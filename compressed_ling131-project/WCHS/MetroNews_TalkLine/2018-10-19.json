the weekend we're going to cut the ribbon on the civic center day I'm very\nExcited about that as is rusty and invited so thank you uh everybody for supporting this show and being part of it and calling and and letting me know when I'm Out there that how much it like it and um [noise] so I can make rusty fan [noise]\nOn five eighty WC a chance to voice of Charleston West Virginia [noise]\nTo a a taxpayer funded abortion I mean that's just ridiculous it this is very sample and we want to make a complex and people want to obscure and all this so that they can win the argument Bob's a obscuring it this is simple this simply says\nThere is a no constitutional right within the constitution embedded within the constitution of West Virginia\nFor the taxpayer funded abortions\nSince ... okay so let's let's let's give some hypothetical sheer what you say that the amendment passes and let's say that your interpretation is correct and that the state is no longer required to pay for abortion\nAnd for poor women where does the weirdest the wall stand in West Virginia than concerning um extreme cases cases of rape or incest or the mother's life\nAs it stands right now those would be funded a the taxpayer would would ah would find those and if and laugh and until and unless the legislature\nMakes a decision on that I'm a different light than current law then you know uh [noise] uh the current law stands and I think is the proper place for it and I I think everyone a outside extremist believe that this is the proper place the legislature\nUh you vote for a candidate that believes aid that taxpayer should fund abortion or be that they should and\nSo ah but the Supreme Court is not going to find in the constitution of a requirement that some a taxpayer in West Virginia funded elective\nAbortion so you're saying that and again this gets a little bit involves so everybody here with me on this that the decision by the state Supreme Court in Nineteen Ninety three which said that the ... the constitution provides for this requires the state to pay for abortions for poor women\nThrough the Medicaid program that that was a decision in response to a state law that was passed that law that limited a Medicaid funding for abortions too when the mother's life was in danger or if the feeders set a severe\nCongenital defect or terminal disease or if the individual as a victim of incest with the individual as a victim of rape when the rape is reported to law enforcement agency so that that was the all that was asked by the legislature that was then notified by the state Supreme Court decision so are you saying\nThat if West Virginia voters approve them in one then then that law was passed and what if it was Ninety two nights we that that is then they'll all\nYes that's exactly what I'm saying uh I mean there's the until and unless we change the legislature or future legislatures change that and it's really the decision of the people of West Virginia as to who to put you know what candidates they want or who do they want representing them\nThat how do they believe on this issue that is the absolute right proper place\nUh to to ... place this decision rather than finding some ah you know contrived uh the\nWording in the constitution of the state of West Virginia that requires a you know I'm Joe out on the street who's working every day to pay for a an abortion adjust if there is taxpayer dollars that's not the proper place and that was never the intention of our constitution\nLet me go to what Margaret workman's said in her opinion in Nineteen Ninety three which provided for state pay for abortions through Medicaid or she wrote for the majority is at three two decision that acting quote for the common benefit protection and security of the people\nThat the state had an obligation to provide medical care for the poor in a neutral manner as to not infringe upon the constitutional rights of our citizens citizens argument was that by not providing funding you're really discriminating against for women who cannot afford an abortion\nYou agree well I Know you disagree but why do you disagree with that concept because you might have for women out there where you do it for women out there who might choose to exercise their right to an abortion and cannot afford it and wouldn't they be discriminated against as compared to somebody else who can't afford it\nWell here's my a problem with that wording of her decision is that that I think it's very properly place it very well sad and it would be great for her to be a legislative candidate whoever wrote that\nThat is the proper place for that language her interpretation that is not what's in the constitution of West Virginia and that is not the proper role for a Supreme Court activists judge\nTo a interpret public policy or to uh to create public policy at this level of the Supreme Court that role is to interpret the law and the constitution\nAnd or if she wants to run a a legislative campaign based on that\nUh you know a scenario that you just describe her wording and so forth well then you know a bit maybe she can get elected to an office\nLike that so ... isn't so so so you're saying this is a public policy decisions so let's say that amendment one passes\nThe state would no longer be required to pay for abortions for poor women but if the legislature decided it wanted to which is unlikely with this legislature but if Democrats took control where there was a change of heart of Republicans they decided they wanted to they could and would\nYes I Am absolutely could I mean it puts the power in the people of West Virginia to decide who will represent them and the legislature who will make the laws as it relates to funding\nA public funding of abortion and uh um so yeah that that could that could occur under the ... you know a under a different legislature under this legislature your eyes\nAnd and that is that something you would support a witch scenario\nWhere would you support or would you support legislatively providing for Medicaid funding for abortion\n[noise] but I I've I've always I mean it's a clear that I've always supported um ah restrictions as it relates to you know I'm pro life is you can base of restrict a public funding of abortion to only those cases that are that are within the law now uh\nYou know the absolutely the rest of the mother's health rape incest those type things um but no I mean to you know at this point in Washington and people should know we spent ah the taxpayer spent three hundred and\nThirty thousand dollars roughly to pay for one thousand five hundred and sixty abortions in West Virginia in the year twenty Seventeen um so that's that's the number that we are talking about the number of lives were talking about and uh so now I I've been very clear I'm extremely a pro life candidate and uh [noise]\nYou know so I ride on that though I run from that perspective I tell my ... near the constituents the people that are voting for me this is my record this is how I stand this is what I Believe\nAnd they vote a for or against me based on that among other issues\nAll right All right we're going we're going to be with the way to leave their image Carmichael Senate president on amendment one supporting him\nBishop Richard coming on today we'll talk to you sent\nOkay or I Want

A. L. K. John in Huntington Hi John ...\n[noise] hey how good the area again I I have one question to ask you did you start out about forty years ago in Morgantown\nI started yeah yeah\nThat's I was listening to you and I was a student and I'm listening to you that\nAre still around and they haven't got came on it and I'm Still here and say oh okay\nWell listen I Want to tell what a to let you know that of course you know the devil is always in the details\nAbout this you know restricting abortion and man that stuff like that and I notice that everybody has always said well except for this for the health care about the health of other health the butler\nAnd want a lot of people don't realize is is that that's the end of the camels tip because apparently a lot of states them agencies and stuff had to find the health of the mother\nTo include the mental health of the month or so in other words it's entirely possible in the abortion industry for these people come in and say look\nYou know it's gonna make me really upset and I'll go crazy if I have this child so therefore I Need an abortion for that reason\nWell let me ... let me ... provide an important insight here I Believe to this discussion and that is\nAnd I'm not positive about this this is what Carmichael said and this is what I think would be the case and follow me here because it takes a moment to explain that if\nIf West Virginia voters would would approve of men one\nThen that wouldn't know by the state Supreme Court decision in Nineteen Ninety three that allowed for oh provided not allow but provided for state funding for abortions which was a decision which struck a which blocked a decision which blocked the um\nImplementation of a state wall that\nPrevented state funding for abortion and that law nine days to dash eleven\nSaid the Follies very short time and redo the key parts it said that no funds from the Medicaid program accounts who used to pay for the performance of abortion by surgical chemical means unless and one of the unless is is this a medical emergency so so complicates a pregnancy as through necessitate an immediate abortion to avert the death\nOf the mother death of the mother so this\nDoes not have that health of the mother caviar it specifically says that one of the exceptions to preventing state funding for abortion what are the exceptions which would allow state funding for abortion is death the risk to death of the mother congenital\nDefects severe congenital defects are terminal disease a victim of incest or victim of rape or rape this report on enforcement so does that help clarify that\nIt does to the extent that it does not specifically include for example C ... the problem is is whenever you get into mental health and saying well I'm so upset about this I may just kill myself\nYeah I understand you know what I'm saying yeah yeah yeah it's\nIt's it's the those in the ... that's the camel's nose that gets into the tent there and that's just the thing I wanted to point to point out that this amendment if anything does not go far I Wish it went further and we'll give you a little scientific thing I'll look up the other day the hurt record\nFor hey youngest pre me because I'm a ... I Am the father pre me the ... world record his if I recall correctly like Twenty one week since ...\nWhen you compare that to what the abortion is are calling you know well it's not a separate human life yet when do you think that currently babysitter Twenty one week's and five days old are able to live outside of the one from\nJohn appreciate the call thank you sir the\nEnough purposely not because I've gotten a lot of text about this and emails and calls\nI've purposely not gotten into a debate about abortion when life begins the morality of it the legality of it I mean I can speak to that but I'm trying to hold this to this specific issue\nBecause I'm not going to change your mind about abortion one way or another nor am I trying to I'm trying to explain what this amendment does the intent of this amendment\nAnd as I've said I Do believe that the wording is confusing and perhaps somebody will even if it passes will try to use that to try to further restrict abortion I'm not sure I'm not sure\nBut it's my belief that the intent\nOf the supporters is and and look every year and the legislature there are bills introduced to restrict abortion or to further limit the opportune to have an abortion ... comes up every year and it comes up every year and every legislature in the country\nAnd they have debates about it and constitutional questions and then it has worked out in the public policy forum\nOkay a but\nIt would be foolhardy for uh is this\nPast many legislature for anyone to say well now you can't have an abortion\nThat would just be inaccurate and it would be foolhardy this is the question you have to ask yourself is that should\nState funding be used to pay for abortions for poor women and you decide you might think yeah I'm pro choice I think it should I think he's got a Fifteen year old girl and she's you know traumatized and she's\nA you know pregnant and she has a she is protected by wall she wants to have an abortion so yeah that's a take care of it they care of it or you might say no this is I don't want my taxpayer dollars for that with the state should not have an obligation that's up to you\nBut I Want to be clear about what this is about and I know the opponent say no this is is is really about other stuff this is about and and I just wish that language has been clear\nFrankly what is not alright\nDecks three or four to three or four ... could the amendment the word it that way because justice workman found abortion to be a ride on the west Virginia's constitution and the argument could be made\nRights are being denied by not publicly funding the procedure just a thought [noise]\nI I don't know I don't know\nAnd let me go back to work means language if I can find it here if somebody paper's going on here today\n[noise] um because\nI Do think the language was I'm not sure she ever use the word right\nGoing it they'll have to find [noise]\nDecks mopping make adoption easier that would solve the problem well we're not okay I understand we're not talking about that that is not\nThat is relevant to the whole issue of abortion but it is not relevant to\nI don't think this particular issue I don't think well maybe maybe it maybe it could be\nMade it in my own I take that back I take that back maybe it could be because if you had a poor woman who\nCannot pay for an abortion or in the states not going to pay for it then perhaps she is more likely to carry determine put up for adoption okay I'm Sorry I see your point there\nI'll be the first part of the amendment sets up just for a trigger trigger language does on to become effective when rose is overturned by the U.S Supreme Court and make it plain that all abortions in West Virginia will be illegal a number of states have adopted similar ... provisions\n\nHappy to say that abortion is a constitutional right is stupid in wrong the same as it would be to kill anyone else because they were on water is moral ethical and rationally wrong\nI'll be able to turn off your show today when Mitch came on\nOh okay [noise] [noise]\nExactly one hobby this is exactly why I Will vote no on a minute one don't tell me the intent\nIs worded exactly the way they intended it to be worded\n\nWell I'll tell you what if it fails if this fails I don't know what's going to pass or fail if it fails it's going to be because of the wording because I didn't think if you let me ask you know I I didn't pull that today if you just ask\nWest Virginia's do you think's the taxpayer dollars to be used to pay for abortions because West Virginia is a pro life state I strongly suspect that a majority of West Virginia which they\nKnow what you throw that wording in there\nWhich some believe is a precursor to eliminate all abortions if roe v wages overturned by the new court\nAnd um you got a problem and if if this fails it's going to be because of the language we back talk line continues after this\nHe wasn't one of our beautiful things are and you can

in a mansions camp ... let me get my tweets up here and uh the ad I think it just started\nThe other day I got two questions are going to get to a wonderful question was mentioned is talkline slash poll ... amendment one\nSays nothing in this constitutions secures it protects a right to abortion or requires the funding for abortion how will you vote on amendment one four hundred twenty four

another question out here about mansion and the ad here just\nMentioned his dog one flash poll Senator Joe Manchin has a new ad featuring West Virginia sports legends Nick Saban Jerry West and Bob

percent says it will help forty five percent says no impact and four percent said will hurt\nThe it's pretty good ad I didn't know and\nYou know Huggins is revered shape and there's an iconic figure West is obviously an iconic figure I'm not sure how much people listen to those things anymore I'm not sure how much endorsements matter but uh certainly it helps more than hertz uh one interesting note about\nThe Huggins part of this because I looked into this yesterday is WVU has limitations on how it's personnel Ken I'm indoors a candidate or a campaign and\nWVU would and and this came up years ago when ... was the basketball coach in someone who is running for Congress Joe reader somebody was weren't for Congress and cat looked came out and endorsed him and it was evident that it was coach cat what that might have been to West Virginia logo at the time was was there I I Can't remember everything but it became an issue\nAnd and if you look at that ad\nYou'll notice that Huggins is not a dense defied as coach Huggins you'll notice these not wearing any gold and blue garbage not wearing any ah WVU swag and he's not I don't think I don't know where he is but it doesn't appear to be in a WVU facility\nSo the mansion people they must have checked with WVU on that\nIn fact I'm sure they checked with WVU on that so that's why in that ad you see kind of a muted Huggins you don't see him I mean normally you have is WVU stuff on and I'm coach organs none of that is there because WVU would not allow that\nOh a quick break away back one hundred seven six five eight to five five
