were taken under consideration\nBy the Supreme Court so he's saying like let's let's take another look at this because really the house should have been a party to that and the the thing and concurring opinion that was issued along side of the main onion\nOr by judges bloom and ... are also\nThis kind of argument bloom and rigorous said that the Supreme Court had no reason to get into a procedural elements here\nBut the house could have taken a second look at those are made its own argument or the Senate as as a quarter of impeachment could have dealt with that stuff so even two of the judges who were part of this uh acting Supreme Court thought that it was questionable but the full Supreme Court\nAh weighed in on these procedures at all and you know I mean if you ... I'm not a lawyer and I don't think you are either\nBut but for the\nSupreme Court to say these should be legislative procedures those potentially seemed to be out of whack with the separation of powers\n[noise] uh yeah I don't even try to play a lawyer on radio Brad [laughter]\nAlthough I have talked to a couple and you mentioned senator weld statements\nAre concerned about the Supreme Court decision affecting the legislatures ability to hold other public officials\nAccountable talked to a couple of attorneys or text it I guess that amounts to talking these days over the weekend and they express some of those same concerns from this ruling or have you gotten the F feeling from other senators how they might feel are going down this road or is everybody kind of a play that close to the best\nI haven't yet I put out a couple of Tex over the weekend um\nAnd mainly the question where do we go from here and and that was still I think unclear even over the weekend\nOr the ... of course initially had talked about appealing to the U.S Supreme Court has not been a topic here to ... ah the judges are eager and uh and bloom in their dissenting opinion suggested that are\nReally the whole thing should go back to the house and just sort of start over again using Supreme Court guidance ah one of the unintended consequences that I think we talked about friday is that the saying these procedures were out of line in the house will\nVote the impeachment of justice justices Davis and law free or under the same procedure so you would think about what ...\nThey're impeachment that their trials can't go forward\nOr you know maybe that's no big deal or maybe it is injustice Davis's case since she has already resigned from the court but in justice law for his case you know between between that time and and now he's been found guilty by a jury of peers on eleven federal crimes so\nI I think\nEverybody here is in a relative unanimous agreement that uh [laughter] but the teacher would be appropriate in his case to to go ahead with the process to remove him from office but the unintended consequences has been but uh you'd probably have to start over to impeach and and now the trial for justice Laufer\nMetro new statewide corresponded Brad ... Brad Will let you get back in the Senate chambers and if something new happens let us know yeah I'll give you a dollar\nFor ship ... corresponded in Charleston\nI'm like you I'm trying to sort through

is in our job it is our mission ... watch out for today he's back tomorrow I'm Dave Wilson sitting in the big chair and joining me now Metra news talk line is the natural in General James Sawyer the morning general\nMorning Dave how are you join well general the rise program we're still continuing to rebuild and regroup after those devastating floods here in West Virginia what's the latest on the rise program where are we\nAs a day where you feel like we're at the point now where are the governor asked us to get to and that we have the appropriate administrative and management controls and functions and people in place\nTo move that program forward a we started out if you remember in uh the fourth of June of this year with four hundred and fifty two cases we've now got four hundred and two cases fifty cases have been closed out\nThat may not seem like a lot some but that's being done while we're also went through the process of redoing a contracts and putting administrative controls in place that needed to be put in place and now all\nThe contracts for mobile home units for a rebuilding and rehabbing homes are all in place and meeting state and federal a compliance requirements and it's\nA matter of getting those processes churning a and the bridge program is moving forward now are both the bridge program and the housing program part of what continues to ah keep up the process of moving is we have\nBut our mental requirements that have to be met a by the federal HUD requirement or a couple of things we've done that I think\nAre unique related to the administrative piece that are going to help us keep capability in the long run as we're using both Marshall University in West Virginia University to help us for example\nAnd uh the environmental work and the the real estate a law work with the w._b. law clinic in uh the folks at Marshall research corporation or helping us with environmental thing so we're also building\nA structure for the state of West Virginia for the future so we don't have these problems again\nTalking to state engine General James who you are when we're talking about four hundred suitcases still out there are what are we talking about are we talking you complete whole reconstruction are we talking rehabilitation a combination of\nYeah we're talking a combination of for example uh the contract for a stick built reconstruction\nA there is a hundred and twenty five of those uh you have a a number of of mobile home units as well as the rehab I think we're we're around a hundred and twenty six\nOr better rehab and a lot of those can continue to go on during the winter months the other thing I think Dave's important to point out is we've a significantly increased the number of people to support us in the case management so now there is a lot more regular communication\nWith these families that were impacted so they're getting regular updates their their understanding where their case is in the process was that communication piece\nWas one of the things that the governor ask us to really make sure that we got to uh to the right point and make sure people understand what is going on and also one other important point I believed to to to bring forward\nThere were twenty six cases we identified as high risk meaning the living conditions\nOf the families that were in those cases or things that we needed to resolve a as quickly as possible uh as of today uh\nWe're down to twenty two and our objective is by Christmas is to have all twenty two of those in some type of a more stable environment uh going forward to through the first of the year and the holidays\nAre we getting back or are the folks down there getting back to a sense of normalcy even after all this time has has passed or is that that's still a work in progress as well\nYeah I Would characterize it is we're not back to a sense of normalcy but we're at a point where people and communities see momentum going forward\nAnd they now see that we're moving forward with plans for not just taking care of individuals but starting to look at community redevelopment\nAnd what these communities or want to look like in the future and and how they're going to diversify and are changing economy and and I think we've got that momentum going\nIt's not going to say natural General James Sawyer in addition to the rise programs uh we have some west new National Guard soldiers who are also helping with the hurricane Michael relief ugly twelve soldiers are taking part is that right\nWe do we have a twelve guardsmen at the national guard bureau operations center in\nDC and they're working to help coordinate the relief efforts from the uh\nAll the national guard organizations across the state that are helping Florida Georgia North Carolina and South Carolina\nAnd Virginia where were needed in addition to that we've got a\nA Twenty one members of the hundred and fifty six the military police or detachment that came home from a nine month deployment to Afghanistan here a couple of days ago we've got Thirteen security policemen from\nThe hundred and thirty a fair to lift a squadron a coming back today and we still have two hundred and fifty members of the guard\nA deploy in Fifteen countries so ah ah it's not just about taking care of the state of West Virginia it's about taking care of a a national security issues and and the guard continues to to keep playing a major role in making those things happen\nSay that when General James Sawyer we appreciate the update and keep up the good work\nAll right thank you
