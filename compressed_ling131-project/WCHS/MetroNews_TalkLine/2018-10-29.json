upon race religion sex age or national origin in fact there\nIs commonality among us but yet why isn't that\nThe dominant force today or is it we're just we're shocked shocked by something like this that makes us not realize the commonality\nI think you've mentioned the the Bible our source for those many of our moral teachings as well as our ideas about live the Hebrew Bible thirty six times talks about love the neighbor love your straight love the stranger in your midst\nAnd why does emphasize that so much and that's because it just so difficult for the human being to not the the other as someone who is different it's just human nature\nUm and the Bible recognize that and the Bible commands us more than love your neighbor as yourself it's easier to love your neighbor your neighbor has a similar how's your neighbor has a fence next yours and you talk to him across but to see someone that is completely different in whether there it has to be where they practice\nAnd where they go to church or synagogue or mosque um what they're thinking\nThat is more of a challenge for a person to do some outreach\nAnd that's where the Bible again and again tells us love the stranger in your mid\n... what do you think and I I Want to be careful about this because I I don't want to add to I don't want to add any fuel to the fire but it's an admirable discussion is the is the tone of the debate the debate contributing\nTo these kinds of events in this country whether it's frankly from the highest office in the land or whether it's from social media or whether it's from our neighbors or talk shows or whether it's from wherever\nIt was the tone partly responsible\nFor a very good question very difficult question to answer and just a few minutes um cigarette huh I'll be as honest as I can um and you probably we've had these discussions before I have not been shy about expressing my disagreements with many of the policies that the administration\nI've also been very vocal in terms of the the tone as you describe it the measured responses above the administration as well as leadership throughout this country I think\nWhat happens in saves us our country constantly is one of two things one is that leaders lead and bring us the great that we need as I said earlier were divided country that's our nature we are such a diverse and that's what gives the strengths this diversity that we have\nBut we always have leadership that is able to find a way to find that commonality\nI'm afraid in our society today we don't have that leadership starting from the top but continuing over and it's not has nothing to do a Democrat Republican I think leadership right now in America is lacking there is not that strong voice the\nThe one that is able to appeal to our better angels and I think as a result of that maybe the solution is not going to be found from top to bottom but Ashley from bottom to top I have seen in in the last forty eight Seventy two hours forty eight hours I think\nUm the the outpouring of love and you mentioned it and when we before we went on air what you said to me personally that's what I saw and that's what we're seeing throughout America not by leaders but by people who love each other people who are loving the stranger\nIf you walk right by our synagogue this at this morning you will see flowers in bouquets messages notes now our synagogue wasn't attacks\nBut these are people in Charleston West Virginia who love people who saw the Jewish people are hurting and are doing what our leaders should be doing and that is toning down their rhetoric reaching out to their neighbors\nThat is where the solution would be found so I Do agree I think the tone is definitely out of whack\nIt is not helpful it it will destroy this country but I think what will save this country are the decent countless decent men and women of this country of all denominations face a political aspirations and political parties who are going to change the conversation because we are better than that\nRub I think that's really all sudden you're talking about the better angels which I think is the Lincoln quote and and I think there's a great point about from the bottom up because the to too many of his there may be a frustration I have a bigger\nA platform than most uh bought some folks usually what what can I Do and what what you can do is exactly what you said is that we can we can try to be better we can try to be better to our neighbor to people that\nWe don't why are we think or whatever I mean we can try to do better if the if you want to do something you can do something and I I point out of commentary today that you know if you want to find\nA way a ... and many of you listening have already found their way through faith or or however you've done it but if you want to find a way and if you want to find a route it's there [laughter] you confided in any faith you confided in you can find it hard it can be found and it's not that hard to find\nNo it yesterday morning or a family came and dropped one bouquet of flowers that's our synagogue and I posted that on Facebook\nI weaponized goodness because what ended up happening was that was shared about a hundred and ten times\nOver six hundred people saw that and now it is going beyond West Virginia again a simple family didn't just read a little note and just call it a Jewish friend that actually took the time to come to the synagogue and placed a bouquet of flowers here\nAnd as a result other people drove by saw that and said you know that's a good idea I'll do that and then suddenly notes came by\nUm we can do that\nAnd that's I guess when we feel helpless and we can't do anything we get frustrated with our leadership on both sides who say terrible things and why aren't they doing something I guess the default is what are we doing what can we do to make this society a better place because this is our country and it represents so many different voices\nLast night we had a private ceremony at our synagogue actually made the temple temple in the synagogue joined today\nOther in just a moment of coming together as a community and members of the Christian faith members of the most unsafe members of no safe came they heard about to ask if they could just join and just listen and those are the type of things that are going to bring people together and that's just that's where we're going to get back to where America is all about\nRabbi victory Iraqi rabbi and spiritual weight has been I Jacob synagogue intros rabbi we appreciate your

your discussion of judge wrecked he told me in a hearing one time that he regretted his famous wrecked decision and decided he had been wrong well that's anecdotal I don't know about that the wreck decision did I thought this about directors and erect decision was um was about\nThe unfairness that existed at the time according to the west Virginia encyclopedia West Virginia education policy was shaped\nThroughout the late twentieth century by a court decision written by judge wrecked in the case challenging the equity of school policy in Nineteen Seventy five Jana Pauli filed a class action lawsuit against the Lincoln county school system alleging the all the children and others attending schools\nIn property poor counties were not receiving educational opportunities equal to students and richer county because schools are funded primarily through the property tax\nShe also alleged the quality of their education did not meet the thorough and efficient standard required by the state constitution always attorney Dan Hedges argued the standard guaranteed all school children in the state and equal opportunity to weigh high quality free public education the case was um\nIn state court uh the case was dismissed from ... recording to build the west Virginia Supreme Court spring court found employees favor\nAnd the case was in fact a circuit court judge Arthur ... presided over the trial there was all this testimony and all may fourteenth Nineteen eighty to judge ... drug direct issued a huge decision detailing the standards established by the expert testimony\nHe ruled that West Virginia school fell short of meeting these standards\nAnd the funding system that existed\nCaused unequal education opportunities from county to county the decision generally referred to as direct decision was controversial critics allege the standards were so high they could never be achieved proponents argued the state's survival depending upon the education of its use\nWhile no school when the west Virginia's ever met all the standards established by the right decision or the master planned the litigation led to sweeping improvements in public education hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on new schools upgraded facilities and improved curriculum\nCircuit court retain jurisdiction in the case to monitor schools progress\nIn January two thousand three judge wreck that ended the decades long period of educational reform by closing the case and relinquishing jurisdiction but it did change put in place changes that exist today on how public education is funded which is why\nEven though that the school a formula now is very complicated not too many people understand it but which is why that uh that state funding which is why what happens is\nThat money is collected through the property taxes in the county and then essentially all that money\nMaybe not directly but routes through frost and then his redistributed to the counties based on a among other things the number of students in that county\nThe per student there is a per student a calculation there\nSo that was intended to equalize a school funding in West Virginia it has been controversial it is complicated and at some point it may be revisited also judge wrecked was responsible for the decision\nWhich are essentially led to the closing of the state penitentiary in Melville a federal prison the challenge was\nThat that uh that were deplorable conditions there and the conditions of confinement were unconstitutional and the amount of too cruel and unusual punishment and the problem of corrections was ordered by the Supreme Court\nTo have a plan and that led to a judge represented in the case\nAnd that led to eventually the are closing the miles of open a century and the building

I mean you think that translates you thought that's a commanding no doubt\nI I Know people I Know people per se you know I Know people personally look at this thing and say you know what\nYou know kind of an insider or whatever and I know Joe and you know whatever you know he's he's been with us or whatever but they look at it and say we have to do whatever is necessary to push Trump's America First agenda and if he comes in and says vote for Moore seat you're going to do it I Know people personally they're\nDoing I'm going to give you a loaded question and it's probably the dumplings you just like a cheap shot at me how much do you think the debate Thursday will matter\n[noise] um I think it will matter hobby I mean I you know I'm you know I mean you've got a pretty effective communications director for democratic candidates for years [laughter]\nUm but I think that you know uh I've seen you do some debate and\nAnd you're going to be I I Know you'll do a good job a these are two guys that know the issues there is a lot of contrast here uh I think people watch I think this race and this was one that you know months ago I you know I had a month ago I was saying I just don't know if it's going to get that close\nBut I think it has and it's it and it is one hundred and ten percent because of Donald Trump I mean one hundred and ten percent because of Donald Trump he's come here time and time again to me like I Need this and no state loves West Virginia no state loves Donald Trump as much as West Virginia\nUm and I think look I think the states just getting more Republican happy I mean it's just\nIt's it's it's been gradual but it's here you know you got the economy turned around people are cited about the Republicans I think it's going to be another good environment\nI mean what I mean even at the state level right like the the you know the Republicans have done you know the Republicans passed this teacher pay raise right or just pay pay raise in state history state employees included all did it without raising taxes um\nYou got to make a you know I have to argue with you like I did Mitch and Mitch comical I mean there's the Republicans the Senate Republicans and to some degree the governor were drag if if if there had not been a teacher strike if there had not been a teacher strike teachers would have gotten a one percent raises your sort of a five percent raise if they're not being teachers trying ... okay\nAre just tax and they do but who gets credit for that it was just out of the Senate Republicans take whatever they are names on it they passed it when they were dragged kicking and screaming into their their arms copy\nIf they would have voted against it\nIt would have been on them but they voted for it so it is on that that's the that's the way it sounds like you're like look like Morgantown with the with the you know ivory towers and all that stuff but out here in the real world that's\nThe way it is it like you and I I was like you and I fighting in the fourth grade and I have your arm behind your back say say uncle say uncle say it say it or ... you\nKnow you're the state or you don't know what the Republican and not only did they do that without raise coffee but\nThe tax revenue down here in Charleston is going up to the workforce today his Democratic candidates the co pay their taxes our feet don't pay your taxes and you feel good once you've got to pay our taxes and and and we're just coming up we're just by just by having competitive elections state revenue\nGoes up All right we'll take your attack Greg Thomas's with his ... Republican still in the west Virginia okay take your free shot West Virginia citizens against lawsuit abuse\nReleased their economic impact study on the assessment of excessive toward cost in West Virginia potential benefits of economic reform so I'll give me are made up numbers here or what you're talking about those\nEither look as you know we had the worst legal system in the country that the the new Republican leadership is come in and done a ton\nDone a ton of legal reforms that are helped moving out in the right direction but with the court crisis that we've had this year and ... and they're still just a lot of laws that need six were still the only state in the country that doesn't have an automatic right of appeal we still have the worst medical monitoring while in the country we don't have seat noted best ability there is a lot of things that we don't have\nAnd I think that's why as I said that there have you use these situations where you still have the trial lawyers are funding campaigns running for office doing all this stuff\nBecause you know that there was a lot at stake and the you know you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of of of cost that should not be there it costs you know that this our report that we put out\nThat it costs almost four thousand jobs are due to all but the the side effects of having a ... an unfair court system well then that and that's why we're glad that you see so much attention on these race\nWell due to this is a bigger and it drives a lot of\nThe trial attorneys are putting money ... money too because they want to ensure that every West Virginia has an opportunity to have their day in court now now now are they\n... you know the only you know the only group of people not benefiting at a Trump army right now in West Virginia ... in the Trump army it's personal injury lawyers they're the only ones that have taken this on the chin at all and that's why they're doubling\nDown one of these days are doubling down one of these one of these days something's gonna happen to you you're going to slip and fall outside the hospital and you're gonna you're gonna say I need a lawyer I was wrong and listen to it and\nIt will be will still be able to have that hobby we ... we we don't have to be we don't have to be first but we're almost still we're still almost laughed but we're not allowed to work but we're like forty ... you know we're still in the bottom we got to fix it and and I'll tell you what the real good acting elect elect in this um\nThe ... circuit judge\nI mean I work with real quick I got a twenty seconds are Republicans going to make more tort reform a priority and the next session of the legislature\nReal quick yeah okay yeah\nAll right we'll leave it there great Thomas Republicans on the west Virginia Greg always go to a bar with your previous coming on thanks ... have you ever wondered just too\nFar the friends of coal well there are fifty thousand West Virginia families who support the state's coal industry and they look a lot like you honest hardworking good neighbors who won a future for themselves and their state\nTheir coal miners housewives schoolteachers mechanics doctors college professors pizza delivery guys your friends of friends of gold know and understand the importance on the coal industry to our state's economy\nThey know about the sixty thousand jobs the coal industry creates in our state they know about the twenty five billion dollars the industry bumps into our economy [noise] and they know that without coal our state would face an economic catastrophe\nCome to think of it that sounds like most West Virginians let Congress no you are a proud west Virginian and you are a friend of ...\nUh\nUh\n... what do you want him to justice Robert J Frank candidate for West Virginia Supreme Court will bring much needed honesty integrity Claire\nFifty three hundred jobs result from aviation and the state from the metro news anchor desk I'm Chris aren't [noise]\nFind on metro news [noise]\nChrist will ... circuit judge in the eastern panhandle for twenty five years at\nCircuit their services Jefferson Berkeley and Morgan counties and he is one of the candidates running for West Virginia Supreme Court he's running in that ah that first group which is for the ... to your term he joins us on veterans chocolate judge can morning how are you sir\nI'm quite happy good morning here\nAre good to have you on okay so ... again ... voters have to sort through all this just take a moment who are you are you running\nWell I'm Chris Wilkes or from over here and you're old stopping and I've been a circuit judge actually going on twenty six years now I'm running because of what I uh we've all seen as the hubris and and the dysfunction\nOf what's going on in Charleston uh I think it's so sad that are all judicial officer in West Virginia or be painted with that same brush\nAnd I think that my experience and integrity is approved by being elected so many times here will go a long way to restoring faith in the judiciary in West Virginia\nJudge I'll ask you what I've asked everybody else has been on the show who's running for the court is that everyone says he or she says they will help reach restore integrity in respect to the court but what do you use what what would separate you from what everybody else could do\nWell I think the fact that I Know what it's like to be a judge you buckle down and get to work deciding cases it's not an office that you should let political or personal ideology influence what you do\nAnd I haven't got over a quarter century of experience doing it and being returned by the voters appear in the larger circuit now in the state I think it shows that I've been able to do that\nThe judge use I saw an interview with you where you said\nI've had to believe for a long time the Supreme Court should be geographically diverse geographically diverse as you said you're from the eastern panhandle why does that matter I mean what's the matter whether a judge's from table to county or Timbuktu I mean if a judge if a good judge is a good judge what why is the geography matter\nIf you have to be able to discuss\nThe views of all West Virginians when you're in curbing the laws passed our legislature yeah the federal circuit to require geographic diversity most States Supreme courts require geographic diversity in one way or the other\nWe now have a canal centered view as to what goes on in West Virginia our constitution demands geographic diversity in the law makers I think it's very important that the law and ... should have that same diversity plus I think it goes a long way to restore faith in the history went all West Virginians\nBills if they've got a voice in their court\nThe Christmas is with us She's a one of the candidates West Virginia Supreme Court in that first\nGrouping that is for they own expired two year tour of course this is a non partisan election so I won't ask you if you're a Democrat or Republican laughable ask you this can you say anything about your philosophy or political or judicial philosophy that were just enlighten people is to\nUm your political views or how you view the world\nI can tell you my personal views but they don't enter into your judicial decisions I Can't give you a little bit on my philosophy and that's a I'm a strict construction work\nIf the legislature passes a law\nThat it's not offensive to the constitution I Believe that's the beauty of the Supreme Court to uphold that law whether we agree or disagree with it and for over twenty five years I've been doing that there are times that I don't necessarily agree with a law that I have to enforce as a circuit judge\nBut my job is to do it if I wanted to be a policymaker then I'd be involved and another branch of government and that's what's so sad and what we're seeing today yeah we're now seeing a major influx of outside money entering enter into our Supreme Court race\nAnd it talks about conservative justices or we'll talk about liberal justices\nJustice is you'd be neither conservative nor liberal it's not the place for the policy you can be determined by the state it's a place to determine whether the laws are offensive to the constitution or not or if the action of the circuit judge has been taken properly\nIt's if you're happy with a range master who's never fired\nWeapon or a lifeguard that's never been swimming and looked at people who haven't been judges before but most of the work screen porch reviewing what the lower court fit and what what you'll find is you're getting people up there because of political reasons they're inexperience\nIn what their actual work requires them to review\nWe're talking to Chris will because he's a circuit judge in eastern panhandle and he's running for their own expire to determine the court one of ten people and there's ten I'll just running for the six year term a judge as we are talking there are people remembering judge Arthur ... who passed away over the weekend at age eighty who issued two seminal decisions in West Virginia one concerning school\nFunding another concerning the mountains ville prison so are there ever as you say you're a strict strict constitutional is but other times when a judge in your opinion\nShould write a wrong someone does something that he or she perceived as they're wrong that must be right and even if it pushes the boundaries of being a strict constitutional is\nNow and I've had the experience copy of a ruling away and then watching the ... changed next year because of the way I have had to rule\nI I think a judge has to roll or if it's within ... constitutional bounds they have to apply that law\nAnd if not we have a super legislature and and businesses and people and at society relies upon their court system to be predictable and two sisters\nAnd if we sadly are going to have the personal whim of a judge determine\nHow case will be decided well then we break down and and I heard earlier talking about what were you know back to the judicial hell whole aspect of it one reason for that is because we have not had consistency and predictability our decisions\nMy business court work has gone a long way to help West Virginia's a specially in business a society because we've had some consistency in good decisions made a in the business ...\nDo you think do you think we were do you think West Virginia was and we're still is a quote unquote judicial hell hole even though that's a\nThat's a you know for ... view pejorative statement productive um\nTerm no and happy I I'd I'd welcome you to do what I challenged uh the now being of of the ... law school Henry Butler when he was up in March or if you have to be your friend\nAnd he talked about the judicial hell hole and I said\nWell Henry let go down to Paterson's drugstore right now and you ask the feet foot founder whether they think Chris Wilkes has created judicial helpful you go to the communities in West Virginia and ask whether they think their jackets upgraded judicial hell I think you'll find West Virginians are pretty satisfied\nWith that level of justice they're receiving at the trial court level\nJudge where do you support or oppose amendment to that would give the legislature\nPurview of the U.S Supreme Court's budget\nI say this you know it I I Can't come out and tell you which way I Am in case there's ever a challenge I wouldn't want to have to recuse myself\nBut I'll say this every dollar spent by any branch of government if the tax payers dollar so it doesn't matter to me whether the legislature review has an overview of it or whether the court had unbridled overview of their budget\nYou can't lose track the fact that the taxpayer dollar that you're spending and I'll never lose track I've worked with county missions forever twenty five years to make sure we have the facilities in my circuit not do the same thing you Charles\nA judge Chris will from the eastern panhandle candidate for that to your annexed by a term on the court or Chris good to speak with you
