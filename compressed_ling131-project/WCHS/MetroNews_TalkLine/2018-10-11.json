{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "It's it's as you call inside baseball sometimes but we we divided the articles into our into individual votes\nAnd they were never a rate combined Scott ... they they took that all they took the measure apart and never put it back together before it showed up on the house and it was all mysteriously put back together if if you're thinking of something like a physical object it was back in one piece when it came to the house\nWas the problem from committee to\nA house floor and then at the end of the process on the house floor it was all separate articles again and instead of passing a real resolution with resolution of the only vehicle the Senate and house have communicate it it was articles so they they made a motion just that they were\nA hand deliver some articles across\nThe ... will use a lot of money I and I remember when we didn't we read but I remember the vote it was seven is Eighteen to seven and then we had a vote Flint juicy Flint is he went to eight minute went de de as Seventeen to eight\nBut um we went down on the floor and we carried what we voted out of ... out of the house Judiciary Committee down to the floor just as it was we did everything pretty precisely in and just you know I'm not criticizing me buddy Andrew I just don't understand it I guess\nI yeah I think we were we were preached to through the whole process to make sure the fees were crawl out without it and when it got down to the I think a a small mistake was made him instead of\nA coughing that mistake I just kinda went ahead for 'em to the extent that the majority party was in a in a little bit of a argument we had a recess for about forty five minutes for them to go back to the speakers quarters to a workout their disagreement on a one on one side of the the leadership thought that they should pass one\nIt was ... and that was going to say only it and the others disagree so\nI could you remember ah when you're on your on Judiciary Committee did their caucus during the uh well a meeting was going on\nUh the the Republican for the recall yeah they actually we had a executive session and the night before the all the articles were kind of drop them our laps or the uh chairman made an announcement that we have a quick sessions Tuesday Morning\nAnd that Republicans would caucus after that executive session\nOr where we went over some personal\nEr here here's what happened the Democrats couldn't get together when I was up there on a on a bill so they made all the ... there's five of us so they made us leave the room and uh they said we're going to ... so you guys get out [laughter] we so we like to point\nOut that ah when we're doing it too well in an argument on a bill that they will uh will quickly recess and ... make sure they either by law\n[laughter] yeah All right Andrew thanks for calling show that's activated already three or four three or four or five fifty eight fifty\nSo let me tell you this homeless illusion yeah just one thing that homeless creative solution All right this is a ... phones\nAnd the plug them all and outlets that are outside that don't belong to them right so\nWhen you're doing that there's a law against\nStealing electricity yeah electricity utilities stuff like that so to enforce the law there to confiscate the evidence\nThough so they confiscate or say leave town\nI don't know I I mean not not Dave uh this particular area and I can see where it is because it's we're too big to do something like a because we'd be challenge but it's worked for them and they've got their own was\nPopulation and a half but this is not going to have a good ending um to have all these folks that um donated units ship and don't care about\nWhat's going on for ed\nHow Danny has the car a state I just wanted to know if if you are Danny as read a book fear\nI haven't read it you know there's a good book\nIt it it it's a great book and and it will it gives a a great tradition or explanation of why you know we've got to the mess in the White House that we that we asked because almost everything he did ... did there\nAre you an eight to ... they allowed him to tape it the people you know all the White House aides and all the big guys up there and let him take what they said you know so it it it really quickly and easily and very very much in depth you know this is a Pulitzer Prize winning when\nWe all knew who Bob Woodward is a ... but he didn't he didn't mention\nWho these people were now but he has them on tape for backup we're dealing here we get to you guys yes\nYeah yeah in the uh uh there's a place in the book\nHe he does he he does talk about uh you know who it is he's talking to yeah he does\nYou didn't assigned some yeah yeah he ... you know it's on\nIt's on my stock I'm reading chase and scream right now but uh uh which I highly recommend but I'm going to read it I just it's OK books away\nOkay I I thought that that would that would help a lot and and understanding and some of the stuff just just just knock you over about the lack of knowledge you know of of our of our president you know what he doesn't know I think would fill ten warehouses and\nPeople are drawn to explain all kinds of different things\nTo him and he won't listen the cheapest seats I don't care about that\nI can imagine I I guess that impression All right thanks thanks a lot for it I I'm Still get over I Can't get a record sounded like the guy I mean I think Madison is great I think Tillerson was great so Tillerson's over in Africa sitting down in the bathroom at two o'clock in the money now\nAnd get fired there is a guy if anybody who's qualified for that job he was a globe charter for Exxon knew everybody knew him off and he didn't want the job now he got drawn to jump in the last two presidents to use them for consultation or I don't\nLike the guy and I will tell you that Woodward on those appearances he looks scared to death severe it was the right title [laughter]\nAll right [laughter] All right Steve thank you and maybe we'll have you back tomorrow we'll we'll see what happens All right stay with us or the jury is

ABC News the White House\nRecovering and not just about thirty five points after opening down well over a hundred the seesaw coming a day after that big sell off that sound that saw the Dow dropped over eight hundred and thirty one points its worst day since February prosecutors in New York and just drop part of the sexual assault case against moviemaker Harvey Weinstein wind seen it in the courtroom\nThings that I was doing that were in the realm of quote related business so does the jury by that or does it not [laughter] you know if he ... the standard for for the peace run in and\nAnd we're moving him from office is one thing but sending him to prison over a you know repeated incidences of driving the car to stay the night with his mom and dad a of of selling is of of selling his book at the greenbrier of\nTaking home or at a desk does that really amounts prison time uh that would weigh heavily on my mind if I were at your I I Will say you know as I think about\nAt the sentencing comes down to judge coping ... the jury to staff suicide guilty or not guilty\nBut oftentimes I mean the judge has some discretion but there are sentencing guidelines that he would have to go buy if he's convicted never remember\nA couple of these charges are are similar to what former justice minister catch them pleaded guilty to plead guilty to and that had to do with his use of a state vehicle for profit purposes when he took it a golf outings and use the gas card so there's a similarity there\nWere charges he actually plead guilty to\nAnd sentencing is scheduled for a December on that what were the key points in the closing arguments yesterday\nOr the the the prosecution again said that a justice law free\nTook office ... intending to be should have been a public servant but went far beyond that and attempted to become the master of the system uh but that he had a sense of entitlement that just ran amok\nUh and and all of these instances are are evidence of justice law free lying bullying taking advantage of the system\nPaddling to to federal investigators are hoping to cast a questions on other Supreme Court employees other justices\nAnd then justice lotteries defense saying well this hasn't really added up to what you say a saying remember jury it isn't more likely it is it maybe\nThis was beyond a reasonable doubt uh and and saying the evidence in this case is not sufficient to reach beyond a reasonable doubt or you know I Will say that\nWe we've gone for more than a week here and in addition to some of this a hard data evidence both the cell phone records the purchasing card records there's been a range of witnesses seven eight nine ten who\nTestified to one thing and justice law furry wound up\nEssentially saying that either they just remembered or they're flat outlying and he particularly stuff that about this fellow justice Britain Benjamin so in the jury's mind you're gonna have to be thinking or you know do I believe the seven eight nine people or do I believe the justice who spent seven hours on the bench telling me his side of it\nWas the last three a compelling witness\nHe did very well when he was\nConfronted with the question of his own lawyer or you know a lot of explanations that you've heard from the beginning with law free saying look I I didn't think that this desk\nHad any particular historic value where's the proof that have had historic value and with law furry saying you can see that I was going over and over to Tucker county I I don't dispute that uh and and the things that I was going for related to the court\nAnd moreover I was he said I was saving the state money or staying with my parents are both the book signings with the greenbrier it was a way to to reach out to the public and talk to people or he did less well when talking to\nA the prosecution a\nCasting doubt on on almost everything he was saying you know justice bedroom itself is how can you say the opposite Kim Ellis says this how can you say the opposite a much more aggressive questioning sure and law free was less convincing in those cases\nSo the jury and began deliberations late yesterday they deliberating for how long and they are back at it this morning\n[laughter] yeah so they went in about three thirty yesterday or the judge judge coping have or has been pretty sensitive to\nThe geographic distribution of where these jurors live so about five o'clock you send them a note and said do you want to keep going or do you want to ah come back tomorrow they said let's come back tomorrow so that gets us to this point\nAnd they have been in since nine thirty are and who knows what they may do I mean if they think it's a slam dunk\nThey could just fill out forms and say yes or he's guilty on all these or if they want to really think that over that really they're supposed to think\nThrough each and every one of these twenty two counts and if they're going to go through the records on all of these uh travel records it could still take a while\nYeah that is that is a huge list bread I mean if they're going to do what they are charged with doing\nAnd there's human beings they might get weary\nThey got to go through each county talking about what twenty two counts you'd have to go through each one and get agreement of twelve jurors or if somebody is you know a is a you know it's like you have you know eleven guilt again one not guilty or um so they're going to go through each one of those counts that could take days\nYeah and I mean it was a mountain of evidence that it was a week of testimony some of it a more detailed than you might think at first and\nThe nature of it was was not necessarily that\nThe witnesses said All right we're going to go through\nCount Thirteen and we're going to tell you exactly what constitutes Thirteen it was witnessed by witness talking about the broad picture here and now it's got to be related to these individual accounts are which may take some some re tracing by these jurors as they've been through it\nYou know whereas you say they may just look at it into toe and say well\nHe really there was a logical explanation for these things and forget about it or no he did all these things are really sort of tied together so they could approach it that way too and\nAh there's always in the speculation about what a jury may or may not do a by the way regardless of what happens he still faces in the impeachment trial when the Senate so that is pending let's say he was cleared of all charges he's under suspension now he could still be\nA removed from the court through impeachment trial correct\nYeah that's absolutely correct and and nothing has been dropped against him in the Senate at this point so uh that comes up he's the last Senate trial to go and that would be end of November I think\nSo that's that's still hanging over his head you'd think that might be a moot point if he is found guilty or you know the the question I guess\nStill be a his his pension but I Would I Would think that this petition will be sacrificed if he's found guilty of any of these uh Cal cheered federal or\nRead back when he mentioned his day

I don't think you can sustain that kind of group we may have very will pay ... obviously with our co exports and things like that and in our taxes and thing ... you know just going down the line\nPlus half of that school and a half to go into rainy day fund so you've got that hundred and twenty million and half you got a you know half of it is going to go to a rainy day uh he says that ah obviously had what fifty eight million dollars\nThat Jerry ... who was going to be there to carry over\nYou know that that's aspect to uh obviously which Medicaid wanted to do the better the economy grows\nA reimbursement is going to be less\nSo you're going to have put up more of the money for Medicaid you know she looked at that aspect of healthcare a southern some things in our state you know just just are not good\nOur obesity levels are cancer levels and things like that health care overall is one of the things you've got to be concerned about the factor that in you know there are a lot a lot of issues that you have to look at when you prepare budget\nMy coming out and saying hey we're going to do this yeah of course anybody is is everybody's gonna support that pay raise for teachers and uh but you're going to put a hundred and a million dollars in P. I. A. they've already got a surplus then he's saying it's going to be sustained over what\nTwo years right to do it over two years well you know that subject to change\nHere's here's one of the challenges you and you see that for him you use been salmon a finance committee's you know the numbers pretty well is that the governor is and and we are the economy is growing there is additional money but [noise] but so far this is a survey was that is more money is coming in there was expected\nAnd then there's a carry over but what you don't know and I think you've alluded to that is that you don't know if next year that's gonna be there even though you're you're bringing these costs to the base of the budget the Costa ... if you do raise teachers' salaries by ... percent\nOr ... percent which is going to cost about a hundred and twenty million dollars every year and then put you put a hundred dollars and ... for two years so the teacher raised that's going to be there every year but you don't know if that strip last is going to be there every year that's the point I'm trying to make and along\nWith home that's correct homeless looking at one at one time money and yeah we were always reluctant to use one time money where there'd be rainy day or whatever to sustain growth in in and you just can't do that and and and there's a building factor in school a formula for teachers that you know every year they get that a yearly stipend\nFive hundred dollars you know it's it's All right it's going to\nContinue to grow and grow and grow and you're you've got to find some funding sources that that's the bottom line\n... but also but the governor said he he wants to make education a priority and there is a lot of agreement among legislators Democrats included the teachers aren't paid enough so you can get it that way too is like well the governor's doing the right thing you trying to get the trying to get the salaries are\nHonest right thing to say there's no question about it is politically correct\n... politically correct so you think do you think the governor's sincere or do you think that he just through that out there for weeks before the election because he thinks it's some Republican senators might be in trouble over what happened with the strike\nI think you're ... you're spot on he probably he probably a sincere about education I mean you've got to sustain a good educational system you got to you know you've got to have a good workforce to to move forward and and he's probably in a spot on on that but the timing was shot back there wasn't any question about it\nNow just to form opposite of Roman ... is with us minority leader Democrat marine county so if this is the proposal that will come up in January ... where are you a will you support it and be where you try to rally your caucus to support it\nOh I don't think I have to hard job rally in my cocker trying to think that they definitely support any you know a five percent pay increase or teachers\nAll right so the Roman ... do Democrats from America to minority leader in the room and good to talk to you appreciate it thank you All right we'll be right back\nIt was really a company looking for new feelings around you know a I T architectural interior product\nDealings in one play a huge role in the audience and you're building investing in premium quality products will avoid installation and maintenance fishing and he has a white collection of feeling in ... which regions noise and maximize acoustic performance he can look at what they have to offer an A.

what this could mean for you from around\nOr oppose the rock hall point\nI don't think that rock author writes that for Jefferson County and I've been very public with that because I Believe that we need to be honest and transparent with our constituents\nI held town halls in all Seventeen counties across the second district and when I was in rural town in Jefferson County on August twenty first I shared that I'm publicly with people in person in the district in Jefferson County I talk to people on both sides of the aisle\nOr of that this conversation I've talked to the ... and and I talked to people who work on this project\nAnd at the end of the day I just don't think it's the right fit for Jefferson County\nSo you oppose the rock will point is there something that ... ... if you were elected or something that a member of Congress should do to try to if you were elected to stop rock wall or is this really a local state issue\nIt really is a local and state issue I think that\nWhat we need jobs in West Virginia but we need to make sure that we have good neighbors\nAnd um people that are willing to a lift up our communities are and we need to just make sure that our federal um represented represented as are actually partners in that and we haven't seen anything from Alex newly across the board in the second district to do that\nThough you talked about the necessity of working across the olive tried to return some sort of bipartisanship what is your opinion of President Trump\nI work with President Trump if he's going doing right by West Virginia but I'll stand up to him that he's not doing right by West Virginia it's as simple as that\nYou think he's doing right by West Virginia now\nI don't think that on some issues perhaps and then I think on issues like health care I think that we have real differences I Believe that ... people with preexisting conditions should have healthcare nearly eight hundred thousand West Virginia and have a preexisting condition and that includes\nThree hundred and forty thousand women Ninety One thousand children and five thousand veterans and you know I don't think that we should be taking healthcare away from people West Virginians Americans for that now that with the pre existing conditions I think that\nI Would agree with President Trump on some issues like a trade you know my family had a small business here in West Virginia and without their trade it is really hard for the small businesses\nAnd these companies to be able to compete in the global marketplace and so we need to make sure that we have fair trade as you ... you may recall my family started my great grandfather started with it and art last company in Nineteen Assad down and what\nCan you do or do speaking of health care and women's uh what is your position on abortion and please explain\nWell I'm Glad that you asked about this hobby because there is a deceitful ad out there right now by my opponent or Alex movie you're just showing his absolute desperation uh this added disgusting and it is shameful\nUm and to be quite honest it's hurtful but I Will take blood from a politician I think it was just showed\nA how um\nWhat's wrong with our money just another typical Washington politicians um but for me as a woman I Do believe that women should make their own healthcare decisions for me that's with a in accordance with my advice from my doctor and in with my sense\nUm and as a woman who values family and what a thick skin a thirty five cousins on one side of my family there's nothing more I Would want then uh the joy of having a baby and so for him to go on air and and broadcasting outright lies it's shameful um he has done things\nLike take away health care for women with Disney prenatal care\nUm he's voted ever fifty times to do that a hobby and I think that that's just wrong and so he has a hypocrite and he wanted the people of West Virginia and we're just going to call a spade a spade on that\nBugs me leaking of his greatest age do you support roe versus Wade you support a woman's currently a woman's right to have an abortion\nI support a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions and she can make the decision not to have an abortion\nJew or just or just as just a quarter of a you know are just as you have an abortion or just orders or act or does this mean more and you\nAnd you well know hockey that West Virginia has laws on the books that we have to abide by suffer Alex Mooney to use this divisive rhetoric to continue to divide people and then to hide away from the fact that he has voted over fifty times to take away prenatal care for women\nAh take away their health care in that sense and then he turns around and takes a quarter of a million dollars from the healthcare industry he's for big pharma and the health care industry and on for the people\nThe jelly storage and his with his Democratic ... Jennifer Congress and the second congressional district jelly that second districts\nThat is a heavily Republican district I mean there are juries pockets of Democrats will music of job as a boost Berkeley Calif fastest growing county in the states are witches republic ... think of a you know which is a more Democrats Brazil has been a red county you think of ...\nUh I'm In the first or second I think it's a machine that\nFirst the first okay al ... which is a ... all these counties in West Virginia when for for all those counties but for some so how do you overcome that the new campaign to knock off Alex Mooney\n[noise] well I think that um look we're very focused on running all Seventeen counties that shared I found that the town halls and all of the counties in the month of August we're continuing to get out there\nThey can't difference between me and Alex ... I'm actually listening to people and I sort of say that the people of West Virginia I felt like Donald Trump listen to them in twenty six teams\nI'm listening to people and taking their advice\nI uh whether solicited are on full if it doesn't matter I'm and I'm listening to them on the issues that matter most to them health care they're so concerned about whether or not because of the a lot of West Virginia factory existing conditions whether or not they're going to be able to go see their doctor without going bankrupt\nThey're worried about this drug epidemic because it's touching all of our communities\nAnd I'll take money from foreign or chemical company and then turn a blind eye and they don't feel in our state I think that's wrong and so there's a lot of differences between us and to me this is all about serving the people of the state I don't care what political party he may aligned with I Want to do right by the people\nThat may violate argue you're talking about differences between you and many of you and money's scheduled any debates are you having any had their heads\nWell hobby I'm Glad you asked that I call Alex ... every morning at eight am and I attended a certified letter on September ... six\nSo I have either an extra money for it to get their back on every morning gave him a morning wake up call he refuses to answer the call to debate\nI Would ask that you put pressure on him and he lasted today ah you know in a in a in a fair way that let the people in West Virginia decide on who they want to have in Congress\nOr by Indian everybody everybody asked me to I I'm flattered and I I keep going to ask that I I think I've already committed to one in the first but I mean I I ...

West Virginia poll had mansion up by eight and I was taken back in August and\nAh the mansion poll by the mansion people Jeff pollock I had mentioned up wells\nAre there have been some other polls has the has the race closer like about six points now there is a poll out by public opinion strategies a Republican pollster and justice just how it works for Joe mansion\nA public opinion strategies is a Republican pollster gene home is a pollster and he joined us on veterans talk on because they have numbers out gene good morning how are you\nWith morning a thank you for having me on your show\nThanks for coming on so you have a poll public public opinion strategies has a poll what is your poll say about this race\nWe showed the race or as one of the ... century Joe mansions now forty one\nPatrick Morrisey that forty and this is a seismic shift a post Kavanaugh here ah you know a significant shift where we now show or just you can't get a closer race than we have here in West Virginia\nWhat happened if it happened you say you took it after cabin also what happened there in your opinion\nBut what happened is we look at a or those who have a ... couple of dynamics won the president's job approval and parties and voting behavior uh behalf of conservative Republicans as a gone up significantly\nA president's job approval already one you know are incredibly strong West Virginia when even higher um and then at the same time we have um a mansions negatives those those voters that we interview\nOr that have a negative view of a of West Virginia senator declined significantly\nUm most of it having to do with a not so much a who he voted for but how he bowed and uh it just taps into voters anxieties that you know Joe Manchin is\nYou know changes his views depending on who he's talking to\nTalking to genome pollster with public opinion strategies a Republican pollster who has this race between mansion Morsi\nOr his poll has it as a dead heat you know gene the ... and I've gotten a lot of feedback to that people questioning how mansion did this you wait until the last minute and he saw how the vote was going to go goes the goes the theory and then he voted for uh for capital but uh you're in the business do people follow it that\nIt it it why isn't that a group or isn't that a group that is already against a mansion in Fort Marcy\nIt'll do people who are trying to make up their minds are are they really looking at it that closely or they just oh OK supporter Kevin all\nI'm importantly these hearings are among were among the most watched in history that where usually they used for something that may be a seat fan gigs watch America watch these here this isn't a wet just to West Virginia thing\nPhenomenon this is an everywhere phenomenon in fact a lot of the movement that that we see in West Virginia we've seen across the country\nI thought that was supposed to be a a blue wave\n'em well in the the issue is is when you have large chunks of rural voters large chunks of ideologically conservative voters\nUm it's these this is polarize the electorate in West Virginia that means in our favor um you know in other areas that have large suburbs you know maybe suburban Philadelphia\nSuburban Los Angeles I'm you know ... we ... we haven't seen in the movement in but in places for me this is and this is this is a the president's second best a state in the nation only Wyoming\nThere's ... ... what do you have any research gene and gene is with us closer with public opinion strategies Republican pollster they have this thing is a virtual dead heat between manager Morsi\nUh do you have any research that suggests the that the support of Trump translates directly to a vote for Morsi because Trump is popular but yeah people people tickets split all the time anymore\nAnd how do you know that it's that it's a one for one if it is a one for one or close to one for\nLetting 'em well that the data shows that uh that Morsi is getting you know more than sixty percent of that Trump vote and a mansion is only getting about twenty percent so it isn't one for one yet\nUm but when you look at the undecided voters that means the voters between\nAh any one of these candidates and a plurality I don't think either one of them as a shot at getting fifty percent plus one but when you look at a ... the voters between uh where they are now in a plurality\nThey those undecided voters overwhelmingly approved the president are overwhelmingly identify themselves as a conservative\nAre overwhelmingly or so for a you know Second Amendment\nRights overwhelmingly are pro life you know so there's you know they might not be Republicans but in West hey every state's different whether that's West Virginia\nYou know you your poll has you got massive forty one Morsi of forty you have a rest of your home and who is the libertarian from car experts you got him at eight percent ... percent undecided\n... eight percent seems high for me for ... and the libertarian are usually yeah and you know the libertarian usually I mean I'm not being I'm not being ... slip into your but usually you know it's in the three four percent range um that seems high that's all\nThey um third party candidate will over poll\nOr early on and then they go down towards election day um yeah that's that's correct but when you look at 'em you know undecided voters\nYou know please help me I mean how many times as Joe mansion been on the ballot um if they're not voting for him now what could Joe Manchin say or do between now and election day to reverse they're the same voters while they approve of the president these undecided voters they overwhelmingly disapprove of senator mansion as well\nAdjusted and you're so you're suggesting a brick toward more see what the undecided correct\nWhich isn't unusual I mean we've seen that in public and private polling in West Virginia you know over the last couple of cycles where the Republican or under polls for a variety of race\nA genome is with us closer with public opinion strategies Republican pollster so gene your numbers that we talked about this this morning when you and I teach at a A R poll was different obviously mansions poll was different some other national polls have been different so yours is yours is the only one that I've seen that has this as a dead heat\nSo why should we believe ... one of the we don't have to believe anybody's numbers by the way but why should you don't you know nobody believes bulls anymore but why should we believe your numbers and not our numbers are mansions numbers or somebody else's numbers\nWell keep in mind these numbers weren't done to publish their published only as a as a a a byproduct as we thought they were interesting um ... nobody uh nobody pays us to a team put numbers out there um the ...\nThe other thing is is I think that uh there are significant differences and what we do compared to what a particularly a lot of the the publish numbers that we see in West Virginia which I think it's actually under served him and many of the\nThe major college polling outfit that are fairly route reputable um you know West Virginia doesn't see a lot of that I think that\nUm you know we have a methodology discussions probably make boring radio but let's face it safe to say that we have\nA a lot more access to what are the electorate is going to look like um we have a lot more access to trend data I think a lot of the uh public polls had our our sort of still reflecting the um the west Virginia from two thousand\nEight you know where Democrats had a Fifteen pointing advantage that advantage doesn't exist anymore you know two thousand sixteen Democrats only have a seven point advantage by registration not a single one of these surveys that have been published has shown that that small of a vote Democrat it advantage\nUm and in fact the last one published didn't even ask partisanship they left out the number one predictor of how people are gonna vote they didn't have included on the\nSurface but did you are you are you are you basing a lot of what you all have come up with on people who voted in\nTwenty sixteen and is that hey is that is that so and be is is that is that fair to do because\nYou don't know if those same people I mean there's a lot of passion and twenty sixteen in West Virginia does that same passion exist today\nWell um when you look at um the when you when you scale out each party's how likely their voters\nAre to vote ... over the last going back to two thousand six even you know before the Obama years um the ... the data was actually fairly consistent", "show_name": "MetroNews TalkLine", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day":
