I I\nCan't imagine how much our then people thinking that ah with this is just a political News I'm kinda only from place to live when I started on on October the fair in ... and then there was a tour of the fact that you get an education should be an economic our economic driver ...\nAnd then the first day I took all those out there you know how much it would bring more people here and and it would just fail is bad in West Virginia has\nAnd then the first state and say that they wanted to push it probably raise for teachers and you're out on that created the I honestly I'm the one that came up with the five percent on the on the pay raise to the teachers are not the unions I'm the one that came up with that\nI'm the one that does that put the state board of education and and the appointments have got rid of a three and a half from this crazy testing for settled back in the local and the local rules in the founders batter and all that situation is just here\nWe have yeah you know because every single thing I tell you it's fact\nGood conservative Democrats that are out there hinders turns on a bank got to listen to me today because they got to step back and say hold on your let's just be fair\nThe Republicans deserve a tremendous amount of credit for what has happened to your now they do poverty that just plain do\nOur state is a heck of a lot better and yes out there and I only say this because it was a lot of good that came out of seeing the people stand up and and voice their opinion in the strike the teachers\nI'm good with every bit of that I'm not good with the ... of the politicians Democrats politicians that basically\nDeliver does nothing game that teachers nothing for Nineteen Ninety two thousand Fifteen their pay decreased and decrease through decreased\nAnd yet they ran in the hall Ron Ron everybody\nI'm not good with that\nLet me ask you to clarify that because I I think the Detroit organizations to some teachers thought when you said that'll happen not because of the people who were while riding and everything upstairs they thought you were talking about teachers and service workers you we're not talking about them\nKnow what went wrong God's law or the teachers know how I feel about them I mean I thought they did a great job and they played it may you know they\nYou know there was sure there were times when they were pretty tough and maybe that's okay\nI mean they may with a lot of respect and everything and I appreciate them and everyone knows why on earth was I talking about the people I was talking about you know Jeb has that were running up and down the hall screaming and hollering and everything was so Jetta brought to the education can you\nKnow what I saw and I know what are Republicans the pro yes\nAnd it's so many just Democrats just run and pollen on it just absolutely you know just running for a vote that's all they're all the world they're doing right here\nLet me ask you another government governor Jim Justice will not let me ask you about the political part of this because ah clearly there have been\nA comments and criticism from Democrats and even teach organizations and union saying that the timing of this is suspect because it's five weeks before the election or the Democrats have been courting the support of teachers\nAnd to them it looks like this was a political move so that the so that the Republicans running for office can say look what we are doing next year\nThat ... that uh they said this was done for political purposes your response\nI think\nThat's hogwash beyond belief and I'll tell you exactly one hobby is just this as you wrote these laws are surpluses weren't growing\nEverybody's going to die then and say we want the U.S we want if we want this\nIt was my thinking right off the get go hold on here let's let's just stop that before that ever happens in less reserve these mummies\nOr the ... guy and four or five percent pay raise for teachers primarily our teachers but all government work well let's take it off the table before\nEverybody starts running is scrambling for the cheese and that's what we'll do you know if we get slapped that alone and everything everybody starts friendly now that's one thing and the other thing I Would just tell you just this\nIs really the people that ought to be ... you know I don't have a dog and it's not right now but the people that have been courting the teachers are the Republicans they deliver they have to deliver everybody else's just\nTall but they deliver you know and so it is not think political at all those Republicans took a\nVery big stand to stand up there and say\nAbsolutely in a way of all the garbage that they too in the wake of all that there is still\nStanding out there and say we're only or you the teachers are seeing an education even in a way of all the stuff\nOh I got an on that in in in fairness on that and I argued with ... Carmichael about this and I was there just like everybody else was is that the Senate Republicans were the very last one to get on board with a five percent pay raise the very last ones\nThey were holding on to the very end until they got shaken they were the last one Senate Republicans were the last ones on that ... percent pay raise you know that you were there\n... that's that's exactly why I said over and over I'm the one that came up with the idea the house in ... Italy jumped on board and said it took a little longer to come on board but when they said that came with the idea for five percent for every bat yeah now you know here's the other side of\nHis faith or just trying to do what they felt like was the first thing they felt like we couldn't spend that much money right now because they couldn't they absolutely at that time didn't really probably believe where we're where we're where we are today I Believe\nIt but you know I there is a long long time and a lot of experience that you do this and so I Believe it but it actually it it's everybody you know everybody has a right to their concerns over just trying to do the right thing but when they came they came for all\nLet me let me finally I Want to go back to this issue for a moment about\nThe using the budget surplus for a pay raise and I know that you believe that will continue uh the economic growth will continue but you've been in business or your wife you know that there are ebbs and flows that occurred and it isn't there ... isn't there some risk\nWhen business is good\nThat you shake that additional money and you put it towards something that's going to be a cost every year not just a one time costs but they cost every year it comes to the comes to the base of the budget\nIsn't there a risk as a business guy isn't there a risk associated with that\n... there's a risk or get up in the morning\nBut that you know and it was a decision when we got to make it are you going to get out of the better just lay there all day you know the other flip side of it is just it's obvious\nThere's a big town where you are if we don't if we don't increase our teachers pay especially if we don't increase our teachers face\nYou know we're gonna wipe the end of the fact that we don't have seven hundred classroom with no teachers I Know who may have seven thousand\nI mean there's a risk everywhere you know but it but if it's the same time when you put in management hurting management and what we're doing is a lemon eighty vacant jobs we're saving ourselves ... upon millions of dollars\nWhen you look for in management and you say okay now on the air go called eighty million by the time that I mean really when the roads where we'd kicking and you know by it but I mean ... and ... there was a lot of\nPeople lots you guys but the gym you really got it on this thing go Daniel you know you did a great job on that he was staying staying go yesterday reached the prices Seventy seven ... Seventy seven dollars and fifty said\nAbsolutely eighty percent of our production estates thing called our coal miners are back to work and you're going back more and more and more every day and ... taxes are going to continue to rise but everything's but\nYou know how many white Danny on at the pay that we're on right now we'll end up with a five hundred million dollars that I don't really want to do\nI Know you don't mean death is I think you mean surplus you don't mean to us at ...\nI'm ... I'm so used to where it was\nFive hundred million dollars after but never left surfaced yeah but it's the same time I didn't really go and we're going to be three hundred million and it was three on the mayor that I'm aware of better way I'll go back to what I said\nIn the beginning education should be the center place absolutely educate everybody wants their kids' education and the best life and and and\nSo many people on the outside all the votes West Virginia's backward ... down and and all that is nasty things nasty jokes\nAnd I hate I hate those jokes and everything and so our all I'm saying is this is the best way Rochefort practical and it is the best way just fail that damage or let the world have good\nWe're ... we're going to leave their governor Jim Justice govern appreciates coming on will be in touch thank you sir\nI use are about All right we'll be right back so they wouldn't have you ever wonder just too far the friends of coal well there are fifty thousand west\nVirginia families who support the state's coal industry and they look a lot like you honest hard working good neighbors who won a future for themselves and their state\nTonight's mean any meetings the next ... theories will be held in general not from the metro news anchor desk I'm Shawn Johnson [noise]\nDo they talk on presented in part by mine were delivering better health for better West Virginia is no job it is our mission Christine Campbell is the president of the western ... of the American federation of teachers West Virginia joins us on veterans talk like Christian good morning how are you I'm good how are you well thank\nYou Christine governor justice who was just on this program are proposing a five percent pay raise a one year five percent pay raise for all teachers service workers state employees and at one time one hundred million dollars into ... to bolster that fund what's your reaction to those depose\nWell name we would always like to see that commitment that we're talking about a pledge or a promise down the road when the truth is the legislative majority is in charge of making those things happen and then the governor can I put money towards PTA\nThrough his office but any pay raise would have to go through the legislature and I think that if that is the case then that's something that he be talking about at\nThe state of the state or down the road not right before the election\nOkay so there's politics here there's ... there's a physical part of what's what to do the physical part first though and then we'll talk about the politics and I I Do think there are legitimate questions about the timing of it however I shouldn't be for you will and and the other two Georgia's Asian WBAI\nHave long complained about what teachers making its July when if you want to fill these positions you got to have across the board pay raises with the governor's proposal that would be\nTempers tempers that raised over two years how come you're not jumping up and down and doing jumping jacks about that\nWell it's just like the ... when the teachers in service personnel went on strike I mean there is a promise of one percent and from as early as February twenty second to march sick\nWhen the bill is actually signed which seemed like a short period of time but in legislative land is you know it is not a short period of time and there were people out of their class rained\nAnd blocks and all of the things that went on politically uh to keep that from happening so I think it's more about this trust that will really come to fruition and\nGiven the timing why are we talking about this now if we are than you want to do it let's do it it has the money and let's see if it if you're not worried about\nWhat's going to happen down the road let's do it because these people are tired of hearing how great things are while they continue to struggle within their own family finances a lack of resources and the classrooms in their schools and the students struggling academically and emotional\n... understood and I I I Want to see what's happening\nI understood it but again that goes back to this point that the the chief executive of the state the person who are through the modern budget amendment actually determines that's out a budget of budget priorities and how the money is supposed to be bad and then there's a legislative approval has to\nFollow but I mean he has come out before there is a fight during the legislative session and said this is just priority that's what he wants to do it would seem to me\nThat ... and and maybe you can take him at his word that he heard your last year [laughter] earlier this year when you took over the halls of the capital but he got it got the message and therefore one would think\nIf he did hear that and he did get the math that then they should be given credit where credit's ... they all should be given credit\nWe heard yesterday in that press release that it was public Republicans who came up with the idea who eventually got it done and I think people are frustrated by the fact that they took a huge risk and coming out of their schools for public education and their students\nInto that for that to be kind of\nA downgraded to suggest that pep rally at the Capitol is just in the whole thing and I think that the peace\nWe would love to see a movie and a commitment toward a public education and as education as a centerpiece I Believe that the governor truly believe that mhm but the people he's working with believe it's a very different way on how to get\nSo you're saying you're saying you're you're not ... so you're you believe the governor but you don't believe that those Republican standing behind him\nPublic ... necessarily who are in the majority right now who are ... you don't believe they're necessarily on board is that what you're saying\nI think the governor wants to make education a center piece and I think he learned last year that doing it from the top down or as a business model is not going to work to attract business you have to have a good public education system\nBut they're also not giving credit to the people who actually brought that to their attention and I think that's the biggest piece right now people have all the distrust because somebody saying don't look over here we did this we did this and they know that fat and not the case\nThat was not propose at the state of the state\nI wasn't you know when you come\nTo fruition until they had been standing out on the streets and at the Capitol for that\nWell it's it's again it's it's I I understand your point and Christian but also you can give a but legislators and the governor the benefit of the doubt and say they got it they heard that they see what happens and that was also\nGive teachers in service personnel the benefit of the doubt that they were working\nA ridiculous hours to improve public education and I can't do it without proper resources and good people so it's a vicious circle of you know last week we were saying oh look where schools are these people are working themselves to death to for the kids\nAnd for the students and for the community\nAnd so while we would love to give the people who actually signed the bill\nCredit for it they should be giving Arab people credit for the work that they're doing every day and they shouldn't have to walk out of their schools in order for that commitment to come to fruition weeping ask it's been on a legislative agenda for as long as I've been involved in a T a multi year package\nAnd now we're still we can't keep up with even the surrounding states because it would take\nFive to ten thousand dollars just to keep barely compete with that\n[noise] okay so you're not happy well\nI'm happy for that suggestion I Am not happy about a promise and not having expecting us to just say oh great thank you very much and at the same time not thinking those people for bringing it to their tension and also for the work that they continue to do every day\nSo would have been in the governor's announcement I mean he focused yesterday on Republicans and gave Republicans a lot of credit for this as I pointed out the Republicans were the last ones to get on board on this so you would have felt better than if the governor had said something to do effective I heard the teachers they made their voices while I'm clear on or do\nI mean you wanted more credit for the teachers then in this proposed\nNaval on credit for what they did I mean I don't even take credit for that like we all work together and the governor was the first to come on board with an actual proposal if that\nWas somewhat credible but he also said that the Senate with the women and that wasn't the case when you want something to get done then do it\nAnd he says he's walking the walk not talking the talk well if you want to do it then and you have the money then\nI don't know called special session David I it doesn't matter to me but the thing about it is is all of this trust in the world is about promises that are being made but people aren't seeing those promises come to fruition\nAt the dinner table every evening\nWe understand but the the ... I guess I mean I I I I underestimated the level of\nTeacher frustration and became very evident to me being at the Capitol last year I saw it I got it it was very clear and and it resulted in there would not have been a five percent pay raise and there wouldn't have been the um you know the the freeze on PE I had you on I've been there that that is evident that is clear um well I\nGot one still happening with the I I mean if you go on and I actually see what people are talking about there are clear there's clear evidence that they're still going to the drugstore and not getting approved or they're still having to pay this exorbitant amount and they still can't get approval for these\nDevices I mean these things are real welders and a half before China than every day not a problem with the ... down the road\nWell they have on it the task forces or the task forces do meeting to try to come up with solutions and even before the source has\nMay not met since uh August September and it's the governor's task force if he's why is he working separately on PE I why does he come to the meeting scheduled a meeting attended a meeting and talk about it with\nThis he created this task force well let me I work with the task force on these ideas\nWell I think well I I I won't work I I think that the task force is still trying to come up with things I'm not sure exactly where they are but I Do know that and I feel like I'm Carrying the governor's water here but I'm pushing\nAnd a lot of these jobs are very good paying jobs with benefits with good things but but but yes to the point of a major factor that we have to focus on in West Virginia is human capital we have to really really place I mean it's already on increasing\nWhat level of education and training and job skills of our workforce or because you know we just don't have enough people in the workforce in West Virginia\nFor one thing that's a major impediment\nAnd in one driver of that lack of labor force participation is just people who just don't have the skills that are in demand for they don't even bother to look for work because their skills aren't up to par so effective or investment in education to get people the right skills to get into the workers a rice field it's got to be priority number one\nAnd this one right into the that where you say only fifty three percent of West Virginia's adult population is working are looking for work that is a stunning how bad is that number\nThat's about ... so here's the bottom of what we have reason to celebrate but we have a lot of challenges and that right there it's challenged number one we lagged a nation by ... percentage point in terms of labor force to patient and there's no way we can ever experienced the economic prosperity we ... we can get more people into the workforce is it it's\nGot to be a key priority but the problem is it it's a long term challenge it not comfortable going to be with picks overnight we have to focus on this diligently for four years and years\nTo really improve the job skills but also the education or or that the health and the drug abuse problem in West Virginia that keeps people out of the work force as well\nYeah this is I wrote about this last week was caught sheet about it but I Would be all for\nUm a lot of legal immigration and people to move here from I don't care where but if they're willing to work hard and and settled here and and raise families and pay property taxes and go to school I don't care where the from if they're here illegally and want to work\nYou know economists are very much pro immigration an overwhelming majority of ... the thing is we have to be able to convince businesses that we can provide them with the workers that they need or else they're not going to come to West Virginia they're not going to locate here for not sure they can on the workers that they need\nTo just simply bringing in more people and bringing in a more people are more people with good job skills with a good health and in the Hamptons job skills on help that a key factor in economic development convincing businesses that you have people that you need if they choose to locate\nHere John Dr John ... director of WB used girl business economic research on this annual report and you're going on in Charleston John it's always good to speak with you great insights thank you very much\nThanks so much have a great thing\nIs you're screwing company looking ... grew up in a gymnasium floors or do you know hey I be architectural interior products when it comes to athletic facilities invested in the best equipment and reduce the risk of injury and hey I'd be understands the needs of athletes with the highest quality sports equipment like\nBleachers equipment storage gym equipment scoreboard they in so much more take a look at what they have to offer at V.

I don't want to I don't want to let you also because you haven't let yourself also quite frankly but you you were the newest person on the court were you were there are times when you were just like well our justice is how things work and\nThat's the ultimate softball to you but I Can't help wondering if there wasn't some of that and you have people have been there for years and have more\n... perhaps the new well\nIt was I guess the best I could describe um you know as a culture that was very well established there hadn't been a new person in four years and that person wasn't actually knew he had been a law clerk for a while so there hasn't been any new justices uh since two thousand nine and so coming into that\nAnd again I'm not making any excuses at all\nWhen I got here there's kind of a big learning curve to do the job that you know we do day to day which is judge these cases you know decide cases based on the law\nI'm based on you know fairly in a partially and I really focused in those first few months of the January term on learning how to write opinions on learning how to analyze these cases and working with my clerks and trying to keep up\nA it's a busy and when we meet we're very busy and so I probably focused on that more than these kind of administrative matters not that they aren't important and I did my best of course to setting and to be responsible about it\nUm but you know it was hard to be the junior person I came in and you know a lot of the what we talked about it in the trial of course was\nI came from W medicine and from a private law firm and and so I had a very kind of private sector way to look at things and I would try to bring that experience to the court and sometimes it was not welcomed and so I think now\nI'm obviously I don't think it I Believe that that I Will you know I now I have an ... an\nAn obligation to the Senate under the censure to work toward greater transparency and accountability to make sure that we're getting the policies and procedures in place that should have been here for a long time and I'm pretty sure my voice will probably be a a little more welcome now\nThe workers were the stream court justice and the quizzes yesterday by others so that sort of to one\nWould think about just a second to the office for a second and as you said you were in the new person there you're trying to hit the ground running\nA ... in that office I think that was burned Benjamin is office because you got to be and she she\nRemodeled it not too many years prior to that and if you were anxious to run running and just as long as I Do want to come in and go look I just need a laptop and know where the bathroom is and I don't need just office reader I don't need all this stuff I just need to get to work\nAnd the officers fine I mean where did that not occur to you\n[noise] well the the biggest problem is that when I arrived 'em and had access the opposite was empty um they found that ... found at a temporary desk and we got a chair and I of course got a computer\nUm but\nIt so we we started to think about well how do we make this office functional this empty office functional\nThe other problem is that it was very dark it was very difficult to working here I'm you know I I don't know if the vision thing but I I really wanted an office that had more life\nAnd so that's where it started I wanted a functional office that sit in the capital as I explained to the Senate um some of the renovations and other offices I don't think would have made Cass Gilbert proud and I want\nTo know about Robin Davis was uh yes I mentioned that during the trial are good um so I went in\nAnd everything I have in my office is designed to make sure I can work well and then I can meet with my clerks um which we do frequently to discuss cases or to figure out you know how we're writing opinions and all of that and every piece of furniture that is in here that is purchased by the state will be here when I leave 'em I'm not interested in\nI didn't choose things that I liked because I you know in vision taking them later these will all be here for the next office the person who next act occupies us a\nJustice of Juno that Alan offering it is alleged do you know the ... did you know the offering the discussion were using and said vehicles for profit purposes\nI found that out late and twenty Seventeen when the media reports started so I did not know that\nOkay what do you think uh what do you think should happen or there's impeachment a pending now with three other justices before the Senate or do you have an opinion as to what you think should happen with each of them\nI absolutely trust the Senate to make that judgment um that is their role and responsibility on our constitution and I've said many times that I respect that greatly\nWhy did you choose to pass strategically to essentially admit that you made a mistake admit screwed up and and and adhere to the\nProcess because there's been a lot of pushback against the process challenges by other justices to the process why did you decide I'm going to accept that I have culpability here and I'm going to accept that this was the process what did you decide to go that route\n[noise] well I thought that that was the responsible way to handle it I just took a different approach than others have taken um I\nYou know are that the process of impeachment as my lawyer said in his opening statement enshrined in our constitution and it is you know the ultimate you could say check and balance um and there I didn't see where there was any\nNeed to challenge it it's in the constitution the Senate held a trial and I want to do appear in front of that trial and explain what I did wrong and what I thought I did write\nWhat we do going forward to ensure that we don't have something like this again\nWell I'm really fortunate to have another ten years and my term I'm so I'm going to be working every day to make sure we have a policy that we need to try for example are CFO testified before the Senate that there were four areas from her perspective where we\nWere uh she thought we needed policies you can bet that I have a list of those four things on my desk and we're going to get working on them as well as an important human resources policies\nAre and and matters like that so I think if we adopt some of these things that other organizations and even other branches of government do\nUm it will go a long way to making sure that that were never in that situation again because the taxpayers are understandably upset understandably concerned\nI Would be to 'em and we need to um restore trust and confidence in the judiciary by making sure that we can show the taxpayers and the legislature that we can administer responsibly\nJustice best Walker justice appreciate your coming on thank you very much and good luck to you will talk to you and thank you\nThank you for the opportunity ... clutches a\nVirginia

West Virginia poll that was back in August and we had mansion up eight we we added forty six thirty eight\nAnd the rest undecided up then the most of the polls I've seen had mentioned up six eight ten something like that a Morris these folks put out a poll last week and I haven't seen details that I've just seen the news releases about it they said the race is essentially tied\nUh they said new west Virginia US Senate race polling conducted by Eighteen Ninety two polling shows the race between Morsi mansion is tied and this was before Trump's visit on Saturday\nAh but I haven't seen the poets self but we're working on getting the Morsi polls drawn but first let's talk to mansions pollster Jeff ... just so much is on veterans chocolate hey Jeff how you doing\nI'm Glad happy thanks for having me as always\nThanks for coming on that before I get to your numbers I got to ask you a loaded question is if people are saying wait a minute Pollack is a democratic pollster he works for mansion why should we why should why should we believe the numbers you were about to give us in this race since you work for\nYeah that's a good question and and people should take any campaign poster with a grain of salt at any time there on the only thing I can tell your listeners are which many of them are the religious listeners that you add now\nWe've had this conversation over many electoral cycles a I've been on your program talk it out um whether we got this was going to win for example and people asked the same question\nI you know look it is incumbent upon us\nOr to when we go on programs like yours to deliver the data that we believe to be writing credible because at the end of the day if we're wrong and we got business problems for for a long period of time so uh I'm happy to take my record as that of accuracy in West Virginia the last number a cycle and put it up against anyone\nWhat numbers do you have in this race\nWell look we have um tiger mansion doing very well I mean as you said you've seen multiple calls that are in that have an update it at my pen we actually happen at this point out twelve point forty eight percent for mansion thirty six percent or more seats and four percent per se how in the libertarian\nFor some of the polls you were also referencing happy we should be clear some of them only ask the two candidates on a as opposed to the three but the ballot that's going to be that the voters of West Virginia are going to the view have that third party candidate libertarian um until it's always important to note that those those three options exist or people\nForty eight so you got 'em up well that's the standard is not above the fifty percent so you've got an undecided there and how big the undecided what are you know about them\nTo the undecided or or twelve percent of the boat and and what we know there's a couple of the first of all obviously and a three\nWay race happy you don't need to get to the present 'em in order to win that doesn't mean that senator Manchin doesn't want to get there you know\nOr that center mansion months every vote hospital and he is going to fight to get a every single vote that humanly can so he is going to fight for some of those undecided knows undecided you're generally people who are lower information voters meaning they're not really paying attention\nTo things the way other people are uh the way some of the other voters are there lasting gauge they're more likely I'm a cat or a can be younger voters for example who will pay attention when things um get closer happy\nEnd of the race so some of those are really looking for some level of communication open the closing weeks of the campaign but we feel pretty good about where things are most of the polls aside from that one or more people that still pretty much a mystery since uh nobody's seen it nobody's I'm a smell that nobody's heard it and I'm not even sure\nUh it is of course the third poster that the Marcy campaign has been through this year so\nClearly they were shopping for and pollster they liked him finally found one or that they wanted to stick with\nJust following his with his a democratic pollster and pollster for Senator Joe Manchin and they're releasing numbers to do their mansion of twelve forty eight thirty six and for\nFor the a libertarian and then would you say four to twelve percent ... percent under such that if that's the underside I I don't know how I don't know how hard you pushed to find out how people leans year but twelve percent that's a that's not a big number\nA no it's not a big number and it it actually has been relatively consistent over the last number of months but here's the problem for them or is he campaigned and then not only are our polling but multiple polls even yours I'm a as well show that\nPatrick Morrisey numbers are not good I'm meaning that his favorable unfavorable when we ask a question asking people are favorable or unfavorable that Patrick Morrisey far more are unfavorable they hand than favorable right now we have him forty four percent unfavorable thirty four percent\nA favorable so that we would call that ten points underwater that's how we would refer to politics as opposed to senator Manchin who is above water\nFifty percent of the voters are favorable to forty two percent or unfavorable that's more seats fundamental problem that the voters of West Virginia have looked at him have looked at his record and frankly in that they don't like it\nUm it's also the reason why that third party candidate very important look some of these voters may not want to vote for Joe Manchin some of these voters may not want to vote\nFor Patrick Morrisey on when you have somebody who's so dislike the way Patrick Morrisey is and the state that third party vote becomes more interesting because there are folks who say good lord I I Am a Republican\nBut I Can't vote for for a for Patrick Morrisey and I can't vote for Joe mansion while they may very well vote for that libertarian which is why that four percent are very important\nJesse could also be though that in our poll had\nA Morsi or like a sort of sort of sort of third or support in the third ... didn't and the third weren't sure about him even though he's won two statewide races so it's not might just be that his problem is a familiar to use you whereas with mansion and maybe people like them or maybe do hate him but everybody knows them so\nI I think that may have been the case in August happy and you're not the case today because\nThere are millions of dollars of ads that have been spent and so I'm telling you I have eighty percent of the voters who are willing to say whether they're favorable or unfavorable to him and so there aren't that many people who say they've never heard of that in fact literally in our poll four percent of the voters said that they have never heard of it\nUm and so it it it's not the same as it was back in August on Patrick Morrisey has been defined and he's been defined by the ridiculous actions that he had taken a journey general for example to take on this silly case and trying to overturn I'm a pre existing conditions\nI'm a ... you know these are the mistakes that and he's made a that are coming home to to to on him\nWell you guys I Know the Democratic seemed this year is the health care issue you guys are running that everywhere you can jump out his with his shoes to mention a poster but if you're here is a challenge you have is that West Virginia numbers you know President Trump is very popular in West Virginia\nThis is now a red state a if after all intents and purposes and President Trump is committed coming here last night when he spoke and he was in Mississippi he said he was campaigning for someone who said pretend like you're voting for me pretend like you're voting for me to vote for this person is a vote for me where we've gone from says that in West Virginia\nThat's going to move the needle for Mars the isn't it a vote for Morsi's like voting for me and he got sixty percent approval for Trump is not going to move this is number\nWell that's certainly what they're betting on and it seems like that it's the president favorite state these days but that's it\nI I Would not say that Donald Trump is very popular we know that this is is I'm a ... second best state in the country depending on which state are you look at a and so the president is trying his heart is that I think it is hard you know that uh Joe mansion I'm a is one of the people they can overcome a his brand\nUm so the president coming in that there's no question there trying to rescue the Morsi campaign but in just coming in and say and vote for Moore if he isn't necessarily enough again I\nI don't want to I don't want to keep pointing out but everybody told me the exact same thing going in to a gym justices race for governor now that was back when he was a Democrat but they said the same thing how are you going to win with Donald Trump as popular as he is and and and doing well and and Jim Jeffords was able to do that\nWell I I've I've I've got differently because justice didn't really run as a different kind of random Jim Justice me almost fit the Trump mold I mean he was a business guy and he was kind of Trump asked uh so I don't know if I see the exact analogy there did you pull one happens depending on how mentioned votes on cabinet all did you ask that question a lot\nI don't know how how senator mansions going to vote on on ... on the voters of West Virginia there have been multiple polls\nThat show that they support um uh uh the appointment of ... um the polling that we have 'em and you know is is a is a week old so it's a temper twenty third is when we finished so we're actually before the latest round of hearings so\nI it wouldn't be fair for me to talk anything about sort of what's happened over the last a week or so 'cause I don't have any data on it\nUm but senator mansions going to make up his mind in terms of what he believes is best for the country and best or West Virginia I'm a I Wish I could say that he listened to his pollster all the time I'm a bus but are those who knows center mansion now he's going to do with what he thinks is best for the state and that's for the country\nIf he would hypothetical gorgeous talking here just if if Manchin vote against Kavanaugh and then the Marcy people the next day if they're smart and I would assume if some people know what they're doing would have an ad up and I would be that thing to death and say when Joe Manchin had a chance to support", "show_name": "MetroNews TalkLine", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "03"}
