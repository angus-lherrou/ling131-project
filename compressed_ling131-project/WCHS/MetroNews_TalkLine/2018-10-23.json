com\nWe we tried to have conversations with those who walked away from us so we we started out we were in great face and we thought we were Kevin good conversation with them and then they turned around and walked away from us and so when they walked away from us I mean that means all all deals are off I mean we want to have conversation and I and I will say let me let me let me be clear about this\nThose students that are in those disassociated ... ah um fraternities they are Wu students and they will always be W these students um but but when they walk away from us and our concerns about safety about being on good academic footing that's a deal breaker for us\nKori first as with is dean of students that WVU and on this\nNew policy concerning the ... the fraternities and sororities too well no sororities um have a completely different recruitment process okay and so this just didn't work for them okay\nSo that the studies that they can have a a pledge period for first semester freshmen if they meet certain guidelines I read the guidelines they do seem very restrictive including the two point seven five GPA\nOr how they're a week before they become become active initiated member so it's a it's a very tight window that doesn't go over the six weeks or seven weeks of a semester so it's it's tightly written\nAnd is this a one time only or is this the how there was a pilot right now so ... we'll see an end um well you know will still do our recruitment spring semester like like ... was already planned\nOn but we'll we'll see how this pilot goes again we're we're in good faith having conversations with those fraternities that want to work with us and want to make themselves better fraternity men um and so we're we're gonna we're gonna try this out\nThat strikes me to Corey that and I think the University of frankly has been over backward has done back flips to try to accommodate the fraternities here it seems to me you're trying yet again to accommodate them and and help them guaranteed their survival because why a lot of students are going to come to WVU for a fraternal life\nAnd if there are fraternities off campus figuratively off campus that say come you don't have to follow these rules will do I want to do that might be tough to recruit against ...\nWell look look we've got great students that come here that are smart and and they ... they came to W. view the cause of W these brand and the good things that they do and so\nTo me I think the students that are wanting to be with the fraternities and sororities that are affiliated with the university understand why they're sticking with the University We're going to be with them and teach them\nHow to be safe and how to have a good time they get great advantages of being able to use the university brand and buildings and things like that and that's in those things of university oversight or important\nNot only to the students but to the parents I mean they they're sending their sons and daughters off the WVU and want them to have a well rounded experiencing great education in many of those parents\nWere members of fraternities and sororities and remember the great things that those fraternities and sororities this what\nAre you going to do because if there is another incident a serious incident at a fraternity that as dissociative from the University We're still going to call you all the press is still going to call the university and even though they're not technically associated with the university they still are in a tangential way so you're still gonna get the phone call\n... sure I mean and and again as I said just a few minutes ago there's still WVU students and we're still want to support them academically when they need tutoring when they need counseling they are still WVU students and we're we're going to be there to support them I mean I Hope that tragedy doesn't happen\nUm but they're still W these students were not going to turn our backs on them their Wu students\nBut when and I think that the university has been for example there's trouble lots of times you called the security WB security please and they are more interested in resolution and coughing and stuffing well now if there's incident at a frat houses not associated with the university might call the police right what does the campus police well\nNo matter what the laws apply in it and that's whether they're associated are disassociated so so the University of police will be involved the city police will be among depends on where the incident takes place they're subject to again usual laws and prosecutions but they're also subject to our student conduct\nCode how intense what is the debate internally\nBecause I Know that I've talked to a doctor about this I Know he's a former fraternity member and I think he was a big supporter of Rick life but it was their intention trouble debate about just blowing the whole thing up I mean just just because a lot of schools have a lot of schools that enough is enough we're not going to do this anymore we're just going to get rid of Greek life did you think about that\nNo because again because we see the value and fraternity life and sorority life and so there there's never been a point that the president or anyone said\nLet's get rid of it completely because again there WVU students these are great student organizations across the country I mean they add value and so they're they're I mean again we want to keep them in the fold we don't want to we don't want to throw him out\nHow disappointed are you is the university that the national chapters the cause of oppression I've gotten from yours the national chapters we're not as willing to work with you or as you all were to work with them\nWell personally I I mean I I Am disappointed professionally I'm disappointed because these are students again as I said I'll I'll be a broken record that\nThere are students and so we know the culture of our students here in Morgantown Russ West Virginia and so those national organizations while I appreciate them they're far away they're in Lexington, Virginia there in Indianapolis there in Evanston, Illinois\nI'm ... and ... and we know our students here locally we know the culture we know the types of students that we attract we know West Virginians we know the region that we draw from\nInstantly know what's important to those students and how to guide them\nHow to mould them to be great citizens for tomorrow\nBut you also know you couldn't let things continue to get out of hand\nAbsolutely right I mean if we are and we and and that culture change started quite honestly years ago not just with our um fraternities but with the general campus culture you know we we you know we had issues around the community\nWe've started attracting and we change the culture we and and again and it and it's showing in our academics you know we have higher GPA's us of high school students coming to us our overall university GPA's up\nAnd and and and look I'm um we've got three times the number of honors college students who are entering the universities and we raise standards and so so that that culture change has worked and and students aren't bracing parents are and bracing it and said this is part of\nPeter culture thing is the university going to exert has considerable power to notify parents or family that here or the guidelines for the fraternities that store associated with the university and hear all the fraternity that are not associate with university\nGreat question and and the answer to that very simply is yes we we we stated back in the spring when we started reaching the summit we're going to keep an open and transparent process\nWe're going to continue to keep parents in the loop and so we we've email parents there were a parent a news throughout this process and again with this process and students and families can look on line\nWhere we've got GPA ... you know chapter GPA's we've got the status of fraternities and sororities are they in good standing are they not recognized and so we will keep that process open and transparent that ... to keep parents included and and again students who are trying to see what's the best fraternity for me was the best sorority for me\nWe we will keep that open and and so they can see that\nHow important is it for the survival of sorts of attorneys that have stayed with the university that they have a there's a successful rush if you will that this pilot works because they need ... every they need members they need members and now they're competing against a ... that don't have to follow these kinda tougher rules right ... well\nI mean I I mean I I think it's ... it's important um ... and I'm ... for their survival I mean but again they've got the full face at the University of behind them and so I think they will work hard to make it work again we've been having these conversations with them all along and so they've been partners\nThey they bring to us proposals we listen to them we we have conversation about how can we can adjusted so\nThe students that are recognized or fully invested in this I mean were they these are conversations that we've had for months\nCorey fair is dean of students that WVU Cora good to say thank you very much thanks a lot we'll be right back stay with\nUs it's your court what do you want\nAnd it just and Robert Frank candidate\nFor West Virginia Supreme Court will bring much needed honesty integrity and clarity to a court which has lost its way Robert Frank\nAs

John [noise]\n[noise]\nGoing on metro news talk and I bought you more by ... or the living better health for better West Virginia is in a job it's a mission were more than ... dot com so back to the mansion Morris the race\nAnd obviously this race of getting national attention maybe not as much as some of the other races now because what some of the polling says but a Burgess ever of political made a trip to West Virginia to check in on the mansion Morsi race and wrote about it and joined us on veteran you're talking about ...\nMorning how you doing hey hockey and doing well\nThanks for coming on and so you say you said in your piece you focus you said that Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader had delivered some help maybe unintended for mansion how did you mean that yeah\nWell uh the Senate majority leader kind of a dead last week a sort of a media tour after the capital confirmation at the Supreme Court\nAnd he was asked about\nUh the debt increasing or under the Trump Administration in the context of the tax law and instead of saying that the tax law had driven up but that he said revenues have actually increased and that Medicaid Medicare and Social Security or the big drivers of debt\nAnd that's what we need to get our hands around to get our hands are on the debt by saying that the Democrats quickly raised the alarm that Mitch McConnell is coming for your entitlement programs\nAnd in West Virginia you know better than I Do a lot of folks rely on these programs are so it does allow the Democrats disorder change the conversation away from cabinet and toward their sort of bread and butter\nSo you took that and ran with it and ask mansion about it and what did he say to you\nHe said more if you will do whatever Mitch McConnell tell them to do a more the fired back that who he was actually at the same event and Martin birds or the fired back that he he would protect these programs and Manchin guy being open to Medicare for all of that actually the person who would change these programs not him\nOr just average with us from political emerges I I think you're right that McConnell and but you know I I sometimes the politicians actually actually see the truth and I thought the yeah yes when colonel talked about these entitlement programs and uh the rising cost\nOf Medicare Medicaid Social security and and the fact that they're going to a ... exhaust their trust funds in a few short years he's exactly right\nBut it's just one you can't get bipartisan approval to do anything into it's not the thing that frankly Kansas when talking about two weeks before the election just a couple of observation yeah my ...\nAnd and McConnell has I mean I I've been I've covered him very closely on five years now and this is one of his stock answers but the reason it's been resonating is because he said it multiple times and because of timing right yeah also like\nA lot some people think Kevin helped mansion 'cause he voted for him but I I Know that there are liberals and in West Virginia that probably won't super happy about that as well so I don't think that was necessarily a clear winner for him\nDemocrat think this one is a clear winner because you know they kind of cat McConnell as a little bit of a puppet master in terms of the Trump Administration they sort of cast him as the guy who's really calling the shots on policy stuff so even though Trump says he won't touch these programs\nDemocrats are sort of running with McConnell it sort of the evil genius caricature as they like to do\nAnd and the Democrats especially mansion I and some of these key states are really going and I know this is has a polled well are really going on this whole healthcare front that's become the top issue and many of these races is protecting healthcare protecting people with a pre existing conditions\nYour Medicare you're such good all those things I mean that mansion talks about that every time he opens his mouth\nYeah and you know your state is super unique or or with Missouri and map the attorney general's running for the Senate seat is behind a lawsuit that we're got Obamacare\nAnd this is something Democrats just can't talk enough about and Republicans are basically saying listen to what I'm saying that what I'm doing I Will protect preexisting conditions will handle it just as soon as we got Obamacare with losses and that sort of Morsi's message as well Josh Holly very\nYoung it just it it's just in a time when there's so many messages out there I think is the bigger challenge for the Republicans because you have to say a couple of things you have to say\nWe're going to fulfill our promise to get rid of Obamacare but also after that we are going to protect these things and do these other things were going to make sure that this happened so it's a tougher it is a tougher explanation frankly uh for Republicans\nAre than than Democrats would just say we're gonna protect you for existing conditions so it's it's just a harder west I think for them\nI agree and I also just think like generally speaking the with the term is shaping up Republicans are comfortable sort of talking about social issues the culture wars or things like that not necessarily economic and domestic policy and they're really not talking about the tax bill that much\nOr that they prefer not to be talking about Obamacare because Democrats at the edge there but I think as you come down the closing threats I think you'll\nBe hearing a lot from Republicans about how Joe Manchin the dishonest liberal and he's with Chuck Schumer and the corn and Hillary Clinton and I don't know where he's at on abortion\nOr merges ever with political so just a final take away you did spend a little time in the eastern panhandle around both of the candidates and you looked at the polls and uh we were talking about this we're seeing it every day but as not exactly an outsider but just a guy that came in what was your take away on this race and all of these candidates\nYeah so I was in Martin's work on Saturday and yesterday I was in in what for Donald Trump junior of\nMorsi and you know it was funny while I'm waiting to get on a cold you I hear a Senate leadership fund ad attacking mansion and sort of that tells you that Republicans despite the polls are still making four to one last push a to B mentioned I mean I I think they're very frustrating\nThat Trump could win the state by so much and and they can't kind of get mansion office significant lead that he's had so they have some uh decisions to make that the president is\nConsidering coming back to West Virginia according to my reporting he hasn't made a final decision a Senate leadership fund which is linked to Mitch McConnell a does not have ads for the last week or the campaign rainy to decide whether it's worth putting a couple of ... million dollars more in this race and sort of rolling the dice that I'm seeing if they can get the president the goose to turn\nA interesting two points on that because we had not heard about the present coming back I guess I should read your story that as you're saying you that they are they may or their content and coming back he's got a plane coming about yes\nYes okay and I ended up\nThe and the rumors southern West Virginia Beckley maybe you were hearing earlier no final decision yet\nOkay and on on the spending one of the arguments always for coming in and spending in West Virginia is frankly they say we were cheap date I mean it's just not that expensive compared with\nUh ads and if you're trying to run ads in you know or the California or New York or something like that I mean it's not that expensive relatively speaking if you want to run a ton of ads in West Virginia so\nRight and the other cheap state like would be North Dakota but Republicans have a pretty big lead yeah right now for their feeling good about that and Montana or more expensive but it's all very close to be kind of the races that they might be deciding whether they could get more marginal impact and in West Virginia\nGot you will continue to follow your reporting Burgess Everett with political a bird just a comeback

no sources are basically as far as getting treatment I Can't even get one of my friends are Republican to sign onto the lifeboat deal charging penny per milligram\nThat would give us two billion dollars a year to try to fight this on the front end to get treatment I had a lady today and she spoke on this and she wanted to be here and she asked me she introduced me\nAnd she said safe he said listen\nI went directly to him and asked him please take some of the settlement money you're getting\nAnd use it for treatment they wouldn't do that so I mean I'm not just making stuff up what incentives me happy\nThat you have an election within two weeks that horrible deal is a horrible deal under any circumstances anytime of the year but to do it and think you're going to come back out

wrong hobby that is wrong\nYou are if you if you add in the car no health settlement which was twenty million\nAnd the um a mirror source Bergen which was sixteen so there's thirty six\nAnd then if it's got to be on if it's going to be thirty five or with the cast and talking about Seventy one million dollars you are talking about I mean ... ... ... ... and some of this one time yeah and it's a one time it would be one of the island of seventies that is Seventy one million dollars and can you\nAt some point you deciding the ...\nWhen we let them pay for your hobbies you can't even pay for your jail costs are putting people in jail because of that you come nowhere close to paying for the health care costs of all the people that have been affected and you tell me that's\nA fair bit are you assuming that those those pharmaceutical companies are completely responsible for the party I Am\nYou tell me when you send five million pills kissing since five million pills in crime at West Virginia with three hundred and Ninety two people you think that's a health plan to make a\nHealthier in West Virginia or is that a business plan up you can't send this many millions appeals to my local state and think that you're really helping us get healthier\nAnd it is and in fact you are accurate and sing in two thousand five and two thousand six in the guessing shipped nearly five million doses of prescription painkillers doing now shuttered four million Kermit it down to four hundred people that is correct that is correct\n... every we've checked all the sources that are everything we possibly had and cross checked everything\nThe only thing I'm saying hobby stop this governor adjusted clean diamond corn I've said in your seat before I moved to ... clean jumping stop this horrible horrible settlement with people West Virginia 'cause it is going to affect us for a long time\nSo you want the governor to step in and stop this and I wanted to\nDo and I think I think Patrick started to cook the books I think when you have already says I think basically McAllister knows that the actual Morsi will accept the curtain climate\nSo they'll go and go for what else are we make a counter offer now see if we know except they know thirty five million has to be the magic number if it's anything different won't be that far off on shore and then basically said OK we'll go ahead and do that Patrick says look what a great settlement\nThe governor is the only person that this time 'cause I can assure you Morsi will not stepping in to do anything right now\nRight we're told you that the press conference plan for friday\nOr you're trying to get the jump on on on him on this\nThat's what we're trying to get this done after that don't have any decency at all attorney general Morsi don't you have any decency and concern of compassion for the people and just for your own political gains you would do something like this and\nIt's a horrible deal the governor's the only one that can stop it right now\nUS Senator Joe Manchin with his ... let me segue or just something that is somewhat limited so bear with me on this because of a certainly allowed you to to speak to the settlement issue and you've been clear what what you think about that is that you are a directly connected with Maya Lin because your daughter is the CEOs\nThere and and they are big contributors to\nMy ... I'm not directly connected I'm I'm I'm I'm a proud father\nEurope proud father of the\nAuthor of her daughter basically the wider way up from the basement and and and I ... career and they are big contributors to your campaign\nAnd and back during the ... the pen a issue a migrant was selling up the pins for six hundred dollars at cost about fifty bucks to me was that also unfair to West Virginians\nHappy first of all the ... pan fiasco what ever cause that that'd be pinned fiasco however it was cause\nI have absolute everything I can say they fix their problem they fixed that and came back with a generic version I don't know the ins and outs of how you price why it's priced it was a he has to go now take and my I take my island\nYou know ... basically has done for West Virginia in that area west of the north central West Virginia\nYou know the amount of pills that they're able to produce there at very low cost generic drugs\nJust who lobbied against generic drugs

largest employer either my state of West Virginia it is a big I'm divorced jobs good paying jobs yeah so you know I'm happy that companies that I represent and work with a support\nSo back to the laying back back what you talked about today 'cause you're challenging argued challenging Morsi to to not do this deal then\nOh most certainly for the sake of the state of West Virginia for the sake of the state of West Virginia please don't do this deal we can't pick up all this cost and if we pick up all this cost we're going to be basically detrimental to all the other services before depending on\nHow could you can't pick up two hundred and eighty one million dollars a year or in health care cost you can't continue to do that you can't continue to pick up I mean two hundred Ninety One Seventy seven million and thinking you're going to have resources continue this forever how long this epidemic\nAnd you can't fix this epidemic unless you have treatment and all the other things that we have to do but basically without treatment you're not going to get anyone yard\nAnd without treatment you got to have money to do treatment and he got nothing because you basically gave it away All right I Hope they stand up and I'm asking him to stop that completely and happy the other thing this personal attacks my good I have not attacked his wife I haven't set a thing that she has a right to make a living\nAnd she's out there continuing she does a good job I understand she's working hard and she represents the pharmaceutical industry very capability\nAnd they're able to still
