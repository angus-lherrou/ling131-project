know they're they're up against the clock to ... there's this other debate about whether it all has to get done in terms of actually impeaching people prior to the next legislature taking office and that's going to be people are gonna be taking their oaths of office\nFor the house in the Senate I'm midway through December you know that's really upon us and theoretically we've got three impeachment trials left\nSo to hash out these lofty legal arguments prior to a new legislature taking place is really asking a lot\nI Do have to ... does the legislature half to go ahead however they would do it and impeach offer aid to get off right off the\nCourt or does this conviction a lead to some sort of automatic remove or of of him\nYeah I I'm not totally clear on that for one thing he can he can still fight the conviction he\nUh has fourteen days from friday to to decide that he's going to ask for a new trial okay so so that's one thing that's still hanging out there I I think you'd still like the certainty of knowing he is off the court and I don't think there's any partisan dispute on that matter a ...\nRight I mean right now he suspended without pay so his his limbo is I mean he's not he's not on the court I mean he suspended but that means you have a substitute in their um [noise] well I'm trying to on top of the night and I can't\nGo to the greater mind than ours\n[noise] what it could the end of the legislature may or there was no legislation they just wanted to drop the whole thing now or they or they want to get out of it as best they can but make sure they get rid of ... are the those new legislature believe wait a minute the judiciary can't tell us how to do impeachment\nYeah there's a range of of views on that uh a couple of little lawyers on the Democratic side\nI'm Mike Wall full and Mike Romano a stood up yesterday and said look you know I mean these were branches spoken but they've ruled on the constitutional matters in this case there's really no fight to still be had here\nA\nHit this area that there is there a German Trump took sort of a middle ground that I think there are aspects that we can still fight but the constitutional issues are said and done and then you had a sinner cars on the other side who believes that there's real wrongdoing here real real meddling by\nJudicial branch and he was in favor of going and getting the presiding officer or bringing him in and forcing him to to have a an impeachment trial\nBecause you can't have an impeachment trial without a presiding officer and the presiding officer did not show up because of the court's ruling\nYeah absolutely so they were they were at an impasse and and then\nSort of talk that through on the floor or what are we going to do\nThe next thing that they're going to do is you know what what do they do they they filed this motion for re hearing and you know talking about lawyers again the the way that's expressed and the wording and and whether it it picks just a particular part of this ruling to challenge or whether a challenges all aspects\nUh that's that's how the debate is going to go forward from years how that is expressed among the lawyers\nBut you know none of this would have happened if the Senate had taken the deal right because the deal was workman and walk or would\nThey were going to be censured they weren't accept responsibility a and then a separate but related deal was that a day they dropped the charges against ... Davis\nBut continue to pursue against offering offers so far has not challenged impeachment process so that could have cut a lot of this out right if that deal had been taken\nYeah as a practical sense if you had taken that deal and if you had voted in favor of the motion to just discontinue the charges against justice Davis just said well she's she's retired that's it we're not going to pursue it further\nUh that would have gotten you uh you know it would have been the ball in your court and you would have ended the whole thing\nUm and we would have been about where we are now but without all the confusion ... there was you know there there was I take them at their word that that the Senate majority felt like they had a constitutional obligation right here this whole thing out to to let the process take its course\nSo again the law for the end of it is well we're going to hear it we're going to do our duty that kind of thing the radical end is yeah you could have simplified a whole lot of things if you'd taken the deal and if you'd made a motion if you'd accepted the motion to not\nMove forward with Dave is that that was not there to say\nThat she was out for Monday McDonald's may have changed and tomorrow night on Thursday night are expected to be from the Knight to not to the mountain states from the edge where do you think could ask ... Johnson [noise]\n\n\nTalk on metrics welcome back to these programs in part by my island where they're living better help or better West Virginia is no job it is our mission so in short and in late ...\nThe state Supreme Court or those justices sitting as the state Supreme Court ruled that the legislature the house of particular got it wrong on how they handled impeachment Roger Hannah show is the speaker of the house of delegates joins us on and also we are joined us on veteran yourself and Roger morning how are you sir\nPublic morning I'm well thanks for having me ... I Know you disagree when the court says you got it wrong and you say what\nWill happen to the constitution is is clear on many fronts but one of the places where it's crystal clear as it empowers the houses of the legislature both the house and the Senate to adopt the run rules of procedure\nHouse in the Senate have done that we did that not only generally as the ... adopt rules to govern its proceedings but we did so in specific for this process where empowered to make that decision not the courts\nWere empowered to decide the process by which we move forward and articles of impeachment we've done that and that's not for the court to opine at all on only to the manner in which we did\nIt didn't the courts say though that you didn't follow your own rules\n[noise] uh yes it did and it did so by failing to give any consideration whatsoever to the totality of the proceedings at the house under cook so if you actually look at the opinion that the court issued\n... the court gives no no reference whatsoever to the to the ... the the complete package of resolutions adopted by the house\nAnd all of this process has to be taken in total happy we aren't we aren't able to cherry pick particular portions of any part of what's been done here out and make legal arguments based on that we have to consider everything that's been done here and when you consider everything that's been done here it's all been done in conformity with both the constitution and the rules the house\nRoger we have here the legislature in teaching the legislature utilizing his constitutional responsibility or write or power\nTo impeach elected officials in this case members of the state Supreme Court and then other members of the Supreme Court sitting and substitute ruling that the legislature screwed it up I mean I keep going in a circle I'm drawing a struggle with my finger\nI mean how do we get out of that\nWell there there are a number of ways happy enough I think the most important point to make here is that ... regardless of which of those ways we take to get out of it we want to be sure we do so methodically and thoroughly and pen properly\nAnd I'm In a manner that gives all of our citizens and all of our business interests both internal and external to West Virginia and confidence in our in our government and all three branches of our government\nSo there there are ways to get out of this process for example it's my understanding that the Senate as a result of this decision is ... is is likely to file a petition for reconsideration of that opinion I expect that the house will likely seek to intervene in that process once the petition by the Senate actually has filed\nAnd that would provide an appropriate vehicle for the court to write it soon we're all here we would certainly encourage the court to do so and\nAnd put this ah put the situation back in the square with the constitution of there there are other ways to do it the the the most tedious of which is that the legislature can advance constitutional amendments to put us back and square with where we should have been all along\nSo there there are ways to get where we need to be happy and it's important for everyone to realize we will get there it's there but we will get there in a way that respects the proper balance of power among all three branches of government\nAnd I'll get back to that balance of power separation of powers in a moment but could you also one thing you did mention could you also go back into session go okay and kinda shrug your shoulders and said okay it's been court says we didn't do this right so let's do the things the Supreme Court said we should do\nAnd and and and I'm really impeach if you will\nCertainly certainly that is another option a I heard that that did you you're you're correct the uh the opinion that the court laid out last week does does provide them a roadmap is perhaps not the right word but a description of how the uh\nThe the court believed that the impeachment process should have been handled in the opinion of the court\nUm whether whether to give any guy whether to give any credence at all of that opinion is is still an open question I I Will I Will tell you though that hobby that one of ...\nThings we want to be sure we don't create here is a circumstance in which West Virginians who lose more confidence than they have already lost in their government so this entire process was triggered by an effort to restore public confidence in government\nAnd that continues to be what the entire process is about this is this is not about individuals it's not about actions it's not it's not even about money it's about the confidence of West Virginians citizens business owners\nOrganizations and a piece of all types having confidence and all three branches of their government and that's that's the goal of I think every member of the legislature at this point is to properly restore the balance of power among all three branches of government and make sure people have confidence in their ...\nAnd you mentioned I mean it is about balance of power and it's about that ... balance of power because it it strikes me that uh [noise] excuse me you and others are saying this that you read the constitution we have the\nPower to impeach and we are doing that and then you have another branch of government says you're not getting it right or you're doing it wrong and you're saying well you really don't have the authority to tell us a how where you are if we're correctly or incorrectly doing our constitutional obligations correct\nA that's a fair summation of it yes yeah yeah so but real\nHobby this is not necessarily an unprecedented situation if you look at the founding of the country it was always the design of the government to be\nTo be that balance of power that you just described so the the individuals who found that our country intended from the very start that the three branches of government be balanced against one another that they all that they that they all three\nCompete for the same rights and responsibilities to make sure that no branch becomes superior to the other\nThat they always be that they always be seeking to exercise the authorities and powers delegated to them and not to see those authorities and powers to the other the other two branches so um I I I\nI think it's unfortunate that people are throwing around a term crisis because that's not that's not the case this is this is a circumstance that\nThat our our\nFounding fathers to use that term contemplate in from the beginning our our branches of government were always meant to compete against one another\nBut it might not be a crisis but certainly you want resolution and it seems like we're going we're going backwards you I mean if you and I have it as there's the whole legal system is based upon an independent arbiter\nHelping us sort these things out I mean if you and I have a dispute you and I can't resolve we go to a judge a judge helps us decided well this in this case as little bit different you had the judiciary\nAnd the legislative body and these two entities are disagreeing Ken Ken the judiciary\nDecide whether the judiciary or the legislatures correct right I mean how do we will let me\nLet me let me be as good as clear as I possibly can in response to one comment you just made hobby that is the way the legal system works\nThat ... the our legal system in this country is designed to do exactly as you just described but please don't lose sight of the fact that this is not never has been was never supposed to be a legal proceeding\nImpeachment is a political proceeding it's a process laid out in the constitution to be independent of the judiciary\nTo be independent of judges at all it's the political process and and I I use I use political process here are not partisan process but the process and that that makes it a fundamentally different process than the typical legal proceeding that that\nThat seems to have framed all of our discussion so far\nYeah okay I understand so I mean if it's if it's not a legal process the political process of which the legislature is empowered to do so\nThat's absolutely correct and solely empowered to do\nSo again I mean but you're applying it there would be a petition for re hearing but one would expect that you get the same result right from every hearing from the court wouldn't one ...\nWell actually I don't know happy because in the first instance what the Senate filed in response to the original petition was I Believe a very properly crafted put a brief\nWhich said in response court you lack jurisdiction to hear this to hear this matter at all so the court never actually was presented with a briefing on the merits of the case\nOr indeed the house didn't even respond all we were not at this point are not\nA party to that proceeding so there was never any response filed on behalf of the house and there was never a response filed on behalf of the Senate that actually reach the merits of the question to the front of the filing made by the Senate was a finding which very simply said to the court\nYou lack jurisdiction to hear this matter in total so if the matter is before the court again on re hearing and the actual substance of the case is considered the house as a party to that proceeding and actually present that side of the issue\nThat I think it'd be every reason to believe the court could properly conclude then that its original opinion was an air\nAll right Roger ... speaker of the house of delegates it is increasingly complicated but we're doing our best of sorts with Roger I appreciate your coming on today thank you for your time\nPow chow right uh she was part of the\nUh in today's environment isn't how shall enough to get it as I watch that enough to get you know if anybody can I add on your\nContributions to ... just to say no thank you um the\nThe reality for her is inescapable she has trans Greste across the most important the single most important issue in the Democratic party no matter what no matter how you how you reach it how you get there\nIs anti racism it is the new religion it is absolutely the core of the belief that the greatest transgression that you can commit\nIn the on the American life today is racism is worse than anything almost anything and I think anything I I was gonna say sexism maybe but I think racism is considered more a more unforgivable sin\nAnd for Elizabeth Warren to explore did that in any way and then the ham fisted thing where we're going to roll it out and hear my Republican relatives in are you offended when Donald Trump says that that it ended up\nAnd then later in the day having to come out and say well actually we didn't mean anything by it and it doesn't mean anything and I'm not you know I wouldn't say anything just a PR catastrophe\nI think I ... for me I think that she will be part of\nThe ... you know I don't know which one of these people as Jeb Bush um but she she is a strong contender for being Jeb Bush\nYeah I mean it it's um it's just kind of silly\nAnd and wait Joe Biden Jeb Bush sorry or Israel is okay here today might be a lot of fundraising last job there you go okay you just hit it\nGot it [laughter] I I I have nothing better than that that's pretty good All right Chris are well

I did I just want to go back to that uh this this conundrum and in Roger ... will have an earlier this week announced it said no this is a natural tension that's supposed to exist among the three branches but\nThere is a serious constitutional question here that included I just if\nIf the Senate had done what they said they were going to do and gone over and tried to drag the chief justice back into the Senate that would have been a true constitutional crisis proportions I've never heard of in any state government I mean we look kinda like we look foolish on this and you know with all due respect to the new speaker that ice house down there are\nA delegate hen show I mean there is no appeal to the U.S Supreme Court on this every\nYear to over here and he's asking for re hearing you saying that the house and Senate will make arguments and you have a reassuring I don't know if that changes they want to read\nWhat would they want is a reconsideration of the opinion because of the house did not intervene right house at every opportunity to intervene a throughout the process of a justice workman's appeal that or get rid of prohibition that just got decided they could have asked to intervene at any time if they thought they had interest to protect they chose not to do that\nNow will lose Supreme Court allow them to now reopen it intervene maybe but I doubt it\nWave ... but again you have you I I still come back to this is Mike and I'll leave it you know this will be the last thing was um it is that\nYou have the Supreme Court or making a ruling that is significant to the separation of powers which in their ruling favors the Supreme Court over the legislature I mean that doesn't that tilt the balance one way\nBut I I think it I I I don't think first of all I think it it till the balance for both the executive and the ah Supreme Court and you didn't have Supreme Court justices make any decision for themselves you had five judges that had no bias no interest in the outcome but I Will let it but\nAct as the Supreme Court I mean they are the judiciary there are plenty there sitting just that is the judiciary but but\nAnd and again I think their decision was was was correct with regard\nTo the senior status judges I don't think they should have intervened into the rules of the house but they did because they were provided with the opportunity now the house should have stood up and took up for itself they knew what was in that brief they they should have stood up I Do kind of hope that the Supreme Court\nWill give the house and opportunity to come in and defend itself because quite frankly I I don't think that the the rules of the house whether they're followed or not is a judicial matter it's purely a legislative matter under the\n... it's it's a ... it's a ... is it the legislative matter under the articles under the constitutional provision the impeachment how does the judiciary determined that the legislature is not following his roles\nWell again because they were given the opportunity and and that doesn't mean it's right or wrong but they are the final say of the law on that land we have to respect the rule of law I don't agree with all the decisions they made when they let Dan you all switch parties\nAt at the last minute and the governor then a point to the party he switched to I didn't agree with that but you don't stand up and say look they're wrong they've done this in the self serving fashion you got to accept\n\nToday's sock on what you buy mine were delivering better health for better West Virginia is no job it is our mission\nWest Virginia's ... congressional district race this is an open seat after Evan Jenkins the gum and congressman decided to run for the Republican nomination for the Senate guy beat Richard Jetta state senator a Democrat got in there\nAs I did Carol Miller she's the Republican nominee a current member of the house of delegates what's the latest in this race Monmouth University polling Institute has numbers out and for those or let's go to Patrick Murray Patrick Murray is director of Monmouth University polling Institute and joins us on ... Patrick good morning how are you sir\nHey how's it going great thank you for coming on or what are your numbers\nYet what we're finding um that I care more has a lead a you know it's a anywhere from a two points a three point or somewhere and they're pretty um consistent\nAbout when we pulled this race a few months ago\nA ... a jet it was actually in the lead he had about a six point lead back then and what we've been finding is that Republicans have been basically coming home or that they then coming back to the flock as where since uh Labor Day but the fact that this race even close and the district that\nDonald Trump won by fifty points and continues to be very popular says a lot about the individual level of uh although Jetta and the fact that these same voters who voted for Donald Trump because they didn't feel that the establishment politicians were listening to the voice\nAre still feeling that way and for a lot of them oh Jetta is the better choice\nYou know it's interesting 'cause oh Jetta is kind of custom that mold is he runs as a populist opinionated a kind of every man sort of appeal so uh yeah he is running pretty strongly\nA Trump as you said is very popular in the third district sixty three percent approval rating what we ask all the time about this so Patrick\nHow much of that translates to a vote for Miller or any Republican in an off year election\n[noise] ah it it generally helps I mean it it it because Donald Trump has become the Republican Party that you liked Donald Trump\nYou are definitely going to vote a Republican and it says voters who don't particularly like Donald Trump I'm so in other races that we've been polling you know this this number has been a much lower in terms of Trump's popularity is just above ... percent below fifty percent uh\nThat's why we see a lot more competitive races this is a race where Donald Trump's popularity isn't\nJust ... just automatically going\nTo the Republican it's you've got to prove yourself I'm In this district you've got to show that that\nBasically that you you're going to deliver in the same way you're going to go down to Washington all you're going to you know a kick some things around a you know upset the establishment upset the those politicians have been playing games or in order to get your voice heard and that's that's what this racist boiling down to right now\nPatrick merged with the director of the Monmouth University polling Institute numbers out on the ... race and Miller up by three that's pretty much within the margin of error this is interesting to Patrick\nYou asked the question is your general impression that Carol Miller favorable or unfavorable to have an opinion uh thirty two percent have no opinion without Jetta twenty nine percent have no opinion so that tells you that uh there's there's still a lot of unknown out there\nAre a and B that could change here we've got three weeks when people were finally a lot of people were ... maybe just beginning to tune in to the ... right\nYeah a lot of a a a lot of that opinion is neutral I mean that just say you know I really I'm not sure whether I formed an opinion that I heard a lot about them but I just don't know\nYou know what I feel about them but we we asked a couple of other question trying to kind of get out you know who shares your values and on that question\nAre we find that Mueller has a slight edge you know thirty nine percent say that she shares of Alice thirty six percent say Jetta share their values but then when we ask a different question which is who understand your day to day concerns that's where the Jetta actually has a distinct advantage forty eight percent say he shares their concerns just thirty four percent say that he doesn't\nBut when we asked about Miller it's kind of an even split just forty percent say she does forty two percent say she does not so you know she Miller wins on kind of these concerns that a lot of folks have whether it's about guns or abortion those kind of values and a type of voters were Jetta wins on the economic voters\nWho's to say I'm putting you know that my bread and butter issues ahead of everything else is at this\nLecture Patrick did did you all get anything on voter intensity because I still in the third district even though it's red or when you look at the Trump numbers and the last couple of congressional races you still have more to a lot more Democrats than Republicans so do you have anything to indicate voter intensity\n[noise] yeah I mean ... there's a lot of historical Democrats there and it's not too long ago and finally she cycles go ... when this district was actually represented by Democrats are but what we find is that when we look you know Seventy three percent said they had a lot of interest in this race\nI'm Seventy percent say it's important to to vote in this race because of how they feel that the president you know those numbers are actually a little lower than in the other hand you know when it's cold I think about Fifteen house races now across the country and so those numbers are actually lower relatively speaking ... the feeling they're not that intense terms of going out to vote [noise]\nAh you know you really have to uh to uh make voters understand that you know the vote matters that that something is actually going to change I think that's a big indication here right now is that um you don't have\nThe kind of enthusiasm on one side or the other that's making some of these other races competitive it's actually a lack of enthusiasm that that's making this race competitive it's kind of defense that nobody listens to us ... and ... and and both candidates have to go out there and convince a their constituents out there this is the time that that they will make a difference\nMetric memories with is director of Monmouth University polling Institute new numbers out in the west Virginia three raised do Jetta and Miller and veteran I may have buried the lead you are because you also asked about the mansion Marcy race in the third you know I'm again so jealous about those numbers\nSure of the last time we pulled from a district real fickle uphold the rest of the the state we didn't do it this time but uh we found that ... had by twenty points in this this and he was that's a that's a bigger league for him and then he had back in June when it was about fourteen points\nAre and that was a high double digits statewide leave so that you know these the numbers there's two things that are interesting is that was one and said Jess if he's got ... point lead in third district that means he's winning the state of fairly handily or and or the other thing is why his lead has increased because of his kind of name brand\nAs it you know he's a Democrat who remind these voters of of the kind of Democrat that they used to vote for 'em or Jetta has been actually slipping even though oh jet I still have that appeal\nHe just doesn't have a the kind of long term a history as both a senator and governor mansion has ah that that these people feel comfortable with some of them still introducing himself to a lot of voters in his district or to make them feel comfortable with him at the kind of Democrat\nThat they remember or to go for a lot like Manchester mansion has some coke tales but they're not quite long enough right now or to bring it over the finish line with an\nInteresting interesting and then more honesty if Morsi were here I Know what he would say because we've been companies race closely he was of course questionable but he would also say that that's not his strong students on the west Virginia and he'd talk more about the eastern panhandle where he is where he lives and there's a lot of Republicans eastern panhandle a Republican in other parts of the state and\nUm [noise] just to just that I just pointed out so\nWell no there's no question that if he was down by ten points and in this district then I'd say you know this is going to be a close race statewide like the fact that he's down by twenty that's just too much of the gap to make up in the rest of the ... and the rest of the state\nMetric Murray director the mom at the University Polling Institute Patrick we appreciate a good to talk to you and thank you for coming on\nHey my pleasure out already thinking about like\nWhen I entered seven six five eight to five five seven six five Ga okay Mike in Martin's Berg on the Supreme Court Mike what he got force\nMike you with us yeah they might go ahead Supreme Court you're up All right well now that\nSaid that we pay for the senior status judges over payment of it at a a unconstitutional I guess he forgot to read articles a section seven second paragraph which states\nJustices judges and not districts shall receive the salaries fixed by law last I checked West Virginia legislature makes the law\nSo that that the Syrian first of all is is is absolutely outrageous it basically said every statute regarding salaries can be now set by the Supreme Court which contradicts the part of article ... section seven I just read you\nWhere do you think the house should do\nBefore you know first of all you know he said that the house for dinner and being you know most of the arguments that Margaret worker you made or things that were down in the house why didn't she name the house because the Senate\nIn fact and and an eight dollar is they used to the court used uh the nut rolls of appellate procedure sixteen ... against the Senate because uh sixteen he basically says if you don't address thanks brought on by the petition or in this case work and then you admit that they're true", "year": "2018", "show_name": "MetroNews TalkLine", "city":
