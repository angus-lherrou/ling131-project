say it again\nUm [noise] as you know I Can't talk at all about law free right now or that's something I've been forbidden to do by the judge because I was a witness all witnesses are forbidden so I Can't get into that but just generally what I Will say is that\nThey were the boss they did decide they want it but they wanted and they directed me to do what was done and directed other members of my staff because frankly they were much more involved than I 'cause I Know lots of people ah who worked for me were handling that more particularly um I I I'm\nYou know I I didn't necessarily feel that it was the best course but on the other hand there were lots of other things the court was doing that I was involved with that I felt was a greater importance in that I needed to focus on\nWe were doing things with that ranged from a a mental health issues to a domestic violence to uh how quickly cases are process these these were things that I felt were a more of a preoccupation for me\nAll right All right thank you I'm I'm you know this he's um\nYou know some people just have their own agenda and this guy he's used different voices and not let me just say something here because I think this is very important that I get this and I think you would concur\nDon't take the bait on this yep and Ed Koch\nYou better listen when I tell you call Mitch and you tell him not to do this don't hold a show on Monday then then you become the issue ... let the let the let\nThe public\nHave their own contempt for this\nUm and this is why\nThat people have contempt for lawyers and they especially have contempt for lawyers with robes I don't care how well their decision to written and I learned this from the people that call this show and the people to stop me on the street\nAnd the people that\nTell me how angry they are\nAnd the person that's produced in his show back there I learned from just regular people understand that people that are a lot smarter than me\nHave written this decision and two of them I like to consider friends of mine but\nI mean people are outraged and you know how arrogant pay you workman is and and she has um she won\nAnd uh one this round but

legal examples in this in this uh\nOpinion and you can kind of just browse through those to get to the meat of it but the descent as much brief are unclear since like nine pages on the opinion sixty nine pages\nIs that it was only ...\nAnd ... wrote a wonderful descent I I guess they read it together but it's absolutely as clear as can be about the possible remedy for the legislature they need to look hard at that they need to look hard at how they can go back and proceed again\nAnd I don't and and and then on the opinion itself says they are the sole and teacher so I think that that gives them the ability to if they wish to go back and have a ...\nHere's what I I don't think that every do I think they ought to put this thing behind him and I think let us change the constitution and then let us do it again and make the Supreme Court live by the same laws of the rest of us do\nWill controller spending but if they say that they want don't want judges to make more than a certain

Court has ruled against even having it so I don't know how you move forward without a presiding officer a eye it looks like you're otherwise I'm going to show up on Monday and see what firestorm occurs but\nYou know the the interesting thing is I think well there's there's a giant pile of interesting things but I was this morning reading uh the concurring and dissenting opinion by a judge has bloom and rigor who served on the five member\nActing Supreme courts and they point out that there are aspects of this broader ruling the would invalidate the impeachment articles against justices Davis and la Brea uh so it is the effects are not just on one day's anticipated\nImpeachment trial for justice workman but everything remaining a so\nIf you if you're going to go on Amazon or wherever it\nFinds the biggest rich you could possibly come up with that is what we need right now\nYou know Brad ... and I can't even pretend to play a lawyer on our own radio here reading through this trying to sort through the the opinions from the justices as well\nThat does this end up in front of the U.S Supreme Court is that where this is head of the Senate a spokesman for the Senate yesterday said they would appeal this does this get all the way to DC it's that's where we are going\nYeah I'm like you I mean that's that's the stated intention or you know the U.S Supreme Court\nCan choose to listen to your or not so I I I'm not sure what the likelihood is of getting a U.S Supreme Court decision um or or opinion or or having the more you in a you know this this dissenting incurring opinion that I just reference\nFrom judges bloom and rigor um makes the point that\nIn a grand jury proceeding if there is an error or you could go back in ... at the grand jury can take a look at it again\nOr they are drawing parallels with the house of delegates role here and they're saying that that the house of delegates could reconstitute perhaps uh the the ... in the streets should article against justice work than than possibly for the other justices still to come\nUh that's the one of course that is sort of the only compensate\nYou will should've kept a better on my own on all the rest of you are and so anyway the bottom line is these guys are suggesting one path\nIf the if the legislature wants to reconsider matters is is almost to start over with the house of delegates reward things reconstitute the basis of the allegations and move forward from there and to me that that puts things in your own hands rather than\nRelying on the U.S Supreme Court to take an interest and so I think that maybe you're more likely possibility the the U.S Supreme court wearing an\n... if you appeal just U.S Supreme court said oh you know your joke that the U.S Senate is the most deliberate body in the country that you you have no guarantee that this gets done any time soon so if you really want to drag this thing out you know send it up to the U.S Supreme Court and we can be talking about this brand for for a very very long time\nFor the addition of a justice Kavanaugh on the U.S Supreme Court it could bring all of our controversies go national and state wide all home to the same easy to access all in all encompassing controversy\nHey you know just when you think you've seen everything Brad West Virginia where we're able to just go one more step into a well hang on a second let's go down this road so\nA lot of I mean a lot of lingering impacts you are based on what happens with chief justice workman Allen Law freeze trial still uh you know kind of in a standby mode waiting for the jury to come back so a lot can happen between now and a dinner time tonight bread\nYou know I mean it it could be amazing if a justice Laufer used convicted but his impeachment if no one [laughter] you know ah but you know\nString have stranger things happened in western over the last few months [laughter] but I don't you think that everything is getting back to normal that's just not the case\nAll right what do you do all day and brand what what do you do write you know until the jury comes back and it just a shame you hang out at the mall what are you doing\nYou know I I I Am at the mall at the moment but I've got to get to the courthouse because\nThere's no guarantee that if a verdict comes in any one will bother to tell us\nIf we're not right there so we the media people\nUh either we're right outside the federal courthouse yesterday that was the case of some of the TV broadcasters or in my case and in the case of several others we just kind of sequestered

anchor desk I'm Shawn Johnson\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter news talk blind resented in part by Milan where delivering better health for better West Virginia isn't our job it is our mission ... gone today off I'm Dave Wilson filling in\nThe sitting justices acting as the state Supreme Court issue in the ruling yesterday that the impeachment trial of justice Margaret workman\nPutting a legislative and judicial branch of West Virginia state government that puts them in direct conflict\nIn the uh opinion side of this case is not about whether or not justice of the Supreme Court of appeals West Virginia can or should be impeached but rather is about the fact\nThat to do so it must be done correctly and constitutionally within due process Mark Williams is the attorney for justice Margaret workman and mark joins us on metro news talk longer morning mark\nMorning Dave how are you\nAre doing well uh I Would expect you are doing pretty well today after that ruling yesterday were you surprised by the ruling handed down by the sitting Supreme Court\nWell when we were surprised by the timing um we didn't have any indication that they were going to actually decide this on the merits\nUm but yeah there was a pending motion to stay the trial that set for Monday and we frankly I thought they might rule on that first and then address the merits after the fact that apparently the the court had already decided that they were prepared to rule I'm On the whole thing which\nI'm you know it was great to get a a detailed opinion a lengthy opinion\nAlong with the concurrence isn't sense that sort of set up the court's thinking it's always good to\nTo get that and get those issues which get those issues resolved\nIt helped walk me through this year we're all trying to kind of figure this out together obviously all of this unprecedented West Virginia or the ruling issued Thursday states the allegations in the three articles of impeachment against workman violate the separation of the separation of powers doctrine how does that violates separation of powers\nWest Virginia is unique in that it has a provision in the constitution in fact we're the we're the only state that has this provision that says that the judiciary\nOr the judicial branch has exclusive authority over their own budget and that the executive with and the legislative branches cannot impacted in any way um that was that's been in in in our constitution for decades and like I said it's unique but\nOver the years that has been interpreted to say that\nThat prohibits any infringement on the spending power the judiciary by the executive or the legislative branch\nAnd the ... the position that we argued in the position that court adopted was that by attempting to impeach these\nA chief justice workman specifically since she was our client on the basis that spending was done that they disagreed with violates that provision now\nWest Virginia also has a provision in our constitution that says there is a clear separation of powers and that none of the other branches can infringe upon\nThe actions of another branch so not only on the spending powers but also like\nThe ability to regulate the judicial conduct of judges the court found that our arguments were correct that those violates separation of powers in the ... could not be a basis for impeachment\nIn the articles in question involved the over payment of senior status judges and allegations of failing to implement\nAdministrative policies and procedures and talking to Mark Williams the attorneys for chief justice Margaret work in the market goes back to something I had talked about earlier was when you get into these articles of impeachment dealing with the payment of senior status judges and how much you paid for furniture and all this\nKind of gets into that area of maybe we don't like how you spend some money but there doesn't seem to be anything in the constitution that could have prevented the legislature from stopping you from spending the money in that fashion is that I Know it's kind of an oversimplification of the argument but it's a ton of what it boils back to\nKnow I mean you're you're exactly right I mean we can all have a conversation about whether or not it was appropriate for the spending that took place what is without question however is that it was absolutely illegal and it was within their authority the court's authority\nOr to make to to spend that money in that way so what you what the the the house was trying to do was impeach justices for actions which they have to acknowledge\nWere legal and within their constitutional authority and so it's not it shouldn't be surprising that a court would say you can't form and you can impeach somebody\nFor conduct which is clearly within their constitutional authority\nWhat happens next market in the Senate has said that it wants to go ahead and convened Monday morning at nine o'clock as the quarter impeachment as scheduled it can it go ahead and convene as according to teach me even after this ruling on Monday\nIn a word no they cannot\nEr and it is very disturbing to me as a a a practicing lawyer in this state that there would be the position that the position that the Senate would be that notwithstanding the fact that a court has said that this impeachment trial cannot go forward that they are still taking the position\nThat they're going to ignore an order\nOf the highest court in this state and proceed with an impeachment trial now they've also said that they intend to appeal it to the U.S Supreme Court which is their right that would be the the the only place that they could go to\nTo get the appellate review of this decision um and my understanding is there going to seek an emergency stay from the Supreme Court\nAbout that and and we'll see if that gets filed\nUm it is unlikely that any decision on that would occur before Monday first of all it's it is highly unlikely that the Supreme Court would ever look at this case um the the Supreme Court takes a a very small percentage of the cases that come before it\nAh and I I think the likelihood that this would end up being reviewed by the Supreme Court is extremely rare\nOr so the bottom line is they cannot go forward with this trial on Monday and and at some point some lawyers are going to have to explain to the Senate leadership what it means when you take the position that you're going to violate a court order\nIs it possible we end up back at square one mark and start this whole process over again is that a possibility\n[noise] well if you read the uh the concurrence I think you made reference to this uh in the last half hour if you read the concurrence I'm from a judge bloom and judge rieger\nThey indicate that that there is a possibility that at least one of the articles article fourteen could be amended\n'em to comply with that has drafted it's improper but it could be amended to comply with a constitutional norms and and that's frankly a position that we took in this proceeding that\nThat by adding the the the judicial cannons component to the end of article fourteen that's what made it invalid or the house had the option of not including that in article fourteen and and decided to leave it in\nOf course that's going to require the house to reconvene house as a journey signing died so the governor is going to have to call them back into special session to do that they would have to then pass a new article of impeachment against\nChief justice workman or one of the other justices or and you know the timing is is in question because frankly you you're gonna have a new legislature that he's convening after the election in November\nSo there are a lot of uncertainties there so I guess to answer your question is it possible that they could fix some of this they could fix some of it but it's going to require a lot of things to fall into place that I'm not sure a possible\nMark Williams the attorney representing Supreme Court justice Margaret work than mark we appreciate the insight\nThank you David\n... eight hundred seven six five to eight hundred

know the institutions do they do martial ... they are the driving force\nFor the state's economy\nSo we've got to figure this out in in again continue to provide the resources needed because you know WB Marshall and the other regional institutions and said\nYou know that's where our workers are going to come from that's where ... and we'll talk about aerospace here in just a moment I you know that's where your aerospace engineers are going to come from and where one is that we want to cultivate these people and we want to keep 'em once we've cultivated them\nWe do and I think we've got to come up with creative ideas to provide incentives for students to stay in the state we also need to provide incentives to create jobs\nSo I think if we can create more jobs and then get our students to stay in the state we can eventually start seeing a increase in the state's population which I think would be excellent uh but I think we need more jobs for those students that are graduating I think about half of my graduates leave the state\nAnd I think it's more than half of WB use graduates leave the state each year so you know we've got a tremendous a brain drain that's going on that we've got to find a way to keep those uh those highly educated and talented students in the state\nAnd help them uh see that they can contribute to the success of the state and the success of the citizens\nIn the state along those lines as we switch gears a little bit there's an aerospace conference coming up next week in hunting yeah Marshall is going to be involved you don't think about West Virginia and aerospace or at least I don't put the two and two together very often but we're talking about keeping people here we're talking about you know writing these jobs\nThere's opportunities there how's Marshall involved with this aerospace conference next week\nWhile we're one of the sponsors of the Appalachian next generation aerospace conference that it's going to be held on the Eighteenth and Huntington um we've got the big Sandy arena are reserved and we've invited\nSome of the major aerospace companies in as well as the suppliers and some small companies in the region that are potential suppliers or current suppliers a Brady industries is locating\nAn aluminum a facility uh you know nearby and we see the tri state region of Ohio Kentucky and west or in West Virginia is having a tremendous potential to attract an aerospace a cluster here in this part of the state\nOr we think that incentives could be put in place to really boost stance and a ... pie is ah promoting the aerospace industry and we're excited to be a partner with them\nOr to help look at what the potential could be because we think there's tremendous potential for the tri state region\nAnd we're again talking about keeping students in paid a lot of folks you know think to work in West Virginia you know you got to go to the minds you got to go to one of these brio labor industry and there's nothing wrong with that but there's a lot of these opportunities again with with aerospace and in other opportunities there's a lot of opportunities and the oil and gas industry that\nFolks don't
