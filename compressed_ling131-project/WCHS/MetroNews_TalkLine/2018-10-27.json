really not a lot\nYou can do because a six year old processor especially with today's video streaming and programs and games and everything else that they might be doing is still a six year old process or write\nA guy and\nThe good news is that if there is any good news is that the next week a on the thirtieth of October I mentioned it briefly during the news segment at the beginning of

have will be able to do that it's like under a thousand dollars to say yes it's nine hundred and Ninety nine dollars right a little tough and so you know and your other options that you look at refer a\nAnd so if you go over to apple dot com and you have to actually ... to the bottom of the page crank and then there's an option and the second connoisseurs refurbished and and clearance\nIs that you I think you might be able to start looking and you know you look this weekend but you know as more people are buying the newer stuff they're gonna be trading and the older stuff right\nOr selling the older stuff whatever May Day and so what I live with you by refer golfer apple is that it tells you like for example what what year was this Mac book released\nAnd then if the screen has to be replaced they do that it also still comes with a one year guaranteeing warranty\nAnd so you still have that but it's still going to be you know you're still looking for you know twelve fourteen

you know here looking at and if and if people really want a Mac\nAnd you know there there really aren't a lot of options for you to acquire that Mac without spending a lot of money that you may start seeing some movement in used Macs next week because as the new one started hitting the the marketplace that may be a good time to pick up an older model\nOf but I think at this point if you don't have unfortunately twenty two hundred bucks to spend twenty five hundred bucks to spend on two new max or even to decent refer max than your only option at that point is to start looking at a really good windows based a\nLaptop that you can pick up as I mentioned like four or five hundred bucks sorry I didn't have better news for your cranking things for your call today [noise]\nAll right let's talk

and\nThen my husband and I like to look at things on the Internet and then I have another one that has an eye pad he likes to get games and it's just to the point where I was just I'm frustrated so I was wondering if a weed boost for the home it's a cell phone signal booster that I've looked\nAt and you plug it into one of the house and plug it into the other end of the house and I was just wondering if something like that would work for us\n[noise] no [noise] no [noise] um\nIt's all it's doing at that point is it's boosting the signal okay and\nSo it's amplifying the signal so the whole idea is that if you don't have decent cellular coverage is that you can buy this booster and then instead of having like three bars you might have for bars okay\nOoh ah and it does it by amplifying the connection with than a certain area around you okay [noise] ah okay so so that's not gonna help you um\nI assume that you this is the only option\n[noise] well I'm that's why I'm calling you because it it's to the point where we've gone over to a friend's house the Internet to uh I teach\nWhat you do what she 'cause you know it's you know you can get fifty gigs but if you're blowing through fifth you know Fifteen gigs in four hours I mean what's the sense right I mean you write\nThat ah\nThere's always satellite and\nYeah we've try well we've heard our neighbors to gripe about

you won one who wants to plug in their phone anymore when you just lay it down and that bad boys charging well there's a certain standard that you need to know that to look out for and which one to have her and tell you more about that\nAnd before we go back to all of your phone calls answered I we're going back and forth in some text messages this past week because I\nI sent you something that I thought was really truly funny\nAnd every once in a while you'll send me something funny and I'll send you something funny and I said you know what do you think about that this was a tweet that kind of sets the Internet on fire [noise] as er name is Alyssa Alyssa and I don't want to miss quote her 'cause\nThere are some lakes in there that I don't want them to be missed adds context or maybe it's just the Generation Z in Maine but how do people burn CDs\nLike how do you get a blank CD and just put songs on it\nAnd the Internet went crazy like how did that ever where did the blank CDs come from first of all I'm very impressed that she tweeted the lake she didn't take it out she put like like how they do this like so that she is a a generation Z or\nWhich they were born from the mid nineties to them in two thousand Ninety seven is that the starting point for crow is it yeah I mean what is it is a two thousand five two thousand seven then or until we're an end to\nThousands OK rise so\nGenerate millennials or anyone in Ninety six and the millennials were the ones that were responding to this thing in mind that old than a generation already has moved past all of my technology when one person responded with which we just ... I'm a billion years old\nAnd they were probably thirties [laughter] gee now I'm not I'm all in you\nKnow Mr by year I was born in Nineteen\nEight I'm not one either because I Do [laughter] maybe three but but see in my son is a gyms ear right into it but he would know how to burn a CD because of who is mom it yes and and dad as we've we've made CDs and he's been down in the studio and\nThings like that but then it may it got me thinking about other things that millennials and\nGuaranteed generations ears are not going to understand or ever use correct one of the first things that I think would be is interesting and my son is experiencing this right now\nIs television commercials my son watches everything on YouTube right he doesn't know what cable television is it's all YouTube but then we hook up the antenna and we're going to watch Sunday Night Football\nAnd it goes to commercial things like what's going on here so we just kept those can we've asked for this you know what that's a problem I mean I mean you 'cause you're you're absolutely right because in in you\nHe has never really had that the a commercial or if he doesn't see a commercial that only fists\nIn seconds yes there is what I have many cars there is a skipped right once he watches five seconds of it right\nI'm sure if I did when I was at my sister's on this past week and I was watching TV my mom I'm like and I'm sitting there going\nHow do you fast forward [laughter] when she's my father is but she goes they don't have that here they don't have a WPN and you can't skip the commercial I'm like oh my gosh how are they living what is going on\nBut see with us it was just a convenience that's nice let's let's let's DVR something and skip the commercials for the younger generations it's a give and\nAnother thing I don't understand about my son is he'll say I want to watch a movie and you know renting it is I bet we have a sixty five inch television in our living I'm not bragging it's huge he doesn't want to watch it he wants to in his lap and his hand on a small little AIPAC\nSo interesting to me and you know what though\nThat it is fascinating and and as he gets older you'll see different technologies and how they're using it\nVersus how you might use that I'm I'm a bigger I mean I'm a huge TV and I see those eighty five inches but they have a ... drew it over the now in generation okay they're they're not really watching YouTube anymore or do you do yeah uh how are they getting their entertainment that\nVideos on Instagram Snapchat\nBut you're not going to find an illusion program there\nAre they you know what they he watch all the stores are watching some boxing match on YouTube okay so if it's an event\nThey'll go to YouTube yes but if it's you know no\nLonger they sharing viral video and I think we've talked about this for like each channel having its own app and so with my ... my my ... my inlaws have cable so they've given my son their passwords so he can look at the Disney Channel and stuff like that on his lap\nHe has no interest he doesn't want to Bob around from apt now so I don't I mean these companies issues companies are coming out with their own apps but it's not going to work well you know and speaking of television member Saturday morning cartoons oh of course it was the bad I Know isn't that humid\nI just remember being a kid Saturday morning would come and you sit in front of the time and I'm like and I would have my bowl of cereal\nAnd the night before when the new television when it come out like right when school started in September the night before the height of the preview show and they would preview all the new commercials that were going to I mean the new cartoons that were going to happen tomorrow morning that was the best what was your favorite\nThunder kept the I've loved I'm Tom and Jerry from your favor I did and and the road runner those roles cool it did but then there's also a mighty mouse heckle in Jekyll\nNumb under cats was was ... has okay the other thing that they don't know about is the pet rock what is it that rock okay it was this phenomena\nWhere this guy had a rock he got rocks and he put it in a box any soldier the rock which just rock just rock forget normal rock yes nothing special right Eddie sold you the rock and the guy made like two million dollars selling rocks\nSitting by a box with a rock and yeah so I'm waiting for the punch line here though there was a total fat okay\nYou know as a matter of fact when I ... and I know you've heard me tell a story that when I was trying to syndicated show I called this guy CBS his name was Frank Murphy Hi Frank and casual listening and Frank told me that that a show about computers in the Internet would never work because it was going to be a fad a fad like the pet rock [laughter] and I'll never forget that 'cause he said it was like a\nPet ... for my iPhone is just about rock sitting in my pocket speaking of the phone when's the last time you used a pay phone I don't even know what do they even exist anymore or\nI saw them in Great Britain okay summer\nNo I I've been a long time and so I was standing there it's actually quite funny as I'm standing there like in front of the phone booth where there's a phone you know like in front of the phone booth were inside there's a pay phone and were you on your phone no and I was just standing there like in towards like Hi okay and in plus out laughing\nAnd I said what are you laughing at okay behind me there were all these naked women things like on the phone booth like but their phone numbers they found a use for the phone booths exactly which is also the phone book\nBut it isn't that something that's crazy yeah the phone book or the telephone operator yes the telephone technology for the longest time did not change and now we just fast forward and when when did the iPhone come out and years ago two thousand seven\nThat was ten years prior to that it was fifty years the same old phone okay did you have an Atari twenty six hundred yeah\nHow ... we're all generations video games game boys yes how to game boy I say go CD game this generation than anything about that no cars on their parents' phone\nIf they don't know anything about a road atlas like a map map yeah no no that would have has good right yeah okay\nI've never I never learned how to fold up a map and I I don't think I'm gonna try now\nOkay America Online now you know I started the computer section at AOL years and years and years ago do you remember when everywhere everywhere you turn around that somebody put an AOL disk and the cereal box that you went to store it was everywhere that was really a genius marketing right there\nBecause how they did that behind the scenes\nThat and I can I can talk about it now I'm sure I'm not under any more nondisclosure agreement says that we'll find out Tuesday [laughter] that with AOL is that if you gave a desk\nSometimes you'd make ten dollars at that person is that if that person use your desk to sign up for AOL you just made ten bucks\nSo we always got them from another place that doesn't exist anymore and that was blockbuster video so you're telling me when we got our Fifteen hundred free hours of AOL's blockbuster was making my yes and then they would make money every single month I mean oh wow yeah it was really crazy for a while", "show_name": "MetroNews TalkLine", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "27"}
