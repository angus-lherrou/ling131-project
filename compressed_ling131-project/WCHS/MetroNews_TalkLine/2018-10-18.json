there now ... that's a good show a smaller as opposed to follow his report or after the election and a\nSort of interesting to see what that is the interesting thing I think about this book is it there's fifty pages but not\nSo everything is very nicely footnote it and I think if people read it\nWe'll see where he's covering ... so I just recommended to where\nPeople who buy really what about what's going on\nThank you Harry I'm Greg Garrett and I knew him well from court t._v. he's on Fox but he's on on the weekend ... when I Do watch it so I watch Fox News from six to seven I'd recommend you all watch it every day I don't care what your political axe to grind is\nI Want to tell you that ah with the teachers' strike and with the PIN\nI'm opposed to public employee strikes just flat opposed but I don't know how else\nThey would have done what they did and accomplished what they accomplished have a nice it's a teacher and I'm more proud of her than you could ever imagine\nAnd I we I think teachers we don't give them credit for the impact that the good teachers have on our lives the the um and the memories they can give us if they are able to instill\nWell either negative or positive but I Hope and it'd be positive I never knew that the state had the money to give them a raise number one and I certainly didn't know they had to give them another race\nSo looking at that from a distance I'm just glad they have the money\nI'm not looking at it from his innocence um\nPeople are mired in the partisan\nActivities the partisan perception that are going on here and they're real and I can't say they're not because I'm mean when you come down before an election and ... to defend Mitch Carmichael I I'm\nWhat you have to remember is folks there was a pack of the same one probably the same folks that are running negative ads against a gone they ah these are folks that are um I mean they basically called I'm Mitch Carmichael guy that was so boring child molestation\nAnd they somehow were able to get Chris walkers Chris Walters in that and um they defeated Chris Walters did not defeat Mitch but he didn't win by very much he became bread and the Senate\nSo I I you know I I'm just I guess I'm looking at the good part and maybe that's going to be my advantage in retirement is to be able to just look at the outside and hope good things happen for good people and I hope we can get the a P A problem solve\nNot just for the fact that uh my little boys and their mother or in it that because I think it affects so much of our state and um\nI think that it's worthy of um of addressing in addressing in in in present time we allow these actuary deficits\nTo creep up on those and\nI I just I don't think we should\nWe think we should deal with stuff as early as we can deal with the problem is there's no political rewards for that people that run for office they won't political rewards it's it's natural\nThat is what they want but that's not what I Want folks\nCause

Virginia are so proud of that was so proud of our our expanse of\nAh protections in our own state constitution what we're talking about doing is we're talking about stripping away rights existing right from our state constitution\nThat would be the first time in the history of our state one hundred and forty six years of our constitution\nThat existing what rights would be taken away the I don't want to get politicians that power over our lives\nAre just going with this West Virginia Ailsa or a CEO you which opposes amendment one\nThat can you make a a okay if you're talking kind of in a in a in a macro sense the practical application has to do with state funding for abortion can you make a an intellectual or a moral argument as to why West Virginia should be one of the states that\nWe're taxpayer dollars are used to pay for abortions\nListen we eat when we're talking about um access to health care we're talking about um they're already so many impediments for women in West Virginia\nTo achieve or to to have reproductive freedom to have freedom over their own choices in their own lives\nWere rural state there's only one abortion clinic in our entire state\nI'm somebody should not be denied um\nThe right to make those those\nThose personal decisions merely because they're poor but as I said we need folks to understand that amendment one and if they look at the plain language of amount of wind it goes so much further it goes so much further um than than than merely funding of a um funding of abortion\nI see that and and I I tell you what I'm going to I'm going to meet you part way on that because I Do think the wording is unfortunate I Do think the wording is unclear\nAnd it could have been clearer but it does say there's nothing in the nothing in the constitution requires the funding of abortion nothing in the state constitution requires the funding of abortion ah that's pretty clear that is pretty clear and if the legislature was hiding it\nBut how to use you skip that half of the amendment so the the amendment as entitled the no constitutional right to abortion and then right and it actually says nothing in this constitution secures were protects the right to abortion things that chores or protect the right to abortion or requires the funding\nAs you know I mean Europe political you're if you're in the legislature everyday like I Am you know\nThe legislature um they introduced another proposed constitutional amendment how strong resolution one eleven that would have only applied to to uh to funding of abortion that's not what they ran he went ran with something that's extreme and dangerous something that\nSpecifically has zero protections for victims of rape or want to pregnancy puts the life of a woman at risk it's extreme it's dangerous and I do believe that West Virginians are going to vote against it on November sex\nOr does it go into a disease where the ACLU of West Virginia a you argue and stripped down it stripped us of the personal freedom to make medical decisions for all our own unique circumstances\nIt doesn't I mean a woman can still decide to have an abortion if this past a woman a woman can make that decision correct\nThat's correct as long as you know the federal courts continue to uphold that right but as you know we don't know what's going to be happening in the federal courts\nWell it's a federal court let's say let's say the federal courts um let's say the U.S Supreme Court did I don't think that well let's say the U.S Marine Corps did say no more abortion roe versus Wade overturned well didn't matter then it doesn't matter what West Virginia does I mean it it could say well everybody's wars and all the time would matter\nIt ... that actually does so if if if if I were to fall it would then fall on the states to determine whether or not to protect women's right to uh to to terminate a pregnancy\nAnd if I met one had already passed in West Virginia we have in the west Virginia criminal code the crime of abortion is a felony unenforceable because of our wonderful state constitution and because of a roe versus Wade but it is a felony on the books in West Virginia\nThat a doctor and nurse or somebody else\nWho helps with an abortion or can face up to ten years in prison\nWe can't go back to that we we we can't leave our children I don't want to leave my children a world where they have less rights than my wife and I have had\nA Joseph ... with us with ACLU West Virginia let me I'm going to have the other side on to argue with him as well and those ... I'm not just beating you up I don't argue with the other side also because you're making a you know you're making if you make a lot of valid points you book I candidly Joseph I I really think that some of the opponents\nHere are employing some scare tactics\nBecause you were there you know the intent of this the intensive this\nIs to reverse what has been a controversial decision in West Virginia for years by Margaret workman\nThat says that the state constitution that the state constitution says that you have to pay for abortions for poor women that was it somebody to decision\nAnd Tom McHugh or in his dissent in that was very clear he said that\nIt implies no limitation on authority of the state to make a value Judgement goes on to say in other words\nUm whether or not the state pays for abortion for women is a public policy decision McHugh said that in the sense that this is a public policy decision this it says in the state constitution doesn't even speak to abortion\nMargot workman's somehow figured that it does this is a public policy decision whether or not to stay for his ... just like the Hyde amendment just like the federal government said no the federal government's not going to pay for abortion for pulling what what those who support this amendment are doing is exactly what the Hyde Amendment does agree or disagree\nTotally disagree I'm Sorry to say if they wanted to ah pass a constitutional amendment to overturn penned up until they could have proposed that in fact they did house joint resolution want to let them that's exactly what it would have done\nInstead they want with Senate joint resolution twelve which is now I'm at one it goes so far beyond the funding of abortion we can't walk into the voting booth and trust the good intentions of\nOur politicians this year in five years were a hundred years from now because that's what we're voting on were voting on a fundamental change to our constitution that will remain there and it drastically expands the power the government beyond just the funding of the of of abortion as the proponents of amendment one would have you believe\nIt is dangerous and it\nDisrespect the basic value of privacy that West Virginians cherish I'm so deeply\nBut they also West Virginia's a pro life state but they also see a majority value life and a lot of West Virginians as you know don't believe that they are taxpayer dollars should be used to pay for abortion you would agree with that\nWell I don't know if that's true or not but what I Do know that's not what we're putting on on November six were voting on his changing our constitution to remove the strip away existing writes\nThe existing right not just to for a Medicaid funding for abortion but the existing right to an abortion that exists in our constitution exist in our a basic framework we're going to be\nAnd I think about it this way if if one were to pass we all have turned our constitution from a document that limits government and protects an a numerous our rights into a document that actually tells us what rights we\nDon't know if if you do that if you if you're if you passed the amendment it just says that the state constitution doesn't say anything about abortion which is a lot of global people looked at including comic you say it doesn't that the state constitution does not say anything about abortion\nBut but the but the ... I Can't there's no uh we have an existing right to abortion rights abortion care rather in West Virginia we have this existing right under our interpretation of the constitution\nUnder a court decision under a court decision interpreting the constitution\nAnd they will be stripping away and existing right there will be stripping away and existing right that is extreme that it's dangerous and when you really take a look at it when you really take a look at the end of courage people to look at the language of the amendment not just listen to me and not just listen to the other side really look at the ... the language in a minute you can see for yourself\nThere are no exceptions whatsoever you know politicians advocacy groups talking heads we try to make is a very black and white issue but when it comes down to it there's not a one size fits all decision for all women in all circumstances\nAre right we're going to leave it there yeah we're going to leave their jobs have going

... who are living better health for better West Virginia is not our job it's our mission so let's get some information about the election some numbers concerning voter registration and as such\nThis is a first I think has been doing a really good job well let me let me rephrase it such as they solve is working with the county ... county clerks are the ones that do the legwork and uh of cleaning up the voter registration rolls in West Virginia because they were clogged up with people who died move\nA cetera et cetera so\nLet's get the latest on that from a ... elections division director and sick disease office and joins us on veteran is talkline Deeks thanks for joining us how are you sir\nI'm great thanks thanks for having\nMe all sure good morning digs do decentralization office work with the county clerks to get those outdated ah erroneous duplicate registrations off the voter rolls what what is it what are the numbers\nYes you're exactly right or to date we have are just over a hundred and four thousand a duplicate registrations an active registrations for two federal elections deceased registrations felony convictions and folks who have moved\nEither out of the state or to a different county I'm taking off rolls I don't know flip side of that we've registered with the county clerk's registered over Ninety two new voter registrations\n... so it's almost a Bush really on that that's right Ninety thousand I should clarify\nSo you're not in two thousand one hundred four thousand outdated duplicate deceased and criminal felon a voter files now on criminal felons just to clarify that or even if you're a convicted felon he after you've served your time and your probation and everything else you can still vote after that\nBut if somebody is currently incarcerated they couldn't um\nAh they couldn't vote so just to be clear about that\nSo I had it in court to do this I mean the ... the thousands of names have been on there for a long time\nWell there's a a a lot of different processes and endless maintenance procedures of the courts follow 'em but generally speaking the way they do is through the voter registration system\nA which is managed by coordinator in our office and um it's the easiest way we can keep communicate with than a certain things like west that come from a data matching groups or lists that come from the division of corrections or the Social Security administration for death files\nUm than the cooks receive those lists on regular basis through a general program and um they review the voter registration finals with the names and addresses the dates of birth assessed security numbers and driver's license numbers that come through in those lists\nAnd they say if those people match up and they need to be canceled or we updated address for example um through the process is not difficult\nOn the court really just have a portal on statewide voter registration system they utilized to to do list maintenance\nIt's just time consuming ... with us elections division director sectors dates August\nMac Warner is a Republican we tend to see everything in West Virginia through apolitical prism why should we be assured if we can be assured that you all did that the court because it isn't a fair and equitable way and didn't target Democrats or Republicans are independence or whatever\nBecause the nature of list maintenance and apolitical or it is all data the county clerk's themselves are various political affiliations most Republican or Democrat or an independent\nAnd them no matter what the secretary of state's office and then ultimately they're the ones that look at the record themselves and make the determination whether or not they're going to keep someone on the rolls because the data doesn't look like it matches or if they're going to cancel someone from the old because it does match\nIn doing so have you disenfranchised voters anybody's going to show up at the polls on the general election day said wait a minute I I'm coming to vote and I'm not on the registration anymore what happened\nI'm very confident that's not the case um we do a very good job in our county clerks to a very good job and the groups that we work with like the electronic registration Information Center which is a nationally renowned\nA group for data matching a there's a very good job of looking at the data and the variables that we use or not a small number we're talking first mental last name suffix date of birth driver's license number a sense of security number\nThe only instance\nThe only instance of any person that we're aware of that has actually been taken off the rolls that shouldn't have been was the name that matched first name last name eight of birth and last for Social Security number I'm like that's the one at\nA trillion chance that the only name that we've heard of anybody being taken off and you know what we're able to get them right back on the rolls before the election and it wasn't a problem\nSo if and there's a lot of misinformation out there about people claiming to be taken off the rolls after using the w._b. dot com look up portal [noise] um every single person we talked to we were able to figure out what the issue was in Ninety nine percent of the time the person just wasn't putting their name and right into the system you have to put your name exactly as it appears in the system or it won't come up\nSo uh if if anybody listening today has any indication that day or someone they know of I Believe they've been taken off the rolls\nHollis first don't put it on social media and claimed that they even taken off color so we can look you up because I guarantee you there's something there's an issue with the data are there's just an issue with how you putting the information into the system\nJust called five five eight six thousand that's right okay All right so somebody has some issue the Gulf of age six thousand ... elections division director ... states office did good to talk to you thanks for coming on\nBaking hobby for up to the\n... All right I was also I mean that's that's a functional issue I think it's important I was also interested in the voter registration numbers which are final final four the November general election I wrote about it today I think about this and this has been the trend one in four\nRegistered voters in West Virginia now one in four twenty six percent is neither a Democrat in or a Republican\nRunning for the vast majority of those twenty two percent have no party affiliation there are some of those of you know there's some few mountain party folk uh there's some libertarians and then there's people who are in seven or eight or nine other parties\nThat are a small party and recognized in West Virginia but twenty six percent\nWest Virginia's registered voters are neither a Democrat nor a Republican and we've seen a steady rise of independent voters in West Virginia\nWhich used to be just a handful I say independent no party affiliation I kind of use them as the same thing and they might not be exactly the same thing but you get my drift but I'm Twenty years ago there were no independence right or very few very few but when a couple of things changed one was when the ...\nAt the Republican Party democratic Republican Party both open their primaries do not affiliated to voters to independent voters that meant that independent voters could participate in the primary and not be a member of that party\nSo you didn't have to be a Republican voting Republican primary or same for the Democratic primary so there was not as much emphasis joined the party also and uh ... said this he wrote about it as well and I think he makes a good point he says so many voters he talked about how parties used to have the big tent philosophy\nAnd it was a big head it kind of had all comers and welcome people with all kinds of different views and there was some general principles in there but it was more of a big jet but now\nStar what rights for many voters so many voters feel alienated these days not because the parties have become more polarized but because the parties have become so homogeneous\nStarbucks says people have tangled oftentimes seemingly contradictory views\nAnd seldom fit into narrow ideological silos and that's the parties have become more ideological it has deep in the sense of alienation for many that's really well set because some of us do have conflicts use\n... not all of us are checked the box Democrats or check the box Republican some of us are okay but others of us have more contradictory views\nWell I I I support this button and so much on that and and and then as the parties have become increasingly ideological then it's harder for a lot of people to fit into those parties also with the rise of social media\nAnd multiple media outlets\nAnd with the rise of candidates running as individual is more than members of a party I mean look at the science you see now not too many years ago and you also see some but not too many years ago you would see a name\nAnd then he'd say Democrat mansion Democrat Marcy Republican maybe he's got some sounds like that or ... years ago it'd be Byrd Democrats arch Moore Republican [noise] and now you just see signs for names\nFor the most part I mean it's the candidates are running as candidates they're not running as much as representatives of a particular party and in terms of Democrats in West Virginia I mean Joe mansion you wish you'd be hard pressed to know what if you if you just landed from Mars you'd be hard pressed to know what party belongs to\nThese really define that party identification meanwhile and this is a challenge for the Democratic party in West Virginia twenty I look back twenty four years ago twenty four years ago Roberts the bird got sixty nine percent of a\nNow I Love it to be with you\nI I definitely get you have it as well you know there's a in fact I'm you know the are going to you have is that we don't understand it entirely endowed that's always

they have a bunch of Republicans come out and support you and and when you're running as a Democrat for reelection but\nBut I think more broadly it's just you know this is what Joe Manchin does is it part is history this is nothing new uh you know when I first got up there and looking around and seeing what was happening and and try to find people willing to do that Joe mansion was the first one through the door and mark\nMcKinnon is with this is a Republican political advisor was a media consultant cofounder of No Labels\nAn organization dedicated to bipartisanship and political problem

is there is bipartisanship I mean\nIs that even possible though and I look you can get bipartisanship usually on a on a highway bill or on a opioid bill but what about the what about the other stuff

issues like that yeah security entitlement reforms immigration the really hot issue yeah what you got to start with the low hanging fruit you got to show willingness to build trust on some of the some of the easier issues and once you do that it's a lot easier to tackle the tough ones\nAre and so but you start building a record and you start building trust across the aisle that how when we have the really tough ones you know people that the Republicans are going to turn to to help figure this out and Democrats to going to say well Joe matches been fighting these fights and he's urging trust

T. and joins us on veterans talk on the morning or\nHow are you there on it how bad are these scores well\nScott ... could you do me if I'm Sorry could you if you're on speaker phone way would you mind picking up the phone will just be able to hear a clear and I want to make sure your ...\nOkay [noise]\nThey are Yes sir Yes sir how bad are these scores\nWell as you said a gas mask off of a work they've been fourteen years of the decrease the fear by point too I'm In West Virginia they've only decreased by quite wrong but there still are troubling it indicates that of our for our\nIt is nationally are prepared to call a proper work\nUm in in West Virginia it's about three out of college students compared to the college level work now the good the good news I Would say in mathematics is that students who take more rigorous courses knew better so in West Virginia students who took areas of them out of high school at least three years\nOr more than a third of them are ... and ... for years more than half of them is called truck\n[laughter] I'm a student who take less than three years less than one out of the kind of college ready so the messages to take multiple years have now more rigorous man ... ... ... clearly are much better prepared for college\nBut you know ... we're not worried about and I'm not yelling at you as ... we're not we're not worried about that those kids that are taken three and four years and that was you know what they're going to be fine they're going to be ready\nWe're ... we're concerned about the vast majority of those uh high school students who aren't taking a lot of math or aren't grass I mean the concepts they and they then they go to college and as you said only one engine has its gills and they're ... they're not college ready they're not going to that those are the ones we're worried about\n... great but it it we can't begin worrying about students in eleventh grade\nOr it's going to be a little bit late and so what we really want to do I'm\nOne of the ... not it's just not that a teacher but it's also more rigorous teaching in more rigorous cautious and beginning students early on so that they're exposed to algebra not ninth grade but maybe in eighth grade or seventh grade and so they have the skills earlier and they can move through the whole line of math\nGiven given the the high skilled workplaces that we're talking about students who are taking only three years of medical less than three years of math are not going to be prepared for college and career of today and probably even less so in ten years from now\nJeeze Lincoln was with his senior leader in research with a seat gee on these are college entrance exam scores which are not good particularly in math\nOr in thirty five percent of graduates met ... and these are the ones that are planning to go to college because they took the test a thirty five percent of graduates met none of the for ACT benchmarks that determine college readiness in subject areas\nThat's that's what you what your explanation or take on that what's what's the significance of that\nWhole again um while up while we can't point to all the all the all the causes of of scores but with changes in the last uh last year last year we actually had a pretty high water mark in most areas\nOf but this year it's gone down a little bit so there are getting your fluctuations and so we can get overly excited about a one year change\nBut dramatically but the trend we had fought over a number of years been slightly more improvement you call a threatening us and this is going to wake up call those things are kind of reached a baseline and they're not going in the direction we'd like I'm In West Virginia one one piece of well maybe it's good news but it's also a how can induce\nSix out of ten students in West Virginia tell us that they're interested in stem that significantly more than ... whether it's far out of her\nSo West Virginia we've got six out of ten students who are interested in cutting in stem where\nThe technology science or engineering were jobs will be found in the future the bad news is only ... percent of West Virginia students have the skills to succeed in stem courses I met the college readiness benchmark because stump certainly requires more difficult higher\nLevel math science technology costs us so I think there's interest\nIn this desire to move in there but I think what really got to do this we've got to work with curriculum should students how the hell exposed to look courses in middle school and up elementary school so they can\nEnroll in a in more advanced science and math and technology costs just as they get through high school and that's one way to get the workforce but we need the twenty first century\nI that's a really good point and we have changed mass standards in West Virginia I think I think these high school juniors and seniors are taking that ACT they've been through three different sets of mass Sanders I mean we've been all over the place and we're trying to find ... signed some\nConsistency there as elaborate on this Wayne is that one of the jokes back in journalism school was wearing journalism because we can't do math but but I mean you have to have these scams skills today for many of the jobs correct me that's where that's where the broad opportunities are in many cases\nWhere you really do and could be a dentist honestly to be illiterate citizen in the U.S\nUnique you don't need to know algebra possibly geometry\nBut you need to be able to reach the historical information quantitative information on Web sites and newspapers you're exposed charts and tables and graphics and a number of the if the items in math and science of measuring\nWhether uh whether you can receive whether you can review our our ... our table and interpret it correctly and those types of skills\nEven for journalists even for English may just cost us citizens\nOn critically important that that type of data statistical data embezzlement data is being used in all kinds of jobs and quite frankly just them in a citizenship and the U.S so those are some of the skills that we've got to really talk to all students even if they decide that never taken a math class in college\nYeah yeah I mean I was joking about myself but I mean even ... percentages I was using it yesterday I was trying to
