member of the family ...\nAs well as the God they're claiming member and I\nJust showed up a fair way to do this one from either everybody else thing and got ... spoke at the bureau of\nAvenue I was ... yeah well I was never heard are you doing things than you've heard the joke right All right hold on marriage oh go ahead\nYes I'm the last caller brought up money and finances and so I just wanted to put this information out yes ma'am I'm the Sackler family they designed the cotton and they made twelve billion dollar\nWho are the what family is that this is the Sackler family okay so where they where they were were air with Purdue Pharma okay\nAnd where does this family live but I mean give me a that that I mean my caissons in San Francisco worst Purdue I Can't remember do you do you know I

dollars but they cost us eighty billion and medicine lost wages and legal fees for addiction\nTo stay on the phone okay I've never taken anoxic ... have taken the other stuff you know I had cancer so\nUm and I think that pain those pain drugs or miracle drugs if you don't abuse them\nBecause I remember before we had him and you probably do too and the best you can do back then was Tylenol for words which had some codeine in them\nAnd uh but a Viking in and talked to cut and if not abused\nCan really say the cancer patient a lot of pain do do do disagree I agree\nAnd I don't know what the

doctor they'd given him a hundred and fifty years\nAnd um\nIt was really good Mary Jo she just seen it it was um if they ever going to do rerun you know Neal to hear because it they had some doctor in Florida that that they got an interview with he's in prison he'll be there for the rest of his life he overprescribed it so\nWell one of the things when you're looking at addiction as you wonder how much does it take to the comic shot last fall\nOr no no and it's different to different people my it is\nBut if you have a drug designed to grab you and hook your brain faster\nAnd I understand my my

agreed with that statement in twenty eight team it was sixty percent who agreed that homosexuality shouldn't be accepted by society again it is more of a age\nUm comparison that is is I think interesting younger people are more and more accepting a and that the trend seems to be growing or as we progress through the years and that is of obviously they have been a number of states approve

news dot com they also have the pull up rex talking about\nHow folks view the government and I I guess this isn't it isn't a shock to me But West Virginians continue to be skeptical of whether the government can improve everyday life for individuals\nBut like the other poll there's there is a generational gap there on how effective the government can be a when you were talking about the government and being able to provide for and and help take care of individuals what are we finding here in West Virginia\nWell the questions are about the government's role in helping people who are on the low income category\nSpecifically ... and then we also have a question regarding efficiency\nAnd government one thing that people agree on completely\nIs a fish and sea of government we ask a statement about a view which are these two statements do you agree with most government is always almost always wasteful on the shit inefficient for government often does a better job than people give it credit for\nAnd what we see here is this is where there is agreement nearly Seventy percent both in twenty fourteen than twenty eight teams uh said that the statement and government is almost always wasteful in and and the fishing is the statement they agreed with most however when you become more specific and you start\nLooking at how the people the government's role in helping people that are in poverty that is where you see more of a split in public opinion\nFor example the two statements government aid to the poor does more harm than good by making people dependent on government assistance\nVersus the opposite point of view government aid to the poor does more good than harm because people can get out of poverty poverty until their basic needs are met\nYou say forty one percent are saying that they believe that government assistance makes people too dependent\nOn a on a government versus fifty nine percent who believe that government aid to the poor is helpful\nDeaf people meet their basic needs\nAnd actually there's been quite a ... a shift in that point of view over the last four years about a third more or more likely to agree with you ask government does have a role\nIn helping people get out of poverty until their basic nature of mess so you see changing public opinion on\nGovernment's role and I'm helping people in poverty on the other hand you do see people who believe that government\nA as a a institution is not very efficient and how they help or basically support or people in our categories of life\nYou know rest as I look at both of these polls and kind of examine the data\nIt it helps to reiterate there is a different line of thinking if you're if you're in at Eighteen and thirty four range or if you're you know thirty four and above and I'm kind of sitting in between right at the moment or hear individually but there's a different line of thinking whether your\nYou know getting started or you know your early in life where you were a year later on in these this data just helps you got reiterate that assumption that you've probably already had or at least that I already had\nWell an historic you you see that the main issue that through the decades you know as people entering the workforce or maybe finishing high school finishing college and uh there is some more of a a um I Would call it more progressive point of view as people\nUnderstandably start working and paying taxes trying to understand efficiencies of their household budget as well as government budgets\nThey start thinking perhaps a little bit differently but you know if you look at recent history and the twenty sixteen election in West Virginia you had really to sort of outlier candidates that very well well one was\nA a novel Trump the president

still see what kind of bump if any ... in that Morsi gets out of this\nI'm Wondering Jeff how much impact senator mansions votes on Kavanaugh went up having as this [noise] you know as we get closer to November six\nI I can understand from for political reasons why you know Democrats want to see this push to after the midterms because then you don't you don't have to make that vote but\nAs as much as Trump is popular in the state as popular as he is and the support that he has how much that vote would impact support for Morsi headed down the stretch\nYeah I think it's a good point um and we have heard this is just anecdotally you know or I've heard a couple of people to call talk shows here locally in Charleston and even talk to a person who said that\nThat's what their vote depends on you know if it you know they're willing to vote for if if Manchin votes for Kavanaugh they'll vote for mansion if he doesn't do vote for Morsi's so that to me shows a little\nKind of soft or you know because they're not as strong or more see I'm trying I'm trying to kind of makes sense that if you were fully supportive Morsi that you would go with Morsi regardless right so I\nI think that I think that's going to be a key for some people you know how how mansion votes on this and he's still you know he's he hasn't said one way or the other the only thing he has said about the Kavanaugh as he came out with a statement\nAh on friday saying he supported the ebb and this is before the president made his decision he said he supported the\nAs Senator Flake a proposal to have that supplemental investigation which is what the president ordered\nYou can of course or read more see the recap from President Trump's visit to wheeling over WB metro news\nDot com I Know you're also Jeff keeping up with the impeachment proceedings that's going on right now to say what do you make of all of this I said I'm not sure if it's ironic or it's interesting or what it is Evan Jenkins being sworn in this hour right as the new Supreme Court justice means on you have an impeachment proceeding going on literally\nNext door what do you make of all this [noise] [laughter]\nAh it's pretty amazing stuff quite honestly I mean it's it's almost it's really an everyday occurrence\nOver the last several weeks about you know ah you know pay who can hear you got these appointed members of the Supreme Court and you've got these motions that are filed by ... by members of the Supreme Court to the Supreme Court\nYou know I mean it's just it's really an amazing thing when you look at it and this morning as that is you have you said it best Walker first person on the stand I mean the house managers put her on the stand first I think they only have about fourteen witnesses or so\nAnd they put her on the stand at the very beginning and her attorney said last week on TALK on my kiss him\nThat the yeah he he acknowledged that she was on there on the witness list\nA and that she was willing to testify and that's what that's what's happening right now she faces is Brad said you know just the one\nI'm just one articles impeachment uh it it's just going to be interesting to see how this comes at because this money last a couple of days they might have an answer with Walker [noise]\nUm [noise] and\nAll of this and the Supreme Court has heard no cases you know they because they were supposed to start their fall term in September they pushed that back to October and now they've pushed that back indefinitely or not here at least not hearing any cases this week\nSo they've heard no fall term cases and you could it could happen\nOr because you could have these fall cases pushback it can happen they could have been pushed back beyond the November general election and you could have two members sworn into the court Tim arms dead and Evan Jenkins who both obviously like their chances in November\nBut they could be members of the court without ever hearing a case it could happen\nThe last six months ... a year or so has been fascinating to watch if you're has man if you want to be entertained by state government it's been entertaining the last couple of months Jeff chickens better news news director appreciate about it I see a man not Jeff Jenkins down in Charleston and and and for what it's worth\nI Do think that\nJoe mansions decision on Brett Kavanaugh is going to play a huge role in this election and like Jeff said again you're talking anecdotally people saying you know what we're hearing out on the streets are against the circles you run in in\nMy vote may depend on\nHow Joe Manchin votes for Kevin also going to be interesting there's a lot of interesting things happening right All right I mean you've got the state Supreme Court the U.S Supreme

polls joining me right now on ... talkline in state agriculture commissioner Ken Leon hard he's going to hold a series of meetings around the state to come up with a strategic plan for agriculture morning can't\nGo on a grave thanks for having me on\nAh thanks for taking some time with us today you're going to have fourteen meetings trying to come up with a strategic plan why do we need a strategic plan for agriculture\nWell you know West Virginia's economy still lagging behind the rest of the United states uh you know we've always relied on extraction industries and we we got to diversify our economy and our culture is certainly one way we can do that\nAnd uh we want to make sure that we're\nHearing all the stakeholders out there\nOr whether they're a farmer or whether they're a manufacturer was there a market or whether they're\nA consumer we want to hear what they think we should do and agriculture and that's what we're doing you know we did an online survey got those results and picked out the highlights and then we're not we're going out into the public but those are the highlights and getting those that input in\nHere in West Virginia deal like Idaho for lack of a better example Idaho's the potato we all know that the potato comes from Idaho it's the one crop in West Virginia being a one crop date thin and helped jumpstart this economy\nWell actually I Believe we're going to be what I call a cornucopia of special Rick crops or we have a very diverse uh topography and terrain and micro climates around the state you know some areas of the state or good for like maple syrup there's an area of the state that has a lot of\nA ... trees and the tops of people are going to talk to your boss rooms or there's\nAlso we have some bottom land that were do some of the row crops like along the Ohio River on the eastern panhandle penalties and and hearty county where some of our bigger a row crop areas of the state or cattle seem to thrive down on the greenbrier him in Monroe County area so we're given that\nKind of a topography and train them micro climates I Believe we're going to end up being with us not just one crop or we're going to have a multitude of crops and that's why I say we can be a cornucopia of specialty crops\nDoes this help help close that gap there is a six billion dollar gap between consumption in production if we can take these steps and have that that cornucopia as you say does that help close that gap\nYes I certainly believe it will help close that gap you're actually correct river about a six billion dollar deficit when it'd be great if we can have that six billion dollars in the state of going to\nOut of a state producers\nTo actually be produced here in West Virginia wouldn't it be great if we don't have to import those hot house tomatoes from Mexico or or California and to West Virginia you know we're developing our natural gas industry when it'd be great if we use the natural grass right here in West Virginia\nThe heat the greenhouses and we can pick the tomatoes red\nI was struck I taste the same as they come out of the garden but\nAt least they're being picked when they're ripe and knocked grain and then shipping and ripening along the way a freshness is also a key thing I think people can actually start saving money by having food last longer than their refrigerator after they purchase it enforced trips to the grocery store I think there's a lot of benefits that we can get\nIn football Bush did agriculture commissioner Kelly and heart joining a zero metro news talk line so once you have the\nData once you have the inputs were very good a gathering input and data I don't know how good we two of implementing it what do you do with all this information once you have it all gather\nWell we're actually going to take that ah that information orange ... and you're actually correct I mean West Virginia is loaded with the studies\nThat have never an actor or we're going to act on this one a\nPart of it is going to be part of a marketing campaign you know we've recently lost our West Virginia grown program at just to highlight the fact that there are producers here in West Virginia or whether they be fresh producer or value added producer that's making a sauces are\nJammed jellies or pickled or\nPickled okra maybe the pickle peppers that uh our candy jar that people can use or specialty item but those type of items that we're\nTrying to hide like grow it here in West Virginia by if you're in West Virginia keep the money in our economy I I could really say that\nA West Virginia grown as good help for West Virginia it's good help for our citizens as good help for our economy\nWhere can we get more information to a meeting locations uh there's also an
