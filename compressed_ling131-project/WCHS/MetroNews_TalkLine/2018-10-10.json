receive reimbursement from a various organizations that he went to to provide a speech or something like that\nExplain that in and did the prosecution to do an adequate job presenting that story and how did last reversed you that\nYou know almost all of these charges really with the exception of just a couple of having to do with that almost all of them have to do with law for east travel or as a subset to those er fraud charges the law free when two conventions uh conferences hosted by outside entities\nAnd accepted their reimbursement for the travel while also traveling in a state vehicle and using the state supplied gas card\nOr so it was across state lines it's it's a it's a flawed to fraud charges actually are representatives of those organizations came in and talk through a few days ago a about what was the the reimbursement out of it at work what was expected what was the paperwork\nOr justice law free\nWhen he took the stand said anything he did was unintentional a kind of hinted to the Erie well you know it's all this paperwork I sort of forgot but I I had said that was taking a private vehicle I wound up in the state vehicle it was all just an accident just trust me here\nAh and then there are for fourteen or so charges just the last three years the state vehicle to go to various places and and uh the prosecution kept those places as as personal travel and a lot of the more Tucker county where law free grew up\nLast week cast those those trips as more of a gray area he characterized almost everything he did as being as having sort of a a a soft effect on the Supreme Court winning it was it was to get out and meet people to uh to do outreach for the ...\n... and he would say that about these trips to Tucker county I spoke to schoolchildren I was supposed to be in a parade because I'm\nI'm a member of the court and it was meant to be an honor ah I talked to a map districts because I wanted to see how the court system is affecting them uh same thing about his trips to the greenbrier uh to to\nParticipate in book signing for his own book he said you know not a lot of people bought these books but I was there through to beat people to represent the court to introduce people to what the justices to relate\nA ... there was another trip that that is on the record but he's charged with but it started out with him going to accomplish and clerks burg and he said well I got a cold and my mother was in the hospital in Morgantown so diverted and pick a thing about it\nSo good good jury is going to have to decide what constitutes person to travel is that uh for for something where you're staying overnight with your parents are going to a book signing for your own book or a or do you get back off from that and saying oh it while he was he was

defense\nWell prosecutors have been on a two track system and one has been this raw data about a cell phone\nTower records were last year he was a gas card purchases and the records that go along with them and I I Will say is I sat there I've tried to put my myself into the jury's shoes and I I I haven't yet\nHer the prosecution hammer that home point by point uh they they painted the things this was a holiday this was a Sunday why the car on a Sunday but but they haven't necessarily point by point going through and I I think they've really got to\nTo to really clarify today exactly what they mean a prosecutors have also brought forth\nWitness testimony a ranging from the justice Britain Benjamin you're brought his authority for years on the Supreme Court or two other Supreme Court employees like a Kim Ellis who claims that justice Laufer tried to imitate her a to three security personnel who killed these stories about\nTrying to get the desk in and out of law for his house and the pain they took to get out or from under the gaze of the media\nOr the defense is going to try to counter all that by saying look just because he traveled someplace and just because there is a cell phone tower record or or gas purchased it doesn't mean he was up to no good it means he was\nTraveling uh on on business related to the court trying to represent it but law for is going to have to

retina legendary Fairmont state basketball coach who passed away this morning and also next hour we will remember the wife of Frank deem\nAnd other legendary figure this time in politics longtime representative from a wood county who passed away this morning\nBut first the state Supreme Court or whoever happened to be on the court at this [laughter] has reached the decision and decided that uh done Blankenship who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination to the U.S Senate seat held by Joe mansion\nOr that and then switched to the Constitution Party and got petition signatures and then filed to run\nA as a get on the ballot for the representative of the constitution part of the U.S Senate and the Sixers he's always denied access based on the state sore loser well which says and asked them said if you're losing the primary you can switch parties and run again in the general he challenge that on several grounds in states being court came back\nAnd said nope ah the wall stands and you will not be granted access to the ballot Mark Williams is an attorney who\nRepresents the state of West Virginia represents six states office and joins us on veterans talk on market morning thanks for joining us out what did the report basis decision upon okay without going through every step what was the can you explain in layman's terms the ruling by the court\nShort good morning I'd learned the the ... the Supreme Court\nFound that are existing statutes that was in effect at the time that Mr Blankenship or changed parties prohibited his being the nominee of the Constitution Party there were two statutory provisions that we were arguing about whether or not they applied\nAnd and they found that one did apply and under those circumstances um\nThe ah that prevented him from being on the ballot or they also looked at some constitutional challenges that he asserted and like every other case that has looked at the constitutionality of so sore loser provision our court found that it did not violate two provisions of the U.S constitution\nMight think there was an overriding and it's dangerous to read into what the court thinking but it was was there an overriding um principle here that courts often are and frankly should be reluctant to\nUm go beyond their authority and to get into the business of the legislature legislator function which passed this law\nYeah I think that's probably true it this court restated\nSomething that they had stated in a couple of other uh election law cases that they're going to show deference to the legislature and how they decide to regulate elections\nIn fact West Virginia's is unique among some states because we have this nice little summary at the beginning of all these opinions called shores syllabus point yeah you know required is required by our our state constitution and they restated the syllabus point that they have stated and other election law cases\nThat says that reasonable regulation of elections to something that the legislature is entitled to do and I think this outcome reflects that\nThis is a loaded question it's not a lawyer early questions really sort of just a ... guys talking question does a sore loser all makes sense or is it a ... it does it prevents yet another opportunity for people to vote and make a choice\n[noise] [noise] well I think that was the point in history Blankenship and his counsel professor ... who was as it turns out my constitutional law professor when I was in order to pass a which is always and\nVisit it's good to go up or it's going to go up against your professor in when isn't it\n[laughter] it really is I mean that was a long time ago that uh he was teaching me common law and not that we had some jokes about that a after the argument but\nUh that was his point essentially that ballot access should be open and free and then there there is a a a philosophy in in one corner of election law that says that there should be no restrictions on ballot access\nUm however we have political parties for a reason we give preference to certain political parties for a reason um\nAnd this decision is consistent with what other states have also found in analyzing the same sort of thing so that kind of consistency is a good thing for us\nThere is [noise] yeah and and there's an argument to mark and I'm arguing your side here is that [noise]\nThat the state has a responsibility or an obligation to prevent chaos in elections\nAnd you could if you just said hey it's fair everybody should you should be able to do what you want I mean I could go in and and under theoretically then if you play death you know I could go in six days before the election so you gotta put me on the ballot so there is a an obligation by states to prevent that kind of stuff right\nThat's correct and in a case of a candidate like Mr Blankenship it's particularly problematic and it's something that we talked about\nIn oral argument or in front of the court is that what he has some one of ... of that stature and notoriety and resources it becomes even more dangerous you know the one thing if you decided that or are you know ... you know\nIn West over decided that he was going to start up a political party and tried to get on the ballot\nYou know you may not have the resources to collect hire people to collect the signatures and and go on TV and spend billions of dollars Don Blankenship did\nEbb and that's one of the reasons why we have these sorts of restrictions is to prevent someone who might have those resources and isn't satisfied with what the voters choice was in the primary to say well the heck with that I'm Still going to go on the ballot through this other mechanism\nRight nice or west over as a reference to mark the ... trying to keep a topic\nI understand finally I'm going to switch gears because you also represent Margaret workman state Supreme Court justice who is due to go on trial next week you saw what happened with Beth Walker\nHas been for justice and they were thirty three to one thirty two to one whatever it was a acquitted her are you still prepared or is it going to be a trial next week is the justice prepared and anxious to go to trial or is there a deal being worked out\nWell I can tell you that are just as workman is anxious to tell her story or she came on your show and\nUm and and talked a little bit about what her defenses and why she thinks she should not be impeached ah currently the trial is still set to commence next Monday or as you know we filed a petition and the Supreme Court\nSeeking a a determination that the impeachment should not go forward or we have not heard a decision on that yet although we understand that they're the panel that has been chosen to review it as it is looking at things and they hopefully have\nAt least a preliminary decision on on some of those issues maybe sometime this week\nDid you learn anything from the Walker trial that you can use to try that would benefit your client\n[noise] well I think there were several things one is that the Senate was doing was was doing their duty\nOr under the constitution and looking at this um I think that there are a couple of things that you can draw from the Walker verdict and one is that they believe that the houses over reaching\nUm I think the general consensus was that\nJustice Walker was going to be acquitted the margin was what shocked me um I think it was justified I just you know when you're when you're talking a mix of law in politics you never know how that's going to play out you know pretty clear that the senators thought that there isn't a good deal of overreaching and bought the house managers were arguing\nI don't want to give up your strategy what would you advise your client to take a walk or approach and accept responsibility apologize I won't do it again we're we're we're going to make a pivot here and do a better job would you advise you to do that or when she was on this program justice work when it was pretty defiant what's a better approach\nWell I think that the I think\nWhat we can expect is that she's going to explain the situation or the allegations against or a slightly different then right after this Walker\nSo she's going to have some factual issues that she's going to have an opportunity to explain and some documentation to explain why things happen that were never raised in the house\nNever discussed for instance she never testified was never called to testify when the house was investigating this so a lot of a lot of what she's going to say and her defense they are going to be hearing for the first time or if this trial proceeds next week I position is that\nThere are enough legal problems with the way that the impeachment articles are phrased and the the legal underpinnings for them that they can't go forward how confident are you how often it are you of acquittal\nWell I'm not going to speculate um because one thing I learned in trying a lot of cases is that you you never guess before a you hear the evidence but let's just say that she has a a strong defense that I'm sure she'll make persuasively\nMark

I'm Talking about the culture vote\nThe cloture vote was basically this they go shut down the roll call\nYeah but you didn't you didn't you you weren't in the first roll call you or not you wait and you are not in the first of all correct\nI was a\n... in there you didn't vote but they go back around if you don't they say\nThey went to flake F comes before an Collins comes before him [laughter] I'm I'm third in line\nMurkowski sends me a note that she's voting no and didn't know it because we've been talking for the last two weeks we've in comparing notes back and forth we started out with seven other Democrats or Republicans talking is see if there is a pathway forward or why we should be for or against we compared to all of our notes all the way up to the end I did not know until Lisa Murkowski walked on the floor\nAnd I walked on the floor that morning and she just sent me a little tech snow so I knew or at least it was okay nothing's changing my vote already had the facts that I needed and I voted\nWhen you came out when you when you came up then you said you looked at the FBI reports on the record again that morning so after you close the book on that FBI supplemental report did you know at that moment that you were going to be a yes vote at that\nMoment I was going to be a yes vote no matter what happened happy because there's no way in God's green earth could I change it just I mean people talking about the politics everything has to be politics while I'm Sorry it's not all politics it does it does it's an awful lot of people may conscientious votes a Heidi Heitkamp my dear friend\nOkay from from North Dakota she made a boat and couldn't get there and she voted with a Gorsuch right Joe Donnelly couldn't get there I couldn't get to where they were getting to vote no and I told him\nI said I cannot I don't see the same as you how'd he says you know we talk back and forth and it was personal ... so I respected that Lisa Murkowski couldn't get there when she walked and she didn't know until she walked in I knew when I walked out of the skiff which are secured skiff I knew at ten thirty that I was confident\nI saw nothing the cooperated that Brent Kavanaugh was involved\nAt all I could have you on your ... you would not you are not holding your votes is to make sure that there was fifty you didn't want to be the fiftieth I don't think ... I Would have\nBeen would ever would have taken I could not I had to vote and you're saying all this get back and forth I Can't do that ... I've never done that bottom line is when I vote on culture I always vote on final passage if you recall and you heard me say many times do you remember John Kerry said I was Fort before I was against\nIt and write a bait right what he and no one understood the rule descent I wasn't a senator then I understand that he was talking about he was told you vote comes first and all the time so\nYou know this up until maybe ten years ago they didn't have ... votes on us on on the Supreme Court they just went right to the final vote\nBut let me ... didn't they never contested let me just getting onto the vote\nLike one more time on there so not only move on us older Joe mansions with is that sure your detractors are saying that once the Democrats want the once the Democratic leadership realized\nThat they were going to lose that wants to get got fifty and that meant that parents can come in and making fifty one so they were going to wants to Democrats realized they were going to lose then it was via Schumer okay for you to vote yes\n[noise] I don't know how you know me as well as anybody in West Virginia\nYou know me and the bottom line is nobody's going to tell me how to vote\nChuck Schumer Mitch McConnell or any of these people\nI ... I just don't do I mean that's just not that I Am I Know they want to\nPeople my detractors or my opponent sure I understand that I understand what they're going to say if that was the case and hobby why does the White House put out that on Thursday they knew where I was they didn't know they knew I was leaning in that direction they knew that everybody kind\nOf knew that I was leaning but I always said this until I see all the evidence\nI won't make a final decision if there's one word or one cooperating piece of evidence that shows that they were in the same place that it could have happened or that they were in the same house and people knowledge that\nOr there was a relationship or that would have been a whole different story but ... I don't know why people I guess that we become so hyper political that everything we do is based around politics I'm Sorry I tell people all the time you're entitled to your opinion\nYou're just not entitled to making up your own facts to support\nYour opinion US Senator Joe Manchin is with the ... where does that you are of course still a Democrat where does this leave you with your fellow Democrats\nHobby I I'm a West Virginia Democrat and I've always I've never been in Washington\nDemocrat and I have a lot of friends who are Democrats who are ... uh West Virginia Republicans and don't really subscribe to this Washington Republicans so what's happening in the tribal mentality in Washington is absolutely ludicrous\nThere isn't you know Frank deem we just talked about ... you couldn't find a stronger more Republican person then Frank dean you couldn't find a fair person and Frank deem that would reach out and say I like that I'm almost support that Joe or say Joe can you consider this and maybe we can get together\nWhere's there's Republicans I think he's still in West Virginia the ones I Know they're my friends and the Democrats in West Virginia I still think that are very reasonable and responsible I Can't tell you what's happened to Washington where do I belong I'm not sure\nI Know one thing I still feel comfortable and trying to help people I still feel ... comfortable and fight and like the Dickens for pre existing condition because you do that\nAnd you'd be down the path of Petra Morsi is going down with his lawsuit you know what that does four hundred and ... thousand West Virginians won't even be able to buy insurance they could afford it\nAnd and I know that that's a big point of view campaign and we're going to talk more about that another day I just wanted to clear the deck on the cabinet that does this does is a ... I got to talk about the politics of and I appreciate you explain to your vote but on the politics of it because we do have an election in four weeks does this hurt you with\nA progressive Democrats to for them this was a litmus test they they want the\nThe the thing that bothers me is for people putting it into a category well if you vote for judge Kavanaugh you don't believe me\nHappy that's not the case at all my goodness I've had people come and talk to me from all different walks of life from West Virginia and sharing their stories are horrific stories and the trauma they've endured I\nUnderstand this is absolutely horrific that this was still continue to twenty first century in West Virginia and people been holding this inside them for ten twenty thirty or more years whatever we can do whatever I can do in order to help make sure that they're going to be protected can come forward and that we can work and help\nThis doesn't continue down that path that's what I Want to do uh I Can't tell you whether it helps or hurts I didn't vote on whether it would help me or hurt me politically I had to make a vote as a U.S senator I made it on the facts\nI Try to do very conscientious deep dive on all of this for the most important responsibilities I have I've done that almost any appointment every appointment\nThat the president's brought forward and if I didn't find a person was qualified or of the quality of a character they shouldn't be um then I wouldn't vote accordingly but\nI didn't find that on this hot do not find it\nOr to or going to leave it there when we come back we'll get to come back next time you want to get back in the issues not preaching\nTo the issues hop out when he will get into the preexisting can we already opiates everything he'll worry that fight

legislator from would count that he was first elected to the house of delegates I kind of laugh when I say is so long ago Nineteen sixty four\nYear before I was born Nineteen fifty four he drove off and on in the house and Senate until his death he was in the house of delegates when he passed away he had a a you know hearts your heart failure\nAnd ah he was taking the hospital and then he passed away this morning Delia John ... brings in Republican from Berkeley county served with Frank dean for many many years and joins us on ...\nAnd as we've had to say a couple of times this morning because of the death of Joe written in talking to people knew him and uh John I Know you were friends with Frank team so I'm Sorry about the loss of your friend\n[noise] it that we will miss Frank ... is a class act in the house of delegates when we we serve together on the Judiciary Committee hearing I even serve has shared an office during one of his times and they and how to delegate\n... what do you remember about Frank\n[noise] he he Frank with the class act he was the old school he wanted to make sure that a\nPolitics was what it should be discussions in on issues he wanted to make sure we got to get above the fray personal attacks that type of thing and he\nWas always looking out to to make sure that that you know we we followed the system the way it should be followed and then avoided some of the negative\nI have that they're afraid of the personal attacks on those types of things just with the very class act and had many years old age was catching up with him but he was always it's always nice to have that traditional perspective of the legislature and the way it should be operating\nIn his last year's huge see him at the Capitol he had one of those motorized scooters and he'd be a shooting around the capital and that scooter you'd see them coming\nYeah them and and that helped to upgrade our um our a capital for especially about how could delegate or people in handicapped in in wheelchairs off elite sort of a yes at age with catching up with him many sometimes headache hearing problem and I think he helped to a\nGroup called the ... the house to become more and more appropriate for people with hearing impairment as well as the\n... people weren't able to get around that is that they might have been able to own a younger days\nJohn over in in ... a longtime delegate from Brooklyn remembering a Frank deems a veteran Republican delegate and senator or depending on what year was from a from would canal Frank would have an opinion or to Whitney\nCertainly would he uh he he was he kept up with issues he was very knowledgeable he wanted to make sure that uh we really we heard his perspective that hey we can answer that we he wanted to share the insight that he had learned over the years and that and I think it was always refreshing\nTo he would bring a new perspective on issues at times as well as just the way the house would operate in now they decorum that we should be operating and he would do to keep us on track if we uh if things got a little too personal are hot and heavy and during the debate and discussion\nOr even in is let her years and it's pretty intimidating to get up on the floor with Ninety nine other members and everybody watching people in the gallery and to speak and Frank was not afraid to get up and see what he thought I mean you could usually count on Frank to get up and get involved in a debate as we feel passionate about it and it's my recollection\nExactly he and he he was not afraid to take on\nThe ... that they felt thanks for not being done properly he would he would let us know that and that he had a tradition of the as you pointed at Nineteen fifty four I mean back when we were just youngsters or even your case before we were born ah he he\nYou know we're like bring that traditional perspective that just covering you know over half a century Frank had a goal he his his one goal was to be one of a handful of legislators in the United states that it's fair\nFor fifty years and he got at forty eight years he got very close to that\nYou had it not not many people make it to that that long and quitting a nationwide and that would have cold but ah he certainly editing a nice prospective over the years that I live\nAnd again it was first elected in the house bill gets Nineteen fifty four but also he was elected to the Senate and the wouldn't county politics can be really difficult to predict sometimes and he'd win an election win reelection in ...\nThey didn't win again I mean he was in I I guess you had to show up John back in the day to see a Frank made it back you know\nWell it Richard Gere made me look at the fact that he defeated the Senate price on there I think ... that right that he was\nHe was in the house or delicatessen they get paid in the year and a president I mean he he was a very sharp and had had a lot of a good insight I ... in that case despite his handicapped and it has its white Becky ... voted in making sure that he got to the meetings you know making sure\nAnd he was getting Boulder and maybe a lot more trail that she was very devoted to helping him do good service to help him ... debate at different times for different committees and different like you said ...\n... is with the Republican delegate from Berkeley county longtime friend a Frank dean who has passed away at age Ninety I thinking incorrectly said or a eighty or just a few minutes ago and the other thing about Frank is and I didn't quarter we didn't know him as well as you did but I knew him and spending time with a capital is Frank actually liked the press\nAnd he he loved it stopping chatter gossip and talk about issues and tell us what we should be doing but always with a smile on me he liked to get you just like the give and take I think\nWe need it will take and being in the political process take will get pretty rough and tumble and he didn't take it personally he was sort of said above the fray doing you know focusing on issues that he felt was he felt strongly about like you said he he liked to press Uber's write letters to the editor I mean I got\nA local paper in March ... there was he was talking about an issue that he felt that the public needed to be informed about it that he had special expertise something\nHe would ... I got up and she'll gosh up until a couple of weeks ago\nI Would get periodically letters from his office in which they deem requests you posed this commentary this call home so he was [laughter]\nIt was pretty sharp right to the end so we'll we'll miss Frank dean as a character and as as a as a dedicated ... I don't mean to dismiss them but as a dedicated homemaker too so\nI mean when you take a forty eight years I mean that was most of his adult light\nOr serving the people on board county you know helping to inform people on issues he felt strongly about and that he he wanted to he wanted the public to be informed and that's where he would call you and your right leg he'd write letters to make sure that we're up to speed on issues or he felt were important to a mistake deliberate of products at\nThe new ... also why you he served for many many years when to be a Republican was a ... when you ... you could call it has been a a in a closet\nOr if it goes back when ... and John Yoder we're the only two Republicans in the Senate and then now\nIs that it was that those who are challenging time as a Republican they'd be able to get your agenda true and now they said during during most of the time that Frank served in the house we were you know twenty to thirty how about a hundred show that it was an uphill battle to get things accomplished\nIn John ... brings in a West Virginia delegate from Berkeley county who himself as a retiring here soon so John I appreciate I Know he's a friend of yours and I'm Sorry for your last night which is coming on today given some perspective on the weight Frank team thank you very much\nFor thank you for letting a share price memories are like we'll be back\nAre you looking for a new pharmacy you tired of being just another number in line this is Lynn for it [noise] I'm inviting you to consider making Britain pharmacy the home from all your pharmacy me\nTransferring and as easy as making calls downloading an ad for dropping your prescription bottles off different man\nFree local deliveries we can even debuted in your hometown family farm [noise] a\nSmall friday night to come to light weights highschool football\nAnd on metro news the tradition continue with high school\nRead your indeed Jacqueline every Friday night as they were you the latest story stories editor views from football fields all over the years all season long at our website the metro news dot com I gained night on the news of\nVoice of high school sports team West Virginia\nThis is talk line on metro news the voice of West Virginia\n[noise] [noise]\nI'm ... and you know and they will him\nOften they denounce let me just like hair I see", "show_name": "MetroNews TalkLine", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "10"}
