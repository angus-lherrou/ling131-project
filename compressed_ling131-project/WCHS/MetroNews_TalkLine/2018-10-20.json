budget long term investment canoe home\nThe vast majority of people do in fact want to be homeowners you know fifty one percent of people think that owning a home is the best investment you can make Seventy three percent agree that it's an important financial milestone\nThe first step is that down payment and that is a major road block for a lot of people\nThat can be in and it can be really daunting because\nYou know for somebody who is you know relatively young and it's just getting started with their financial life it would be the largest single sum of money that they probably put into anything on their own their education obviously costs money but it gets spread out and their parents or ... or they take out loans so\nTo think about coming up with ten twenty thirty forty thousand dollars and gas little loan if the if you live in a coastal city it's even multiples of that as a down payment can be daunting but yet not on achievable\nSo what do you do if if you know you need to you want to buy a home you know when they take that step it but but you just look at that down payment you said that is just on achievable unattainable what do you do\nWant to you know the first thing that I Would suggest is just doing a research\nUnderstanding what it is that you do need it you know maybe\nIn your head you think you need fifty thousand dollars but maybe there's a way to get into a house or twenty thousand dollars you know I put eight thousand dollars out of my first call so there are opportunities and there are more good programs that you could potentially take advantage of it\nAnd thinking about you know not just taking a rule of thumb from a national average but think about where you live and what the cost of living in your area is to make sure that you're identifying the right amount that you need and then it starts to get into just budgeting and getting started one of the themes we always pushes part of our efforts is to say\nThere's no time like the president to just get started the only guarantee you that if you don't start you won't get\nThere how long that normally take for people to come up with that ten percent minimum that they need people\nAre realizing that they have to play it out for it they don't expect to sort of have this thing be overnight but don't want to necessarily be a gold is going to happen in ten or Twenty years so we really do try to give them a tool and and we've built into trying a calculator that that helps people to understand given\nThe amount of money that you can set aside on a weekly or monthly basis and given the target goal that you have whether it is ten twenty thirty thousand dollars how long will that and then we also give them a sense of\nIs there a benefit is there a pro and con to taking in and if it is a five to seven year time period maybe thinking about investing the money and and seeing if there's a a benefit to doing that in the middle a in a conservative investment portfolio but even if it helps to save you six months than we think there might be it's worked at least ...\nAre there other things that you should do before you make that down payment like say your credit card debt save other kinds of debt you should get that cleared up first strike\nYou know it all comes down to each couples unique goals in life how important is\nHomeownership to you and and your family you know self concept\nIt could be that if you waited till the quote unquote perfect moment it might never us and so for some families it is worth it to say you know we have a growing family we need to move into a house and we're willing to spend a little bit longer to pay off this other debt in order to achieve this financial dream for ourselves and for other people they might feel like they need to have a little bit more\nA level of comfort in order to be able to take on that type of obligation because as we know there is paying for the house and then there's maintained to the house so there's always more to go\nAbsolutely and you do mention that there is no perfect moment in and if you wait for that perfect moment you're going to be waiting for ever how easy is it to get a mortgage these days I Know that the economy has improved credits loosened up a bit but not a lot but that working pretty hard to obtain for a lot of people\nIt can be and certainly I think that goes without saying that it's harder than it was ten years ago but I think it is something that if you do your research and if you do you're planning and if you've taken positive steps in your financial life to have good credit than it's something that is very achievable for most families\nSteve door of all the head of advice and innovation for John Hancock on how the app that he helped develop called twice can help

have minded my own business but you didn't I didn't have an acquaintance too recently\nUh reconnected with a a daughter he had it in a marriage when he was in the military and Europe okay ah and that was a\nWell Nineteen Ninety eight she was born that originally reconnected and the people and his family are pretty concerned\nAh so I thought I did that old easy button and just do a background search on her and she was like equality or to no avail us failed miserably\nOh hey man so you've got to wait whoa wait so so you put so she's what Nineteen she's Twenty years\nOld so she's Twenty years old and that's right because you said Nineteen Ninety eight um you couldn't really buy anything\nAbout her leg on Instagram or Facebook or anything like that oh I did\nI did I found a a a Facebook account that looked like it had the origin or January twenty Eighteen oh but that's not very much of a social media no not in Iraq\nAnd so so you are trying to do a background check on this young woman so that this way you can\nTell your friend more about her or you afraid that she's not really the daughter or that she's going to scam ham or ... all of\nThe above okay uh she does for for money or they're not rich by any means ah ah the family just ... but a lot of concerns over this and it's causing trouble in the family so\nOh I'm sure I mean all of a sudden you have a kid coming out of the blue right and you're like okay I\nI'm just a bystander and all that well here are\nGood friend I mean you're worried about right new automation I was\nI was concerned in a regular show a I don't like she anybody get hurt a ... and and I heard you talk about these things before in\nA different stage for looking people up but I used to be ideal dot com yeah his book goes all ah and I'm coming up with nothing\nYou know there's also family tree now where okay you\nMight be able to find something in your family tree now it's supposed to be like where you put your family tree together but it really there's a lot of information there\nUh and of course much like any other site Jim you have to be careful especially when you look at people searching sites is that what appears to be an actual box that is going to help you find somebody is nothing other than an ad so you really need to\nKeep your wits about you and don't do this if you're having a beer or a glass of wine ... click and other places are and then of course there's Donovan surge which is another place for you to attract but I mean if you are really trying to to find information about this young woman is that\nYou know I'm surprised that that you know he can't friend her on social media or somebody that he knows could friend her on social media because they\nBe the easiest way you know especially if this is his daughter and so you know what how can and then you could then he can share his credentials with you if you want but he if he wants and then you can start snooping around and see if there's anything else out\nThere yeah I don't think he wants anybody who thinks oh he doesn't want to know I don't think he wants to know oh why\nYou have a you have an uphill battle all around right what does your gut telling you\nMight get is telling me that the that she is his daughter and I don't\nThink she's got a very good background and I think she's just out to get which you can do it\nAnd say well maybe you know you can do your background search you can see what you can find on line\nAnd you know maybe you're just counting your friend on the warning signs things to look out for\nA you know as far as you know first she's going to ask for ten dollars then it's going to be a hundred dollars you know whatever it may be you know as it goes on\nI and maybe you know he needs to text you every time that she asked for money so that this where you have a record of it because he's not going to want to remember or it sounds like he's probably not even going to tally and now that I think about that\nWell we're we're not that close like I said I'm just a a a bystander and all this so there's a connection to uh uh other people uh that I'm associated with a ... and everybody is concerned for him a and it's taken a toll on his own current family\nYeah but you can't help people that don't want to help themselves right that's true\nI mean I hate to be that blood but I'm you know you're a good man and you're trying to do something and you know I Would search at the family tree diet now and ... search I Would try to expand that surge into people that she may know and he may know\nAnd and you know put those names into Facebook or you may also want to you know just put her name out there you know as a Google alert to see what can happen obviously look in the county records\nA you know wherever she may have lived and the court houses and the civil records because all that is now on line ...\nAh you know there are ways for us she was applying for a job that you could actually use a company like precision higher or what have you\nThat would do a trace task to tracking rather across the United states and you might want to look at a PIN PIN is going to cost you around five hundred bucks okay well and if you start doing this on line you're probably looking at fifty dollars two hundred dollars but that search may not be as throws you would like\nUh when I was afraid of yes\nBut if you do want to PI you know I I Know a couple used over the years you know trying to do background checks on whether it's you know somebody to care for my mother or somebody that were hiring and you know what exactly is going on in this person's life\nBut there are so often you can hop online you can see it if you start expanding that ... that ring if you will so outside your friends go to the next you know if you think about it on tree rings\nGo to the next level go to the next level just keep moving out and out and you may find something but you can always like I said started the county courthouse records are online you don't have to go there anymore\nUh the civil records and the criminal records and then in addition to that you can you know by searches at these various types that I mentioned uh thanks for being a listener thanks for being a club member jam I really appreciate you and have you ever gone to hear you you know you have time to Phoenix from from the studios\nSo I'd

the sun does know that there's a track or you know there's really no way to unless unless he could actually get the phone and install this tracker on and not have the kid no right\nI mean that's another issue okay alright that's sad when there's a a depending upon the carriers of ... do you know who the carrier is\nA ... to ... okay if the mobile has it to 'em\nBecause he's probably play paying for the kids' cell phone plan right\nI'm Sorry if he paid for the kids phone uh yes okay is that\nThe carriers they also they have something like family locate or packages and the ... and it's like ten dollars a month but what I like if it's from the carrier and that not only can he see where the boys that but the boy\nCan see where he's at an okay and if the if\nHe had you know his grandparents where he want to even the normally you can have up to ten people on a plan\nOr a you know and you know there's also glimpse which is also something you might want to look at that's that's

and Google Maps has really easy to do but before we do anything else I tell you there's a big update\nUh so if you need some juice for your dying battery and you're all electric car\nIt's not so simple to find an easy charging station or electric charging station well things have changed Google Maps now in Iowa as the Android you can now have the nearest fill up spots show up on a map if you need an e v charge they're listening show you buy the station what type of plugs charging speeds other business details\nA and so if a business has a charging station available by the way that's going to be lifted too so again if you need and even charge you want to update to Google Maps on Iowa west and the Android [noise]\nAll right I ran across an interesting story over at the wall Street Journal this past week and the title was you want twenty percent for having me a muffin\nThe awkward advocate of I had a thing and\nI don't know if you've noticed it but I certainly have that wherever you go where somebody choosing square and they're on their I pet or on their phone\nIs that they want to get tips for just about anything out there have you noticed that Andrew\nI'm so glad that you found this dinner bringing this up this is such a pet peeve for me it's on but I don't want to name a possible on out there possible sponsor a future sponsors so I'll just say there's a place is called but narrow bread\n[laughter] talking and code [laughter] and they have their yesterday [laughter] have amazing\nWe delicious food yes did the Greek salad ... it's the best out I've ever had booked every single time they ask you if you would like to tip the person that has just standing there at the register\nSo because of an era I developed the seven foot ball with that if you have to go farther than seven feet I Will tip you\nWould if you don't [laughter] I Am probably not\nGoing to do that though if you're just taking my credit card right my apple pay my ... pay a farmer's market\nI bought spinach pasta\nWas twelve dollars for one thing of pasta and they asked they asked for a tip on the app that you tip of course not\nOkay so my hair stylist lovely lovely young woman named Nicole and\nYou know like a lot of hair stylist she she rents her station right\nAnd so this is pretty much her business well it is for business and what I Love about in the call is she treats her station like it is a business so she's professional she's on time if I say I need to get my hair done this afternoon show part the water or she'll make it happen\nAnd and for somebody her age to have this type of business vacuum man there's something she uses square\nOkay and to you know when you pay and so you don't go to the front desk or anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent\nSo I told her I said you know I said you've got this all rock and she's like what are you me and I said you know research has shown that whatever you put in the middle that's what people are going to tap and\nThere'll be a certain percentage that will that you can guilt them into going to [laughter] you know the third call it which is the goal of all businesses that people have more money so I thought I explained to her I said so you know you're married and you got a two and a half year old and a ten month old little pictures up there the kids you know\nAnd they you know and they're trying to get a they have no you know they're getting ready for college showing their cheek bones we can really hungry or whatever it may be a said seriously\nResearch has shown so instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty percent or just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent\nFee if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I said so out of work out she goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and some people are going like thirty percent\nBut she isn't that different though because of that industry has a naturally of gratuity\nBut if the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on the screen\nSo when you're up a narrow do you tip yeah really I Do that where they keep asking because people like you keep tipping okay\nHere's the reason why gay many many moons ago I worked at Houlahan which is a bar like Houston right and and when you wait tables and I also waited tables and when I was at a a shoe\nAt a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at bat so if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want but at that but I've been there and drabs okay\nBut sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat it's I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget the ... percent\nPoint eight hundred dollars or something and ... had to tip jars\nOkay and so you know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right [noise] one was one said for all you Android people and the other ones had for all you iPhone people\nAnd the iPhone chip drivers like overflowing [laughter] and the Android One didn't\nHave anything yeah I was at a a video game thing and they said if you think the X. box\nChip here if you think the PlayStation ... it's just a ploy it's just like you said before giving people out of their money but how about this one this is a little different when we order or my sister's kids came over for dinner or something like let's just get a bunch of barbecue so we go on Amazon restaurants right a bunch of barbecue and I get the total\nAnd it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars and I was like that's a lot more than I was expecting right they automatically added on a twenty five per cent tip after also charging me a delivery fee of ... that that's really\nTough because they don't even ask you yeah and you know ... tore us for that and also overeat because they'll say like price things search\nOkay and so they add another five dollars if you order something that's under ten dollars there'll be a small order delivery charge you know or whatever it may be\nBut maybe it's like being a server at one point in my life I actually will tip the whole foods or the Amazon Prime driver or whatever it is I'll actually add more like he's like okay I got a whole foods and delivery yesterday\nAnd it was probably the it was like a hundred and fifty dollars\nShe got two things yeah I had seven and broccoli [laughter]\nWhich is probably about it and some sushi okay\nAnd if the tip was a recommended to was twelve dollars it and so so I was ten percent okay I ... I gave the guy sixteen I gave them an extra four\nOr five I Wonder what I mean the research has got to be out there that this worked otherwise the apps that are doing this the squares and stuff like that they wouldn't include it\nWell and because you know remember they're making a percentage of the total even I tip yes okay because they charge square and the other one said two point nine percent two and a half percent of as a transaction fee of the total amount right okay so if they can get that total thinking about this if they can get the total\nAmount up by five dollars I Would think the temporary dollars no no no you pay the whole transaction than what the ... what is that what is the bottom line transaction\nThen you have to pay a fee for them collecting the money and doing things like that and ... I'm Still not tipping well or is it hard it is hard and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "MetroNews TalkLine", "city": "Charleston", "day": "20"}
