West Virginia where do you\n\nSherrie Westin two more package is much like the ones packed with the fact that explosives already\nFound have been discovered today details from ABC is aren't ...\nNYPD was called to a post office on west fifty second street in midtown Manhattan just after eight am where employees discovered a suspicious package that closely resemble the others sent across the country this one was addressed a former director of national intelligence James Clapper another critic of President Trump a similar envelope addressed a senator\n... there ... there are some there are some concerns were going to get to that but in terms of overall performance in terms of winning the game and not just winning the game but in a decisive fashion because you know Brad if they had won the game and the struggle and had some turnover I mean and and been a mess you still have questions but you go okay they're back\nThere but you would and and I get a lot of credit to the players 'cause they have to go out and play but you're right on this coaching staff especially on the ... side ... data hawks and as bad as it looked against Iowa State it looked that good last night and it wasn't just execution that was play calling if you saw some different things last night that we hadn't seen the first touchdown to the game\nGary Jennings in motion running what was in essence a wheel route up the sideline wide open you saw both tied ends catch passes six tight and catches last night you saw Alex Sink we'll get back on the field after an injury he\nGets involved in the past and game from the running back position so a lot of diversity you heard David still say after the game that it was aggressive play calling Vijay ... tall that helped lead this off that's back to the promised land they were really really good last night here is\nThink about this that for a second because it makes no sense to me I I have to double check it so West Virginia scores fifty eight points running ... fifty eight points on third down to one of ten amazing how does it seem go one of ... points\nThere were there were a lot of big staff last night that one to me I Am with you that stands on that's a concern because West Virginia had been so good through the year on third down converse in one of the top ... teams in the country and like to add a gory\nUntil it got to Iowa State such two weeks in a row where third down has been a problem obviously didn't affect the outcome of last night's game but that's something you won't see very often\nYour ten percent conversion right on third down you rarely put up six hundred yards of all fenced in fifty eight point\nTwo games in a row where they were the third down has been really really bad maybe again I it meant when you looked at the Iowa State game you go okay there's an explanation for that because they were only have one down converse and I think in the Iowa State but it's the same number in this game and it cost fifty eight year\nFootball's a weird game and then happy didn't need it last night but that's something that they've got to get corrected before they get to Texas next week because generally last night the exception generally this off and just built on staying on the field and picking up first down then hitting a big play it didn't happen last night with just the one of tent\nAlright speaking of things that still are concerns Devin Bush did have the big run on the judge sweep and save on Austin was there on the sidelines of this call that the Austin you know the table and play because that's what it used to run for success we all the time\n... and the diving Bush or had that run for Seventy nine yards almost got in the end zone and but if you take that out and you look at the look at the other runs in the game West Virginia ran for just one hundred and twelve yards if you take out each other and Bush ... is that a concern yes\nThe ability to run the football is a concern you're seven games into this season now that's clearly a weakness for this West Virginia team now that's not what they want to do first they want to throw the football but you've got it has some semblance of a running game so what's really going to have to go back to the drawing board and one of the things you saw last night was will we're running in a couple more times\nYou're getting late in the season now I Know you don't need to run him against Youngstown State\nAnd it gets a bad tendency team early but now the time when I think you're going to have to start getting him involved in the running game a little bit as well whether that's on those those zone region where he pulls it if the defensive and crashes and he runs outside you saw one of those last night a color and I was ... to quarterback sneak here or there when you need a couple of yards\nThey are going to have to manufacture ways to get yards and the running game at least enough to make those linebackers respected because right now it's not very good\nTo add to your Kevin Bush that they're on that run if you add in March ... thirty three yard run sixty five percent of WB is rushing arts came on just those to carry so is it a concern moving forward yes the ... just going to have to get creative with a way to overcome that that division\nDon't I'm not even sure you I guess you overcome it by just I'm running it enough to keep the defense it honest and you're gonna win on the past you're not going to win I mean we we've talked about a week to week but you're you're not going to win by running for three hundred yards and the games\nAnd so you say you have to do what you did last night said so bill back to what you just said get to heaven Bush who's electrifying in the game find a way to get him that big play head away with that big hole up the middle Greer around the outside a couple of times where you go back into the short passing game swing it to some facts out the site or\nAcross the middle that's what this team's going to have to do because it's not suddenly going to turn into a great running team in November after you've seen two months of evidence that it's not okay\nWest Virginia with a big win over Baylor that sets up the game against Texas Texas has a rivalry game at Oklahoma State Saturday\nSo first of all before we get to West Virginia Texas about Texas and Oklahoma State who who does West Virginia want want in that game it's a great question it's a great question because for the ... you can go your way also for the\nBig twelve raised you would say you need Oklahoma states when give Texas a loss then if West Virginia can be the next to last year Texas get them out of the way\nBut from a national perspective from a marquee when position you kind of want Texas to when I go into that game against West Virginia's the five or six team in the country West Virginia moved into the top ten that's a heck of a stage next week if Texas is still undefeated in the league with just one last on the season [noise]\nYeah I don't know I mean do you want do you want the bigger stage or do you want the technical advantage on the conference for race\nBecause if you if you beat ... but we can do this\nSo if you would beat Texas and give Texas oh a law that that just push right at go right ahead of the big twelve champion it okay if Texas one of those Oklahoma Oklahoma State I should say and then you give Oklahoma it didn't give a Texas a second laws\nAnd in West Virginia which say wins out except for Oklahoma than your rematch Oklahoma into that\nSo that's what you want that so that's a potential concern till you get in Oklahoma team or program that West Virginia has it been since joining the big twelve and now you're going to be asked to beat them back to ... weeks that's a really tall order\nYeah really so I guess that what we're doing is just as it was like fantasy you can't should you even think about that or should you just say no just go play a lot of the guys over like\nMost car centers and think about it we can were fired to do that I I think I'm On the ... one of the big state I wouldn't I Want taxes to win this weekend 'cause I Want the big stage for West Virginia I Want them to have the opportunity to go in and knock off a number five numbers yeah Texas team and really be involved back in the narrow conversation\nCause because there's so much love on sex us now and so I'm from ... Texas is back to Texas is back so if they beat Oklahoma State and if they beat 'em decisively then they're going to be a giant national story for and frankly than of West Virginia goes Texas ... the story is going to be Texas it is ... which which is good which\nAs we said for decades is the perfect role for West Virginia a good West Virginia team playing with a lot of confidence and you can go in and build the chip on your shoulder that everybody's talking about taxes no one's giving you a shot go in here in shock the world so I think that's the best psychological situation for West Virginia is if Texas wins tomorrow\nYou don't want Texas has a home dog you want Texas favored by three three and a half or going into the game is whether single Mazie\nNumbers with Tom Herman the Texas head coach when he is an underdog it has an offensive coordinator or head coach twenty three and one against the spread an unbelievable number as a favorites just foreign fourteen and his last Eighteen game so yeah you want Texas to win this weekend to be the favorite western and he doesn't have them\nRead how about your new sports also we'd just recorded a three guys before the game and I just uh retweeted it it's out had Alison All right All right thanks bread I started to talk to you we'll be right back\nSure Medicare for all sounds great but this new Democrat health plan is a terrible idea especially for seniors would get hit hardest even Democrat Joe Manchin said he'd like to explore a government run health for everybody to just like the Medicare for all planned President Trump says it will end Medicare as we know it and demolish promises made to seniors and the disabled\nDrums write an election day let's protect Medicare for seniors and stop a Democratic majority vote no on Joe managing people by reviving America pac which is responsible for the content of this advertising not authorized by any candidate\nOr Kennedy's committee revive ...\nTrying confident solid solution judge William Thompson is the only experience circuit judge and division to hand in the rain for Clinton, Virginia Supreme Court judge constant is nationally recognized for his work with drug court to loosen to the opioid epidemic team battled to\nProtect children and reunite families and he'll probably for the public's trust and the Supreme Court on November ... vote for judge William Thompson paid for by will Thompson for Justice Kennedy Mary Fran Drescher\nWhen mine Lynn jacked up the price of life saving medicine five hundred percent Joe Manchin defended mine when profits not West Virginia kids no surprise mention to nearly three hundred thousand dollars from Ireland and mentions donor is ...

I was at the philosophy last night when that incident went down and from what I gather I didn't see the first part of it but I did see the um the guy that actually jumped he got ... ... another guy apparently what had happened I'm the guy that that would have jumped\nWas in a verbal argument with his girlfriend her wife\nHe apparently shoved her and that's one another guy that was behind them kind of stepped in and in order to shop and they got into it we're pushing match and um\nI the the guy she shook hands with the guy that shoved him and the woman that was with the the guy that jumped she was obviously shaken up she was crying or he the guy that the I guess what the husband of ... sat down and try to touch her and she shoved his hand away\nI thought it all calm down and then we kind of went back to watching the game and then we just heard gas and somebody behind that said oh my God he jumped\nSo I hung around ... so you were there you are in the section so you saw that confrontation\nYeah I did okay\nAnd so she was arguing with his girlfriend or wife he was arguing with a woman with him\nYeah he was they were apparently what had happened and this was after I went and got in the middle of the guys that were all really ...\nThe bigger guy shoved him I Want to call you got to calm down as much kids around and that's when the guy that shut them and said you know he if you were here earlier you with us on costs and his girlfriend and are cutting out as well as a woman and then he shoved or that's what the other guy says I I didn't see that part but I did see um the aftermath\nImminent like trying to be cozy with there's this woman and then just you just got up and like apparently this jumped over the edge\nYou but you did not see him jump\nI did not know ... ... ... or I\nLiterally was like a half a second after it happened I was at the top Michael covered saw saw were\nAnd that was in that South south end zone section\nYes it's the the old score the old\nUm screen that's on the other side it away from the curse away from the hospital\nYesterday and where are you all seats near the top\nYeah we're we're probably seven rose from the top I think his seats were probably like two or three in the top mhm\nSo ... did you did not ... you were there and you saw the argument but didn't see them jump but did you talk to others as others just said that she went to the\nUm Waldor and just jumped jumped ship just leap over\nHow far how far is that from their down to the concourse what's your best estimate oh\nIt's got to be I mean thirty to thirty to forty seem really I Would assume yeah [noise] and and if there's um\nWhat makes it even probably taller like six or seven feet tall or is that there's I'm not last that last row there's a concrete wall there there's probably five or six feet tall right to pick it up on top of that that makes it makes even farther of a draw\nYou know and they did it\nI Want to be careful you know and and you know\nYou're reliable persons while I'm trusting you to do give us the accurate eye witness news certainly sound as though you are ... did it appear that uh the individual and we should not be done if I was intoxicated or impaired in any way\nNow I couldn't tell mhm or the woman that was with him and she was she was crying and shaking and you could tell she was definitely there was something she was either scared of the situation of him and the other guy getting on the occasion where she was scared in and obviously fighting from the from the abuse from the guy\nYou know one of the two and this was just the first quarter is that right\n[laughter] yeah yeah well that's that's a terrible terrible\n[noise] and there was a bunch of little kids around you have obviously you're concerned about the altercation between the two gentleman that was my biggest concern is there's a bunch of kids are out of the guys you got to stop this there's little kids can hear you will see you\nAnd that's what that's when the imagine that I Know and that's when the individual who had stepped in and said gee you well he had shoved the woman\nYeah\nYou know ... it's a terrible terrible well\nListen to ... the I witnessed report and we're going to talk with the chief of WVU security coming up at eleven I was sick so I'll make sure you tuned in for that if we can find out the way just from their investigation\n[noise] or the topic thanks a lot [noise]\nOkay so that sounds like a credible eye witness that ... that the individual was having a confrontation with the woman that was with him another person's stepped in and become seated they eventually shake hands\nOr that just uses and then the individual um\nAfter not being able to according to this report of make up if you will with\nUs partners to give you another jumped over the wall the concourse below some thirty to forty feet below we'll talk with the head of WVU security I live in a six to ... you don't get too

B.
