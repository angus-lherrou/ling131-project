Fifteen won\nA soft answer turns away raff\nIf someone comes out you with hostility or would withdraw and maybe you don't understand exactly what that person's feelings but say there's something about fear there and they may be handled wrong they may be handling handling it simply wrong\nBut you return of soft answer not a hard one hard when it's just going to stir up a soft answer will deflated and deflected\nTo find the softer stance or you can have and take personal responsibility for that we've already talked about this and make sure you don't miss this you can't change other people\nYou can only change you well if she would only if he would not\nThat's the most unproductive thing you can do to help her relationship you work on you and was God's help do that and then respond with loving servants who could as God commands us to do\nSo we talked about in in first Peter ... Peter three seven when we started this series husbands dwell with them with\nUnderstanding it is your job it is your job\nTo love that lady like Christ's love the church and if you're a wife it is your job to respect that person and submit to him as Christ's submitted even to death on the cross\nAnd I know that seems just sort of our place in the way we typically do life together but this is what God response so I Want you to I Want you to just think about those things\nTo think about okay yes this is going on it if it has a ... it has its genesis in this desire to connect or desire to control\nAnd if he was a husband can do something to develop and bring the connection and and if your wife and do something that would seem to bring things more under control rather than\nCreating more chaos is going to help immensely is going to help eventually\nOne more verse you might wanna rock jot down first John for Eighteen first John for Eighteen\nThis this this this fear that we have that as sort of hardwired into us from from this reality here in genesis three it this fear has an antidote and first John for a team says this perfect love\nCash out here\nWhen you're\nEnveloped in love the love of\nGod predominantly\nThere's no room there it it it it fills all the space so there's no room left over\nFor for your friends are God has loved us beyond measure\nHe's promised it will never leave us for say guess\nHe loved us enough to send his own son to dial horrible death on the cross he's promised Sunday to come and they take us to live in the father's house\nWith him forever\nHe's given his promises he's given his work he's given assist his spirit he's given all these things have expressed as well if you're a believer in the Lord Jesus\nOvercome your fears by every once in a while just get into the word and immerse yourself in the love of God\nYou've been listening to the radio broadcast of mount calvary Baptist church in Charleston Mt calvary Baptist church is located at fifty known on ... avenue in Charleston West Virginia worship services nine AM eleven and sixteen now for more information to account for re W.

[laughter] so you had to go to the news service\n[laughter] you're here in Maine man break among many other young when she needs to talk he can see everything\nThat we're going to need more people passing by any ... and what are your favorite\nScene doesn't bother me then what do you begin to began\nTo their standards have been\nCrying because you're trying to convince you\nMake your point of having a hard even prior to ... what\nAre the crowd out in\nThe position of hopelessness\nHe's riding in a position of two meals me I'll be the one of the\nThings that he was blinded in his living\nThey may want to know he was able to cry you know he is going to be if you treat people they don't know [noise]\nThey don't want to remind him that\nHe's the only thing we don't want\nChance to communicate like Mark this is yeah there you go much higher communicate like me he talk forever before it gets to the point but John gospel is different John's gospel it's not just an optics it it does not go through all the the life of being a Jesus or at least the ones that were recorded\nUh through those three got was John's gospel is is very different John had a a different mandate on him in in explaining the gospel of Jesus Christ John John's concept uh in in explaining the gospel is he focused I Believe a lot more on a\nUh the [noise] the deity\nOf Christ even more so than the other gospel\nA John really focused on the deity of Christ he focused on even in in certain situations or his his own personal relationship with with Christ which is also different from the other three gospel\nOf because John I Love it or because John was a competent and who he was and he was confident in who he was around Jesus because a look you got to know who you are to refer to yourself in writing on to decipher who Jesus loves\nI'm the decider for whom Jesus loves like my kids like the you know I'm the I'm the favorite son\n\nYeah and so John John read more about the deity of Christ and he really uh really wanted to focus a lot on not not only the personhood of price but the really the the deity of Christ they wanted to focus on the origins\nOf Jesus not just the origin of when he was given birth to and a entered into the earth round but even before then and so uh this this book of John is very interesting the particularly John\nChapter one very foundational I Believe in Christianity are given the fact that even the very first ... first starts out with in the beginning\nWas the word the word was with God and the word was God\nIt's amazing how John chapter one very very much a parallel in some instances genesis chapter one genesis one starts\nOut in the beginning God John one\nOne starts out in the beginning was the word which automatically gives us the revelation that there is no separation between God and his word\nWhich means God is his word and his word is him that you you can't separate the two and that's why that's why sometimes I get frustrated with people that try to see God as outside of his word\nThat they try to comprehend God and somehow God is separate them\nWhat he has said dot is what he has said he does what he said his word and him\nOther say he was a while I don't know what got one for me he he's told us what he wants\nHe is he has revealed to was in his word\nWhile he want I don't know if God you know here's what God wants to do it well do you have a\nWord for it because if you have a word for it then that means dot set it and if God said and you have a word for it then that means God is attached to his word and we got it attached to his word and you attach yourself to his work and that means you of attached herself to God\nWho will turn out to get to\nSee a logically\nSeminary with this but uh but but there's so much to this and I don't want to miss this\nBecause first fourteen very very specifically talks about the word was made to slash and well among us uh\nThat's important the word was made flesh God made flash Jesus Christ\nMade flash God in flash God and\nFlash just as important later or because you got to understand when they're talking about the word is talking about Jesus the word or we learned in in the month of January\nThe word was the express thought of got the word was the intent of God and so therefore he cries the intent of God was made flash or the intent of God was revealed to where people could see the intent people could see a God's word\nInaction so when you when you read about Jesus and you read how Jesus I did you read how Jesus live did you read about what Jesus did then you can automatically\nAttached to it that that is God's will for my life\nBecause Jesus was the word and physical representation uh okay okay okay okay and dwell among us and we'd been held his glory the glories of don't ever gotten father full of grace and through this is an interesting passage of scripture because here John is writing and saying we've held his lowering\nThe glory as the only the gotten to the father full of grace the truth but just just a few versus before John was writing and he said he came to his own or watch as he was made flash to his own but his own did not know him and his own did not receive him oh lord I maybe we should have started about earlier\nBecause it said to as many as they received and he gave power to become the sons of gone as nearly\nReceipts have so watches that tells me that the same group of people can behold but words so will receive it in some ... some will some won't be able to hold\nThe glory but some will reject\nGlobal ring but you wonder why they couldn't receive the glory and receive him is because that can receive the package that it was in and because I couldn't received a package that it was and they were not able to receive the glory inside of the package walk for toast the religious people of the day that you expect\nThat the package to be different than what Jesus came in\nI may not get anywhere else in this tax and finished assault\nWednesday they miss the going rate but told they were looking at\nInstead as I could receive because the religious leaders of the day they were\nFor a team to come they were\nFor a change to show up but they\nThinking about the same team that God had in mind that ever looked at Burger King rotting in order style you with armor\nAnd a sword wrong they were looking for a warrior\nThat we're looking for the lion the godsend or land that we're looking for someone to show up with a big roar\nThem from the Roman rule they wanted\nOccupation of Jerusalem the Romans occupation of due to the wrong with the occupation of Israel and they wanted this came to show up and gather and army and just slice and dice the Romans but that's not how the king showed up the king showed up\nBecause he understood that they didn't need delivered from the Romans as much as they needed delivered from themselves because he didn't deliver\nThere would be another empire come and take them over why\nHistorically it proved but also people got caught up in themselves another empire would come in and rules that until they repented and then they repair the guy gave him the victory empire leave until they forget about how God deliver them and then they get caught up in themselves again\nAnd then another impact comes in and take them over and over again throughout the history and so said this time I'm not just going to deliver you from an empire physically I've got to deliver you spiritually and if I could get you delivered seriously\nThan the stuff that has dominion over your right now we won't have dominion over you later because I'm not dealing with it and what I can see that I'm dealing with it and what I Can't see or in the spirit\nAnd if I can get you for the spirit then you won't have any trouble in\nThe natural and because they didn't receive him they receive the glory that was in him\nOh lord I look there's so much principle here I could even I Can't even talk personally and tell you that or even in my own life I've gone to preach places and because they couldn't receive me for who I Am that could receive the glory that God has deposited in me so he put on not public myself up I'm just tell you I Know the graves at all my life and under what God told me to do\nAnd unless you can receive from the package that you can't receive what's in the person\nLord that's why that's why one of the dangerous places to be is hating on your pastor and still come to that church because you can't receive from him look I Would be foolish to think that everyone that came in there every week\nLike to me I Would love it if everyone\nLiked me everyone loved me and that's\nIt but what do you do you find somebody that you like until they make you mad and then you find somebody else [laughter] watch watch\nWas being revealed to Jesus Christ but they could not receive it\nBecause I didn't like the package that it has he been times when I'm gone like on Wednesday night I was gone Joe ... brother Joe most filled in preached there's a great on his life to do what he does but if you don't risk if you're only looking at the packet then you're not going to be able to receive the glory I heard I heard pass around ... just this morning on those still it\nHe said the important thing is when you come you get bread don't worry\nAbout who's cooking it as long as the bread is good I went to a seafood restaurant while I was gone I never met\nBut nothing was good I didn't care who the shrimp as long as it was season right and the word was made flash well among us oh lord\nThing to know that global reuse it in the middle of a and some people are not going to be able to receive from it because of the time and look look this is this is\nThis is a this is talk real packages or this is generational packages that there's all kinds of packages that we can't receive from the package the package a package watches watch watch watch some people some people that they can't\nAll right let me put it this way up when the when the choir was your team is up her thing or something like the blood still work that something like that to block the I'm\nHouse I'm In I was just about cultural Turks go say motorcycles us two blocks from me but watch we say something like one of us are probably somebody like well that's why for me\nBut we have to be willing to look past the package and be able to receive the glory that's in it because if not we're going to miss a move of God because most of the Tom Dart will soon they move up his story in a package that we're\nBut when you hear something in your spirit\nIf you have to say about that it doesn't matter if it's been dry for three and a half years so it doesn't\nIf people can't hear what you what if you hear it in your spirit but you got to recognize that God is back to school\nI don't have to say to know the ... all the way I don't have to see what else to understand that he is being released\nLast\nI hear a greater rate being released I hear a greater goal repaying released a I Believe a greater glories being released over your lifetime I Believe a greater glory it's going to be released over your body for your health over your mind well regrets already\n\nStarting to see this morning\n\nI Need someone just a shout out I hear\nI don't have to see I\nDon't miss it because it don't look like what you expected it to look like don't miss it causes don't look like what you expected it looked like don't miss it costs the packages different 'cause there's global ripping revealed\nFather the name of Jesus we thank you for releasing glory over our lives we thank you all the glory it's full of grace and true is full of grace the truth is it's up the phone is if you\nDid everything we need you have supplied everything we need you have\nSupplied it's our it's our it's our\nHallelujah every I close every I close before we leave this place today but we believe that Jesus

can be found in the New Testament portion of your few Bible on page one Fifteen\nBut Thomas who was called the twin one of the twelve was not with them when Jesus came so the other two cycles told him we have seen the lord but he said to them unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands and put my finger and the market the nails in my hand and his side I Will not believe\nA week later his disciples were again in the house and Thomas was with them although the doors are shut Jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with you\nThen he said the Thomas put your finger here and see my hands recharge your hand and put it in my side do not doubt but believe\nThomas answered him my lord and my God Jesus said to him have you believe because you've seen me was that are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe\nThis is the word lord\n\nBefore I started I Want to say a couple of things actually for people on the radio but we're in the room and will benefit from what I'm about to say\nIt is this this beautiful sanctuary I sit here Sunday after Sunday looking at it and it is very beautiful and I think about these windows we have these six windows on either side of us paid for by the women's group a long time ago they tell the story of Jesus' life in six panels\nAnd I'm On it I'm going to refer to this one over here this one up front\nIt is Jesus resurrection as I understand that\nWe're Jesus looks brilliant and whites and I'm In the middle and there are soldiers cowering at his feet and there are two angels they're around him\nAnd so that portrays the resurrection and I'm going to be referring to that and that event is referred to by these four people in these medallions up here we don't really have many medallions\nI'm On the wall that are not a part of the stained glass but I sit here and I look at these and we stand and sit under these four pitchers these pitchers that reminds us of the four gospel writers and the church is in the shape of across\nAnd at the foundation of the dome that seems to be having almost reaching down to us at\nThe foundation of where the cross meets the dome of having is the gospel writers and they to mention the resurrection and so I'll be referring to that later and just for our radio audience so they know what I'm referring to\nOur passage today comes from corn and it's corn was a very interesting place I Want to just give you a little bit of background information before I read it so that you understand the meaning of what's going on their\nKoran towards the city that at its peak had about two hundred thousand people and was located in a unique location on a ... between two c's\nAnd people would instead of going around the horn so to speak they would cut across at this it's miss they would bring the traders would bring their ships on one side\nAnd they would either hall the freight to the other side it was about three to five miles depending on where you were to the other side or if your boat was small enough they literally drought drug the boat up and over the hill to the other see and then it continued on this was advantageous for them\nAnd this being lot having a place that there is lots of trade there is lots of opportunity to have wealth and be a part of that trade and to benefit from the very fine things coming from all over the place both east and west and so this was a very wealthy place\nAnd it was a place also known to have a very interesting morals on there's a um a mountain there that had a temple to Africa daddy the goddess of love and it was known to have 'em as many as one thousand temple prostitutes\nAnd ... was a city known to have very lax morals in fact\nIt was an insult to call someone a Corinthian because it was saying they had low morals\nAnd so corn was a city kind of like New York and perhaps Las Vegas and San Francisco kind of all rolled up into one and when the gospel writers or when the Bible writers write about the gospel coming to this place when Paul brought the gospel here\nThey would have read with anticipation\nHow is the gospel going to do in such a place as Koreans\nAnd so that's what we're looking at here today there were there it was a church that struggle they did have those difficulties and it's one of the few churches that um that actually received two letters um a rare distinction\nThere um that our church would received two letters but they were challenged with many different things\nThere was actually a third letter written by comment of Rome the bishop of Rome\nAnd it almost got included in the Bible but they decided not to include it because Clementi was not\nAs close to Jesus um in in time and in physical place and so they excluded it but you can still read it and it's very uh very at a fine letter and trying to encourage a church that struggles and struggles", "show_name": "MetroNews TalkLine", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "14"}
