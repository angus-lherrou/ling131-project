know if this guy just won't learn this president won't learn he won't listen to\nHis eat them and let me ask you a question now this is very important 'cause I I don't it was a huge mistake he's gotten rid of all the pragmatist ... there's been some good people in this administration yes there has\nTillerson is one and uh I'll tell you another was um how one was while he was really good and a\nAnd also think you know he's about to run over ... who's probably the best defense secretary you've ever had and right and he's um and he's going to run those sessions who even though edu logically I disagree with him I think he's a decent guy and he's going to run him all this\nWork despite all for all the things are they really are they holding these guys to rent yeah these\nAre direct quotes from 'cause they almost all of them let him use a a a tape recorder and ...\nWhy would you allow that\nAh the information this chapter come primarily from multiple deep background interviews with firsthand sources\nAnd in the introduction it talks about that almost all of them let him actually tape recording and most of the book is is quotations most you know Seventy percent of the book is quotations we know you know where they just type from the from the tape recorder\nAnd the end of what you know what amazes me most cities are really bright guys going to try to educate him on terrorists in doubt saying you know John Dowd who who finally resigned\nAnd yet the best lawyer he had the ... the Goldman Sachs he's a smart guy it's really\nA these are real smart guys had and they both end up saying you know now say that we can't let him testify 'cause he lives\nHe can can you imagine if you were a lawyer and trying to represent a client like that who won't and listen to all\nThat is why Dowd resigned yeah All right exactly Fred ...

but suppose for purposes of a trial of impeachment the Senate adopted a set of rules that said the respond where the chief justice work or anyone\nHas no right to testify in an in an impeachment trial has no right to call witnesses has no right to cross examine witnesses I think it would be appropriate in such a circumstance for the judicial branch to say wait a minute\nYou're depriving people of fundamental constitutional rights if the house of delegates impeached a member of the court for something that's not a one\nOf the enumerated grounds for impeachment article for\nSection on Mount ministry ration corruption neglect duty high crimes and misdemeanors et cetera you know but impeach somebody because you're in a third term and we don't think you should have three terms of uh\nOh you're oh you're oh you're black or a woman or you park and the cats they have something I don't\nThink it is I I don't think it ... the legislatures authority is absolute to speak unchecked\nWhich early on that on it but where is the again separation of powers amounts of where is the balance where does the Supreme Court provide\nThat safety net if you will for a defendant's rights without usurping the constitutional authority of the ... of the legislature to conduct impeachment\nWell it it's a very careful balancing and I think the the balancing has perhaps been exceeded in this case although that opinion issued last Thursday\nOh by the Supreme Court ah speaks of the separation of powers and and the importance of the it here it's an observation that doctor and\nYou know I think there are a couple of areas where the uh the court didn't the judicial branch did not stay in the third way\nMhm right so there there there could be reconsideration by the court this decision could be fine tune or or change you know generally I Know you had other points you want to make and I want to get the opportunity but let's let's take this thing back\nA little bit and because I think everybody wants resolution or most people want resolution and they might want different kinds of resolutions here\nBut we want some sort of end game here in your opinion as the as a lawyer as the Senate Judiciary committee chairman how do we get out of this how do we resolve this\n... you know the the two things we talked about the very commencement of the of our conversation a won the request for re hearing ask the court to consider few things that clearly did not consider for instance\nI think the court was incorrect when it said that the legislature has no role\nA than a U.S there and can have no role in establishing the payer compensation for a retired judges who are temporarily assigned to serve in judicial circuits on occasions when you have circuit judges who were\n... that sort of thing I think that was an incorrect decision by the court I think the article eight of the constitution gives that authority to the legislature set salaries for judicial officer since express\nSo that is that is that is the case then the judiciary can't just say well we're going to make up something here we're going to do something else and we can do that because we control our budget\nThat that's correct okay now you know ... and now the other part of that is and I talked about this at some point on the floor of the Senate you know the cases was framed up in a way that was\nInappropriate and didn't allow for a proper education of the case the house of delegates was not named as a party so a great\nPortion of the complaints that justice workman chief justice workman raised\nAnd the presentation of a petition to the Supreme Court\nRevolve around things at the house did or didn't do\nBut the case doesn't name the house as a party names only the Senate so you know to to put of fine a point on a hobby you know you wouldn't you wouldn't follow complaint with the Supreme Court and say the house did things incorrectly and name as the defendant the division of motor vehicles\nYeah or the Amish in Iraq or culture and so the Senate is the ... to get to where he body and impeachment proceeding and quite frankly not the appropriate party to defend the actions of the house on this point on the Senate floor is this had bought before this red probation\nHad the court not issued this red probation the members of the Senate would likely have been called upon to answer and resolve\nAdjudicate some of these very same questions so I I think you know\nThe case or if the case at the Supreme Court is going to review and I don't know they should or could but if they're going to review what the house of delegates did they cannot or should not do it without the house of delegates being a party to the case\nIn the house again this is a legal point in the house should respond I mean the house didn't initially didn't want to respond because it wasn't name and then to if they did respond they were in the view of the house leadership justifying that the Supreme Court had\nUm had some jurisdiction here but now you're saying you think the house if there is a filing for reconsideration that the house should respond and make its arguments as to why what it did was proper that what you're saying\nAbsolutely okay up slowly and it's not\nIt's not for the Senate or to the side that are argue that that's the that's the that's the house the Senate doesn't know we weren't their hobby I made this point on before the Senate I deliberately try as hard as I could knowing that I Would have a robot is essentially as a juror in the case\nNot to watch or listen to the house proceeding\nTherefore in a lot of it and therefore the inappropriate for the Senate to respond and defend what the house did so I get I get that point now so also Charlie and finally it is I mean there's a timeline here right because the elections less than three weeks away and what if there's a new Supreme Court ah after that time\nWell uh I don't know if there is a ... there'll be there'll be to judge\nThe right vacancies on his record now that will be filled in the November election I guess those ... results will get certified and late November December and a ... office will be taken after that ah\nThe governor has appointed right now a on a temporary basis to people to fill those vacancies so\nWell they'll have to sort that out Charlie finally again that that again I Know this really gets down into the to the legal and technical weeds but it's it's the central to understand what's going on now but how anxious argued just to get some now some resolution or just get some resolution here so we can move on\nWell we need resolution we of course the two things we need resolution we needed ... we have to we have to restore public confidence in the judiciary a we have to fix this um and but but I'll say this hobby yesterday we have to do it correctly we've got to do it right\nYou know we've got to make sure that the provisions of the constitution are followed a ultimately while the court among the branches of government is the final arbiter the final final arbiter of what the Constitution's going to say is the is the citizens\nThe papal West Virginia writes constitutions it's there it's our it's our seed document at the highest authority there isn't it come from the people and ultimately the people will decide what the constitution says or should say right now this year you know you I'm sure you've done programs on both these we have\nTo amendment right on the ballot that the citizens will consider both of those arise out of actions of the judiciary you know one of the prophet get spending of the Supreme Court and the question presented to the citizens is whether or not there should be a check up some con on the judiciary ability to\nJust reach into the treasury and take money and spend it as a ... I think that check needs to exist you know the other\nIs the other amendment that the people will consider arises from a decision a bad decision by the Supreme Court a holding that or the west in the constitution provides a right to government funded elective abortion rights or anyone who can't pay for\nYeah that's the panel pinto decision to work on a highway and we got to get caught up on that we're going to spin and we've got a couple of weeks off we're going to spend time on that makes sure people know what they're voting about Charlie Trump Republican Morgan county\nChairman of the Senate Judiciary committee Charlotte you always have good insights appreciate you coming on I'll be my pleasure rate that thank you very much right back\nStanding with over nine thousand female farmers in the mountains name the twenty Eighteen women in agriculture conference every second and third in wheeling symbol the resorting conference center\nHere in Bahrain speakers including the mill pharmacies in Miami and marketing business livestock and other birds all helping agar women grammar dominant on their\nFarms and and then then and helping their voices be heard extension on MTV you dot edu slash conferences for more now to register the message sponsored by the west Virginia Farm Bureau\nIn New York court what do you want\nAnd adjusting Robert Frank candidate for West Virginia Supreme Court will bring much needed honesty integrity and clarity to a court which has lost its way Robert Frank as twenty eight years experience representing ordinary people facing extraordinary challenges Robert Frank's experiencing constitutional litigation family law pharmaceutical cases and other complex\nMatters is needed on the court though Robert J Frank for West Virginia Supreme Court\nThey were granted about eighty percent of traditional rate making treatment company officials say the money is needed for infrastructure improvements from the metro news anchor desk I'm Shawn Johnson [noise]\nToday's program present in part by mileage delivering better health for better West Virginia is no job it's our mission think about this for a second\n[noise] twenty four years ago ... years ago in West Virginia not that long ago really two out of every three voters in West Virginia where Democrats sort of every three voters were Democrats\nAnd over time those numbers have shifted dramatically and there was there were there was a handful of independent no party affiliation voters letters changed pretty significantly in fact I was looking at the numbers for\nA voter registration at the end of September\nAnd these are not final before the election intercept timbre of forty two percent of all voters were Democrats thirty two percent or Republican twenty two percent no party we send a cult independent but no party affiliation\nTwenty two percent and as Jeff Jenkins reports story at W. B. metro news dot com\nSince the may primary Republicans and voters with no party affiliation of made up the largest number of new registered voters\nGoing to stick to the states office Gen thousand three hundred eighty five state residents of registered as Republicans since may eight or nine thousand four hundred sixty seven I registered as being members of no party\nSeven thousand seven hundred and forty to register as Democrats so you know Republicans have had some games they're Republicans over the years have been around twenty eight thirty thirty two percent Democrats have been a steady decline independence no party affiliation has been on the rise rubber up as a\nPolitical science professor at West Virginia Wesleyan he follows these things and he joined us on veterans ... professor good morning what's going on here [noise] [noise] well\nThe the key question is and why they changed the question historians who Alaska's wide for eighty years did the Democratic party dominate a state state\nPolitics [noise] uh but as far as what you pointed out the number of no party I guess what we we are mountain areas where libertarians we're always free so is it not surprising that in this time\nOf party transition we're having a major people saying I don't want to sign up for either one\nIs that is that a rejection of politics or a rejection of the parties because people are angry at politics in general are they just don't want to be a ... with a party and they'd rather vote for the person or a combination of those things\nWell I I think I think it's a combination of those things but what we're seeing you know you have to realize both Democrats and Republicans of neurons since\nEighteen forty and fifty a and a\nAnd you know and and they're still here with us today offering is a a two choices are and I just think that and it's not just happening in West Virginia is happening national the fastest group they call themselves independent but the key thing is they don't want to sign up for either party\nMhm rubber up is whether it's West Virginia Wesleyan political science professor Rob knocked at all or go\nIf you wanted to vote in the primary you had to be a member of the Democrat or the Republican Party to be part of their nominating process which frankly\nMade some sense but in order to try to expand their ... their interests they eliminate that so now you don't have to be a member of the Republican or democratic parties to vote in their primary that was a big sea change our started big sea change I think you agree\nYes the ... because\nThey both you know that they were both playing the game that help themselves and basically in West Virginia the was the primary that was more important than the general election you know happy I kept saying that there are three parties Republicans Democrats in West Virginia Democrats [laughter]\nBecause it wasn't just a big tent it was the only can't if you are an ambitious politician or if you want to vote or who wanted to you know have a say in and who's running your ...\nYou had to join the Democratic party because it was so dominant at that time but now we've seen it but again happy the interesting thing is that the Democrats\nIn less than a decade of lost a hundred thousand voters\nThe Republicans have picked up only sixty thousand of those voters which means that you know there are a whole lot of non party people\nYeah yeah that's true also for the Democrats let's face it West Virginia's an older state and you have people who were as as a long time as you alluded to a longtime blue states since Nineteen thirty do rightly or that I guess what I'm those folks are dying [laughter]\nI mean I'm not laughing about that I'm just saying they're dying off\nNote that people have come up to me and said well I'm a I'm a Kennedy Democrat I mean that we're going back to John Kennedy Nineteen sixty because they think the Democratic party a slip\nBut here's an ... interesting factor we approach politics like who do religion and if we don't like the religion we usually just don't go to church we don't switch to another religion is seems to happen in parties a lot of those West Virginia Democrats\nAre ready to leave that have already left the Democratic party but they're not ready to go\nRepublican so this is a nice place where they can park themselves\n... Rob ... and Rob Rob is with this West Virginia Wesleyan political science professor why hasn't this friend contributed to the rise of a third party\nBecause they're great structural a constraints on this I mean we've been waiting for a third party for the last\nFifty years um and the interesting thing happy is always bet on institutions even when they don't work that means Congress in both political parties you could say\nBut it we've just been unable to break out of the two parties and and I don't know how it's going to be done but I've been looking for a long time and it hasn't even gotten on the rise and\nBut this might if you have an independent candidate maybe for president in twenty twenty and rally and saying I don't want to either one of these\nI Want what's good for the country [noise] that may shake things up but we'll wait\n... speaking of third parties the mountain party\nHas very nominal registration are only about two thousand one hundred and forty seven that says of the end of September so just over two thousand that's zero point one seven percent\nLibertarian six thousand two hundred Seventy five as of the end of September this this zero point five one percent than there is no party\nOr a mess that was twenty two percent then there's others or their constitution importing some other things that's two point four percent\nRight in happy and we're not alone in this all the other forty nine states a third parties are very difficult to start up because you know they're ... they're losing their ... and not going to win\nSo the only way they can get respectability has to win but didn't tell her that they had to be recognized [noise]\nIt it will lick looking for change has probably as it's gonna happen it's gonna come into one of one ended up on both parties rather than waiting for for that third party to appear in and a shake up politics\nSo you're saying that the why go to a third party would be that one of the traditional parties would split is that what you're saying that that's that's the ...\nNo ... some independent candidate okay a bit you know would would come out and then form his own party that's already happened in France that the president of France formed his own party and and did it\nAnd it's happening in a couple of other countries you you had some charisma addict person come out and say I don't belong to either one and I go ahead and France literally had had a had a functioning party system until suddenly I think it went from two percent to fifty two person\nYou know the other thing Rob is the trend has been I I remember watching a speech by Harry Truman I think he was my maybe giving the state of the union or something\nAnd he mentioned his party and the advantages of his party over the Republican Party time after time after time it reminded me that admit more at one time to be a member of a particular party and to subscribe to those ideals that seemed like a tighter knit group\nAnd now you have the politics of individuals individuals running and they don't necessarily embrace a party identification it's a it's a personal identification more than a party identification you agree or disagree\nHere no I agree it ... ... you eat you eat a vote for the personality that policy or the party\nAnd what's gone down the most is party just look look at these the yard signs how many had party identification and I'll tell you something else to say how many have reelect so\nYou don't want to tell them you're a politician let alone that you belong to a party\nRobber up West Virginia Wesleyan political science professor ... always a pleasure thank you sir\nOkay take care Bye bye are coming up next\nThe when when the teachers strike as we heard from a lot of teachers who said you really need to know what's going on in the classroom their discipline problems the parents don't back\nThat was a heck of a load there that teachers indicating what teachers are up against Rick\nThat's Laura wash them she teaches at a at walnut hills high school in Cincinnati which is one of these you know very prestigious urban high schools you've got to take\nAn exam to get into right and they ... and it's a Latin school you have to take Latin seventh through ninth grade and I called that teacher last night is that that I just want to make sure that you know ... this this\nPerson really is comfortable and understand you know the strong sentiments and and and you know which he told me it was even you know it was it was just as just as the separate she's very frustrated by these mandates\nFrom the state telling telling them what to do that they don't feel is is a is really tailored are appropriate to the teaching of Latin\nOr they had to sit through a a session a three hour session talking about how to improve English\nPerformance or when they do the same thing in Latin department for teaching Latin and and so they're saying well why are we sitting here you know through through this a while we could be teaching kids in the last time you know this frustration you see it broadly almost everywhere\nRick and we're also seeing there's a there's a ... you might have seen this is not in your old story I don't think that there are a CD is out what their new report their annual report and math scores are are are bad\nOr in continuing to decline we're we're not seeing our kids come out of high school college ready or in many cases and all these things are this is the larger qualities things kind of tied together do you think\nThere's no question there tied together obviously the question is what do we do about it and you know to some extent who do we blame\nAh many people feel that there's been this what they call a moral panic about American education performance and in that environment you look for a scapegoat\nAnd in many cases the classroom teachers been scapegoat even though as you know and it said there's a lot of other factors such as the spending on education and things like that ah but it seems to focus\nIn fall down on the on the classroom teacher partly because the classroom teacher is in fact the single most important\nFactor that

the Senate had taken the deal I I Wish that they had um accepted what was essentially a plea bargain\nThat would lead to censure for workman and Walker and a fourth Walker got an anyway 'cause she went ahead with their trial and was acquitted but except ... century ... century\nAnd then work when was the same deal and then I excepted which the Senate had accepted Charlie Trump's motion to drop the articles of impeachment against Davis mhm\nThat would put us about where we are but without all the overriding questions and you know it matters would have been in the legislatures own hands they would have a they would have accepted that deal and and that would have been there doing rather than the court system imposing the current situation\nYeah and and now it is a now ... there's\nA struggle here too because there is a practical which we've just talked about and then there is a more [noise] um ... global but a a a larger issue of separation of powers and who sort of gets the final say on these kinds of things\nUh who has greater power to decide\nHow this is all carried out and\nWhere where in New territory on that too because at that argument has never been going forward on impeachment so this is new territory on that\nYeah and it it if it would seem to affect any other impeachment trials in the future\nA particularly if they relate to the judiciary so I I Do think that in the long run you want to get greater definition\nOf a we're we're the boundaries are and if you were the legislature and you think that you've been been overridden to some degree on your own procedures than I think you do want you're kind of obligated to have some pushback on look these were our procedures unity sure I have no say so on the matter I think you're going to work\nThat out have bred macaroni is with us and bread for ... for those of you who are still listening and don't just go way when we start talking about this because this story is now in terms of reporting to you our listeners and readers it's brutal\nIt's brutal I mean we know because we talk about it we know that this is awful uh for you to try to sort through but it but we're in a conundrum too because it's relevant I mean you're talking about the impeachment of Supreme Court justices\nAnd these are the steps that are going on but it is Brad you take it from there I was just a tangled to explain to folks what's going on and and I I feel compelled almost to apologize\nBut I just I hate this cliche but it is what it is [laughter]\nIndeed it is and it has been for a year and it of course began with the controversy over the renovations with the office\nCan we just got back to the couch yeah easy to understand the\nCouch you could wrap your arms around him frankly as a legal matter the couch and the enlisted floor have very little to do with any of the ... right ... it's all other stuff\nUh but yeah it's been going on for a year now involves all five of what had been our Supreme Court as recently as spring all all these people were on the court in the spring now now some of them are not a ... but it's also taking shape at various levels of of the court system federal courts\nAh the Supreme Court itself\nOr the house was involved with sin is involved so to try to go back and explain what I found myself wondering you know how much do I need to tell people about what the actual charges are against these ah justices [laughter]\nYou know that now do people still think it's about office decoration [laughter]\nWell we were stuck in this another world of process stories\nWhich just that like this is the latest this is the latest step in this and there's not last times there's not a resolution is is kind of the process which can be mind numbing Lee boring but again because of the stakes here because of the stakes you have to be on it so\nYeah and you know I mean even the issue of which Supreme Court are you talking about that's not normally a question and it drew I mean I keep talking about the main Supreme Court a Supreme Court prime but there was a substitute\nSupreme Court to to suspend justice law free uh there was a substitute Supreme Court to uh consider justice workman's appeal to the Supreme Court\nAnd I think there was one other one and it just gets it looked like what what are the ones where there are other court there you know and we can a color coded uh yeah so it gets like\nRidiculous to the point of humor and even the issue of of if the Senate is going to ask for a motion to uh to to reconsider this matter who are they even appealing to to the the substitute court or to the court\nThat comes out of the upcoming election [laughter] yeah\nDid you ever had I tell ya there there have been ... incidents in work and in life where you often feel like that you're going backward mean typically in life we were trying to go forward right we're we're doing things that are the ... things and we're moving forward right or sometimes we feel like we're stuck\nBut sometimes you have to start out on a trip\nAnd you say okay the we're all packed up are ready to go and then you start out and you have car problems\nAnd then you get lost and then you realize you left something behind and then you take a wrong turn and then somebody in the car gets sick and go to and and you know you're you're now you're going backward you're ... the more things that happened the farther away you're getting from your destination\nAnd that's what it feels like now it feels like all these things are getting us farther away from a resolution or destination you agree or disagree or maybe they're all or maybe I'm wrong and they're really actually toward the destination is just mind numbing Lee technical\n[laughter] the the headline in the Washington Post this

I'm In as a mountaineer fan I mean we cover them but also I went here or there I'm In panic mode because just what you just said and because of what has happened the last couple of games I mean the offensively it's just gone off the rails\nAnd and and it it's one thing if you're struggling offensively any way and you have a bad game but this thing has gone from a peak from a high level of efficiency from oh my gosh the they're unstoppable and they had these receivers who could possibly stop them to just what you cite a statistic is Iowa State I say it's time to panic\nYeah I mean ... had this metric in his head that they needed a scored in the mid forty right to win this year and that's not an average so you know the fifty two against ... feet into that so you're thirty five short yeah against the Irish so yeah and I actually I Would say you're actually\nTake away none of that because the defense got you seven and the safety gave to back to the office was\nOnly scored five points net against I okay I hear that it's um that's an example that would not have won this game in Nineteen sixty seven [laughter] you know back in the days where you know he's got his that was it just it was a shootout so my problem with this off and it's the same thing we saw last year at times is\nA good day is a really good the bad days\nYou fall off a cliff and you have nothing that you feel like you can go to there are a lot of great office out there that don't score forty or fifty in a game but when it gets time to do something they didn't really down and down there and there are things that they can do and they take advantage of penalties they they they grind out a couple of drive to make a competitive western\nGate located at local Kansas State did yeah I mean look at Kansas State which was so bad we saw that we were terrible and the bill Snyder took control of the officers who gives his way the way here's what we do know offensive line blocks guys and then the running back follows the block or the quarterback runs in ...\nAnd then when the game I mean that they did what they found they rediscover their identity and they won their last game yeah how do you not\nRun the ball a little bit makes them short passes do whatever you need to do to adjusted the three I think and just be competitive it was really want the game for most of the second half and West Virginia never crossed midfield then you get that why you tell\nMe I mean what are you are at the press conference yesterday just does what's dangerous or what does he like he\nBasically says they often divine didn't hold blocks which I think we've seen pockets of problems with the off into von maybe ... defensive coordinators are going to figure out hey this is what they can't handle right now and so as much as people scream project started on his head right now\n... had two years as the main office of line coach and things have not gone well during those two years I'm not going to bring up the fact that rock crook is\nOften defined coach for six no Cincinnati today I'm not going to bring that up or appreciate you not do it um but but then there's plenty of blame to go around and the receivers to getting frustrated when their initial route that and get open the whole the whole game as soon as a scramble drill where your first routes weren't going to be open so everybody's crisscrossing and\nDoing why weren't that because if the west Virginia wants to be sensitive way man to man 'cause they think they can beat him Mm right you have this don't do the the the ... the whole time\nDay they were dropping six six at least and sometimes up to eight but uh what I thought was was a genius on their part was that would bring these blitz is\nWith the safety right Fifteen or twenty yards off the ball and won't even trying to time the snap to give it away because I think they anticipate the fact that will will go through a couple of progression was and then he'll roll out and look for somebody what would that safety athletic bearing down on them that took\nThat away that was a great strategy by which they they had that high safety the third the third safety ... now sometimes I think he did shoot up like he would start coming up and I mean he was in the backfield either they were trying to time to snap and one\nIn his ... and nobody if you're an office of Wyman though the brilliance there about the play by ... if you don't account for that guy yeah you're not you account for a while and and and and the wind back there but you're not accounting for the safety\nAnd that's a long way to get home till we drop in seven that I think the gamble was that they can defend and cover for two point five seconds and that guy has a chance to uh to prevent Iran from getting us out of pocket\nLet me get back to the panic then you don't know this because you you are so limited now and access to employers employers tend to say\nWhat they say and what do you think the ... what do you think the atmospheres of do you do you think they're shaken not shaking shaken\nYeah I'm not stirred I think that there there's they're trying to grapple and find something that they can always go to and this game show them that you don't have that thing\nYou you would typically say if somebody dropped say we're going to be around the ball and throw short and get it done they didn't do that so what happens when taxes is up in your face with better defensive linemen and you know I don't know what they can go to right now with any sort of confidence that they can run against me but\nAll right let me see if the let's say there's a there's a big news story and uh it's a big story and we're trying to you know there's a lot of confusion things like that but you go to a Jeff Jenkins Shawn Johnson or Alan sailor or Chris Lawrence and you say figure it out\nYou know what to do do it and they will they'll figure it out it ... my analogy here is you have a highly you have a highly compensated\nCoaching staff okay and you have some stability coaching\nOr their figure it out and you have some talent you ... you have an NFL caliber quarterback you have a ... decent running backs you have outstanding receivers and you have a defense it's fast probably over performing figure it out yeah that's your job yeah\nBe competitive against a team that's two and three and the fourth quarter I ... I think a lot of a sticker that would be a tough game that would come down to one possession none of us thought that Iowa would be killing the final five minutes when West Virginia\nShould've yeah she was not the issue is not that Iowa State won the game and the issue is how West Virginia performed and throughout that game often someone that's the issue\nYeah and when you've got a senior quarterback that you're building everything around this year\nAnd he doesn't so confident either in his office to blind or the other night I think he has some capability issues because it it clearly wasn't they athletic guy he was before because of that ankle I think that fed into it as well\nUm where do you go there's gotta be something you ... down to and and just just to make sure you get Seventeen to twenty on a board to be competitive and they couldn't even do that\n... the office net five points and I was state net five\nYou're in panic mode\nI've seen this movie before and I we were assured all pre season was just wasn't going to happen again and then you go to hold her son's history of second half poor performance is that some of that because you play Oklahoma and the second half every year you play taxes and say I get that if the conference these and you're going to have a drop off\nUm but right now you know thank goodness I'd got eight days for Baylor to try to get something cook and again I'm but\nWell ... the Baylor game the Baylor game looms extremely large because of what's up in November and if you lose the Baylor game you're season on the brink mhm yeah yeah I mean I'm ... now now you're just now you're just hanging on", "year": "2018", "show_name": "MetroNews TalkLine", "city": "Charleston", "day": "17"}
