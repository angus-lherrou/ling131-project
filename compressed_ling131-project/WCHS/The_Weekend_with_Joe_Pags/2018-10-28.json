certainly did moving to a five and two records as they want in a double overtime thriller against the Miami of Ohio red hawks who felt to three and five it was that the legendary Mikey stadium in West Point New York\nWhere the Miami of Ohio red hawk scores fourteen points in the fourth quarter\nTo force the game in overtime their\nArm reflects the mental and physical toughness that has led them to ten consecutive home victories and their overall five and to record this season they were led by the old fashioned quarterback for that combination as south more camp Thomas filling in\nFor Kelvin Hopkins ran for a hundred and thirty seven yards and one touched down and the fool that combination of down now wolf all can Andy David some carved out the red hog defense for a combined one hundred and thirty five yards and three touchdown\nBeing a former fooled by myself you know that warm I hardly any\nI I can feel it already you know we're on the other side of the state from each other\nAs right as we look at the statistics and the tail of the tape\nYou know it was very interesting that Miami of Ohio actually won the total often yard it's statistic with four or six times armies three forty seven partly that was distorted because an army kind of reverted to their last year's form of zero passing yards but nonetheless\nThey were able to prevail they had zero turnover as did the red hawks but an army did\nWhen the time of possession battle thirty six to twenty three the game balls will go to as a fill am sophomore camp Thomas as I mentioned with a hundred and thirty seven yards\nAnd one touched down and he lives have Riley who made the key stop in overtime to keep the red hawks from scoring as they went for two\nAnd to keep that ten\nGame home winning streak in tech for the black night\nI got to love that this is going on there and you'll in front of freedom we're discussing germs academy football when Roberts yeah I was happy with my black nights are really afraid I'll give you my brother in law salute or something\n[noise] uh [laughter] he saved the day that's right and\nThey didn't do so well against it but it was not a bad game\nNo you know can we said they can ... the amount of low low had a tough task this year as a navy schedule just looks ... he was facing three undefeated teams\nThe first one was going to be a Houston then he's got Notre Dame and then after that as University of central Florida so there's no risk for the weary and nobody's going to feel sorry for you out there but the mid ship and put up a good bad or good site for\nAgainst the Houston Cougars but just fell short you know they're continuing to play good football they been bitten by the injury bug a little bit\nBut of course as we mentioned they mix have Notre Dame coming up\nAnd it's a home game but not quite on the Chesapeake it's going to be on the Pacific [laughter] as they held the game and San Diego California\nHill navy again like you said\nThey did their best and ah best was not good enough but again you don't ever like to lose but be humiliated is different than certainly did not happen no\nWay I mean like I say cannot me a model oh well he's doing an amazing coaching job but it sometimes it just doesn't show six and a\n... at least in the records and now that's what you have going on and look they are going to a rebound at some point like I say this might not be there year but of course there's always the game at the end of the season against army which they can put their all and all that too especially if they fall short of ... ability\nSpeaking of ... ability let's turn the air force as they yes down to the University of Nevada Las Vegas running rebels forty one thirty five\nAnd a friday night mountain west shootout in Las Vegas Nevada Airforce quarterback guys they offenders accounting for four touchdown and three hundred Ninety yards of total ... to propel the falcons to their first conference when all\nOf the season over the struggling un Elvie rebels who are windowless conference play trailing Twenty one Thirteen and the second quarter air force took control of the game was twenty eight consecutive points to jump ahead forty wanting to Twenty one\nThe falcons held on to that lead and the fourth quarter\nWith the defense of stop on fourth down to solidify the wind was under two minutes left to play as we look to the key stats or the game into law fence Airforce I'll gain you and I will be five Seventy two to four hundred and in a surprise status if the game Airforce pass for two hundred and Seventeen yards\nThey also had a substitute quarterback Isaiah Sanders as their starter\nWas entered in the previous game and I say is that Sanders really a came in and also received a game ball\nWith nine out of eleven passing for two hundred and Seventeen years and one touched down any added wanting one carries on the ground for a hundred and Seventy three yards and three touchdowns source stellar game\nFrom I as a as a Sanders and\nNow the game ball also goes to Ronald Cleveland the senior flex back from Franklin, Tennessee who flashed his style of speed with three reception for a hundred yards including a longer sixty nine and edits six cares for forty yards and on the defensive side of the ball\nFor six five two hundred and Seventy pounds suffer more defensive lineman Jordan Jackson from Jacksonville, Florida\nWas the one who knocked away the fourth out past the ice the game for the falcons he's going to be a good one for the falcons in years to come next

Sports network at seven pm eastern time\nAnd will Navy is going to host Notre Dame in San Diego\nSan Diego you know then they wonder if that they can and we try to do is they tried to play Markey games in states that are fertile with recruits\nFor each of those teams if you look up and down baby schedule navy army and air force of course recruit nationally and so especially where there's a heavy navy ambulance I Believe as large navy base over in\nThat as much as ... you know I've been there yeah and\nSo I actually have a brother station in San Diego so\nIt is a huge navy base cued recruiting territory for navy\nAnd so uh you know between the navy and Texas and Florida you'll see that our came to try to get those three states as those have historically been fertile ground for good football player smart football players and of course scholars patriots as well\nYou bet and arming will be in our home state of Michigan plane eastern Michigan\nThey will and uh this is before of course they're a tune out for their game next year's they traveled to an hour to play the University of Michigan but ah eastern Michigan is a is playing pretty good football this year you know they uh they've lost a few close calls but they want from big games in so\nUh this is going to be a big game but I tell you what\nArmy is just a very impressive with a way they're playing both mentally and physically there ... ... ... is it still real toughness in that program to adversity that as I get them down or they believe in one another they stay true to who they are\nAnd uh and more often than not they prevail based on those factors allowed\nClinton thank you this is awesome we're going to charge on and we'll talk next week to see how accurate your crystal ball\nHow right that it sounds
