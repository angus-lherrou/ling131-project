football time now on the show and joining me of course is football cohost Clinton Robert ah howdy palette you or your air force academy reunion last week or two\nThirtieth reunion then a my how ... is a it was a great time to be a Colorado Springs Colorado beautiful weather walk up to about eighty two as we over or able to look at pikes peak and watch a pretty good game\nAs well even though the falcons did not prevail\nWell as we were talking before\nTheir second half was a whole lot better than the first half wasn't\nIt really was standing in the first pass a playing the Nevada wolf pack where they sell twenty to twenty five the first half was really I really a catastrophe was bad foot about it is no sugar coating it no way around that\nArea and worth meant just could not get anything going for the ... the defense Everytime you looked up from talking to my buddy's there was another past going in the end zone at at the half\nThe wolf pack had a Twenty one that's seven lead and truthfully air force was fortunate that it wasn't any worse at that time\nBut the second half of the shows from resolve and they show something they they really going to need next week they change quarterbacks\nAnd in the second half a they started off with a forty three year if you go from Jake ... than there was another touchdown sprinkled in there from Nevada but a mark has been it then hauled in a two year our past from\n... third who replaced Erian worth men as the quarterback so that was a twelve plate fifty eight yard drive\nThan in the fourth quarter Hammond scored on a ... yard run\nEleven place sixty seven yards and those aren't the familiar types of drive that we like to hear from our academy teams towards the end of the game Airforce made it close to defense held and Nevada ran out of the back of the end zone for an intentional safety\nMake the score twenty twenty five and cake to air force with\nSeventeen Seconds left to go and air force they had about two plays one which they completed a pass and the second\nWhere they threw it into the and they're trying to win it at the last play the game but the past failed incomplete but when we look at the tail of the tape is evident why they lost Nevada out game there for four hundred and thirty six yards to two fifty\nAir force is titled possession was only twenty eight minutes to Nevada is thirty one and in the turnover battle it was dead even so\nYou know with air force are struggling with right now is really the running game they had fifty one attempts only averaging three yards rush and you just can't make a living like that on the ground you got to get more out of the running game than that\nAnd of course they're not going to be a passing team that's not who they are\nThey never have been so ... was only a meter two hundred and fifty yards and that's just not going to win it many games so\nThe falcons fail twenty eight twenty five hopefully they found a quarterback hopefully they found a quarterback who can get the team rushing for more than a hundred and fifty four yard that figure needs to be closer to three hundred or more for them to really have a good chance\nWell I played a little bit of football I always thought that you didn't average for yards per running play you are going to lose\nAs her identity that's that's the magic number either because of four times three he at twelve yards waivers universe down you know and at three or to a pop and you can see is just not going to get it done so in a deep sense then gets put in bad situations you know and uh\nUh teams the sense is just a really\nBuilt to withstand that much of a a barrage and you give other teams enough chances and they're ... they're going to break through at some point\nThey sure this is going to humans are much freedom or just 'cause he was going to be football when Robert ... by the army during during a week\nFor identity they played buffalo and the bulls came in on defeat it looking to really score big land against army army of course coming off that narrow defeat\nAgainst the Oklahoma sooner and licking their wounds just a bit but I tell you what it did not sit army back but so much with the bulls came out on top and first quarter scoring on fifty three are pass from Ty rejection that kj Osborne go up seven zero\nBut it was the again another great drive a good army Dr eleven place Seventy four yards five minutes at forty four seconds some Caitlin hold to get in on a five yard touchdown run\nMoving to the second quarter was all army uh is Conor ... three yard run on another twelve played driving many lives are Riley I had an eighty yard return of a block field goal so special teams played a big part in that as well moving into the second half and the third quarter\nBuffalo broke through with a twelve\nPlay drive of their own to cut the score to Twenty one they're Thirteen but Jordan as barrier hauled in a guess what a pass from quarterback held at Hopkins to score touchdown passes ten a path army\nThe ball [laughter] didn't play Seventy five an hour drive and then the fourth quarter they was all army will ... will folk scored a touchdown as well as ... than to seal it with a forty two over ... forty two to Thirteen\nThe score over the Buffalo Bills and when we look at the tail of the tape armies total yards three Seventy two good buffalo to fifty five time of possession thirty seven minutes to twenty two\nFor styles twenty five to buffalo fourteen and even though army had won turn over they could still overcome that so you know again when you look at those kinds of stuff over winning stats when you see that army ran the ball for two hundred and eighty one yet to remember what the Airforce I say that you want to have it closer to three hundred\nAnd but the hill buffalo to rushing for only one hundred and three yards so they're planning winning football the defense is playing well they're controlling the clock beginning the running game going and getting some big plays in there and surprisingly this year\nUh Kelvin Hopkins has shown that he's a better passer and their previous quarter back in ... allowing him to throw the ball now than I ever going to be mistaken for running shooting okay let's not let's not get\nAhead of ourselves but how can complete at four out of five passes for a touchdown and Eighteen point two yards per completion so almost Ninety One yards and total so you know when you look at that that's a again", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Weekend with Joe Pags", "city": "Charleston", "day":
