miner\nWho is the head coach of the hundred hornets joins us now in high school sports line coach welcome in\nHey thank you Yes sir I'll write a hundred more niche I I I still go back to when you guys are one of the game I and I can't imagine I Can't imagine the party it had to be exciting\nOh it was it was real fighting next week a practice it was funny that for for a week we got to be actually feel like where you know what I mean and now that we are but it go for that week a practice prepared for that next game a fit with a lot of fun the kids enjoyed it so\nThat was the game you knocked off pan and back on September fifteenth forty two to twenty six cents than four games and those have not gone the right way you've lost those four but\nThe second best often performance of the season was last weekend and he scored thirty drop the game to Hancock Marilyn but you put thirty on the boards the office was clicking last weekend\n[laughter] yeah yeah the ... really opened up or we struggled on the ground you know they were watching a lot so we took advantage of what they were giving out and we started throwing the ball we had a lot of fast but unfortunately we just couldn't get a date that we were we were producing oil but could not get a stop on effect so\nUm they got lucky that come with a couple of times but we just couldn't come up with a ball so\nUm yeah I mean we were in it ... it was still fought it with competitive so that's what we're we're we're shooting for we really want to be competitive\nShame regardless of the results to this point and the results were your last two games you've got a roster that for the most part is going to return mostly intact next year how much have you been conscious of player development and and kind of building through practice weeks as you've gone through the course of the season\nYeah we got a lot of of new guys out this year that I saw more it didn't come out last year and now they've really developed a they've really came a long way\nBeginning of the season so you can really see the growth there and and we are we're we're going to lose three seniors that will that will be barely mess with a I think there's a lot of interest um you know getting the wear and help with that but they actresses got coming back uh you know we don't have a lot of boys at our student body high school but\nUm there is interest I had we had four players we just talk on that didn't have the grades initially uh they they wanted to come out and I thought you know sure let's get them out there let's let's get him interested so we got some new kid new faces a and hopefully some kids that will help us last year as well\nYou know to keep following along those same lines Shane I mean not only do you have a lot of kids returning before single a school when you got some size on the roster\nOh yes sir yeah we're getting all of our size back we have we got we got three boys right at three hundred and one guy three sixty of what we've got one around three or ...\nAnd these are kids that we really pushed or to get in shape you know and and they really are at that size is really tough to to get up and down the field and uh and they really work hard and they have came a long way from the beginning of the season 'cause conditioning at our main coach Campbell we both think it could be\nA you know your play it on both sides of the ball so we we really try to try to get him condition him for the kids you know especially in the heat\nIt's tough to did not want to give up you know and that and they really push for so I'm proud of him for that\nYeah you probably don't mind a week like this week when it feels like football weather down in the fifties when you're practicing the\nF finally we get some football whether it does feel great\nAh let me er yeah that's right\nLet me ask you is obviously the numbers are always kind of low it hundred and and I know we've talked in the past sometimes you don't even have enough numbers to have a loving on eleven maybe talk a little bit about what a practice is like in hundred high the numbers are down but the enthusiasm is up and maybe talk about what it's like to be on their practice field\nIsn't that a lot of that it's much about the death of is it gets really really hard for us to get it more so a lot when I Lived there to get it falls into a few years ago and then there's the ... the good except for\nThe call or have as you just never know I\nHope this isn't it the goal of this\nAnd there you go yeah you are you like to be fourteen in the next time we talk or something but uh hey buddy busted luck friday night seven o'clock ... Jefferson ah ah we'll see what happens in a best of luck trying to get that thirty seven in a row okay\nWho should get it\nThank you sir head coach David Walker of those ... goal dogs\nI he's been there this is his twenty second year and a ironically enough we can talk at towards the end of the show in fact the last coach we talk with Tom Harmon of Wayne this is Tommy Harmon twenty second year and for David Walker\nIncluding the wins this year you get two hundred and twenty eight wins and forty six loss Tom Harmon two hundred and eight wins and forty nine months he's been pretty good too\nWent Wayne had also one of those long runs straight gear within the last four or five years as well so that they\nMy I'm sure on Tommy harm inside they kinda know what Martin's burgers kind of going through as well and and I think you know coach Walker they know they have a goals I mean they're not you know they're not they're not dumb they know that and they know they're going to get Jefferson's best shot and then\nYou know a game I'm looking forward to is that game that wraps up their regular season and he talks about the cat in the park out of Philly and a ... but the muscle and sitting there in the apple miner seven to know and you know they're waiting for him as well\nTo tell you what Muslims Bruins you have to take on a ... they've had they've had a really good couple of tests in Morgantown at wheeling park and they beat both of those tools at their places that willing park when was a huge went to the ...\nAnd also with Hedges ville mixed in between and they've done it in a couple of different ways they dock Morgantown Thirteen seven the edges bill twelve seven then they need to go up and score points on wheeling island they they do that get forty one and get the six point when\nI send a great point that's a very good point because a lot of times we'll talk about teams that maybe you can go over there and get Martin's burger challenge and maybe at the team that plays well defensively and can they ... yeah but they can't out squirm Orangeburg\nDraws a great point this is a Muslim and team in a couple of weeks that have won a variety of different ways and uh that come from behind and point out that game willing park shows the apple ... they can also play defensively I Know we're a couple of weeks away I'm not ... by any stretch overlooking jeopardy than or anything like that but uh\nIt's hard not to look ahead to that game on the twenty sixth of October\nYeah no question that I I don't know that you know I think maybe they're fortunate and the fact that muscle ... this week gets a Washington team that struggling a win seven\nAnd Martin's bird gets the team and Jefferson the struggling a little bit one in six so it's you know if you're going to\nLook past the team it's a team that you probably should beat him if you don't have\nYour a game but again you can jump up and get bitten by anyone that's a fact need to take a break come back we'll be joined by Chris booth Chris first year head coach at the mavericks James Monroe down ...

Smith joins us now go to welcome him\nWill serve thank you\nSo well but I'm telling you impressive right now with medals and county is doing five and two on the season the two losses ah Petersburg that's five and two clashed double a ball club or southern Garrett Maryland rams are five and do right now so uh uh you've done your cells proud so far buddy\nYes sir we're we're playing pretty good football I'm hoping to get better as the rest of the season progress is here and I'm just looking forward to this week and friday night though\nObviously goes you've got a a Pendleton county ball club that has the five wins on the season you're sitting at five in too with the team that won\nThree games last year but you've finished two thousand Seventeen with winds over more field and tiger's valley so you've really one seven of your last nine how important was finishing last these with a couple of wins the springboard this Pendleton county team in the two thousand Eighteen\nA tremendous um that momentum going into this summer and in the spring the weight room program we had twelve to Fifteen kids in the weight room and they just sit at heart attack the weight room and\nUm it it really bled over to this season uh last year we had three seniors this year we're we're blessed with eight seniors and and it's made a turn them into effect a\nCoach biggest victory on your schedule to date sixteen to nothing triumph over Tucker county where he scored all sixteen points in the fourth quarter\nYou entered that game week against some outlines coming off of a loss against southern Garrett a team that you had a lead on late in the game how press were you what the response that those guys had a ... to be able to hand Tucker their first laws\nBut it was just a great win for us um we preach that entire week that we needed to win a big game and and get a quality when and if we did that against Tucker county um and we found a way to win and the second half that's also what I was very pleased about\nUm [noise] we we uh played a tough game against southern way we're up fourteen nothing in the first task and let them come back into the game and the second quarter was fourteen Thirteen at half time and then just\nCouldn't finish the job and the second half a had went up Twenty one night thing and then they had the last two scores in the fourth quarter we gave up a couple of big place but I think\nWe continue to learn and progressive season goes on and try not to make the same mistakes\nTalking with their coaches acts Smith tunnels and county and your Wildcats or I Would say certainly one of the leaders on your ball club has to be cold puffing burger\n[laughter] yes they are as a he's definitely a a great leader and in our general was quarterback a he's a phenomenal kid\nHe's got a ... foot ball ... understands the game well\nYou're got a great army throws it as as well as anyone in single way and he's just a great kid and actually played high school football with is a older brother\nUm who sits passed away but I it's just a great honor to catch the kid and and I enjoy every minute with him so\nAnd coal had a a great game also a lot of great games this season but going back to that took her county game he had a rushing touchdown and a touchdown pass or any squirrels sixteen points in that fourth quarter you know what kind of talked about how important that went over Tucker county was but not only is shut out but to have that often come alive in the final quarter had to be huge backing week six\nNo absolutely the and we're\nDown you know our office of lions play as a media best throughout the season when it was like as in and we want to get the best out of them and uh\nI just they they came through in that game I was very pleased and proud of them are defensively we\nPay you to stop talk or they would sustain a drive into the reds are and we would come up with a big turnover\nI'm Josh Wagner had an interception with without a sick the yard return which set us up for for that first score so just big place and I couldn't have been more proud of the kids though\nAnd six sketches per Timothy thorn in that targets valley game by an all those coming to basically a happened two minutes of the game got a A N early because of weather what does he bring to your ... and and uh how about his connection with coal\nYeah there's there's two been throwing touchdown passes since middle school seventh\nAnd eighth grade so it's it's nothing new to them a cold deathly finds confidence in him and and he's a a play maker for sees are touchdown guy explosive VS phenomenal hand or he ... the ball well\nJust a great athlete I'm In it and another great kid on our team so\nYou know ... we talk a lot and rightfully so about the all fence about political and and and to me ... and you get you get coal winging about one Seventy and to me about one eighty but I Would suggest to you that on defense they hit harder than probably anybody else in single a\nYes or yep they do they bring it\nUm and I I think coal he he likes playing defense as much as he likes playing all fenced so [laughter]\nI thought you make a pie is watching some highlights thing as the tigers valley game they were down by their by their goal line and was that the game or heat like they had like a reverse ... track the kid down almost by the sideline and made the tackle\nHe did he made a great play on that on a these are outside backer and force player on that one and he we practice batting practice and uh we'd wrapped it and went over it and he just made it a great play stayed at home did his job and uh that's that's what he brings to the table so\nSo you're in the middle of your or just finished\nYup you're by week and you got Fifteen days in between games right now with the playoffs started are you guys would be\nThe number eight spot home for the opening round of the playoffs certainly a chance to even better that situation what have you told the guys about the big picture obviously you want to take care of each party and take care of business first but the big picture view there's there's some pretty good things out there for you\nKnow absolutely um well and that's been our goal since uh the first week of the season in August is we want to hurt the playoff game and be the first school in ... county history to do that so\nThat that's our first go and I guess are short term goal of course we want to make a deep run into the play offs\nAnd when you when you are running the football well especially against Chapman bill rehab three hundred and Seventy three yards of ... two hundred and Seventy four on the ground\nEight different bulk carriers but the pioneers last weekend is that kind of been the theme week in week out just multiple ... along with my ... and a Aaron Adkins and different guys have been able to carry the ball and especially eight in the game against ...\nWere a lot you know that's another one that strikes that we protect strange only a\n... a a ... square of all kids we have that are that are effective dog before me to say that somebody told me yesterday we got a ... to\nGo to the gate when we had a hundred dark Russia and again you know that's probably my career reckon rarely say that so like it's a testament to the debts we are on the conflicts and\nThomas friend who was mentioning earlier you're now when you're third decade as the head coach in Wayne and you were the architect to in a huge part of the thirty six game win streak that you guys have from twenty ... twenty Thirteen Lawrenceburg in position now to potentially break that this week\nAs one of the three people in the state do remember Don Matt how difficult is that the author or a streak of that link on\nYou know I think um Bush for most people just don't see you can't or ... or they can tell you ... burger kings ... ticket of games you can't have a have a lot of forward thinking going on you got to be\nA cost straight out of the task and handle\nIt takes a lot of discipline I think in those ... ... it's because you know high school kids are gonna tend to overlook\nBut just to maintain that consistency in that hope is that this plan but it's a ... takes a lot of you know she says she and coaching consistency and the type of kids that are still a step toward the preparation and trust so you know it's\nLike a ... the whole if they're for a while\nMy buddy final thought for you real quick you you get a ... club this week they won their first three they lost three of the last four or what are you seeing mark Wilson's ball club\nA burst of a system built traditionally I mean you're talking about a bunch of ... or a\nYou know we were we were talking about in your coaches office every day like\nThere was you know ... year after year after year for ... and we played highschool football years ago you'd always count on our part Davis is so you know first than most that they are they're very very ...\nOften seen as much to do it everywhere you go to Gary lights down a given night or to give up sales leaf ... fourteen gas seems like the times\nAnd just it's always been a good match for ... come out on top a lot of those games are just a little twist here they are that that could have been a different [noise]\nAll right my friend with the best of luck to you three more to go and um you just keep winning okay\n\nThat's the plan huh yeah well you know since I was like I said don't do that\n[laughter] Tommy always a pleasure buffer around okay thank you buddy there you go to an army veteran head coach of those Wayne pioneers Iraq couple of minutes left\nIt gives us an opportunity to side are games of the week class triple a gentleman uh icy maybe to that jumps out at me\nIn Huntington Campbell middling\nParkersburg south greenbrier east you see anything else\nNo those are the ones I was kind of looking at it as well I'm In ... number twelve it for for the hosting the islanders is the Huntington team coming off the last to Capitol after this cabinet link itself Charleston so a big game big big points opportunity for capital middle and sitting in number two well why do you think Joe we're going to a joke pick\nThis one who is a lot of pressure I Know you mentioned park shouting Greenberg these two teams that are probably a you know exceeded the level of play it leads to the expectations for for people around the state so certainly an important game for a playoff positioning greenbrier used to get a couple of more coming in\nLikely to secure a playoff spot so that that's a good option will go on [laughter] we'll say parks out green very sad about that\nWhat do you think do you like the works for me or I Want to see how he picks double A. between your games that are right next to each other on the square but yeah you got\nThree really games in double a this regard AAA gave it away Parkersburg south in greenbrier east in double a it's either going to be rich guys are very monsignor grafted killing Bluefield\nAnd and I'm really I'm really split I look at paramount senior and wrapped in and out can be a great game Fairmont senior on the road taken on the ... the my eyes go to the middle of the scoreboard I've got a Bluefield seem that scored three points are not going to be real happy Mitchell Stadium taking on oak hill\nAnd I probably going back last three or four years Bridgeport Kaiser's all we spend our game of the week right so the brake tradition and go kill Bluefield or do you just keep the same old same old Joe and go Bridgeport\nGuys why I think I Need to recuse myself because all have Bridgeport Kaiser that'll be my game friday but gray Kerry will have coverage of oak hill in Bluefield so\nWas it made me do you

... saving for a house got your emergency fund good for ... yeah and I wanted to know how long is too long in baby step three being the flash and live on two babies that for was not a magic\nCancer of the concept or the other critical thinking skills for the answer is simply this\nIf you stay there so long that you don't save for retirement you're screwed up your retirement Mm right yeah or if you don't stay there long enough then you don't have a good solid down payment and you'll end up with other problems on the mortgage so it's the it's the pull between those two things\nAnd with most people that means you know three years four years something like that um but if you're if you're fifty nine it might not be that long or you're not fifty nine now how old are you\nAnd twenty eight on friday\nOkay cool and so I mean if you stayed out for four years and never started any retirement until thirty two\nBut you had a really juicy down payment on a house and got a ... you know how to

safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than they Ramsey says never go more than three years yeah that's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other or because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go yeah that's all it is I think for stopping by think stay\nPhones at triple eight eight to five five to to find

motivated them\n... died of that we had a good time Dave and ah I didn't pray for them to beat us but the hey it was an amazing game is [laughter] I I Love the titans but I Love the ravens do so hey the best one way or the flu\nWell that day the best football team playing that but yet I don't think that our heightens guys would agree with that it was about a\nMonth or so you you've done that travels several hundred us from other NFL work as well so some of the other teams of cold and you're in ... both been available to them and and helping them when you're meeting with those guys I'm ... and they're asking you money questions what's coming up\nYou know day this is the main thing that's coming up hey I'm young I'm twenty two years old I was only making maybe five thousand dollars a year my first check was Fifteen thousand and I'm gonna get another one next weekend\nWhat do I do ... how ... how do you keep from being overwhelmed overwhelmed money with the pressure with family how do I tell my mom no should I tell my parents know how do I tell my friends know um should I go by this car\nAlmost any names but there are some um you know rookies out there that I've had the opportunity to to mentor\nAnd they're you know they they they're going out there and biased and big things and other rookies are seeing that are saying well wait should I Do that and I'm like no no no do not do that and save your money live on a plan live on a budget\nAnd with the coolest thing was but the ravens I can say this was all of them sign up for every dollar a couple of weeks ago um and all of them get every dollar play and so there was like ... how do we do this and it was surprising to see that a lot of kids did not know how to budget\nEither twenty two year old Twenty one euros\nMaking nearly um on average sucking the low end is about Fifteen thousand I was the games that's about sixty thousand dollars a month to about two hundred thousand dollars a month and they didn't know how to budget that so\nI'm just excited because I'm seeing them saying hey I Want to help you know these guys are Texan me they're they're calling me Kate how do I do this how do I invest what is Dave say about this you know it's just real cool to see\nThese young players want to be good on the field but they also want to make the right decisions off the field as well\n[noise] I was telling a leadership team this week when I was talking to the river passers we're with yesterday that aren't you can't attribute\nA life skills book to someone just because we're successful in one area or in starting to get a twenty six year old music star yeah um well they're good at music but what happens is we see them being very successful there\nEven me I'm fifty eight I Know better I've worked for the NFL players for Twenty years off and on\nAnd um I Know this is a a a world class\nOne half of one percent athlete um but they are twenty two guests there and the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills are developed they are the size of a key uh yeah [laughter] it doesn't mean that their life skills have developed at the same level and you know so\nIt it's it's kind of weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps as like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um because he still is football skills are are the best on the planet you\nI'm In his physical acumen his physical a cue the things you can do with this body in mid air or just circus like it's amazing what those guys can do\nIt but what happens is when you watch that skill level especially if you're just watching on TV\nYou think of that guy as you know a forty year old who's a mature developed a ... as you know strong marriage has all these other things and these guys are college kids or not they were in college last week yeah you know there's twenty minutes ago and I'm\nEven a player that's been in the league three years yeah they're still young and they're still I'm twenty five years old ... and so it's uh it's interesting in the same thing happens with music people when they get a success level earlier anything where your spotlight and you get a success level\nAnd your skill is world class in that thing does not mean you have everything else together yeah yeah and that's true with the you know teenagers in general is one of the things we do this entrepreneur tool box\nIs they can start to develop some of those skills you know running a business\nYeah yeah they and that's absolutely right you know you say this all the time when in America knows he knows you for saying this but the NFL stands for not for long and these football players young football players know that like hey I Need to develop something now because in probably in three years I Would not be in this league mhm um and the most\nMoney these kids were make will be within their first three to five years of the league if they make it past and\nAnd so I I I told them like ... you have to get focused but when we look at these twenty two year oh this is why I'm so passionate about that Fifteen you wrote about that Thirteen year old getting you know the peanuts in order to about ... get into graduate survival guide a book and also taken our financial foundations curriculum is out of a classroom\nBecause all of that teaches what the old they're professionals do not know ... if they can get at Thirteen like these middle school kids day four out here now taking our middle school curriculum you know they are um a head of the game like they were teaching me some stuff earlier today I'm like wow like winning the world\nAnd so just to see these young kids are getting it taken our curriculum learning learning how to budget learning how what is the difference between the credit card in a debit card and these kids like me and I'm not financing anything like that just gets me excited\nYeah his dolled in in a life skill yes life skills stuff and you need life skills whether you're Seventeen or fifty seven yeah you know and this this money thing you know the basic stuff of being out of debt being on a budget\nBring your emergency fund the stuff we talk about here every day on the air it it really does work for teenagers and the interesting thing is they're not um\nYou know that they're not like rusted into place right you know they're they're pretty they're pretty uh uh\nElastic in their spirits in that they can receive this stuff sometimes more than some of us are a little older and we get a little stiffer on our spirit and we don't where she was quite as well they're like okay let's go let's do that right\nRight and they're not like old docked in and go now to

for next season and big well play was released by the big twelve conference coach hotter West Virginia's going to have an\nOpen week the last Saturday of September and an open a week last Saturday of October so from a symmetrical standpoint that works out well\nYeah it works out really well plus four games open we play three games open week they're each Thanksgiving is a week later than it is this year because this year there\nWould have only been one such open date if not for the ... say cancellation so that's why there are the ability to have to next year\nSo extra week in the fall opportunity for an extra open date and I think that that bodes well for I mean obviously West Virginia will you only when everybody is like twelve will all enjoy such states but the second one is sort of like this year in the dust around a Thursday night game so\nThe most part I like to weigh the big twelve does things in it\nThere'll be a nice day she used to have inequitable open dates and who are already played you know the week before and you got an open date big big twelve that that it rarely happens I don't remember ever having to West Virginia\nYeah a couple of things here are firstly West Virginia will play its first game are August the thirty first\nAgainst James Madison at home then go on the road and play Missouri the next week then come home to take on NC State the third week of the season and then you enter into league play in a culture and this is spread over Fifteen weeks\nI'm this come next year's Fifteen weighs twelve games or Fifteen wouldn't\nYeah so lots of opportunities you know for for little downtime but um you know it's it's okay I think that works well\nWhen to non Saturday games you got a Thanksgiving a day after Thanksgiving at TCU and you've got a Thursday night game at Baylor on Halloween Night\nThe murderers row comes up October of five twelve in Nineteen Texas\nYes I put Iowa State in there in Oklahoma so I think I Would say his chance to be really good next year with property in his second year what that defense that so that's a really significant stretch right therapy think\nTexas finishes out this season on the rise they'll bring their quarterback back as well see the Texas Iowa State Oklahoma three consecutive games in the month of October\nSo that stuff but you don't have the death ... walked through November like you do this year\nRight or at least what we thought it would be things change as you go along but um again November's tough enough in this league in your lap stretch but it is in Oklahoma Texas heat you Oklahoma State like it is is you\nKnow next year you're you're November games um Texas Tech November Nine and you've got a key state November sixteen Oklahoma State in November twenty third TCU November twenty nine so\nNow West Virginia does play for their last six on the road but I I think from a faint perspective you don't my neck as September October or your prime weather months mhm and get the bulk of your games early when the weather should be better\nWrite a reminder that are coming up tomorrow we've got high school football will talk about that on tomorrow's program week number eight\nThat correct kosher nine nine or ... who signs we'll be playing their last game not this Friday but next friday a lot of them will be and then the final weekend we can love and you can go to a

that seems to be a little bit of an issue and that might be something that is addressed down the line but uh there was a lot of there were a lot of questions just about the umpiring the ability the

you know to make sure that\nThey were not maybe rattling the umpires harassing them at all going into what is now a a obvious must one day we\nSpoke to address this afternoon and he kept saying I I don't want to talk about it I don't want to talk about it it was yesterday and then we'd ask a specific rules about the rules about positioning the umpire the the replay cameras and he he would answer and then he would interrupt himself and say I don't want to talk about it I think that was the message is players we can't let\nThat play impact do games it's over\nRichard in terms of Jose all too vague clearly he is not one hundred percent you we saw that on the slide into second last night how do the Astros then balance his health versus the need of his bat\nIn that line up he's going to play and ah one of the law lines AJ Hinch used was you could not rip\nThe heart out of this team any more if you eat and eat by taking by doing something more than taken a Jose out to be out besides that he wouldn't allow him to come out he doesn't like AJ who's talking about the injury he's playing on one leg if this was the regular season he'd be in the disabled list\nA but he's not going to come out of the game and so you just you you accept him and I think one of the lines AJ used about him was his teammates revere him and they understand what he's what he's going through but he wants to play it's October\nEverybody wants to be out there there is no way they take him out\nYeah you can see what he's running um and he just looks like he's in so much pain and then\nRegardless of what your view is on that on that call that controversy I'll call pretty much with an opposite field home run 'em and said to be doing that on one leg I think that you know there's like shades of occurred gifts are that are coming back here and and really what age eight point was that was this team is really it's not even\nJust exclusive to the ability and the athleticism but it's also just what he brings to affirm a leadership standpoint what his name just an outline that um that he absolutely has to like\nAllison footer along with Richard Justice joining us here baseball tonight on ESPN radios we set the stage for game number five of the American league championship series red socks look me close it out in five games tonight David Price going for Boston\nHas everything seemingly against them guys short rest on the road was up in the bullpen warming up multiple times last night he was growing up against ... he hasn't won in the post season as a starter he's not expected to pitch while but could this be actually a good thing for him is there is zero pressure on his shoulders\nOkay they've gotten the series in ... where they wanted their up three games to one and now they can take a deep breath you know I'm pretty sure we're not going to see kimbrell tonight we're probably going to raise your did not\nI don't know if Matt Barnes can go because the workload is starting to take its toll on those guys that are they going to have Christian Bale lined up for a game later they're going to have an ape and involve the lined up those have been there guys\nSo this is this is sort of you know you're asking about the Astros hell this is where the red Sox are as a team to their bullpen is their pitching staff is tax other than of all leaders rotation hasn't been very good\nBut you know you're one when away from their fourteenth American League pennant and you go for it I I think David case the less preparation less time to think about it the better because there's not a course of his palaces question is does he ever think you'd do at times you know you see him taking too much time between pitches before he\nPitches and some of his postseason games just go just go out there and just let your talent take care of everything else 'cause in control what you can control\nAnd I think that the only advantage that the red Sox might have in this game as well of course that that they are fueled by the adrenalin rush of being a gay I went away from the pet it but I just don't hit left hander is great in the ballpark I said yesterday during a game for the just as much of a must win for a team that's up to to one\nAnd a seven game series that I think I've ever seen because of the officers had won that game I just think that that you would really undergoing\nConsidered a Red Sox have scored for relief each of the last three games to first inning runs for each of the last three four lander and price here tonight as we get ready for game ... back to the studio at job Berkeley\nMove I Know it's hard to bind David prices struggles in the postseason but they are for real old and nine in his career in the postseason and you're right over six and eleven career post season starts those eleventh starts without a when are tied without light or for the most in postseason history at the drive for the championship Roger you buy Honda maker of cars trucks SUVs\nAnd crossovers Andrew local Honda dealer but let's also died deeper into Justin Berliner on the verge of elimination there was no one the Astros would rather have on them out\nYou know you either want to be the moment or you don't you know for me I've always wanted to ban it doesn't guarantee that you're going to have success and I'm just trying to go play baseball\nIs for one in five prior career starts with a steam facing elimination winning each of the last four and it's your Reagan those games is one point to one and has not given up a run in his last twenty four innings\nBut it's now the second time he's facing Boston in this series and that to change things\nEspecially these guys are team that's really gonna make adjustments and they can just as quickly you know they know my strengths and weaknesses I Know there's a new job or you don't\nIt's kind of one of those times when I like to rely on my instincts when I'm Out there and you know just be on my way through again\nIn game one Berliner pitch six innings of to a ball what do you have issues with control especially early on walking for in fact the most he's given up this year and a postseason career high but Berlin recovered\nAnd Berlin either it's a one two three for the third straight inning and he is retired ten in a row\nSo who can get to ... it likely won't be the red Sox table setters the top two winters

or make him a stark six career start\nIn a potential elimination game the numbers back it up born one with a one point you want me All right he knows the red Sox if your Boston how do you get under a skin\nYeah and said look Alex Cora the manager of the red Sox have special insight into Berlin or because he spent the last season watching gr lander any talk to us before the game today about how Berlin repairs wherever you started out we looked at getting reports\nBut they also know his obsessive ness about science dealing nope pitchers seem to pay attention to this more than Justin\nAnd don't be surprised if tonight during the course of the game\nIf the red Sox get a runner second base you're going to see the runner do all kinds of stuff and try to give up the indication yeah we got the science yeah we absolutely have decided to fact one member of the organization\nA joke to me that you know what we might be doing jumping jacks distracted from what he's doing a an all white and the whole issue of science feeling has been become such a big concern a major like\nBaseball yeah that it's been a hot topic in the last forty eight hours around major league baseball in terms of the red Sox starting pitching David Price making the start on three days rest they need to get twenty seven outs if they're going to get this victory tonight in game five how does Alex Cora manage that pitching staff you're not going to have great temporal obviously because of the six out said yesterday\nWell actually he is good at all you know is going to be available it's amazing because I walked out of the interview room without score last night and I said hey\nI who's going to pitch after pricey looked at me and granted said we're going to find out like a mystery but then today when we met with him he spoke much more confidently which was predicted by age enhance the Astros manager because look Alex has been through this he knows you can't just go into this match up of\nA price on short rest versus the Berlin or just can see the game\nAnd that's why Al Gore spent today talking about how yes if we get into a situation he can use joke Kelly he can use a riot Frasier he can use Matt

against the Astros buster only joining us here on baseball tonight on ESPN Radio a couple of changes for the Astros lineup Alex pregnant stays in the lead off spot Jake Resnick a in a nice spot in centerfield tonight Tony jumped in the seventh spot and he did a price go way way back what more can you tell us about this relationship buster\nLike it happy birthday good luck to\nScore the red Sox manager earlier with ... here on ESPN radios the red Sox won went away\nFrom returning to the world series for the first time since twenty Thirteen were re joined in Studio by John Farrell the man who led the red Sox about World Series championship in twenty Thirteen as we get to what to watch for ... by Firestone Tires go get some Firestone destination tires and go to a truck stop whatever you drive\nDrive a Firestone if you're the Astros you've got the man on the mound Justin Berliner we've gone through the numbers twenty four consecutive scoreless innings and potential elimination games here John but\nWhy has he been so successful when the moment is so important\nWell this is one of the top competitors in the game and because the way he prepares I think he has an ability to raise his game that extra step on the biggest stage or he doesn't fear it he doesn't uh you know push it away he embraces it and you see that true competitive spirit come out of him\nDoesn't hurt that you're strapped to Ninety five and your arm in a in a in a big overhang ... to wipe out slider sure those are all big time tools but the fact is that uh he he relishes the stage and I think that that's kind of how he's wired as personality\nI always find it funny to injustice ... talks about at the age of thirty five he's in the second prime of his career which is scary enough for opposing bats I David Price was I Would say average against the Astros game two for two thirds for runs a in terms of going on short rest of your the Astros lined up how do you approach the left hander tonight\nWell the thing is I think everyone is seems from David prices career both in season and post season is that he pitches to his strengths almost to a fault", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018",
