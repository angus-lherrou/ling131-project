a as a school they're playing it very correctly because here's why bill self has on believable power unbelievable power and Brad and I we talked about this\nWho is going to raise their hand and say wait a second\nWe're going to investigate you because the person that does that forget about all of us that look at it their way we're talking about the fan base the emotional fan base that absolutely

walking\nLike around on eggshells going like St ... enough to make them to be aware yeah we know what's going on we're talking ... you know I yeah talking about oh yeah [noise] but no one wants to come out and go like\nThis is ridiculous where embarrassed or suspending the coach pending our investigation nope not going to do that not going to do that\nYeah yeah it has this program had some just really unfortunate bad luck of being accused of things I mean it's unbelievable how many how can you imagine that wrongly accused\nThat didn't do any of it than it did you don't know if it's true but yeah I mean as you said there there are three hundred and sixty one division one basketball programs three hundred and sixty think your dirty is a dog right but you only have the answer to one fan

sports line\nAppreciate it matter of fact I'm standing here with the ah actually at the starting line we got old stadium lights on and I got a crew of about Fifteen gentleman that are getting this course ready and they're just they're stripe at the starting line right now\nSo take us through some of the logistics of course set up what is going to take place over the next two days and how you prepare the corps and and all that goes into putting on this event\nWell the the biggest thing is uh\nI wouldn't even attempt to do this if I didn't have the\nThe parents' support that you know we I mean coming this Saturday will have close to two hundred volunteers\nAnd you know luckily for us we have ... you know large chain which means a lot of parents are as parents are willing to help so you know this course we basically what we do we cut discourse all year long have we try to keep it ... the best we can it makes the grass coming in sicker\nAnd so we as far as statement goes we we've been\nBasically preparing for the last three weeks\nAnd you know you look at the weather you look at things that\nWe know we're going to get rain we're on it big time with with rain as you know coming in on friday he was going to be on and off on Saturday So with that you know with that in mind you know we start prepare and we were just buddies spots are so\nWe've got about eleven ton of a crush on Ron coming into Mars same crew will be working on it some more just fill it in those spots losing out just trying to make it fast you know the best condition for these ah runners coming in because it's the poor you know that the season for\nNo you're exactly right this is what they all trained for this is all the work comes down to and he talked about the two hundred different volunteers are doing everything they can to make sure no matter what happens weather wise they had the best track possible for these young men and women to run on\nKind of talk about what's that going to be like then for the next uh Seventy two hours trying to make sure everything obviously an eye to this guy and look at the radar but what's the Seventy two hours can be like for these volunteers and yourself to make sure that everything is good to go this weekend\nWell the big push and it's why we started a little bit early but you know we keep an eye on that whether it's somebody was saying oh you know this was a you know on Saturday Asia grants are coming until Sunday I said I\nCan't look at that and course on Sunday\nIt changed just coming in on Saturday as we've gotten closer\nTo this week and now it's coming in on friday a look at it you know or you know you have the authority and uh so you know with that being said uh you know we're going to have everything completed outside that tomorrow evening we're going to have it on all the course at everything stay\nWill set the finish line set the banners set the shoe get all that set more so on friday you know ... teams do come in and everything will be set up but on the same so we won't be out here\nYou know in rank coach you know traits than all over the course you know trying to get prepared so we'll be done with that aspect on Thursday evening now coming on friday there there's a lot\nThe stuff to do inside that because we do the big award ceremony in the gym and we have we we hire a\nA a lighting crews that comes in and it sets up almost like a concert you know atmosphere so you know we wanted to make it really special we announced the all state or stopped in and they were when the announcers a downstate runner up in the state champion to come up on awards Bodie\nWe try to make it really really special for so we put a lot of effort on that and will set do all that\nYou know they'll take all day friday probably up until about that crude last year left out here about one in four H and then they were back on the side you know the eight o'clock in the morning get ready you know for the award ceremony later on that morning\nWhen they ask you a question about the ... and we have to see that Fred person you're here with us as well and you're talking about all the work that you guys are doing it might be a silly question I don't know Joe's ever run across country I'm guessing friday night no\nBut if you're the if you're the runner and you're not quite sure that conditions coming in do they have different types of shoes they may bring to the event just kind of based upon what the corps may or may not present\nYeah I think mostly I mean they're all going to wear ... and the question will be what size spike you put in and I know we\nWe normally just wear quarter and spike\nBut with this rain that ... that I saw coming in I had\nA ... we're going to use three eight three eight than just a little bit longer and now some people go to the half an inch and I highly discouraged and a half inch because there are some areas that are gravel\nAnd you've got to be careful ... her too long it feels like spikes coming up through the ball your foot so we're going to a three day so that yeah it does absolutely\nFace the fact I mean anybody that does not wear spike\nAnd just wears regular flash regular running shoes are definitely going to be at a disadvantage especially in the muddy the muddy spots\nTalking with Chris Parsons um they're right guys yes and I was just making sure I I before I brought you in France is given to one last chance to make sure everybody gave us the go ahead and glad I now me makes you real quick here you've never ran cross country right bread\nTwelve no okay giants and reason the Christ the reason I did this I give those guys a twenty minute headstart just to see if they catch up [laughter] ah I hear you know we talk about the course and everything we know it is a a number one course their capital middle let's let's cut now\nTo the kids to the schools are in in Tripoli for example I I Know that in Tripoli boys Campbell ... been a top sent all year long\nAAA girls university looks like they're ready to go again do you see it that way and I know it all depends on how the kids show up and if there's not sick and all this other good stuff but those would be right now I Would think two teams in Tripoli boys and girls that would have the or outright to lead right now\nWell I I I definitely will agree with you on the girl size university we haven't seen them all season they pretty much stayed up north uh other than that\nWe've run against a girl wise most all the other teams uh we've been fortunate or or ... as far as West Virginia goes ... or you know the the winter side of the university I mean there are loaded I mean they they just keep reload just when you think they're all graduates people they you know ad\nFrom apple affair they he just keeps\nYou know reload and um so I definitely agree with you on on that\nThat into the uh the course when it does rain and the elements come in you know the funny thing happened but you know everybody here is definitely you know their\nTheir plan to bring or a game and run the best and you just got to take care you know like I told our kids you just have to run your race and\nYou know don't leave anything out on the course of when you cross the line don't don't play that game all van YDF or I could have a you don't want to you don't want to be saying that you want to cross the line and say that was it that was my best you know best I had you know on this day now the boy side\nWe've been ranked number one all season we are run against everybody all these except for university and uh\nYou know we've been fortunate or voice ... to come on top two however with that being said\nYou know university has a very good team you know just like their girls team they are they are loaded stacked hurricanes\nYou know air Cooper coaches those kids and he's a alumni for here he's a he's a former state champion your capital is so he's taking of the hurricane spot\nAnd like like last week we only as an amount by two points to regional so we're very aware than Woodrow Wilson has a very good to have a you know you can't cannot willing part you know so I think all the boys are just a ... it's definitely closer um\nSo you know again it's like I told you know told our kids you just have to run your race be aware of those teams that are\nYou know potentially camp beach you and do all you can to get to the finish line as quick as you can\nAll right Chris I I I'm just curious here before we let you go you ever thought about getting into politics no about everybody on the ballot and the un I seriously on one point how how's Brent ... is he ... well ...\n... here's the thing with Brett what's good about him we he had on September the ... the head on race in Fairlawn\nAnd with four hundred meters should go he went around that funny corps\nAnd he tweaked his left hip\nWith Nico a little bit but we're still we're still growing up and there's still a little torn as a team you know the the video it is for it\nYou know we've got everybody by so yeah we just got to continue a grinding\nHow key was that go to the maturation of the team you start all over in four\nAnd then you'll see your own for the new when in week five you knock on the west side forty eight well through sit in one for with this young team you're down Thirteen nothing the clay county then you come back and scored the game's final thirty three points and since that period of time your team as you mentioned it one more than you've lost\nSo how important at one in four down Thirteen nothing to clay county ones that independence come back to win that game by twenty\nWell I think it was it was awesome I I'll tell you I'll tell you we twice jokes football which has always been like a big mistake you know going down the stretch you know you don't do it through overs and football [laughter] so it's not like every other sport with short like to have to do the roads you know we'll play in a little better now\nBut uh you know you don't have the Ohio River section of regional and all that food you know you say look forward to you know I look back when you've got to look for it but you're right that was a turning point for citizen\nYou know they were undefeated at the time is limited to stay [noise] we've been playing football we just we just always like a critic industry like when you're starting to get\nAny closer to your season this Friday night with a trip to Wyoming east how important in the scheme in terms of a springboard to twenty Nineteen to get a good result to get a fourth win and to get some positive momentum for you guys\nWere you hit it on it I mean you know I for low and ... and ... as we were what did you go on to a to finish out to say you cannot figure out what the elite shock the offer the off season ... concern is you know we are crushed with injuries or\nYou know we've also for a very very rich geopolitical to a ... to ... you know ... and ... and that hurts us a little bit but\nI can tell you the resilience of this change in our snow said coaches are real phenomena how many\nYou know when you start all hope for and he don't have any discipline problems whatsoever [noise] this time of day and age you you're you're you got a special punch she got snow\nYou know I I think we'll corner in the right direction hope on the right direction and you know God's will and retain my key chain you get an apartment\nFor John certainly the good news is you got kids coming back end you're going to get a full year\nUm actual being able to coach and I understand the limitations and everything but if anybody thinks football begins in August the crazy show you get your weight room going and and I saw that I saw pictures of that new weight room you got going there and that's that's a start that's what you had to do it quickly if you remember show that landed a key or\nWhere you didn't have a waiting room was packed with to try to start from scratch and uh you know we get we have we did not have wanted independence and we just ah with the types of uh some community members and corporate sponsors you know able to put on the job done and you know we're going to build a program around the white program\nAnd a ton of what we what we do we talked out of all and\nUh you know just like when we were the job of you know we were fortunate enough to go on to the ... years of a you know hopefully we can continue to get to that to that level of course glad you know the standards go on to the playoffs and we didn't like that but you know it's some learning tools for us next year\nYou go buddy and and that's what will happen to you I I can see independence and independence has been known for plans to smash mouth football and I know with with John ... and a a new enemy there it will be there hey buddy I appreciate your time best to Black Friday night when you hit down to Wyoming county to take on the [noise]\nI mean he's warriors and we'll talk again soon

on Dave and uh I thought Joe you brought up a real good point but if you get this when will\nThey be huge for next year\nYeah absolutely I considering you know like the the important point that you may now go solely will have an entire off season to be able to work with those guys and to start to build towards twenty Nineteen and you know certainly if you can close out with for a winning and winning for audio last six certainly a lot of positive momentum they can take forward\nWhere we got a guy coming up next the boys had a heck of a season undefeated on the season and they got a big
