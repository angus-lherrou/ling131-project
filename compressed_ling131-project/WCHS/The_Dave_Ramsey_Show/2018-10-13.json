act a wheelbarrow could have been critical CBS board dot com and been Baylor a made a run at it but could not get in the end zone waiting sexist holds off the\nBears sure did twenty three Seventeen Charlie brewer in Austin native right out of there and less like high school he uh had a chance to go down and some Baylor slash Austin lord drove from about Ninety seven yards down the field had a chance there at the end but Todd Orlando as defense has brought a ton of pressure\nUm and just wasn't able to get that or get that final\nTouchdown did they needed so at the theme throughout the day it seems is sort of survive in advance if you can use yesterday against Memphis, Texas did against Baylor and sometimes in these situations just got to get the W. again sort of a natural let down situation after the\nOklahoma wind last week and then with same Eleanor did not come back into the game with that shoulder injuries so shameless shell and not solid but enough to get the win\nSo Texas gets by week I think Ellen gr health moving forward to going to be the big story since he's such a an important part of that ground game with how they use and in power runs in in in quarterback sweeps\nAnd Washington and Oregon earning overtime in Washington a gotta feel go up twenty seven twenty four that over time third and go in Oregon has the ball so you don't know whether this week is going to be you start out like well maybe it's Dole's bill than it was well maybe this shakeup started out just might be chalk\nMight be it it might be chock but ah Oregon is going to have a a a chance here to win the game this was a a Mr feel go by Washington that sent it\nInto overtime and you know Oregon member earlier this year window overtime against Stanford I had a ... a couple of chances really to put that game away wasn't able to do it so this is there's some definite ... implications here if Oregon can win this game\nOr they're going to be the clubhouse leader and in the standings and and that's a pretty deep division again about three or four teams\nAre that are really good in that patch off north so this is there a lot of uh important way on this game and really you could be talking and Barrett is Oregon just got the touchdown so they're going to win because you can be talking about the ducks really as an undefeated team based on the fact that they they kind of blew that Stanford game earlier in\nThe near the Oregon gets redemption for the Stanford walls in home they knock off Washington overtime thirty to twenty seven Oregon gets to win and Washington falls to five and two Thanks Ben meanwhile Jeff Jenkins West Virginia a defense forces of forces um\nYeah three announced right now it's all pretty run it so an incomplete pass in inner David Montgomery on first down getting a carry so West Virginia three announcing that they so they forced to pump Marcus them to follow that but did recover and moved out to the twenty five yard line so what do you have a second job getting twenty\nOf around the corner to start with Dave we could what'd you see on that first series for a\nA worse than Montgomery is playing a I think that's that's big west Virginia I was sort of hoping that they were going to miss him apparently not he's going to give it a go up ... first pass on third and three very small window tried to get it in their wide receiver dropped it\nYou know one of the keys to the games and I might be a third down conversion West Virginia almost sixty percent and that's why I Want to say like twenty three twenty four points higher than I was\nI was like thirty four 'cause that's the one is using that first verse verse they weren't\nHappy there from the script I mean thirty ... and the game ...\nYou don't run the ball first down secondary same play inside zone reads a quarterback get the ball parties runner didn't get much not really fast we run him down where fast defense on third downs thirty three I'm shocked it didn't run the ball they get balanced budgets that sort of little receiver screen out their\nResources using a couple of things terrible for on third down that was in the coverage that should've been a pet we could have taken that went back to the house when we get a chance to hit this quarterback hit this quarterback we did not take advantage I don't think about and you'll see more of that coming should there be stone that right now\nI think exactly what reached that confusing attacked the freshman they switched that covered that was Kenny Robin ... there to pick up that exactly what you want to do
