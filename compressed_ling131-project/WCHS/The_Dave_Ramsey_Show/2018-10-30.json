you guys are killing it what do you do for a living\nI'm a licensed clinical social worker\nA construction project manager for a interstate retailer\nUh-huh okay very good well you guys are killing it way to go man they saw what kind of that was this one hundred and eighty thousand dollars\nA eight thousand was my car and a hundred and Seventy thousand with our wonderful student loans from a private Christian university\nWe were expensive spouses to\nEach other [laughter] you know okay so this you drop some coin and yeah All right and um then six and a half years that's a long time to pay off the student loans I was thinking maybe it was the house when he told me six and a half years so there has to be a good story tell me your story\nUm I got a really funny story actually um when we went through financial piece at our church at the time I'm One of the things that you mentioned in your video was a take cash with you when you when we were newlyweds when we first went through and you said take cash would you when you go to a\nFurniture store to buy a car and and and flash the cashing in and talk to them that way so\nWe were at a furniture store and I'm a very not confrontational kind of guy kind of a free spirit and she told me hey let's do this let's put this to practice so\nWe took passion and I'm Talking to the sales guy about a bad that we're trying to buy for our department at the time and I'm flashing the cash and saying hey I'm I'm going to walk as if we can make this happen right now and he's like I'm I'm Sorry that that's just the price\nAnd uh so I just went out in the car and set down because I couldn't swallow my pride and buy it but then my wife ended up buying\nA set out that that that's just to show that\nIs a lot of negotiations in the beginning we were really um when we were dating and engaged at the time we were sitting there with their finances and we were actually writing out the numbers and it was just this\nPet feeling in our stomachs of uh we're just indebted to these loan companies and we're going to be in our fifties before we pay 'em off and\nUm so and so we started the class we now down to budget and did the ... and we were really um persistent okay for the ... down and just really got serious about it and\nI think the big part and for us for as far as deciding to really and tried to work on baby step too as\nWe paid by car off a relatively quickly and then he had gotten his first pretty big bonus and from work and so we were like okay we haven't really gotten to travel before kids let's take a really great trip to Europe with the money we deserve it\nAnd we were sitting there and when ... were we just at our budget you know a few months ago and said that was the first step we use that bonus money instead of a trip to Europe\nWhich who knows if we'll be able to take that ever and that's okay but we uh\nWhy wouldn't you like a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in debt and our first uh for you know we have two kids so it doesn't ... [laughter]\nAt least in some countries [laughter]\n... yeah that that was the big you know turning point for us when we put that big lump sum of money and our first a student loan payment and it was an awful feeling that hurting but a good feeling\nTo show how much of the six years did you make closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years a product of the last year last year the incomes doubled down right yes ... and so that's a relatively new figure correct then and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right there so you really have been doing this ... okay and then the last year or kicked in about the time you saw the light at the end the Donald income comes up ... yeah I mean what what was the hardest part of this for you all six and a half\nAnd a good and I think for me the hardest part was and starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see that a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper\nOr to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and um so I think when we paid off our first student loan and that was just such a victory feeling\nFor us and it was really hard at the beginning to go from letting our money kind of flow out wherever and to really nail down a budget and in the envelope system and that was hard for me to do\nNothing for me it's just the the sacrifice um you know the world we live and just the spirit of comparison and just seeing everyone around you spend money and buying new the nice things and I'm just constantly telling ourselves that will be later and you know when we went through the class and I know it's kind of what you always say but it really\nIt's been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can look like no one else in a really close to that because there were times where we wanted to give up or they would have been easy to just you know do what we wanted\nTo be here now to be able to talk to you and all these people and just say that we did it it's just an amazing feeling so\nNear free you know those are the ... the last three hundred pounds [laughter] it really does spending as much a lot of that yeah it's pretty incredible ... well I Know it was a long time and a lot of sacrifice was it worth it Yes sir yes that was were you ever go back into\nNo no no no we've never had credit cards we want to cash flow um we're I'm baby step for well at the beginning steps the baby step for but we're wanting to save up to cash for a minivan\nLiver let's say that but you know during the ...\nGood good for you guys like well congratulations to have more cheerleaders are more detractors as you went along\nHad a lot of cheerleaders yeah we were and really you know supported by our family and our friends especially once we started getting the ball rolling and\nPaying off dead it was kind of just people who are in disbelief that we were able to pay off so much and um\nAnd at the same time you wanted to make things for us with our journey was and being smart with our money especially all the extra income that was coming in and like that but we also wanted to still I'm available lord in use our money for him and so\nI'm a lot of you know for the first few years a lot of money was going out not towards our debt and we felt okay with that and so that's just part of our journey for people to not be afraid to still be generous while you're on baby step to even if it's a huge lump sound not cause the lord bless us and so many ways when we um\nI mean we've had both of our cars my cars like eleven years old and we don't want another car payment we're at the point to where we literally it was we were outgrowing our car like with the car seats he couldn't even put it sneak back all the way that he was like sitting out but we're getting a very hard\nAnd that so part of our story as my parents they blasted us and gave us their pay it off as TV oh wow yeah so um you know that's just one of the main you know blessings that um you know where it's given\nThen don't keep it a cause by keeping it tomorrow you bought it again in a sense so I think you take the offer or get a really sweet offer up the off or whatever but uh dumping a definitely do but\nNot only is in Little Rock Arkansas Hi Natalie welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up [noise]\nUm and how do you mean situation here I'm really not sure what you're going to tell me to do but we're working through your plans for the baby ... baby step to I'm paying off that so we only have no one dollar emergency pot and and the only thing that we have left to pay off is my car\nWhich I just discovered you recently until six months ago and it was I really needed a new vehicle we did the damn thing and buying a brand new car so I owe a lot on my car

a GMC Truck immigrants and strike good\nGood okay they said we're All right good [noise] wow uh I'll tell you what I did when I was in the same situation one time I rented a car for a month while I saved up the money to buy a car I'll bet you could save five thousand dollars a month\nYeah probably so\nAnd then by five thousand dollar car and drive it for six months or four months while you save up a bunch more money and get you a Fifteen or twenty thousand dollar car and pay cash for it OK so rent for one month by five thousand\nThen okay then drive it for four or five months and by your Fifteen or twenty thousand all with cash\nOkay because I don't borrow money anymore\nRight well we also we consider the option and talked about it or if they were thrilled about it but we only have a four O. one K.\nThat no no no no money anymore okay we don't borrow money well okay if you borrow money on four oh one K. it's a debt you borrow money is that borrowing it er yeah it's borrowing

you living with friends family what\nI'm living with frankly I bought a house out in the country because it's cheaper you\nAnd some friends were roommates yeah okay and so you have rent and electricity or shear and you have food and you need to get out and you need eight thousand dollars a year and yet they're okay so when we add all of that up what does your rent and other stuff cost you a month\nIt cost me about nine hundred thousand looking on my dad and I I work minimum wage ... things like clean needles holidays and things like that trying to make a little bit of extra money\nMhm okay All right so let's let's kind of had that up then I get about twelve thousand dollars a year for that and I need a thousand dollars a year for ... for tuition and some other are probably some books some stuff too but we're pretty close there so twenty thousand dollars a year as what\nYou need to earn it there and minimum wage doesn't do that in that sounds like you need a new job\n[noise] and I have an opportunity to start a whole failing family name brand clothing and and now I don't have the money to put up right now\nNo they don't need to get into that you have a job you\nNeed a job you need to so you can make more you can make 'em\nFifteen twenty dollars an hour babysitting and managing you can make good money cleaning houses Fifteen dollars an hour or ten dollars an hour cleaning houses I'm walking dogs or other stuff\nSo I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage and by the way you make enough to work your way through with the numbers that you and I are discussing here\nI'm In um you are going to be working all the time though and if you but if you can get a situation like that the semi self employed where you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever um and you uh\nCan control your time and you can

dropped by from hostile George right here in the lobby of Ramsey solutions Hi Dale how are you\nI'm doing great thanks Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nAh well I had a an unusual question and I've been pondering it for a while I'm after my divorce I moved to a guest and started working and I moved in with friends in their garage apartment mhm\nSo I have used the kitchen registering ... and laundry on normally think she would renting a room from um but I came across a condo that one down the realtors owned and I had an opportunity to buy it\nFor about fifty two thousand and its values anywhere from sixty five Seventy mhm and it ... and was rented when I bought it for a couple of years ago and it makes about Thirteen hundred dollars a month and I my rent where I Am an only five hundred and\nThis one's going to be available for the end of the year and I've been wondering do I want to\nMove into it make it in my own home now that it's making mhm so you bought it and it's rented right okay and what's your income oh average about thirty five thousand a year commissions\nMhm okay well the the way I answer questions what always ends up happening with me on stuff like you're describing is um what feels good and the short term might not be taking me to my long term goal\nAnd uh so uh when I'm always asking myself as warm where am I going to be in ten years in which of these decisions takes me there okay now obviously you can live in a garage barb how old are you\nI'm not fifty five okay and you can live in a garage apartment or your sixty five and you could make the transactional spread here\nUm make an extra some extra money doing that is what we're saying and then the question you ask yourself is is that worth it to you does that get you some place that you couldn't get otherwise um my tendency personally would be to do everything I can increase my income during the next ten years\nAnd be living in a condo\nOr I mean you landed in the garage apartment as a a a place to heal and and get reset after a divorce right\nBut that really was an ... it's kind of camping well when you're not a college student [laughter] I mean that's just camping that's right you know and so this isn't like your destiny it's not where you want to be long term but ... and so my point is just because of the numbers work on something doesn't mean it's right\nSo if you feel and you've settled you got your found footing under you again which I'm guessing you do that you bought a condo um probably moving into that condo but the ...\nWhat am I going to be doing ten years from now it makes me Seventy thousand to the thirty five and what track 'em on there what am I gotta do to get my support a healing is believing in yourself again at a way ... our our believe in yourself in a way maybe you never have to where you put yourself on a career track to get those in comes up long term\nBut a ... ... if that's where you are that's where your head as I think I'm going to move into the condo now if you're headed is saying you know I think I'm probably going to the solemn ever going to do I'm just going to ... thirty five thousand into retirement you might want to rent no garage department or the other money in your pocket\nBut I don't think that you know\nI'm not really like to purchase a house yeah keep ... rental income now well let's get it paid off\nIs paid off oh good that'd be awesome them you will by if you get an extra money to above and beyond to buy a house with I'm saving not at the moment not OK than living in a condo with no payment at all\nYou know you can do that and again getting your income up get you into that go faster so um I I'm going to be working on the income side of the equation and I'm probably going to go and enjoy that paid for condo it's a it's kind of like saying uh on back\nYou know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay yeah you're back yeah they all use back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house of them will pay cash for 'cause my income is going to go up and goes back\nAnd uh yeah I'm I'm not gonna camp anymore fifty five it was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but that but you're you know you got past that stage now your back is that okay yeah cool thanks for dropping by saying\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia like Claire how are you\nI'm good how are you know good how can I help\n[noise] um I have a question for you so we're all your data sets for a little less in the air now and I feel like we are on I had on retirement but we are behind on college savings for two kids so how old are your kids you\nAre they are twelve and ten\nOkay and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement I'm a little over a million over your head congratulations ... so what's your household income\nDefinitely feel that way but yeah we\nWe are I mean when you have more than a million dollars you're a millionaire yeah okay yeah you're you're right [laughter] yeah so ... what is your household income\nA little over two hundred okay\nSo why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get have plenty of money for college when you've got eight years before college\nWell we're paying for private school right\nNow as well what are you paying for brown to how much cash how much twenty thousand a year per kid or total total okay you make two fifty when looking at you like it you don't have like two hundred I leave me one eighty okay\nAnd if you can cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's ... ... that cash flow can be turned towards cash flow in college too if they choose a college that's a reasonably expensive\nYeah OK okay that's a good point and yes nine\nSo I I you know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement\nYou don't need it you're in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the moral\nBut I don't think you have to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for kids to school today we're going to offset some of that was cash flow in some college but some college we want to set aside\nAnd put Fifteen Percent ahead side so we're talking about thirty thousand dollars that's fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in return I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say something to college you say ten grand a year\nPer kid another twenty grand you can do that a front for from now until they go to school they'll have plenty of money\nI mean you just Jack up to five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control inside that five twenty nine get or the one that's more of us are pros and they'll help you do that click smart ... de Ramsey dot com for a list of them in your area the people we recommend them sit down when you help people that five twenty nine together\nAnd pop ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you are not working our plan at this stage\nBecause you put Fifteen Percent into retirement until college and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and you're a baby step seven to increase returned wrote me on Fifteen Percent and Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand thirty ground\nSo that that's what I'm doing the math here I think you can do it I think you just gotta sit down and not have this vague worry about it and instead of having an actual game plan will lay out and go this is important this is more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing so that we can do this\nIs true right around the mall I Do it the Wu grad but the Oregon a D I Wonder if he can speak on behalf of what\nI don't think I think it's got to step out yeah I think he's got about a boy\nYeah production other text from their production WB fourteen here's one that says eleven\nAnother text saying Fifteen to twenty no respect after Iowa State in the weeks schedule so far Rob tweets me and says WVU will be eleven and the first poll Aaron tweets my guest on the ranking is twelve to fourteen\nBut it went over Texas on Saturday puts West Virginia up to seven to ... keep those come and get a few minutes left to dive into those while we're waiting on some text to come in All right so than football recruiting West Virginia what they know their commit yeah phew the\nCommits was talk about them real okay we'll have ... uh the linebacker from North Carolina ... committed from West Virginia while ago a libertarian Henry cornerback fruit now plays in Tampa I'm also has\nTo be committed to West Virginia and then there's a lot of question about the Martin's Berg linebacker doing grant them about what his ultimate status is going to be with West Virginia whether he may have to go prep school were to go ahead and played a whole lot this year because of the foot injury but there are other aspects that may keep it\nFrom coming to West Virginia at least initially may have to take it in an old for an alternate route or to view but so it knocks him down to Fifteen in terms of the number\nOkay ... what's what's the level of concern on D commitments I Know you see that occasionally but what's the level of concern\nMinimal um I think West Virginia was starting to feel like they were over booking a little bit and kind of not getting leaving enough room for some of the transfers the Jew goes for your transfers of grad transfers that they've been so successful with in recent years\nAnd that's why they have slowed down so much in terms of taking commitments from high school players and I think they got to the point that go you know what we may need to reevaluate how deep we are into this considering they're only going to have twenty three scholarships this year because a couple of kids that came in\nThe summer are going to count ahead to the class two thousand in Nineteen so I'm their first junior college for ... in any a buddy but a ... a traditional high school player\nCame in a commitment today from\nTaj Austin junior college player from a familiar place or ... Lincoln high school in Mississippi Keith wash you know what your genes current started cornerback played for Colin last year\nUnder has gotten some other players from there and certainly the Mississippi junior colleges is the\nHeight of of West Virginia coal recruiting Joel Klein was the head coach in that realm ... our earlier in his career so West Virginia's mine that area now they get Taj Austin six for two hundred and thirty five pound a defensive end um ... long past rushing type\nOf guy um and again he comes in with three years a village Billy left because he's actually was a qualifier coming out of high school originally attended\nEast Carolina I'm In two thousand and Seventeen enrolled there in January red shirted that fall so last fall he red shirt cities Carolina then decides\nNot going to stick with the pirates\nAnd ends up in a junior college in Mississippi at Colin and uh so now is able to come out from one understand this January as a full qualifier and will not only get here in January but then we'll have three seasons of eligibility remaining so\nProbably needs a little bit more size at two thirty five if you know what he's going to be a down payment for West Virginia he needs to probably get to the two fifty to sixty range but a gets into a major cause weight program\nOr you'd like to think that that will take too long getting him into here in January ski that something West Virginia's his dressed as it always been the the ... for for ... years in terms of junior college commitments but or something they definitely like to see because if those kids are going to play quickly in here in January\nAnd less or I mean maybe he doesn't have to gain the weight you just put him at linebacker Giovanni Stewart\nMay move down to a deadline they're here that's next for him but you know again West Virginia's\nOne back record next year even with the law says that they've suffered that I mean everybody's eligible comeback that's currently lining up at linebacker for West Virginia plus the ones that you know the the ... Cohen from Alabama the transfer who's you know sitting out this year they're stacked a deposition which speaking\nOf so Dana announced last night on various calls you cleared so we've been talking about that when is he back when is the eligible to play I Am not going to ask you to speculate on how many snaps if any he gets on Saturday but what's he bring if he gets into the game what's he bring to\nActually pretty good pass Russia and that's where West Virginia used him last year was more on third down situations as a designated pass restaurant\nIt's hard for me to believe he'll play this Saturday and could be surprised but actually both the and burned and ferns are supposed to start practicing this week so now it's a matter of how quickly they get up to speed and practice what's their ultimate health\nConditioning level yeah exactly those type of things now\nTruthfully it's an easier decision on friends because he doesn't have a red shirt available yeah so you just send them out there and go what did your three and gives you a free plays it doesn't matter you're not trying to manage the four games and the ... for for all we know he's got a red shirt available he's but he's got to play a lesson for no West Virginia's for regular season games yes\nBut that Richard also counts postseason games so league championship bowl game college football playoff semifinals any of those things are are in there also a can you mark junior was in town this week understand his visit went very well on the basketball side of things um but\nNothing to report in terms of commitment or nothing that we've heard he saw that one yeah so it was if the Baylor game so he saw good what\nAre what they are going back all sorts of guy I think that's kind of an interesting one not just from getting some help than Depp\nRegardless of the number of plays it is but also from that roster management standpoint this is really one of the first ones we've seen where we've talked about all summer already who would be used how do you go in there when you put them in if you've got those four games do you put him in for five plays on Saturday if he's ready and then how to manage it how\nHow do you need you lose one then maybe that factor so yes I did yeah you're winning straight through to you keep rolling oil and if everybody else is healthy too right I mean ...

you die what happens to the pension and it goes away right\nUh probably would go to my wife is she still living would would continue to receive a lesser amount that's probably if I can take I can take it as a matter of survivor and probably get more\nYeah but are you healthy yes\nI Would take it as no survivor getting more and by Fifteen year level term insurance to cover your wife if something happened to you it's a better deal\nYeah go ahead and take all the money you can get you know OK I'm currently have a four hundred thousand dollar term policy show\nOkay yeah then that she's probably All right without the survivor benefit because that's going to replace your forty thousand dollars that you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay that that that are invested ... percent will be forty grams so that that's pretty good you're in\nGood shape and you can probably do it this way um\nI Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\nYou're you're in a way above average shape I'm In good shape is is is way above normal because normal just sucks okay you got to weigh better than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life\nFor the next forty years is going to get old\nAnd you don't really have any income coming other than that because your investments aren't big enough to create it and so I\nWould you know you can do it you can do it but I think you need to have in the back of your head you may be going back to work at some point\nI'm considered that I thought about it for the health insurance and um [noise] um and I've heard of these mega share programs do you\nThink I remember there was not driving this for me for what's driving it for me is you don't have much\nMoney right and you got the pension but I understand you know think about what what are\nYou know forty thousand dollars is going to buy in forty years when you are Ninety\nNothing yeah nothing\nThat's the problem with a guy here so it doesn't have a good long term prognosis of you guys just being able to live and we can figure out how you could live in other words if you had a million dollars a mutual fund this becomes like a no brainer\nInstead you got like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe if we scrape everything together after the failed around properties and\nYou know the farms got value but it's not producing any money so what might what I'm thinking is ... and again you can do whatever you want to I'm just talking it through with you OK I'm not saying you're you're you're you're wrong or you're bad or something but that's my concern of what I'm hearing\nIs and so I probably would think about what we always called an encore career and say what could you do that would be really fun\nThat you could make fifty grand or a hundred grand doing for the next five or six seven years\nAnd you didn't enjoy doing it start a business you'd have fun doing it and make some bank and bank all of it and health insurance as part of the day I don't care if you're working for somebody else you start a business but just do some what you're doing out and make you smile anymore so you need to get out of there\n[laughter] you picked up on that her\nYeah and so you know but I but I mean when you're you're young you have a lot of uh a lot of\nService to humanity left inside of you that you could get paid for ideas concepts things you could do I don't know what it is but it's something that just I mean I I'm just a little bit older than you I'm fifty seven and do not plan on work\nAnd it's not 'cause I Need money I don't need the money I got money coming in my ears but uh I'm working because I have a blast to find something like that\nAnd then you can work in hunt and fish and worked in hunt and fish and farm and you know\nBut but you know I'd like to see your bank another five or six hundred grand and the next eight years and have fun doing it that's what I'm saying that's a that's the only challenge I've got is I think there's God's got something inside of you there is something you can do more than hunting and fishing that\nOkay and not you know but no I won't sell it to you where you go into debt I'm not going to participate in that activity okay but if you want to sell it to our sheep and just help her\nUm because the four thousand dollars doesn't move the needle much in out of a hundred you follow me ... or what moves the need a lot of a hundred is the new getting really emotional about deeply sacrificing and using the huge income you have declared this debt really really fast so given those numbers I might\nGive up you know some of my value in the car or you got to scrape together five hundred and you pay me cash five thousand you can have the car I might do that but hunting I Am not going to participate you going into that\nYou're going to have if you're going to be that you're going to do it somewhere else because I Love you too much to participate in something that brings harm to you\nAnd that's even if my kids are grown and that's not me interfering in their life and that's not me being a control freak it's I'm not going to participate in anything that I don't think is good for you that brings you harm\nBecause I care about you and if they can't get that statement than they are options that little rebellious twitch seriously I mean that's just I mean if they can't hear\nLove coming from you that way then there's something wrong but I in your case what the numbers on my if you don't want to just show it to him cheap that's okay too but he's in one's fine with me but no going into debt is not an option Amy is with us in Spokane, Washington Hi Amy how are you\nGood Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell I've been listening to you for a couple of weeks and\nI'll bet that and I started filling out college applications that my daughter my son's already in college and right now I'm just like how did we get him into much debt already he's in two years or ... that he started his second year of school and\nMy daughter will start like I said in the fall but he already has a like\nTen thousand dollars and a and school grounds and then we have fourteen thousand and apparent pie phone [noise]\nMhm and so I'm just struggling and know how do I get through this thing and how do I get them through college\nWhere is he in school\nA Washington state university\nAnd kind of what is the tuition\n[noise] ah about well the first year at twenty seven oh tuition it is um [noise] around [noise] I Can't even think twelve eight\nTwelve thousand okay tough that probably pretty close on my animal off but it should be about there in state tuition and yet at school or something like that the national average is about ten but I think Washington's a little bit higher okay and so um that's the tuition only and he's living away from home on campus\nNo he's not living on campus you know living in a house trade paying very minimal for rent\nOkay that's good news okay because you're working\nYes he works about twenty five hours per week right now but it does make about fourteen dollars an hour\nThat's decent okay good good [noise] okay and we got to get him on a really really tight budget and needs to be applying for scholarships left and right yeah you guys helped him sit down and figure out what you can contribute\nTo the equation so between his hard work between the scholarships and you can your contribution and the fact that he's in a reasonably inexpensive school\nUm we just sit down and really iron the wrinkles out of this and figure out how we can pull it all together and make it happen with no more debt and don't add any more debt\n[noise] okay so then my question is we had the third we have a car loan where\nWe have a car loan for Thirteen thousand five hundred dollars and then I've got he's got that parent PLUS Loan now do I start paying hammering on the parent PLUS Loan or do a camera and the cars\nOn your car loan a car loan and then the parent plus non yes\nOkay because I didn't know if that 'cause it you know when you go down your um step and I didn't know invest for kids with\nNumber five but we're not investing for now trying to cash flow with them yeah help him get through with no more new debt you're you're not you're past the point of
