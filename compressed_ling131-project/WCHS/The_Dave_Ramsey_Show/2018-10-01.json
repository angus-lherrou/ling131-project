Mary art and\nThey were one for two for a touchdown so [laughter] it's hard to criticize them for that you know ... maybe should have ... been too for for you to touch downs but\nFrom a defense I was a defensive coordinator for the defense his side of it people who run some of those type place cost you a lot of practice time\nUh getting ready for them because you know they they every show for yards a play\nAnd then they run one of those places so the the coordinator at the west marshals is doing some things just travel Lucian a defense up there and he did that first one early in the in the was the first series that was in the ball game\nAnd it got um a touchdown so you know that's good I think he he ... he ... you have certain down distances positions on the field is usually the game plan for those things and you're expecting a certain type of defense so they're they're pretty well planned out we uh\nWe run a few ... when I was there and ah sometimes they work and sometimes they did that's just a a way it is they're all designed to go for a touchdown is just scored how you execute but uh\nI think it it causes it helps you from the vantage the defensive coaches had to work against them\nAll the time in Europe predictable and your play call and you're just like the you know anytime you wrote something like ... you're not you're you're just not executing in uh uh didn't make any difference what he calls they're gonna probably\n\nOkay Tim we appreciate the phone call things you're checking in and you can do so as well you have to do is call eight hundred seven six five talk eight hundred seven six five eight to five five really take her next break come back we'll have more with the two coaches you're listening to the ... and bumper show on metro news\nI'm a scientist one of hundreds were in a mile in West Virginia I've been here for twenty eight year driven and improve patient my one of those ... or my wife she takes a drug that helped develop right here in Morgantown going up to six hundred products selling America say my work is personal that's\nAn understatement it's why I'm proud the Milan is committed to creating better health for a better world that are America a better West Virginia [laughter]\nNo money every school sports in the mountains in things like medical follow your favorite team up all day long on schools for grind signing your friends and\nFirst singer and Jane Jacqueline Saturday morning final scores stories and more high school scoreboard metro\nNew our ranking released Sunday night along the jury's\nMore football so he's three and a had done that in some measure of West Virginia\nMany websites selling medication may look professional and legitimate but the vast majority of site selling prescription drugs are doing silly legally have you seen Web sites\nThat don't require prescription or offer to ship medicine internationally then you've seen a rogue websites off and they sell sake nuts with too little too much or no medicine at all criminals\nUse websites to sound counterfeit medications that may contain life threatening toxins that pharmacy instant website verification program that helps you identify faith and trust where the online pharmacies you know we're dot com is located in the website address right [noise] that's where you'll find out\nPharmacy and because it's part of the website address that pharmacy cannot be thank I think that\nIs the um on a website means safety only don't pharmacy website or fraud proof\nPurchasing medicine online doesn't have to mean risking your house finding a safe online pharmacies easily just look for pharmacy to the right at the time in which side addressing public service message from the national association of Ford's pharmacy\nThe following is made possible by that [noise]\nBecause the players get terribly all over\nThe debt joke corny grown or the but also one of the simplest ways to share a moment with your kid\nCanceling framed [noise]\nTurtle\nAnd kids that spend more time with their dad to grow up to a smarter more successful [noise]\nTiny kitten and\nWith any luck funnier adults\nWide scale going to have anybody to go way\nDad jokes [noise] to take a moment to make them on it\nWhich is easy it's going to fatherhood dot Gov rocky by the U.S department of health and Human Services and the hearing\nFind out what happened overnight with America in the morning and the voting news week the morning to five on the voice of Charleston five eighty ...
