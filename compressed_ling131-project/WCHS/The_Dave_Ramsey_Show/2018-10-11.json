{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "Yeah that's great\nYou're doing All right I mean it was a let me ask you this practice good today\nAre not too bad lower end but a pretty good job at the white conditions\nAll right let's talk about this ball club vibe in one on the season you're only lost to a very good Lincoln county ball club this year ... people a force Lincoln county not eligible for the playoffs because they play six ... months still that's a good ball club but obviously\nYou have a very good dean what makes you go right now they've\nI'd say most for just a just a bunch of seniors is just want to make a name for herself uh they uh you know I've gotta I've gotta\nThink seniors it's played behind a group of but a group of seniors graduated last year that\nThey was always in the shadow of and they just slowly worked hard all year industry we've we've got better every week\nYou know it's a band ball club to spread mentioned you've won five games and you talk about the good group of seniors and kind of looking back over the last couple of years\nBack in two thousand sixteen is six and four team didn't make the playoffs kind of a tough and all the two thousand Seventeen season kind of spring boarding into this year at\n... I Would imagine then the success of two thousand Eighteen and his group of seniors they've kind of seen it on the other end of the spectrum the last couple of years they kind of build and build for this run here in two thousand Eighteen is that somewhat accurate\nOr somewhat I don't know if it's total or we\nLike say a I had a couple of kids I think I got about three boys is what he wants team two years ago\nAnd uh just didn't play for one reason or the other and last year uh when when I step aside as they got back into it and and got a little taste of it and and the ... to stay with us\nI don't live like say it's ... ... we went in the summer months and then we plan on doing one thing and then when a bunch of always come out and I had some more numbers than we expected\nThis things slowly progressed and and\nYou say we got mounting seniors are going to get above we just started a year we had a bunch of always it was just for all we know experience and a lot to learn and and they've slowly bought into what we've been other coaches and talking to them and we've progressed every week\nThe building back to your last game of twenty seven fourteen victory at Taco Bell you force five turnovers in that game what keyed that defense of effort\nWe want to buy the front a told them always you know that's the first time I think we'd want to know each other probably since two thousand want\nAnd uh we'd we'd like good beat him last year and we we should not have when I have five or six years ago against them other than that they they ... and\nWe ... we had to get up front first first couple of games and we just you know they sit front this I don't know if they wanted to prove a point but for the first time and I could probably save my tenure here that was the best we looked up front\nTalking when they go to the price of the van highschool bulldogs let's talk about one of those kids you know a lot of times I I think opposing teams the a player come out and they say yeah well he he's big but he's probably not all that good however\nIn this case if you want to talk about somebody that in my mind a bit of my eyes as what it is like to be a ban bulldog and has to be decoded Philips\nHow to go to meet with when I went to school with these parents the parents is from here a lot of farm raised their hand\nAnd got hurt to think getting to miss game to actually missed Lincoln county gang uh bought and bought it for sure what exactly was Romney if he did some slow therapy there and and\nEver since I think it was two game together he came back it's\nGot this went to the doctor and told him to release him and and the doctor told me he didn't think it was nothing serious and\nIf a few people watched him over the last two weeks you ever thought he missed a game this year and a because it's just I mean when you said when you said he's proud to wear a Jersey on friday night demand a just like a lot of Anglo players I've had in the past I mean he he gets after\nWhat are your quarter player quarterback is a guy named ... Smith and kind of watching some highlights right now from the ... game and I know we had a hundred and Seventy yards passing earlier this year against Peyton city you know read ask you about the one athlete there may be on your your signal color your quarterback Gavin Smith and and how he's progressed this year\nWell ... ... ... and another player with for years and as fresh from plates and valuable time on a playoff team that\nAny place roles that are played more defense in off the Internet as a sophomore didn't players played more of a ... force and last year I think ... got him and he'd quarterback some games for them and\nWe knew that was his arm that he could present some problems in St Louis ball the most ... schools didn't see and I mean Gavin Long and every week I mean he's had some very games obviously but uh now that we\nAre getting better run on the ... it's really opened up more for him and then and\nIt's if somebody would come watch them and said this guy was you know at quarterback and he's fourth or fifth career game they would probably not believe it but ah ah the sky's the limit for Gavin I mean these came a long way to show that a lot farther you go\nThe way this uh this other gentleman Steven yeah they're just send us an email saying that story he figured this out Toy Story to his ran between five thousand and six thousand miles in her career since middle school based on twenty miles a week about fifty two weeks per year and he says that is conservative\nSo how many trips to California that [laughter] you would be out and back would you would just want our coach young on at this point let's do that Mike young how you doing buddy [laughter] are you Fred\nI Am well sir and well and uh let's talk about this wheeling central\nCatholic ... room nights ball club uh wow what can you say six you know or you have gone through some very very tough teams and are you guys keep rolling along obviously I Hope at least hopefully you're staying away from injuries right now\nThat's a key Fred we uh we get banged up that Lindsey game a pretty physical ball game couple of weeks ago and\nWe had to take it back off a little bit in practice because we had to get ready for stimulus Catholic central which was a heck of a game a last friday night and now we uh we face march very purple riders a friday night air and it's going to be about a battle there too\nYeah talking about the Steubenville capital a game and looking at kind of the notes after that they all games you by Thirteen Yard's not often somebody out gains wheeling central offensively but was really the key as offensive play break prices interception returning it a hundred yards for a touchdown and the second half was that kind of the the the play the gods her team over the hump last weekend\nUh it definitely gave us momentum on a it stopped or a big driver there's that uh you know they they they went down to it down to feel with some good yard age and\nYou know with our defenses planned very very aggressive are up ... points on the board but when you're banged up that takes away some of your your timing of ah of their receivers and your backs and everything so\nYou know we got to continue to keep working hard as key to our a season and we got to keep working hard to be in good condition in good shape because our numbers are down a so we don't have a lot of back up and uh that that causes you know a ... for us to be concerned in terms of\nHow hard we practice for the week and a and how how many people have ready to play friday night\nLike you mentioned trying to stay away from injuries the first couple of games of the season you're without loop to plow guy on the line how much does it help to have him back in line up\nOh he's he's a senior leader on our team uh it does a great job up front offensively and the offensively so\nYou know the chemistry of your team is based on a lot on your seniors and your leadership and we have some pretty good juniors leading the way and and and Kurdish muggy and uh at Emory and of course a ... a for a fate Marlene you know you're young kids are are stepping in there too so\nAh leaderships used chemistry is huge a injury free is you\nBalance on this team don't you go to I mean you're solid both on the ... not one area you can pick on on your willing central team you talk about the blocking and tackling and everything else but this is about ... a very very balanced ... have been defensive squad and two thousand Eighteen\n[noise] ah when you have the talent we have and the coaching staff that I have with with coordinating the fence coordinate that defense a I've got quality assistance that are true loyal and they work hard with the kids are we spent time more than just a on the field together\nAnd you know it it's it's all a work in progress every day I I firmly believe that the ... and the number of distractions and can get in a way a throughout the course of a week or ... that they're they're very challenging but to stay focused on the task at hand\nTo stay focused on doing your job on a specific play is huge and ah\nWe always say next man up we always say make this fight it played better than the last play ah we believe that we're going to try that we're going to work that and that's the case that says success I Believe and that's you know that's not philosophy\nOr that's action in the works and um [noise] these kids have bought into that and that's why I had the respect for them and and the love I have for them because they buy into what were selling as the coaching staff and and um that's that's how you're one\nOf my buddies are going to let you go by the way I'm your ball club I mean you've you've had three shut outs this year you're six you know through six games your team has given up the fewest amount of points of any team in the state regardless of class AAA double a single a\nThat's what we've really been hidden for the last two or three weeks is that you know everything that that we wrote down the kid's wrote down goals beget a year and every single one of the playoffs and if you can control what you can control and that whenever a game that you play\nFrom here on out than than you are going to be there you know but if you if you slip up and\nAnd lose one you know now you put your fate of somebody else's hand account on somebody else dilutes to let you get in so I was going to continue to focus on what we can control in a mosque turnovers of penalties and come out hoping to win every week\nYou have to look at the big make during class double A. you guys are currently sitting in Tempe tied with graft in it for one obviously you need you guys to focus on one game at a time because there's very difficult opponents leapt on your schedule but\nLooking at a double a as a whole how difficult is it this year when you've got your ... there's probably gonna be a seven when team certainly a number of six teams that are going to be left outside\nRight now it's a it's a tremendously competitive here in double a or you know there's potential that there could be four undefeated teams by the end of the year or maybe five point pleasant still undefeated as well\nUm you know that we could end up at five hundred feet a team so even with one last year you may not even get in at a an eight seed you know where your house and so a competitive from top to bottom um a lot of big games this week and a lot of big ape sitcom\nUm basically I think if we could control we can control a and continue to play like we've been playing\nAh yeah we went out to Oregon and put herself in a good position\nOh I like your position if you do that I'd like your\nA number to him right now and uh with the games ahead of you yeah I like I mean I Know you take one of the time that's all you can do that but you get this went on the road coming up this Friday night by a dance is\nPretty good anybody that I'm definitely a big win for us it is indeed always a pleasure Kevin best of luck to you and we'll talk soon okay\nAbsolutely thank you for having me on a really appreciate it then thank you for every day that you do for our kids in our state\nWe appreciate you that's given board and coach Petersburg as this big game friday night game\nYeah really is and and ... his dog is not a big game against Frankfurt but really a good opportunity here for the Vikings\nYeah and when I'm not to reiterate my the point I just made but I mean a game like that so huge considering the points that are at stake now obviously there's one less potential point at stake for Frankfurt because Petersburg he's only play nine games but I mean you get this game this week you're probably in great position\nThe loser of it may ... when they turn the page the Tuesday and look at the FCC ratings maybe on the outside of the top sixteen obviously there's still a long way to go but uh yeah in terms of consequences this is probably one of the bigger games are across the state this week\nI think just as there are I think it's the biggest game for Petersburg and the reason I say that these because they have three games left all against class single a ball clubs\nYeah cello and the amount of points available more field struggling I took her county's very good east already struggling like we don't usually the eastern already struggle so it's going to be interesting going to be real interesting but\nWe'll see we'll see what happens to see what must do a I had a break schedule but it could rich board of graft and is on board right now so let's go ahead and bring rich on board a rich how you doing buddy\nHey I'm doing great how are you\nDoing well glad to have you aboard a protest saying that uh this talk about ... buddy are born one season a much like we were just talking with a\nWith a head coach a Kevin board\nIs is born what do you do to me than I Do know is totally at all and you know and I and I am Holly does well my fault but we were talking with gambling and of course the the the game that didn't happen so you both in the same position\nWith nine games this year but let's talk about you more and more than ... honestly it's good to see the ... back in contingent again\nOh it sure is and and you know we've got a ... it's we've been down a couple of years and um oh we've got a great group of kids to work with and I've got a an outstanding coaching staff and uh it looks like we're headed back in the right direction\nYou know I take a look at the schedule the one real blemishes that game against ... Glen you drop that won by twenty eight but you bounce back\nWith the women liberty Harris than than a hard fought game with Lincoln last weekend tens seven take me back to that game against Lincoln and sounds like when it's ten to seven in the final that game probably came down just a couple of places here or there\nWell it certainly did it was uh extremely physical game up you know Lincoln hadn't been given a lot of credit this season but to be honest with you they had uh their their losses or to you know extremely good football teams with a Robert cheaper Nicholas county and liberty when they were full strength\nAnd uh we anticipate it was going to be a\nHard fought very physical game and we got just what we anticipated um you know both teams made some mistakes there there were apparently that hurt both teams and uh we lost our quarter back um and had bringing a sophomore or like more\nWho are really just a a modest victory took down the field on the on the phone driving the game and made some great decisions call the number and and uh uh made a great run and made it very throw and and allowed us for the game out at the end\nJust a white hair really in a game winning touchdown pass to put you guys they had Blake's composure on that final dry did it surprise you that a guy who hadn't yet been in not only in a a a league game situation but in a situation like that where you have to ... to get the victory did his composure surprise you\n[noise] ah ... didn't I've been in this for very long time ago I was an assistant with Mike scanner for for twenty five years and and I'm headed into my thirty fifth year here and\nAnd you're kind of get to know athletes and kind of get a pretty good feel for what they're capable of doing and uh even when like played last year as a freshman you just knew that he was going to be something special down the road and\nHe just has that kind of demeanor where he does it get overly excited [noise] um and uh and I knew that we were in good shape when he came over to the sidelines various hound outfit head coach I can write a K but we'll call play\nAnd that's the play that or we ran a counter and he just pull the ball and ran and got the first day on and then a little bit later through the touchdown pass to to uh to justice\nWhich are going with the coach rich boarded the graft in ... given the only sixty nine points this season um usually guys like ... and those kids up front doing a great job for you\nWell we uh we have a we're very fortunate or or uh guys up front um have have really come for for us this year\nWe're still relatively young upfront ah but ah you know they\nThey played like seasoned veterans and and I give a lot of the credit to that to uh or or off line coach Mike Johnson and our office coordinator Mick Foley uh have have both a have done good jobs work with these kids and ah [noise] ah they stepped up and and done everything we've asked them to do\nThat for and ask you about that often the line and their ability to block in their opening holes aren't they this year ... the senior and seven hundred and twenty nine yards rushing he's closing in on going over last year's total of over nine hundred yards as a junior and tell me about ... what makes them so such a national ... cat in the backfield\nWell Caleb as that uh that kind of zone running mentality or\nYou know we're we're uh we were kind of a ... team and and when you when you block gaps you you're kind of run straight ahead a Caleb is always looking to make that cut back run and and uh [noise] uh he's been very successful with that for years\nIt's better graft in high school and and uh have combined to kind of combined both of those together and and make some great runs a season and a very physical kid although he's not real real big uh he's gotten a lanky he's a he's a physical runner and and ah it's ah it's paid off for us down the road ship it certainly has\nJoined I wrapped in head coach rich more to coach defensively and and it started out your first game of the season knocking also a barber twenty seven to six but defensively even loud six points to PBS shutout against these pheromones seven points each day against liberty and Lincoln particularly in a liberty game\nOr what did you guys do well against them out to news 'cause obviously that's a huge game on your schedule because you know they're going to win some more games coming in\nWell I I thought we tackled very well we were very physical going into that game and and uh\nYou know in the conference that we play and you really don't have a choice a you're either very physical or you don't survive very well and you know you take a look at the Victorian across the board even some of your schools that don't have any records or our coffers takes turns or just you know really beating each other out playoffs\nAnd if you're not physical or you're not going to be successful\nAnd that some of the time and how the weather related to turn ... doing a good coach\nAnd uh you know we went into that game and you know I I have to be on a show at liberty or\nAre they had a couple of they're very good players were unable to play a and I'm you know we we kind of got caught took advantage of that and our kids were very aggressive upfront we moved the ball while in office and uh [noise] uh it was just one of those nights where everything was clicking\nThat's what you're wanting this week isn't it Oh absolutely you know it's\nIt's it's got to be one step at a time you know a looming down the road is an extremely difficult part of our schedule um it is the most difficult part it's what's going to determine how far we go and uh you know you just got to continue to get better every week and you can't look for it and you can't look backwards\nVoice of Charleston five eighty WC age as\n... we'd be morning that non is presented in part by Russia plumbing and heating survive but is it the new state of the current
