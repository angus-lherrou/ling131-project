second half ... keep in mind [noise] ... ah first Dr evaporated on them so let's see what happens there who were here with her first job of the second half\nSecond half kickoff comes down to key details ... Herbert Hoover he's across the thirty across the thirty five to thirty six yard line so Hoover start out pretty good field does is\nIt going to have an opportunity here in like a coach Maher said they got to move the football that's the one thing they were not able to do in the\nFirst step they did a pretty good job of containment what has been a pretty potent poker off and it's all season long\nDefensively Hoover played very well as we said though all sensibly yeah\nYeah St played with the other side inside of the thirty five to thirty third that is working well for them is that all taco played left an arrived they found something there that they can move the football on and that's good enough for the first I don't\nThink they went away from the tendency there because the formation Christian Greg certainly they're going to run it to the right then came back to kind of the week side and picked up the first then\nWell what they're doing is they're lining up of course he is the tail back and they're putting two blocking backs Dylan and Spencer\nIn front of him [noise]\nSo it is now first down antenna [noise]\nAll about the thirty four yard line they're going to hand it all the Spencer again and he's going to be stacked up than he'll get positive yard age inside of the thirty five right at the thirty\nHoover content just to keep it on the ground keep ground in a way because as long as you're moving your head and toward ... as long as you're moving keeping that off into poker officer you\nKnow that's kind of what we talked about on the first half they hit a couple of times straight in a row their full back and then they switch gears\nClark wanting for thirty two and the third period poker leading seven no nothing but Hoover with their most promising grab a night\nAlso in their own or Bartley as one of the late blockers for key snap comes back to hand it off the Spencer again he gets to straight up as the ...\nMost of the line of scrimmage minimal gain their give him about two on the Kerry it'll bring up\nThird down NFL\nFor all the defensive and is getting just frozen when it comes across 'cause he if he over commits the hand it off if he stays at home white keeps it pitches has another option to pitch it and so far that's been there the Hogan is not adjusted\nTo that yet and this is too down territory goes you've\nGot to down to make minimal yard it's\nSingle receiver splits out why do the far side to blocking backs again ventures in tight this time it's more of an eye formation and they'll pitched a key looking to get the outside lowers the shoulder times for the pile on on the first down stick and he's got to be close but I'm not sure he got\nIn that time he did take the second option he did not handed to the first man through because the defense it adjusted and that's turned around and made the pitch and you're trying to get the corner but Polk it at a pretty good job stirring it out\nIt is going to be for down animal out too so we only managed to get a yard as he came to the near side\nDown to the twenty seven yard line yeah if you're pogo wanna [noise]\nYou've been picking them up to three four yards at a time so you got a pretty good chance of getting this done if you keep doing what you been doing [noise]\nBartley is the full back out of the information hard snap count they handed off decay lowers his shoulder runs into the poker events they're pushing him sideways and I don't think he\nGot I think the second effort Greg did not have it it really looks\nLike it looks like the mark from the from the near side with the guy on the line judge on the sideline it's the second half or the you're right they're heading stock that I have that can never\nKnow they hit him and got him moving sideways and then of course the first down the guy who was the first down chain he moved to drop the chain and I thought they kept pushing laterally but apparently\nThey did not it is a first down at appear what appears to be what the twenty four yard line Jeff\nYes twenty four and two forty left in the third grounds imposes had their offices in on the field for three to ... ... [noise]\nHoover moving the ball trailing seven announcing here and the third quarter they handed off the key and they just got him by the ankle is he dies inside of the twenty to the Eighteen and a flag\nVehemently comes out of the pocket of the pack judge them pushing and shoving going up against on the line of scrimmage if it's against poke a boy Hoover is going to be happy and spread language the one who got stopped got his\nHand in their\nJudging from the reaction of the Hoover players though I think they're thinking they're going to be guilty or something here since the ... ... ... ...\nOh yeah he through that thing way up in the air it is going to be a personal foul against Hoover personal foul guess poker so the penalties all set\nYou know it's certainly been some short fuses out there because this game becoming more and more intense as the\nMoments the minutes took away and the score remains fairly tight got a good one cooking here what\nDo you get about a three yards on the carry their ball\nThe yard lines are sort of obliterated in that part of the the it looks like it's about the Eighteen yard line maybe [noise]\nSo it is second down and\nCall it five four Hoover\nAt the Eighteen they handed oh a any runs into the left side of that defensive line and I mean they smack him in math\nOkay they've adjusted to that [noise]\nThat was excellent hit by the coda meadows\nAnd also villain Taylor right there to meet him stonewall ... in the old\nMove the ball back to know about the Eighteen yard line so call it a one yard laws and it will now be third down an now seven [noise] he lost a yard or two on that one Thirteen carries forty one yard for key unofficial\nSinger receiver over to the far side clock rowing to the end of the third quarter here it's a minute twenty to go and the third Herbert Hoover looks at eight thirty down and about six and [noise] before you can get the snap off of five yard penalty on a false start\nThat backs them up\nYou know not worry and needed it that's for sure moves it back to what looks to be about the twenty five yard line\nStill for down territory for the huskies here so I expect they'll get two boys to get this done\nThird down at about eleven for Herbert Hoover\nOne minute and ten seconds to go here and the third quarter\nSinger receiver the near side singer the far side a straight a formation key is the tail back Reggie White which over the poke a defense\nMake some adjustments play clock down to three seconds and he's going to have to burn a timeout\nFifty five seconds to go into the third

in seven Herbert Hoover it's seven and I think post on the huskies are moving the ball here in the third quarter [noise]\nThere's a discussion over here in the near side line between the white cap and coach sent the Ramsey [noise] a\nPoker coaches are saying that the one of the running backs and Hoover's just given like a little bit of a twitch [noise]\nHaven't seen it but then again I'm not really looking for that time you know as it stands it down in eleventh sure they'll keep an eye on it now sure they will\nIn a lab in front of the poke at twenty five yard line it's an eye formation for rent white the quarterback snap comes back they pitch it to key looking for running room juice it to the outside comes back to the inside he'll get inside the twenty down to about the looks like Nineteen yard lines\nThat right Jeff I I Will say that yeah you're at the Nineteen yeah the yard lines in the middle of the other kind of obliterated by the rain and the the college [noise] and so it's kind of a gas but\nFor now six thank goodness that button career and technical center sideline reporters there to save the day\nFor them six year for Hoover big play round here for both teams over Santa great drive [noise]\nPaid for it to stall at this point it should\nBe the final play of the third quarter on both down an sick from the Nineteen rent white drops backfires a pass he's got a wide open wide receiver remakes to catch it and he did not get it looks like he's going to be right down right at the Fifteen yard line and say for yard\nPass and catch and it'll be a turn over on down\nTo a break for the huskies that penalty certainly hurt 'em a moment ago\nTask was caught bomb a girl goes down\nBecause you think about the penalty guys I send them back five yards that run there just a moment ago would have been enough to pick up first down that run but been key but for the past would have put them into position with first and tenants of the twenty as it stands now all goes over\nAnd poker gets another opportunity to poke it takes over on their own team yard line six seconds to go here and the third quarter can a husky defense stand up again my client of hand is the tail back Jay cook the quarterback on first down they pitch a tent a clan of hand looking to get up to the outside\nHoover's chasing him down he will be here and brought down it's going to be short\nOf the twenty five yard line and that'll be the end of the third quarter seven announcing vocal were back in sixty seconds on five eight ...\nAnd they can get out of bounds clocks ruin [noise]\nActually get a three yards\nForth and go here and they're going to try\nYou know they're gonna send the kicker other in droves he'll do come away with points and then maybe you know once I get a little early for\nThat yeah there's a little early on I mean honestly the for the audience has been playing around kick the ball all the what happened [noise] now the field goal attempt ball is going to be spotted down\nAt about the sixteen yard line it as a twenty six yard kick for John Campbell he approaches kicks in is that it is good so Herbert Hoover is on the board six fifty four to go in the game seven to three\nIn thirty seconds on five eight ... C. H. S.\nDoes your network me better support if you think you're paying too much in getting too little then you need to upgrade your IT support team called Quinn computers quit his building\nReputation by

look them up online course down by their location in Spring Hill Quinn computers in their business to give you back to you or [noise]\n\nSo it wasn't a touchdown as ... but they did come away with points on a good drive fifty yards it was eight plays and it ended up being a twenty six year I'd feel go by John Campbell now ... seven to three\nAnd really when you consider the fact that it was first and go from the thirty one guy that was\nReally nice finish\nFor Hoover on that Dr they're lining up for the kickoff in here to go it is great white\nPoker looks like they are anticipating a non sidekick with McLean of hand and Miller is you can see Canada rain picking up a little bit more is Campbell approaches\nAnd he is going to kick it over to the near side it's going to get past my client of hand he's got a scoop it up at the tornado of aids attack all he's going to the far side of the twenty five and he finally brought down and then a flag comes in you heard that Hoover coaches across away from us screaming for a crack back and it looks like the white Catholic grade\nYeah absolutely and that's a there's a reason that's illegal and the reason is he's on his one me right now trying to figure out what his name is Andrew dice clay or there is Brandon Hammons and boy he got he got to reverse or feel by\nBy the return or yeah there's the there it is [noise] helmet to helmet call guys\nAre still Fifteen yard\nSo that's kind of put poker backwards and they're gonna have to start this drive from deep in their own territory 'cause that occurred at a map the twenty eight twenty eight yard was low inside the ... of the yeah\nThe ... plant a hand due to the ball on the far side line or near some and do you guys and then when he reverse field that's where you get into trouble they're moving in with your block tell\nYou what your guy I mean you kinda get the feeling right now that all the momentum is kind of going toward the husky\nFirst down antenna I've got a pitch it to the clan of hand come into the near side trying to evade taxes trying to get a little help from his line as it gets across the Fifteen to sixteen yard line two yards on the pick up it'll bring up secondary\nCredited rescued even as I saw a lot of hands going for that ball somebody trying to strip that out of there and if you're McLean and you've got to secure that thing cover both points of hot and your bread basket goes who were doing everything they can get a turn over here and get the ball back\nTo what my plan a hand has been hailed to eleven yards here and the second half so they haven't had the ball\nYou know six Thirteen to go here yeah this is only what their third position second position a lizard third\nYeah they punted on those second down and about eight for poke a three\nAnd the backfield cooked wants to throw it now he's gonna run to the near side running for the stakes he is going to be hit an punched out of bounds at the Seventeen yard line and say one yard game [noise]\nThere were down and long\nFive fifty one to go here seven to three pogo leads it but Hoover\nTheir defense fighting here trying to get the ball back and if they can hold them in force it upon it would probably guaranteed I'm pretty good feel position\nAll out of the field of play it did stop the clock with five minutes\nAnd fifty one seconds\nSchemes hospitals over to the near side singer receiver over to the far side cook up under center it's got to blockers\nAnd a single set back the clan of hand the clan of hand takes the pitch he's looking to get outside of aids attacker stays on the he's got the sideline first down and more now on the far side line fifty yard line into territory and the same official the likes to talk that flag forty yards in the field just one other one is going to be against\nHoover I'm Maria\nCame at the end of the run and it was a pretty good run guts out across midfielder now they're going to have probably fifty more on to\nThink what a big play that was not counting what happened to him that nice blocking\nBy poker in terms of defenses\nIn inside the taco got out there in the tide in in creative route from Atlanta hand to uh to turn that corner and that's the key for him to turn the\nThirty one yards on the Kerry and then a Fifteen yard penalty against Hoover\nAnd the huskies were really set up their defensively trying to get to stop and forced upon and they were going to be on the cat ... but now they are but by behind the eight ball\nWith the ball on the thirty five yard line of Hoover worry it'll be first down in Sanford poker with an eye formation that died\nAnd it all to my clan of hand and he is hit across the line of scrimmage he will be brought down shy all the thirty yard line that about the thirty one\nSo the clock roles five twenty eight now if you're poker\nYou're in a position now where you're just trying to burn the clock well\nAnd you know we talked about undefeated teams we talked about championship teams and of course you know quite a way away from wheeling island stadium but an undefeated season and these are the kinds of things you take advantage of you get a big stopped down their aided by some penalties than you pick up the big run on dirt down\nAnd what seemed like a long way and then you pick a huge\nRun through a lot of time here [noise]\nSecond down as whistles blowing poke his all fence a little confused they want to take a timeout with four fifty six to go\nAnd the ball game seven to three oh go on top of Hoover we're back in thirty seconds on five eight ...\nAny of it these tires poker wrote the commercial I'll read it folks bring their problems to us because we can fix it by saying breaks sharks tires water pump air conditioning Satan smoke should you get the idea\nThen they said if your car gives you any kind of trouble getting into trouble or guys knew how to fix it and do it quickly\nCenters in service poker we're right downtown [noise]\nStadium is San jose in West Virginia where the Dodgers are leading seven to three and they have the football by the way an upset in triple a\nNumber one spring valley losing tonight to double

after a marathon game back to buster and Jim on the show ... ... ...\nLine from Dodger Stadium and it was a rough night for ... what were those guys doing in game three\nWell that was a indescribable what happened there kittens are on the ball up the middle that we had had a couple of options there he said his feet and still make a strong throw or he could eat that ball and have runners at first and third no running still the ties are still one run ahead and instead\nHe chose to force of all over the first made a terrible throw to a catcher playing first base that was a mistake that kids are I'm sure will regret was not an easy play he did stumble bony did stumble then there's\nThere's a time to reset yourself as for new as he was all over the field last night and I understand he's got foot problems in anger problems and everything else but when he fell into the stands last night catching that foul pop up that allowed ... to ... go to second base on that play and that change the entire inning\nAs opposed to envy and at first and being a second base\nAnd buster on the base paths those two guys I showed a lot of written hustle and couldn't have been juxtapose anymore than by what went on with many Machado again showing some like a muscle\n[noise] yeah hits the ball off the left the wall but assume that it would be a home run and Cadillac he's going to first base he was not close to being a home run and it was also noticed that he wasn't running out other pop ups look I talked with a value waiters other teams today who said certainly took notice of this\nAnd they're frustrated by their disgusted by what he's done in this postseason one evaluate are saying you know I've always been a fan of many\nNot anymore and look this is a player who's going to be a one of the highest uh names in free agency this ball and one of the questions being asked is if he's not going to hustle now when everything's on the line in the world series can you trust them to hustle in a long term deal\nTim I'm some may not have been up at a three thirty eastern time twelve thirty Pacific time ... Belcher was very forthright with you what he wanted to do right after the game right\nI was not prepared for this I asked about crazy that game was and he said here's how crazy it was\nI had to go to the bathroom for the last eleven and things of the game but the drug testers were there and they told us You're not allowed to go to the bathroom until the game is over so he said we add though I don't hold it in because I'm not allowed because the drug test or are there so he said that was a great relief after the game was\nTo go to the bathroom which is I just had never heard of that in a three question interview after the game on the field\nI appreciate your cleaning up some of the language do which is good buster or the Mets GM's situation sounds like Brody band wagon in as a real shock to get it\nYeah he's been in negotiations with the Mets here over the last twenty four to forty eight hours to get that job it's so unusual print agent to be hired to head of baseball operations\nLook this is a hiring that's drawing a lot of scrutiny from all sides of baseball agents wondering about potential conflicts of interest or people on management side wondering why would you hire an agent when there's so many qualified candidates people who have done a job like that before\nA so there's going to be a lot of conversation as he takes that job about whether or not he's

games to one\n[noise] [noise]\nBy hitting clinic [noise]\nI was bringing our hitters Eduardo boroughs and Chris singled saying daddy we start with you how does the pre game prepped change when you have a marathon game like we had last night\nIt was a marathon I think the first things first uh it'll be optional batting practice for most of the guys including the coaches and I think that's going to be a big key which they already did that but most importantly if you get your rest you come in later to the ballpark and you're able now to them\nOr just go about your your go about your routine and a lot of guys don't want to change that routine although hitting the cages so get loose but uh as far as that long game yesterday these guys are built for this this is what they do especially now in post season play World Series everybody wants and they'll be ready\nI Would say things you know they they changed in the second half of the season you'll see teams that kind of\nPull back a little bit and uh this is no different especially as you play deep in October and I agree with that he uh you know you come in and and you just get loose you make sure you're loose sometimes you know after a marathon game like the night before it actually takes a little bit of the stress and pressure off because you don't really have time to think about it you're back in that after\nEverything being exhausted last night in terms of rosters and position players and everything else\nOr you might see some guys come out today there are a lot more relaxed and what we saw each person it seemed like last night was tried in the game with a home run but only one was able to do that max Muncie\nSinging a Eighteen pictures using this game what's your approaches the hitter when you know the other teams pitching staff has been taxed\nWell I think that you know the hitters really don't want to change their approach very much I mean you've got to stay with your strength and what we saw last night a specially\nThey'll start at the game Walker builder great stuff with the red Sox really describing out at bats in and link letting those bats in a to a degree we saw it on the other side with the Dodgers so ultimately um you know just got to be ready and you've got to communicate a lot well if you're going to have more pitchers kind of in and out of the game\nAre real important for guys groupings whether it's you know on deck circle in the whole uh kind of communicating a little bit of what your scene and and try your best if you're just getting one opportunity to go up there and make it ...\nYou know ... you're right about that and I think the game plan for all these guys pass to go in and you have to realize what's put your strength of and you have to realize what your strength of germs you ask the bullpen is\nAnd most importantly guys over under nine innings over under\nI'm going to go over I'm looking over the dance show men are great a play by play man is not here so I can say that the poor man has to work through those X ratings but I wouldn't\nBe surprised if it happens again I we're playing nine innings tonight but there's no telling what's the score might be and given the way last night was played we have no idea how it's going to go and that's what makes it so fascinating\nTim church in buster only for a Dodgers stadium as we get set for game
