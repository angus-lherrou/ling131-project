S.\nI mean we didn't number in many ways of like I I had the notes in there on what we had the first time that you know we I think we only have three positions on twice and scored one time so I mean thirty three percent of the school and who knows if we get another one I mean we've got to take\nControl of the football and you get big boys on the on Thursday and that's I think that's the key to any games getting big plays in front of them\nDon't appreciate it great All right Jeff jackets down on the sideline for the putting them career and technical center and that ...\nI mean pretty much later down you've got to get possessions but when you get the football you need to copy what you did on that first drive and have a Seventeen play dry\nOr he didn't sugar coated either defensively I think he's challenged as deep as to make some place on first and second down and forcing them to be back on their heels are having to make plays on third and fourth and we did not see a whole lot of that and the first half\nOnce they did on the one position they did get to enforce hurricane into a situation where the animated plate look what happened you had to pick six tied the ball game so\nHe's right defensively south Charleston has got to put more pressure on won't make that got to find a way to stop Christian the hill and if they can do that then they got to get their options out there and get it\nWrong well I think if you take a look at the numbers I mean certainly Christian hill hurt them statistically on the ground picking a big yard age\nThe passing game really other than the one big play right before halftime that got him down to the three yard line really they haven't had a lot of success in the past game they had the one nice\nThrow a to a Christian he'll out of the backfield other than that boy I'll tell you that um ... well they did but if a pattern in the back of the end zone in rebel coverage or it's just a great catch made but as far as picking up chunks of yards what's really kept them moving all sense of leaves the run get a question\nAnd Germany Taylor said that coming into this game we've got to run the football and pass it you know here in there and the he felt like the room would open up the past and\nFor the most part it has for hurricanes and they've not had to go to the air that much because it's a success Christian hill defensively organs on a really good job so I'll drop them with a\nOne touch with one off into touched down there in the first half of the other one the pick six\nGood news guys are good news for me to not reading\nIt well it it might get ever see the lights\nIt's it's just barely it's more like a kind of a heavy drizzle but that's much better than Canada downpour and the only thing I Would say there Chris is you know ... you're going to be on the sidelines during the super six\nOh trust me I've I've endured every kind of whether there is doing during their\nBreak I think you might be seeing things you know your age you get to you need is not raining\nReally yeah Chris ... helped\nMe out it looks like a little bit of Mrs lay but I'm not out in it so I'm not going to argue with the man is hey\nYou know what will take and we're ready to start the second I have let's get this thing underway sale Charles is going to start out with a little [laughter] and it has got to be fielded by one of the up man and he will just grab it and immediately dropped of the ...\nYeah that was a smart and play by the man\nWho caught it rent Tomorrow TALK of shame about it just immediately said\nGoing to the ground and he did and the guy was about the debt Kim\nPast run over top of him and landed about five yards down the field it was almost like a\nLike a Three Stooges of that but good feel position for hurricane to start the second half they got the ball first in pin on their own forty eight\nFifty two yards away from the end zone and it was a\nBy the sound Charleston didn't pay off they don't have the football but\nNow they got a place of defense direct snap back to a Christian a hill and he will rush off the right side and get into without Charleston territory to the forty\nSeven so a little bit of a new wrinkle their the direct snap back to a Christian hill rather than to the quarterback\nFor the wildcat information kind of thing going there is he'll still in in the wild cat takes the direct snap bounces doesn't last bounces to the right and pushes his way ahead down to about the forty two\nSo I guess hurt and just finally said you know what we're giving it to him ever played were not even going to worry about the hand of you figure it out who's going to get it will just get a straight to it\nSo he's down very close to the first down out of a wild cat again Jay ... stands do is ride Christian hill takes the direction that he gets hit in the backfield has a tapes and hesitated just enough down to the forty two yard line should be enough for the first down\nA move to stick to that time so three straight plays for hurricane they have not marked the first down yet\nIf it's not it's going to be darn close\nWhich has got to get it either to measure yeah they're going to have to bring the change out measuring but from here it looks like he got it I thought he had but it will depend on the spot\nYou would think they'd be able to see it because there are only three feet away from the change there\nBut they stretch them\nBring the chains out\nNot too far off that force on line and got it\nNot by much though because they had to take a look at it [noise]\nSo down the field would go to another first down for the red skins\nMoving the ball here just under way in the second half\nThird quarter ball on the forty two yard line of sounds Charleston\nAnd the Redskins who used to quarterbacks aren't using any this time they're in the wild cat with Christian he'll he'll\nHas the quarterback snap comes back to him it's going to be Christian hailed bouncing it\nTo the outside he's an open space thirty twenty five twenty nice talking to Fifteen of the ten they showed her that\nAnd side of the tin yard line at about the sex\nDone I'm finally random out of bounds nice job that time a Christian hail seeing the down feel block and nice job of the down the block or not to commit a clip or a block in the back you waited until the defender turned around and then made the block yielded a good job of using that getting it inside the five yard line\nAnd so hurricane continues to go with this\nSince they don't have a quarterback in there it gives them an extra block or for hill\nNow said he stepped out of bounds actually at the five yard line so it ends up being a thirty seven yard run\nAnd it'll be first and goal at the five Christian hill has the snap starts left comes back inside and he'll get down to the three yards on it'll be second in gold for hurricanes\nBoth Oregon's quarterbacks on the sideline right now\nWho interesting interesting way to come out on op eds here on the second as\nWell as you said that given end of all most of the time why not let him carry it [noise]\nAt the three yard line Christian hell out of a wild cat takes the snap starts to the right bounces off of\nTackled the answer for the hurricane Redskins touchdown [noise]\nGot a great blockbuster J. T. Cooper that allowed him to move to the left side punch it in and hurricanes with a quick strike here to open up to the second half and extend their lead\nTo a Christian a hill out of a wild cat takes him to the promised land as they get into the end zone\nThree yard run\nOpens up the third quarter\nSnap is back for the extra point McCutcheon puts his right foot into it it is\nChristian held by the way twenty six carries a hundred and Seventy seven yards and a couple of touchdowns averaging nearly seven yards that carry it's twenty four fourteen hurricane on top were back in thirty seconds on

Jenkins with their button immigrant center sideline reporter Jeff interesting move by Jeremy Taylor there to just go with the wildcat put an extra block perimeter I get straight to\nChris yeah why not and I think ... pick is holding a little bit and I was wondering you know that when\nYou know what are you signed up as a running back he gets really running start at it so I was wondering about it but you know one can't argue with what he's doing in South Carolina just cannot stop them running the football\nWell eliminated the possibility of a of a formal on the exchange you know there's one less thing to worry about red one back the actual\nFirst down in Tampa for\nThe black it goes it sounds Charleston now trailing by\nCan and before we can get the snap all AI game the lay of game is called against south Charleston\nGermany Taylor had to do over he probably would have tried that one after maybe a time out to explain what was going on nevertheless south Charleston gets to stop they got the ball first is in\nBaltimore I'm twenty nine yard line for a wide receiver snap comes back they're going to hand it off the law and the man just recovered the fumble\nTakes the hand all he'll get ahead to the thirty yard line it is one yard on the Kerry second in the\nOne thing about this game guys these these guys are playing physical out there both teams are hitting hard it is many physical contest and that's what you would expect from two teams are the\nKind of predicated on their defense bloc rolling under five minutes to go third quarter [noise]\nSee receivers to the near side to the far side\nOn second down and nine like candy and went back to throw the ball slipped out of his hands and just ... he had to pick it back up and go down as a loss credited they can have added about\nThe twenty six twenty seven yard line so at three are law keep in mind judging is reporting from the sidelines that it had stopped raining but that turkey is still wet and the balls\nAre going to be wet is as well we've seen two occasions here in the last couple of minutes where the handles been hard to find\nFor wide receivers on third down an along Thirteen for sound Charleston\nCounty has the snap fires the Passover owning a gun on the ball just a little bit too high goes off the hands of done them it's out of bounds incomplete it'll be a pun for South Carolina\nWalker James berry merely with a pick their for hurricane got away from him\nBut nevertheless her a south Charleston can capitalize on the turnover they're going to have to put it away\nEverything high and hard from guinea guys that's the thing is to install for Clinton that should be and that's one of your simplest throws their you know just just parallel with a line screaming she just to see if he can write to ship here a little bit next\nI mean what do I have a lot of pressure on them either I mean he had plenty of time to get that off\nSnap is back pressure is on hurricane runs into the kicker applied comes down and the pollen is going to be fielded at about the forty six yard line so here's the question of the day is it running into or roughing it the ...\nWell we'll find out here in a moment and we'll all be enough rivers down he will is no foul yeah that'll be a first down\nPersonal foul against her again to\nHurricane special team or come in and absolutely level the punter\nThought they had a blog because it was a bad snappy had to go up and get it\nYeah they were there it was a hustler penalty they didn't intend to running down but they thought they had the block and once they had committed to the bar they couldn't hold up and pull up the punter who\nAlso did his own acting job to sell it to the referee and the referee a few seconds to finally decided that was what was going to happen and pulled out that you know the Reagan here we go first down south journals to\nFall on the forty one yard line or own side of the field moving left or right snap back the Kennedy they fired a quick pass over to the side it is caught Romeo John Bryson's accolades at the fifty weaving in and out of traffic now he's just carrying hurricane

exactly the details of\nThe models but we live on the skin of the bubble and the bubbles expanding so take a balloon put ... representing the stars and the galaxies and the balloon is expanding and what is it expanding into well the skin the surface of the balloon represents the universe\nAnd therefore what is off the balloon wit is off the balloon is the third dimension now if you're a bugs living on the surface of the balloon you can only see two dimensions forward backwards left and right\nBecause the balloon is the universe the moon is everything's areas now where is the universe or the bubble or the balloon\nExpanding into expanding you did a third dimension now that the bugs cannot see the third dimension the bugs I can only see two dimensions but is expanding into the third dimension the third dimension of space\nNow Einstein says our universe is a four dimensional bubble so what is it expanding into the fifth dimension\nNow you can see the ... mentioned just like bugs cannot see off the balloon\nBut that's what the universe seems to be expanding into Syria wish explains is called string theory or string theory has not been verified now the expanding universe theory of course had been verified it every time we look at the galaxies in outer space\nShake theory has not been verified drinks every actually predicts that the universe is expanding into eleven dimensions\nNot just for not just five but a loving dimensions and so think of a bubble bath of universes so our universe is a bubble and is floating among other bubbles\nOut there now this explains I think a resolution between two of the great paradigms of religion in the Christian religion we have genesis in Buddhism we have nerve Anna\nNow my parents were Buddhist and Buddhism there is no beginning there is no and there's only states have consciousness called nerve ana\nBut I was raised as a Presbyterian as a child\nAnd every Sunday I went to Sunday school and I learned about genesis and the fact that the universe had a beginning and instant\nWin gods said let there be light so how can you reconcile these opposite point of view to totally opposite points of view one in which there is no beginning only states some consciousness no beginning no end\nAnd the other one being a definite point whether the universe began well the multi immerse idea coming out of string theory explains it\nBecause you see our universe our bubble had an orange and it had a big bang there was a moment when the universe came into existence but there are other bubbles up there\nAnd what is it expanding into nerve and or something the on the bubble nerve Anna that is eleven and mentioned all hyper space\nAnd so string theory says basically that all the particles are nothing but vibrations on a tiny tiny little vibrating strings\nThat physics is the laws of harmony the string\nThat chemistry is the mentally you can play on these vibrating strings the universe is a symphony of strings and the mind of God that Einstein wrote about in in his letters and his memoirs the mind of God\nI finally admitted it might be asking I wasn't feeling well\nSo veterans can reach victories great and small\nNow I

council\n\n[noise] Dion\nFan and they made you well\nWe had a call come in and before the break what happens when you fall into a black hole\nHow is it possible that you as you fall into a black hole you die almost instantly but someone from the outside far away looking at you with a telescope will see that you are frozen in time paralyzed and it takes thousands of years for you to fall into a black hole how does that work well\nFirst of all falling into a black hole is not very pleasant many bad things happen to you\nKnow among them stay guinea for ... and it turns out that your feet or a ... a black hole a little bit faster than your head and so you are stretched as a consequence by tidal forces and you look like a noodle recall the spaghetti vacation\nAnd so one of the horrible facts about you falling into a black hole is you become a noodle of spaghetti as you get into a black hole\nIt even closer to the that horizon of a black hole even the noodles begins to fall apart and the Adams the very Adams of your body becomes noodles\nAnd they get ripped apart and you basically turned into kinds of the dust\nAnd spaghetti as you fall into a black hole not very pleasant\nWell the way Einstein looked at it is at times be said different rates of different points of the universe so think of putting a clock at every point in your room\nOkay so every point in your room this clock thousands of clocks right in your room Einstein says that they don't necessarily beach at the same rate\nSome clocks can be faster than other clocks for example on the ... o'clock on the moon beats faster than a clock on the earth a clock on Jupiter the slower than a clock on the earth\nAnd all these things are measurable this is science fiction there's speculation we measure these things in the laboratory\nAnd so the main falling into a black hole has a clock\nHis clock in a different from a clock on the outside\nFor the man falling into the black hole his clock says he dies almost instantly now a clock from the outside yes light from the man of falling into the black hole but that light is affected by gravity gravity polls on that light beam stretching it\nSo it turns out that you get what is called the red shift\nAnd things to talk to slow down in that life be\nSo I like being shot from a man who is falling into a black hole that light beam is stretched called the red shift\nAnd time is also slow down because of gravity so the gravity is so intense of a black hole than it slows down time stretches allies beans and so you were looking at the man falling into a black hole you see he becomes reddish\nHe becomes like spaghetti and he's basically paralyzed\nAnd again and not very pleasant thing to happen now we've never observed is of course because of course the nearest black hole that we study regularly is at the center of the galaxy and that black hole is why something like fifty thousand light years from the earth\nAnd so we've never done this experiment but ... theory so far\nUh this is what the theory predicts and so far we have no violations of Einstein's theory of gravity let me repeat that again\nWe have no violations that all of Einstein's theory of gravity every time it comes out right on the dot as Einstein predicted a hundred years ago\nOkay well we've run out of time in this segment of science fantastic so keep the calls coming once again if
