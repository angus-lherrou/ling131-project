had more cheerleaders and we had people that were heckling the same thing mhm\nCheerleaders are hecklers on me you were to go and I usually say people that are just calling you're crazy\nYeah but that's a heckler much good\nI think too like if somebody's out there and it's kind of in the middle of this and they're struggling with it um you know at the beginning it looked like just a mountain of debt that we were up under and we ignored mhm and it was blocked in our future but we didn't realize it ... and when we finally realize hey this things in the way we got to go over it\nYou know and here we are standing on top of it you know and it's a freedom like none other you know we're so excited for what\nThe future holds because now we can see yeah well and and the math is the math I mean you you chip away you chip away you chip away doesn't seem like you're getting progress and all of a sudden there was a bright colors\nIt breaks loose and there's this flood and and you and you're there you spend and you're done and then you know how I can control this stuff called money and now it's gonna be a tool in my hands I'm going to make it behave losing it shows it does change the hope factor where there is a lie to them the tunnel is not an oncoming train\nYou know so well done you guys well done I'm proud of you think the good stuff thanks for coming all the way up to Nashville

become a millionaire an everyday millionaire when we did the study with Chris Hogan our research team and the outside research team that we had to help the structure of the study of millionaires became the largest study of millionaires ever done over ten thousand millionaire surveyed\nAnd then Chris wrote it up into a book called everyday millionaires how ordinary people built extraordinary wealth and how you can to teachers just like Curtis and Sarah\nMost of it of credit card and then I have personal loan so for instance one credit card company is Thirteen thousand they just sent me a letter mhm and if I paid on twenty five thousand and they would you know I'm just throwing a calling them all and this time I'm having a hardship defeat they lower how much I owe mhm\nWould undoing good for them lower you don't have any money\nWell my husband's income I was thinking but it's still not enough\nOh well that's part of the picture when what does he make\nAbout twenty eight thousand a year and that much that he lost his job when I first\nGot hurt mhm um when I first got\nHer are you not in the end you're online receiving disability\nNote I'm applying I'm the insurance company had enough to tell me all of a person on permanent disability to state but I've been out of work so much that now it's going to be really really low is not even want to be when I couldn't get because you know to go\nAnd our credit than in and out in and out of where\nI'm at this point I went to the military lawyers and so I'm trying to find out he said he can't really tell me much until they go in and see if I should do is having on it I could do with that and\nWhat every team and then if I did at Thirteen he didn't know how much they were going to pay that they want to get in and out of that out\nAnd then I might have to wind up paying I mean you know they'll only and that money I don't understand\nYou gave him Eighteen hundred dollars to file bankruptcy or anything oh I don't get anything so you're not paying on these credit cards or these loans today right\nNow not right now and I'm not paying women\nShow ... where are you going to be look let's pretend you're just didn't pay those loans for a year\nAnd they just sit there the worst cases in which you're right\nYeah and what are they going to get you don't have anything you don't have an income and you don't have the assets they can do your own something as valuable\nWhile I have yeah I own came home that living at home and I looked at the equity and now I'm at home um I have about fifty thousand and now I Can't sell the house though because if I tried to tell if I did that algae either go\nMarket yourself and then just because they're falling housing and get like sixty Seventy down and now I'm a I mean you know I'm Sorry is that how are you all for like one of a like a hundred and fifty thousand\nMhm but why can't you sell your\nHouse a lot of them in the area that are headed again\nWhy can't you know your house and one of the other half of it I don't live in one I'm thinking of it has about two thousand and why why can't you sell it because you have a lot of for it and people are telling them for sixty and you are what\nUm own Ninety eight\nOkay so ... and get out what you can out of it and pay somebody will\nSay oh my dad with that\nYeah definitely for you go bankrupt and when you get right file bankruptcy they don't let you keep investment property with equity and then not pay your bills bankruptcy law works\nSo the Trump bankruptcy trustee will force the Salem that property and it'll be forced to be paid against your bills and I think you can get enough out of that to go to each one of these and you can probably settle fifty thousand in your situation for around thirty five if you negotiate with them but you need the money in your hand to do that you know what I mean money\nSo this is the way to get this all cleared up and then in the process of course we've got to figure out how to get your income back up and get your household income working again 'cause that's the root cause of all of this ...\nBeen so long term where are you going to be in two years were you going to be in a year where you gonna be in three years which are long term game plan and what are you doing about getting there that's got to be your next step because you've got to get either disability income coming in um you know if you're the workers' comp if it if you were hurt you said on the job or you or I can tell from what you're saying that which way it was but\nYou know any money that is do you or any money you can create you used to create your future kiddo\nAnd that's what we want you to do we want you to have a future\nAnd and so you start looking out there in the into the future and saying how am I going to take the next step is to get there but as far as filing bankruptcy I don't think that's going to be advantageous to you when you got this much older when you've got this much equity in a property and I think you can clear up the debt by selling it\nSelling it taking the equity using that money that thirty thirty five thousand dollars it's they're forty thousand whatever you get out of it\nAnd subtle at fifty one thousand doubts about negotiate with them get that in writing before you send them any money\nBut I think you can work your way through this to fall by ruptured be one finally there's I'm like you sell the house or your way\nExcept for this hour of the day Ramsey show in the books our thanks to James Charles our producer and kill it in your

this plan so you must have been talking about it even before marriage tell me your story so we have\nAn interesting story we feel like you're going to like this one a lot we um we met about four and a half years ago a in Sunday school and my brother was\nHim and his wife for the coordinators for F e you class at our church that started like fall Tom that year a million Haley we're the only two single people in there\nAnd so when we had to partner up to figure out who the nerd was and the free spend or we just partnered up together and we started dating later that year and\nUh yeah so um we we were both doing individual budgets before we were married and of course when we got engaged a leading up to our marriage we set out and had a conversation about ... numbers in the dead and we we made our goals and\nSo when we came back from the honeymoon which we cash flow mode and the wedding ... cash fired we sat down and had our our first official a budget mating and set a goal that we were going to be out of debt completely before our second wedding anniversary\nI'll tell you what this place to meet a woman and a financial piece class [laughter]\nIt's a joke the Israel lobby [laughter] we\nWe always say we're we're a poster children for Dave Ramsey in it for you here show\nOh my God I don't know how you could get any more doctor needed than that that's pretty much [laughter] as wound down to\nWhere you're trying to figure out earlier today I said you know one of the best thing about this as we've never had a money five ever and I would say we're probably in the one percent and she said it's probably less yeah you know who married couples that ever ever are new to her never argued about money\nWell I don't know how many I've met that actually met in a financial piece class [laughter] we're gonna have to start a financial piece class for singles [laughter] should slash dating moss yeah\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] oh I mean\nThe arguing down on the on the after the ... after the weddings over there you\nKnow well I can think of a worst place to find a spouse I'll tell you that [laughter]\nThat is awesome guys well since you are experts in indoctrinated through and through what do you tell\nPeople when they ask how you get out of that you've been all of a hundred and fifty three thousand twenty three months no matter where are you mad that's not easy\nNo it's not I I think that they get fired with having a packet and having a plan together and they think into that plant every Nazi\n\nAnd I'd say for for me I think that you know I just feel that we're wherever the willingly left and the fact that um\nWhile before we met and I could look back at my financial history where I made bad decisions after we met and we got on the we got on the plan separately we've we've never gone through those dumb decisions um\nWe've never had to deal with those stupid purchases or we've never had to look at something that we've done as a couple and said that was dumb now we've got to fight back out of it you know\nYou're going to run out of the way while you were single yeah\nAbsolutely [laughter]\nFor you guys very very well done I Love it that is awesome it you're right that's a great story that's a great store gives me a whole new idea for a new product line [laughter]\nYou go I think I think to one of the one of the biggest thanks for for us is that um we found out\nAbout eight months ago that we are going to be having our first child you\nKnow [noise] so uh we we had about two months to go getting out of that and we didn't hammer down to finish this often I Know my personal story my father passed away and\nHe was thirty six years old well our family in a pretty tight but my mom a such a hard worker erode the family um had many health problems which make money yeah so I get overwhelmed to think that our child will not ever know about that yeah\nWell not ever know how that life is you know you know\nI'm sure you're I'm sure you you're a fiend about term life insurance through with that you know\nWe were just listening to that [laughter] oh and the other thing for me when the Holy Spirit and not just you to do something and you don't have any did you know what you do you do it\nTo a man I was talking about that the other day it's tough to serve two masters\nThat high end or when you don't have
