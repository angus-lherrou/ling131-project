hover\nYeah he's a about a year ago today is whether it on a rock and your ... and they hit are going into the season he was probably project\nIt'd be our starting point guard I'm so not not just you know hit us you know mentally but have our basketball team because we were going to be with our starting point guard on ... and he's trying to ... you know the most popular kid on the team both on and off the floor um his smile ... he's playing ... guys so\nIt hit us pretty hard um you know ... about I'd say January February is when we got the news that you know he'd be what former um and he's going to be back playing the season and then when he got here I'm at the end of August early September he has worked just as good as he ever has your life liberty\nAwesome that's just an awesome story and we're we're happy for Brady in in your ... he's a lot of fun to watch and just couldn't be more thrilled for him personally that he's healthy and then secondarily these that he's back with your group and leading the crew\nWill no expectations are high again pick the when the Emmy C Street Smith has used preseason number one I Know that's old hat for you guys you been doing that for years you had a great first years as head coach I mentioned you were coach of the year in the conference what's it like for you coming back here in your to now having been through it is the head coach for one year what's the biggest difference\nI think I learned a couple of things um last year we practice hard every single day from the very first they were allowed to practice to the day we left for the in the tournament\nWe went to our as hard as we possibly could and I actually think that Iran guys too hard ... and we got your your\nUm so I I think I've learned a little bit on that\nAnd I like the group of guys that I have no we obviously we watch them on most of the first of all American\nWe lost Brandon Smith was in the program for five years and we lost another starter and James Griffin who graduated and decided to transfer back closer to home I'm at a y Hilo so you know we've got a summer turning guys but we do have a lot of new faces when I walked her and we can't wait to get a ticket sorter here\nHow are they mixing together like you said you do have a lot of players coming back from that and it was so good last year but on how the newcomers mixing in do you have to rely on those newcomers a lot this coming season yeah\nAnd that's that's what's tough and I I think the hardest part of any coach's job is that getting guys to play hard and these comments were coming from from high school and and we have one coming from a junior college and we haven't mentioned what transfer\nThey think they're playing hard but they're not and especially for us the way we play our style play is very taxing on your body it's we're up and got us faces for forty minutes for trapping and were chase and um it it's a really hard style and it's a really dangerous style of play so we have to have guys that are both mentally and physically ready to go\nWell isn't that such a one of the benefits of having we we mentioned Brady they're coming back in his style of play again Dalton Bolden Boleyn who had such a fantastic freshman season it's so incumbent on those return or to show how west liberty plays basketball because that's one of the biggest things\nBecause I've been amazed watching you over the years it's you've had so many great players and it's it's not the right phrase to say plug in play 'cause each of these guys that different skill sets but it is kind of plug in play you just put these guys in in the system has been so good and you're so good at finding guys that match that system but it's incumbent on these returning to show the young guys how to do it isn't it\nAbsolutely in our fall season we only get two hours a week with these guys on the fourth division too so we have to really dark time effectively\nI'm In it it's very important for our returning players you know guys that have been the program for two to three to four to five years to really show the young guys I'm ... you get the question all the time what are you guys don't conditioning condition here and that that were people with mine what we do is we play to a hundred\nEvery single day and open gym and planning\nOn going to play the right way to a hundred you're going to be way better shape than just going out there and gone and suicides are are doing whatever I'm you do conditioning so\nThat's got to help her courting too 'cause you play a lot of guys that's always nice to be how to make that pitch right\nAbsolutely absolutely and then they go back to the number one ranking we never talk about that as a team the only time that I mentioned number one ranking is to recruits and you know that that always sticks out to them or whatever it is important for recruits know that there is a chance for them to play early here at West liberty because we do platoon\nUm you know for about ten minutes of the first half so that that's pretty attractive to recruits\nYeah we are a lot of fun to watch we're looking forward to another great season I mean the basketball we doing one of your games here soon thanks for clearing time first nine please send our best to Brady and the rest of your croquet\nAbsolutely thanks for having me on your guys\nAll right then there is we appreciate it Ben how it head coach west liberty hilltop person that's that's an awesome story about Brady Arnold he has a heck of a lot of fun to watch I mean he was\nNumber I'm dating myself here but member Vinnie Johnson for the job isn't the microwave yep that's what he was like when he'd get in the game is like man did they just put this thing on fast forward so awesome news that he's back and has beaten the the lymphoma and he'll be back with the the ... this ah\nThis this winter you'll be notified season the ... got another good team down at a\nDown at ... State University of Charleston was picked third after they're run to the conference title game last year so now they're fun season coming up yeah I mean boy is it was the one to watch them they really get going they do they do it's a funny style of play ... tax before we get out of here said\nSenator please help us out there a few on the board at Google News dot com that need to know how to listen to the scrimmage tonight because I don't I don't know how to do that\nYou don't unfortunately and you'll have to uh you know just log into Google News dot com when it's over Kevin ... will have all the information you'll be back\nOn Sunday with a scoop on how it look we'll be back Monday evening with the sticks of sex will break it all down what the newcomers say we'll have to I'm sure make some bold season predictions based on what we say from a ten minute scrimmage\nWill do that coming on all four [laughter] going all the way they are now aren't you will see what it looks like I don't know I guess the first basketball you get a little more time to let it ruin that he gets he gets more a bigger say on it I jump in with buffalo to start things no it's not easy that's not easy at all that sounds easy that's not easy now it'll be fun are basketball coming out of gold and blue debut\nTipping off year in just a few minutes that's it for coach on her and myself enjoy your weekend on her back Sunday I'll talk to you Monday we're out [noise]\nThe city and state wide forge line has been an exclusive presentation of the metro news radio network for rights reserved\nW two or three D. R.

for records for the moment are meaningless south Charleston at two and five of the black egos have seen a resurgence after starting the season is owned by with wins in their eyes do outage\nOregon Redskins have seen their own struggles they are three and five and trying to raise up three games get\nWhat's at stake for both of these teams tonight is the playoffs\nThe loser for all intents and purposes is eliminated from the post season the winter still has one game to see if they can qualify for the postseason campaign so it's all chips on the table the playoffs start tonight\nFor the black eagles and the Redskins from Redskins stadium on the campus of hurricane high school I'm Chris Lawrence and this is the ... business systems high school football than I\nOtherwise have Charleston vitality WC age as hurricane and south Charles in Beijing off in a critical battle Greg white is here to call the action with me tonight and I think you'll agree that the loser leaves town on this one\nWell and that's the thing and you hate to see a situation where you are in week nine of the regular season and it's a playoff type game where when in advance\nAnd lose and go home you know obviously you have a couple of games left but every came wants to make the post season but that's the kind of thing we're dealing with right now and that's what the hand that both of these teams have been dealt three and five two and five a couple of games left in the season but you were right when you said it\nThis is a must win game for both of these teams and the triple a field is so can danced at the bottom of five and five teams can make the playoffs\nProbably will but you got to have at least ... wrecker to get in and both these teams are flirting with that right now when you look at the south Charleston team we saw them early in the year\nAnd they definitely have weapons but they're still very young young team I tell you what the last couple of weeks they continue to make mistakes but they've started to win and that has cured a lot of things winning will cure that winning will do that and these are guys that have hung together through some of the most difficult circumstances and they are really on the up slope right now I Would say well\nThey are and you know they had a really tough early part of the scheduling when you throw young tenth graders and you gotta remember these kids are fourteen Fifteen Years of age in tenth grade so they come in and they're looking at a Capitol team with all the experience I looking at Huntington all these different teams\nBut as you said they stuck together now they've got to win back to back that gives them a little confidence a little momentum going into the game flip side of that for her work and they've got some experience players but they're on that three games scared and so now you have to start to wonder if that's starting to get into their heads a little bit\nLast time we saw the Redskins was against capital they managed to really hold capital in check for the first half but they're special teams completely abandon them and the and capital built at twenty two to nothing halftime leave without even scoring on our pinch hurricanes definitely got a heightened that up or they're going to be in trouble here tonight\nThose guys and they're being coached up now I mean it's it's not that they're not being coached up you know but they're they're getting better they're improving so but I also mentioned Romeo doubt um Romeo just been\nA week on our little table often I Know I mean he he's a guy that came in first year player he's a junior and he's he started off like just trying to figure it out and now he gets it and the man he's all over the place and he's been really good for us\nThe really good an aspect of catching a ball of defensively women were were really bad at all\nHe's been he's received he's taken and off the kickoffs have placed corner for she's played outside back or for worse I mean he's he's that guy that you can kind of plug in about everywhere he does something like he kind of found a home corner\nForest and not allow people testing and um he wants to test and I think that's a sign of being a great corner right there that want the ball thrown at him and um then often simply we just kind of put him in places and try to help you help us and he's he's I mean I was ... he\nWas going into this year the fast to get on the team that man when Romeo came out I was like holy cow I think we've got one faster so and I was actually talking with a coach Gibson from Wu and uh you know drink drinks fast philosophies right with him but I'm Romeo and got another year and uh I really like Romeo\nAll right well and then it'll be interesting to see how they measure up tonight you got to in a road trying to make it three in a row this evening\nThe hurricanes always tough I mean it's always been a good good contests I mean the scores if you go back through history and look at it I've always been really really close football games\nAnd we'll see how that goes tonight ... thank you\n[noise] coached on their the south Charleston black eagles were here from Germany
