he's about four yard shot you know look out for on the pickup yeah third down in about a four here for when the o clock\nRoom so I took a long time to develop\nAdvance very smartly Matthew Stone casting\nAnd it definitely fooled poker because the south pole through the most unorthodox pass you'll ever see on screen\nLike turned around I don't really be thrown under his arm or something it was weird the way you turn it through that less than\nA third down and a bell for\nSingle wing snap comes back to covert covert looking to get outside lowers the shoulder\nHe's got the first down across the thirty five [noise] still dragging jak present the thirty that's on the on line that's\nBanned football right there for the Winfield general when I was single wing is built to just grind it out\nCoburn advance in the backfield poker with nine and ... and the box snap comes back to covert looking for a running roomy hits the pile and he died for sure\nThe percent of the forty three wow what an effort by John covert just willed himself across that first out Margaret Cho poking at a pretty nice job of bottled up the middle [noise] it was just brute strength on British strength right there and when\nThe ... the battle LA are losing the battle of the clock it's ... minutes three to go and we're about to go inside of that\nI Would have bet every bit of money are statistician brought that he had that didn't have that [noise]\nI Would often say it's her money who cares\nFor sale and dancing a receiver the near side that comes back they fire the passing the ball\nIn his arm had to be here\nAs he let that go either that or it was I wanted to I don't know that he ever had it\nHandled the world the laces were right I slipped as it came out of his hand\nIt was almost like he's through with the\nPoint of the football\nOr the incomplete pass by saying stops the clock with forty five seconds to go\nFourteen to seven\nOh go on top when bill with the football they're driving\nAt the forty three yard line of folk\nSinger receiver the near side\nDance and covered in the backfield gets camp Brooks takes the direct snap days one jak or gets inside the forty down to about ... thirty seven yards\nOn thirty five seconds left here in the first half Winfield cannot stop the clock they don't have time outs\nAnd as you said not in any hurry\nThey look at a third down and George [noise]\nThey do not realize\nAs you can hear the crowd they want 'em to snap the ball and it looks like Winfield just going to be content to go in the only down by a touchdown dance rolls out fires the past got a receiver now it's an incomplete hunter more as\nAn adult incomplete pass will stop the clock with eight and a half seconds to go and you'll have to\nAnd they are actually moving away they've got their back two o'clock so they can't see the scoreboard\nBut somebody somewhere on a glance up there yeah I mean a lot of urgency here and you've got an opportunity\nFocus going to get the ball is in Boston against well yeah I'm trying to do that so it's a tough often to run in a hurry hurry\nSo at this point I mean you gotta think Winfield just basically trying to get into the locker room are going to put this one answer so it is for down an for with eight seconds to go through all of the thirty seven yard line to poke a wind field\nWith the football fans drops backfires down the middle\nOf the field to pass his talk after Twenty one yard line that is a first down by Sam anger on the clock will stop long enough\nTo move the chain of all is said and there is a snap

adjustments won't with on who's going to excuse me\nBlew the roof football team and their ... and when we won't\nTalk before the game coach about the assignment on defense team did a pretty good job there but then they well they do when you're in the second quarter ...\nGoing second quarter wars them in a couple of big drums are and I got some girls behind us and secondary we're lucky to be in business nor are we going we're going to find a way to dig down to the smoke it up for your um endure endure diversity was Lucy and just make you just moved to the next few of those like um oh okay good luck coach\n... like All right Jeff Jenkins with Seth Ramsay the head coach\nOf the ... it's been a good one here we do not expect anything different and the second half where a couple of minutes away from the kick off to the captain's meeting at midfield remind you that the polka dots will get the football to start the second half they lead at fourteen what this have\nYou know it was interesting you know he's exactly right rather they got to just eliminate the mistakes forget about what happened in the first African continue to play football it absolutely got to have a short memory here just get back to doing what they what has gotten an undefeated at this point\nI think that's part of the other thing you have to look at and you have to remember these are Fifteen sixteen Seventeen year old kids poker comes in their undefeated Winfield at two and three they're struggling so in the minds of the poker died she got to think they came in here thinking we got this and so\nNot that they don't execute well but they may not play as hard as they would if they were battling up here\nWell I'm sure that they got a wakeup call it have to work out at Craig's matters right this is a pretty good team to be two and three I mean their record does not reflect the level of talent on this team they just had some bad breaks along the way\nAnd they but they defensively they have really kept themselves on the ball game the opposite it's finally answered there and the second quarter coming out of making that score now the deepest has got to go out there and get a stop here quickly and the and try to get another score on the board that turnover there that are about\nThree minutes to go to the first half that was a huge turnover for our Winfield [noise] unfortunately they could not convert that into points that they've been able to pull that off this would have been a brand new ball game well and that and and that's\nThe thing I mean if you're when you're you got to understand you literally left six point two on the really had a wide open receiver he managed to get behind the secondary and he just couldn't hold onto it you've got to have better concentration and you know one of the interesting things we go back to last week they were talking about West Virginia university\nAnd the announcers were talking about how West Virginia does have passing through with tennis balls\nAnd the rule is you can't catch the tennis ball with the palm of your hand you have to catch you with your finger tip that was really good exercise just said if you bring those down to the high school level don't let that football come all the way in because it's going to hit the plastic shoulder pads and bounce right back out [noise]\nOr about ready to start at the clock they're allowing it to wind down still got twenty four seconds to go\nAs poker is lined up there and waiting\nAnd here comes wins the over the kick off\nTo the general will kick it off to rule spot the ball down at the forty\nYard line as we start\nThe second half poker\nTrying to stay undefeated rank number four\nAnd class double a\nBeen a long time since you've heard poker\nNot only in the top aide but in the playoff hunt at all but boy that got going in the right direction and now\nThey're looking for more as your roof has got to heat up we're ready to start the second half a year\nHe is fine if we go about it because he got up okay ran out everybody out there sort of all to thirty\nThree art I was actually pretty happy about it to be honest with\nYou because I think he jumped up what the penalty and we saw the play got excited\nYou know something to shoot improved those guys they will ... they have switched their lines judges who've worked in the opposite sign language that you never see that\nOh here's the pitch to eat the paint on first down and tanned from Winfield thirty three yard line breaking tackles trying to get an outside he's going to be close to the first down as he will get do about the twenty four yard look\nGood at a steam that time for Ethan pain and you know you're starting to see poker starting to flex its muscles a little bit here\nWinfield deep answers played is done to humans work up to this point but\nAre they starting to get a little tired and there's they're armor starting to crack just a little\nDefensively they played well they have struggled most of the night on all that spoke elites fourteen to seven play acting on second down they dropped back by far the past the fallback making that cat you'll get inside of the twenty that's big loop road\nWorst number thirty two on that Jersey and he will pull it down for the first down\nRoads is generally the blocking back doesn't get too many carries certainly doesn't get too many parents receptions but he got at that time\nAnd it was enough for the poker versus now\nWith the ball on the Eighteen yard line\nNext yard pick up [noise] and it is now first [noise]\nTwo receivers to the right wing on the right and they'll hand at all to eat and pain on first down it goes right up the men all across the Fifteen I had to do about the twelve Thirteen yard line about five yards on the pick up\nSeveral of those big when Bill Wyman [noise]\nGetting up of course one of them is\nThey hung up it was absolutely in on every single tackled that is made by this wouldn't be able to focus\nAll on the Thirteen it was five yard pick up where it will be second down and five\nPistol formation cook the quarterback for the dots takes the snap looking down the field he's got a receiver in the back corner of the end zone and his tipped around tipped around an incomplete went off the hands it to poker receivers and one Winfield defender of are falling to the ground\nNice job by Caleb dropped or all that time hitting the intend to receive we're just as the ball arrived in literally up into the earth crowd react to that he literally flipped him in the air\n... actually had two receivers there neither one of them to come up with the fast third down and five ball resting just inside the Fifteen yard line of the generals\nVery close to the third team is the visual spot where they say it is clock is stop seven minutes thirty eight seconds and the third quarter\nAnd it looks like focus going to have to burn a timeout little\nConfusion on all ... fourteen to seven poker on

you're going to be a special team that's going to be really the only time that can happen this year so let's see what happens more\nCoverage tomorrow again nine AM on many of these states here's the pitch on third down and five they give it to pain and he's going down to the right and he is not going to get the first down they're going to bring him down right at about the eleven yard long\nFor down territory here for poker but when bill with an opportunity for that drives up one more time and give us off into another chance\nThey've done it all night can they do they have one more enemy or [noise]\nI don't know it's also the eleven yard line and ... you know you're you're exactly right Winfield defenses come up big\nAll night they played well\nYou do it here on foot down and to from the

and how we determine how all the entire universe is\nWanting some of the greatest scientific discovery is really the twentieth century were the universe is expanding\nFirst of all we it was considered the universe was probably I think things are moving about half of it but the discovery by Edwin Hubble really the things we're moving away from each other and everything was moving away from everything else\nWas a big big breakthroughs in science and the twentieth century figure discoveries more recently it was the only things moving away from each other but they're accelerating as we

New York 'cause I work on something called string theory sanctuary when you think it's a theory\nEluded Einstein for the last Thirty years of his life as theory of everything each vibration of a tiny tiny tiny little string corresponds with some of the timing particle\nAnd that's why we have so many sub atomic particles so physics is now reduced to the laws of harmony vibrating strings chemistry is the melodies you can write on vibrating strings that unit versus a symphony of strings\nAnd then the mind of God\nThe mind of God they looted Einstein for the last Thirty years of his life the mind of God would it be cosmic music resonating\nToo hyper space tend dimensional hackerspace\nNow we live in a three dimensional universe but there could be hidden dimensions out there because if our universe is above all of some sort even children as to question what is the bubble expanding into\nWell our bubble is expanding into hyper space we think ten dimensional hyper space but the question you're asked how come I sometimes say eleven dimensional hackerspace well let me explain\nIntent dimensions we have five string theories that are totally cell consistent and qualify for his theory of everything\nNow we don't like that we think the universe should be unique in some sense so why should the universe created not one but five\nMathematically self consistent universes that sounds a little strange right\nWell we're doing at Princeton\nFound out the reason why if you go to one more dimension up into the lemons dimension\nAnd then you squeeze it you squashed one of the dimensions when you get you get ten dimensional strings\nIt'd be dot org and take a short time\nBecause pre diabetes can be river\nTalking about the ... and ... around here [noise]\nThis is science been tested [noise]\nThe lines are often you're not going to get a busy signal you'll get right to us give us a call at six one to five six or eight one two three five\nYou know hearing carting at the side of the

perhaps your thoughts on the hurt on national radio so once again give us a call and have your thoughts heard on national radio\nWell before the break we had a call concerning dark energy so let me explain really quick it turns out that even nothingness pure nothingness has a small amount of energy associated with it\nNow some crackpots claim that they can use that energy to create a solution to the energy crisis no doesn't work that way you can calculate that there's zero point energy is very small very very tiny but\nOver and collected businesses then of course is very big because space is very big\nAnd that energy efficient to push that galaxies apart in fact that's why the big bang bang that's why the universe is expanding but the calculation of dark energy has eluded businesses up to now what does that mismatch\nMismatch between theory and experiment is ten to the one hundred and twenty now take out a sheet of paper right down the number one\nAnd then ride a hundred and twenty ... zeroes after that one\nThat's the mismatch between theory and experiment now\nThat's in bad scene [laughter] this is the biggest in Paris summit in all of science the biggest mismatch in all of a science is tend to that one hundred and Twenty one with a hundred and twenty zeroes after it\nThe mismatch between the experimental value a dark energy and the theoretical value of dark energy so what are you going to do\nIf you ever find a solution to the dark energy problem you're going to call me\nAnd while I'm a generous man all split the Nobel Prize with you\nOK to ask what it's worth is worth a Nobel Prize\nIf you can figure out why dark energy is so dark and so energetic\nOkay well let's move right on now to the next listener phone call\nHello Jessie from Houston and watch it on a couple
