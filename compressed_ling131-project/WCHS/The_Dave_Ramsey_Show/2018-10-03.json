you I Am thirty one wall with all our townhouse in Seattle what's not worth\nA well we're actually like thirty minutes south of Seattle I got in yeah [laughter] ... yeah yeah so I Would say it's around right now a hundred and\nFifty a hundred and forty but when I bought it um so it was like around Seventy so it doubled\nOkay wow so you're single\nYes single mom I have two kids um they're eleven and nine so this was just on my income\nTo just plow through it as making sixty grand as a single mom with two kids and paid off your house or thirty one years old\nYeah you're on rock star the incredible tell me your story what happened four years ago that made you think you could do this\nSo actually my journey started um eight years ago that's what I found you back then I used to listen to Suzie Orman and read her books and I'm kind of a nerd uh went to school for business and I think I was looking for like a book and personal finance and that's when I came upon the total money make over\nAt first when I read it was like oh okay this sounds interesting but um I mean as I got into it more I really liked what you had\nI started listening to you and that's when I was like hooked 'cause you go straight to the point so I started up paying off my credit cards I had a little bit of credit card debt a student loan small student loan um like three thousand and then I really got intense on paying off my car which at that time was like twelve thousand\nI'm just so that was around eight years I've been on this journey for eight years I've had have my two kids um what people didn't know was that I was in a relationship that was toxic it was abusive um both verbal and physical\nSo I'm just being on the plan helped me kind of set myself up to her I didn't have to be in stuck in a relationship\nAnd that particular relationship mhm\nUm I started I paid off my car started putting money um\nIn savings emergency fun because I knew that once you know the relationship ended that I'd be the only one reason you know financially responsible for my kids um which is what happened so five years ago um I had an emergency fun I started ... putting money aside\nFor a house luckily I was able to stay with my mom at that time we were staying with my mom um there was a it but some domestic abuse and then to the end and\nUm but I had set myself up to where I had no debt so I was able six months later to purchase the townhouse so that we're kind of started\nYour amazing I think\nYou you're a survivor I don't know if you know this or not there is a very a correlation between extreme levels of central control and domestic violence\nSo usually are guys this big a jerk yeah abusive verbally and physically the also trust or control you through the money and that sounds like what was going on here what am I hearing that right\nYeah oh I'm the one that worked so I was able to push he didn't work so they will result is home so I\nKnew that I read about you got rid of them are that's awesome\n[laughter] yeah\nNot like a loser checks writer and they lose recall that\nYet and I have to you know give things to you for putting together this plan so I can\nSend

bother with somebody like me you look for somebody else yeah it's unbelievable unbelievable\nYeah the first time I ever ran into that\nYou don't you any of your old enough to remember an old show that was on TV Sallie Jessie Raphael with the red glasses remember Sallie Jessie I was on Sallie Jessie show like four or five times\nAnd we did one a did one would just\nIt was always crazy people 'cause she kinda Jerry Springer thing going it was always just nutty people on there and I was trying to help them with their money and it was just like I'm the only seen one in the old dead gums that it was crazy but there was one of the lady that um that they would bring on this lady that was a psychiatrist or psychologist or whatever\nYou know minus ... minus ... minus water doesn't leave a lot of room but you could pay your payments on everything doing that and then you can pick up your overtime and start making some headway on some of these deaths and cleaning them often as they these little desk clean all these credit cards outstanding medical bills in student loans clean off\nYou know over the next year and a half two years you're going to start having a little bit of wiggle room and you guys will keep moving forward and head but I I think that's the you're just you know you're just feeling the weight of all of this and it's kind of clouding it's this is doable though where are you are is doable I I think you can pull it off no I Would not sell your house\nI Would not about it because I don't ever tell anybody to buy a house where we got that but\nIt's your house is not like when I hear those numbers on my like what are you crazy none of that so there none of it you're you're it's very very reasonable\nUh for your situation now would it help if you earn an extra thousand bucks a month you dead gum rotted would clean this mess up faster two thousand bucks a month even faster so are you have you got a couple of years are really hard work and lots of overtime\nSide jobs ahead of you yup you sure do\nAre you guys going to be taking a bunch of friends who vacations nope you got a bunch of that\nYou and me clean it up at your reality but hold on I'll have Kelly pick up we're going to get your copy of the total money make over book and give it to you and um help get you started and if you need some more help you call me I'll help you in any way I can\nI'm Sorry you guys are facing all these challenges but I think you're up for it I think you can do the math makes sense to me that you're giving me unless or something we left out of this equation so thank you for the call Josh is with us in Los Angeles Hi Josh how are you\nGood how are you doing Dave better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] not too much I've got a question for you I'm On baby steps which is pay off my house early [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't have any other debt because my house I have a six month emergency fun\nUm but I kinda did all your stuff out of order because I've never really liked that but anyway um I have a hundred and sixty four thousand dollars less to pay off my house\nBut I also have about a hundred thousand dollars invested in mutual fund and stuff like that and I'm curious\nWould it be wiser to um take a hundred thousand dollars out of my personal investment put that off towards the house and then just pay off the remaining sixty four thousand or should I leave that money invested and the money that I have every month just accelerate payment from my house\n... what's your household income or probably about a hundred and fifty thousand so you could be like debt free and when you were if you did this\nUh um yeah I'd be done by the end of next year I'm sure if I if I took the hundred thousand for the court house\nOkay if your house was paid for and you didn't have any money and investments what'd you borrow a hundred thousand on your home to putting investments\nKnow same thing in it\nUm I don't follow okay well\nI mean if you have a hundred thousand dollars in an investment and you take it out investment in order to put in and pay off your home\nThat's the same thing in reverse if you didn't do that it's the same thing as if you if you leave it in the investment it's the same thing as borrowing on your home to invest isn't it got it yeah\nOkay so it's a balance sheet equation meaning that balance sheet is where you list your assets on one side of the pager liabilities on the other side of the page\nAnd right and you can switch back and forth by borrowing money\nMeaning if you were sitting there with no investments paid for house you could you could borrow money and put you know money you got that over there on that one side of the page but on the other side of the ... now you'd have an investment right\nAnd all I'm doing is on doing that by asking the question in reverse though it's a bit of a trick I kind of courage to uh the trick is that it makes you think not just with your head but also with your heart\nAnd I always like to think of when my my head is where I Do math in my heart for a measure risk\nAnd your real risk averse you hate that like I Do yeah and so the idea of borrowing on a paid for house chagrin investment is absurd and your mind\nYeah I mean you immediately reacted but that's a hard thing to me that's a that's a risk bart that ... that you're measuring this cause you to do that you didn't stop and do math you went you recoiled and went whoa that's crazy and your mind right you know\nAnd that that that but and and start by asking it in reverse so all of that to say yes I Do the hundred grand at it in a heartbeat I assume it's just not in a retirement account no penalties right\nA mill that hundred thousand is just personal in bed right yeah and the only thing is I mean you're talking about the head and the heart and that just with\nThe mathematics of it a Miami Myers of it though if you ... if I if you put risk getting the mathematics of it and it changes the mathematics and so and\nAnd so your heart is actually correct your heart is helping you do a complete measured amount Maddox and so yes I take the money out of their house ... ... what I'm the\nGuy just ...

hundred in the wind over Marianna sweeter than a couple of impressive weeks he's an impressive young man and then we tell our listeners a little bit about what makes Jay Johnson special throwing the football\nWireline he can also keep the play alive so if they can't get to play off on time he can keep the oil and and and scramble keep his eyes down field and a\nAnd still complete a pass for you and he he does that on many occasions or he has a lot of us in yards and honestly we don't call is number ... that much a lot of them are a\nLot of them are scramble but uh yeah I can call half of the ... in a a you know Jake or finish it and go on with it he knows what we're doing in Iraq and call portion of the plane he knows what protection detail the lime and very intelligent young man he

people don't see sometimes\nUm he's an excellent salt blocker when you're putting bother tackle he can put his hand in the ground and they can block well for you he he does not mind I've never seen a young man I'm with the numbers he has and and being a big comp lawyer\nIs not mind being the decor so other pay for open 'em and he has a smile on his face and he comes in ... with the kids when they score and never one time of day come to me\nI Need to get the ball go to an end to get the ball and that's not Britain strange he is a well mannered young man and they they are he loved his teammates and that's why they love him to it because he's very unselfish\nWhich he's committed to a Penn State and we certainly wish him the best of luck after high school not a kid that I'm actually a group of kids that certainly don't get a lot of radio airtime or or newspaper coverage you may have you just may have the strongest Ken and the state line tackling Ryan ... each\nWell he's definitely over a thousand pounds ... power playing a\nDefinitely a strong young man are probably going to have to start getting a little bit more out of him on a date fantasize ball then we really want to but uh you know it's that time of year you you got to play what you have and even if I mean some of the kids are playing both ways\nWalls and ask you about that coach we talked a lot about where you're Parkersburg team is that often sleep it talk to me about it ... it's ... it's been some games where there's been a little bit of struggle on the defensive side to where you kind of that after six games and where's the improvement need to come on the defensive side\nWell or haven't Britain back there helps as well ah you know I actually told him going into the game if you need to harass you need to do it or on our fans 'cause we got to have you out there on defense\nAnd ah so um\nYeah we just we don't have a lot of themes feet on the fans and that's hurting us in in in Boston in some other teams like Morgantown than big tackles and you know they'll run those big golfing some lemon out there and we're just not very big up front and uh\nSo uh\nYou know we got to make up for it in other ways and of all I can say is I'm skewed and are deeper into the coaches are doing an awesome job with scheme I mean we show up in the right off most of the time it's just\nThat a lot of times we're not big strong and fast enough to do anything about it when we get there so\nUm yeah we just keep work and we have to play good team defense to be effective some whoever supposed to set the edge has to do it in the run length thank be too big and we got to feel that run line all uncommon but I Know all those kind of thing so\nUm you know we're getting there we like I said we're up thirty one to seven and and and play and really wail on defense but we have to do it every series\nSpeaking with mark and mark head coach Mike ... the final month of your regular season schedule everybody on it is five hundred or better and you've got some great challenges this first one coming up in the audience George Washington a very good all fence grant wells quarterback what's the biggest key to slowing down that patriot office\nIs trying to I'm just trying to make 'em earn it and drive the field and not not give 'em anything you know just given big place\nAnd I think that's the key for us it's a you know we don't want to give give him wanting to play drives while we want to make 'em go eight to ten employees and see if they can sustain of driving and I'm like I say we got to play good team defense\nAnd are they in around alleys when we're supposed to and\nYou know if they catch a ball thrown up as we got a breakdown attack all those all those you know fundamental types of things that you have to do to be a good day fast\n[noise] All right my friend I'm going to let you go I I Know you've got a busy Wednesday night on Thursday and friday and all of that as the head coach so great job you're off to a\nThree and three start a everything looking good your way best of luck these final four games in a hopefully we'll see you in that field is sixteen which I'm confident we will gang\nCancer appreciate it will ... will show up you're sure try to get things I hear you my friend head coach Mike\nBy us Reza Parkersburg and guys I think you can go ahead and pencil though man\nI mean with a small club that he has the way they're playing right now and as Joe mentioned I mean he's got some you know he's got he's still had GW laugh he has a hurricane ... Huntington deemed he's got that rival with partners works out at all for those games he can win and all for you don't play right you can lose though are but I still think I like his chances I really do\nI like his chances I think he kind of hit it on the head since Britain strangers come back this has been a different team as far as most often simply is concerned and it's right there I mean those are all four teams that they have left on the schedule Joe I think we look at it as being ... teams and potentially All right there in front of it\nNot particularly a you know obviously a great challenge going up against the GW often says week they've got Parkersburg south on the back in and then in the middle a hurricane team that show they can pull off some big victories and nobody's been able to beat Huntington yet so uh you know certainly some good challenges but if they can get out of that at a minimum of two and two\nPounds soaking wise for her but just the ... you know what he sings a\n... you watch it all fell through through I ride a bike is all you don't catch what he does it just makes cuts and all that you remember I had to get that Williamstown years go by the name ... well oh yeah\nAnd I think we're having some trouble with rising still guy on the line but I think you might have dropped we\nMay anyway let's see if we can again yeah yes if we can't uh hook up with him again call him right back because and he was talking about Alan trace well and then I Know Dave you remember Alan\nReplayed it Williams down 'cause my goodness gracious player that guy was that's for certain but uh yeah we'll get docked back on because there's a couple of other things that I wanted to talk with him about er you know\nA ... you know this where they are located at the new Martin ...\nOf course they're very very close to the Ohio border and that's why you know when you look at their schedule they play like five will they will I played five straight teams from Ohio\nWhen they tangle with crested Butte come again this Friday night so uh you know and and those teams or we don't know a whole lot about but you can watch them and she said he was very good ball club to beat them by thirty\nAnd then to come back and get a win over team like river or to handle frontier and it'll be interesting to see what a what doc has\nTo say about the crest view if we can get him back right now we just got him back on for they ... I wanted to ask you about and I do remember Alan hey extremely well yeah\nBut let me ask you this um this will be your fifth straight game against a team from Ohio are you located their new Martin's they'll understandable but what what about this ... what what can we expect them\nTo break up front um we play um last year ... there were well coached you could tell what she won't tell you the best one firing them last year you know it helps I mean there's ... are pretty much\nThe same ... but I just saw it and it's a veteran group I think the\nKids to six got sixteen seniors I mean there\nThere are as advertising ... he said he saw a little bit or um is it on their hands full then we talked to the boys will be asked narrative bottle you can't you\nKnow these are a lot of ... like actually down the road\nIt's also your last road game of the seeds in your home to St Mary's home to Tyler and then home at the season ender on November second to wheeling central so it's all kind of right there in front of you isn't it final three games at home after this road trip to crush you this weekend\nLike smoking or drinking dodge playoffs because these are all ...
