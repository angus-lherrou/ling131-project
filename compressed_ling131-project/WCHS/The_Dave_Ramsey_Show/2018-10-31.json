I'm good how are you doing good welcome to Dave Ramsey show how can I help\nWe my wife and I are looking at downsizing I'm partially to help clear up to that um [noise] our income has gone down about forty percent in the last\nTwo years why I'm compensation at because of health care [noise] my wife is a physician and compensation from insurance companies and one I had gone down considerably and we um we built a dream home and moved in about six and a half years ago\nAnd it's a wonderful place but we are becoming a house for because of the you know lack of income so what was your household income before and what is it now\nIt was about four eighty and this year was about two Seventy five\nOkay and most of that is her\nCorrect I work two part time jobs and and care for three children ... and how much do you own your home [noise] about eight forty and what is the payment on that are just it's like thirty nine Ninety five it's just short of four thousand a month gotcha okay\nNow if it's on it's on the coast of water waste we all have the insurance flood insurance taxes ... a truce or or monthly you know when you're factoring types of insurance is concerned with hiring I\nGot ya okay right and do you have no other dead or is it\nOh no we have about a hundred and fifty which is a mostly credit cards and student loan\nOkay we've kind of accumulated\nThose credit cards over the last few years of trying to figure out you know whether we were going to wear the compensation was going to return to previous levels and we just don't want to live how sporty longer in the house was probably worth about a million and a half\nMhm so we're looking\nAt um [noise] getting house back in town um we actually found one mhm\nThat um [noise] the four we purchase it it'll be on a Fifteen year and\nIt'll be a little under twenty five percent of our take home okay All right and with with the world looking at was with the amount of equity we have in our current all we can pay off every bit of a we have except for what we all have on the new house which\nAnd still be there to still be at that number the Fifteen Percent number or the twenty five percent number of Fifteen year\nIt'll be a little bit under actually okay\nThat's yeah that clears the debt and everything okay here's all the young I'm definitely not doing that and um the I think that all sounds like it's very wise uh especially to the extent that you\nUm do you like that this is permanent this change the income from it and there's nothing you can do to fix it um\nYou know a change in direction with the way he way she practices or what she does or you know what what you know is there a whole new business model that she can go out our practice with the changes it but even then if that worked and she got her income back up to half a million you could buy another house\nExactly oh that's where I kind of told her I said you know if we if we do the school at Harvard crunch the numbers more going to be five\nTo six thousand a month to the good at minimum yeah yeah and we have a sixteen Thirteen and ten year olds who are looking at more cars the purchase more insurance for cars colleges coming up but we we have about three quarters of a million and retirement savings we have five twenty nine scroll through the kids that we've been functions for you know we have proper insurance\nIn Atlanta and we do need to go crazy on kids cars here ... is the thing is I don't want you to move down and\nRelax the pressure to figure out is there a way to get the income backup I Want you to look down and keep the pressure on is there a way to get the income back up just for the fun of it because you know when you write a ... million ensure fun to make it again\nExactly in the house we're moving into to me is not a step down the beautiful house it's a I mean it it's a house that everyone would love to live and it's you know I'm not going to be able to see the sun come up with the Atlantic every morning but I can live without that\nYeah and ... and again it doesn't have to be permanent and it's not like oh it's a great house so we're just going to relax I that's the thing I don't want to do here I don't want to just accept defeat\nI don't mind moving down you know pulling back to get back behind the wall and but now we're going to fight again we're back behind the wall you know we we can you know we're not taking fire were not you know we've got we're back undercover again okay would retreat enough to get undercover in the battle but we're not gonna ... we're not going to surrender\nTo the to that we want to take that ground back again someday\nBut for today are for the next two years or whatever it takes to turn it around absolutely I'd make this move\nDefinitely make that move it all sounds very logical to me good question I ride Derek with us in Phoenix, Arizona Hi Derek welcome to the day Ramsey show\n... known as honor to talk to you have you too sir how can I help\nWhile you're told a money maker her book or just changed our lives I got it as a wedding gift and it was the best wedding gift we implemented it\nAnd pay off twenty thirty thousand dollars a day and eight months and then that ... ... so it's been awesome good um my question to you and I need your help\nIt is because sometimes I feel like I'm controlled by fearing over thinking when you quit your day job which is good to go fulltime entrepreneur\nThe other fulltime job or do you have the entrepreneur gig running\n[noise] [noise] yeah that's what my wife does um she sells the clothing for that movie um [noise] and she's doing very good at it and so I work for a local government here in town a mechanic just trying to figure out when the time is to leave that retirement benefits that security\nYou wouldn't believe it was her the mechanics thing to sell women's clothing [noise] yeah [noise] ... are you already involved in the business\nYeah she's a she's been shown it for a year and a half um she's she's kill it she she makes in one week would I make a gross and among as a mechanic mhm um so I wouldn't be going fulltime helping her with in voicing and shipping in the back office stuff while she sells all the dresses skirts\nMhm okay and what do you make a make fifty two thousand a year\nYou can't hire somebody cheaper and fifty two thousand dollars a year to work in the back office shipping stuff\nWould that be the best route to go as\nWell less pretend OK you walk away from fifty in order to do a job you could have hired somebody for wanting to do\nThat ... short\nWell she she gross is she is gross two hundred and ten thousand so far this year\nI don't care what she groceries okay unless you're going to add more to her business in savings okay or in revenue than what you are making now than it is not making sense\nOkay 'cause grossing two hundred and ten is fine as long as your expenses aren't three hundred and ten\nThat's what you're fighting you know you just got this thing you're fighting in and it's going to slow down your progress it's not going to keep you from making progress but it's going to slow it down and just give yourself permission to do that and let's let's win the battle that you're fighting and that's the the battle for your health\nTo get your health back oh bless you sir wow ouch\nOw Brooke is with us in Tampa, Florida Hi Brooke how are you\nIn good health care I but I say I already know the answer to that [laughter] [laughter]\nI I was actually calling I was wondering um I don't think you mentioned you know where\nA lot of school and I had crashed into the marsh now I'm back home that is an aspect mhm like I'm twenty four I took out a little bit of student loan that aren't bad mouthing I turned twenty four I'm getting like\nA lot more and grant fat probably won't even have to work at home\nWell I won't be added then they could do it\nBut I'm trying to work at much at all I Know yeah but you have any advice for time manager like trying to ... twenty four and trying to get like well if I'm a little bit it all off if she'll go out and I want to let your child that they have all that much of it\nA little longer on school so I told you know\nWell the first thing you do is your budget obviously your time for ... for your classes\nAnd then you budget your time for your study around your classes and in the new budget work I'm social comes after that I'm older than most people if they throw a brick through their television they found about thirty hours a week\n\nAnd um and that's pretty amazing right there\nI mean people ask me how I read so many books a year I just don't watch a lot of TV anymore\nAnd I'm not mad about television I don't think the levels and their although he probably is having a pretty good time there but um it's not like it's something like that it's not like a spiritual thing it's just a matter of what do I want to spend my time on that gives me my best life\nHas been my time on grandbabies children wife\nMe work reading\nThese or do you know a long time before I spend my time she'll just being intentional with your time you'll be amazed how much time I mean you know how many have you been made so many people spend two hours a day on Facebook\n\nAnd you talk about a colossal freaking waste of time there's one so um if you just stayed off social media completely or virtually gumbo almost completely and he turned off your TV you could make a pretty good living with that time\nThe second thing I Would do other than that as other than getting away from time wasters in budgeting my time is\nYour best income production things at your age wall in school when you need to control your time are typically some kind of self employed or straight commission slash self employed idea\nAt twenty four years old you can make more money ... and babysitting\n\nYou make Fifteen twenty bucks an hour\nDoing that\nYou can make more money cleaning people's houses you can make twenty five or thirty dollars an hour doing math and neither one of these things require extremes levels of skill\nI mean yes you obviously know something about children and it will be good if you had she'd be are at the Y. you've taken the class and got certified and so All right but and\nYou know those those sorts of things but you can make really good money and control your time or book the times that you're willing to do those things around your classroom time\nDoing that so do away with the time oysters intentionally budget your time and look for self employed and or straight commission ideas where when you work you get paid very well and you control when you work\nAnd work a lot I was selling real estate in college now that's a very unusual

been building our home paycheck to paycheck\nAnd um it's not a hundred percent completed yet we had to borrow money on it or to kind of get things rolling a little bit but um\nWe got an offer to do the care taking position and the guy a the a four hundred dollars a month to take care of his vacation home in the same town we live\nUm do we tell our home\nOr do we keep it and continue to make a payment on it\nIt's not completed well we're at a point it means a paint\nBoring and you're living in it\nNo no um well we were living in a mobile home um but then we got that offered to live in the house basically for free when he pays to live here and take care of\nI got that part okay so that's correct so you've never lived in this other house now okay\nIt's gonna be a little tough to sell it and the conditions than yeah like they can't get financing on it right and so you're going to take a whipping a what will it take money wise to finish it\nUm\nWhat never had a professional answer on that but probably about eight thousand ten thousand dollar yeah and what is your household income um well my husband he worked forty hours a week what her household income [noise]\n\nProbably thirty seven thousand a year\nOkay so your husband's the only one working\nWell we have a business um that doesn't make it out and running but it doesn't make money\n[noise] his income is about twenty five thousand and other than that makes about Fifteen thousand nearly okay and then getting the care taking condition or there'll be making about forty eight hundred cash but we get housing for free\nYeah I got that part until you get until he decides he doesn't want you to care take anymore and then you don't have housing for free anymore\n... so I mean he could walk into more on fire you\nPretty much\nI changed my mind and then you you have a housing issue again right nice so um you have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring as it is\nUm [noise] well we had a appraisal and if it were completed it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand that smart completed so probably a hundred and fifty hundred and twenty five\nNo no not if it's not completed it won't know um because ... it's a further discount than the cost it takes to complete it it's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer cannot\nBuy this house okay because they don't have any money and they're trying to get a mortgage and they can't get a mortgage on this house\nAnd so that limits your in but they didn't limit your selling pool to investors and they're going to discount

I wouldn't even have it formed accept upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as I Want to view as alive as long as one of us alive to manage your ass that's one of the things you're going to do is care for this child\nThat flew out of those ... now that the when the trust is needed is if both of you die it gives the trustee me the the the the direction on how to handle the assets and disperse them to take care of this child's needs\nAnd I'm ... and what that needs to be is a a big hairy term life insurance policy that ... that is the beneficiary of it is that special needs trust or a portion of the policy you know thirty percent or twenty percent of the policy in the beneficiary line goes to the special needs trust\nIn the event that both of you die kind of a thing in the primary beneficiary is your wife okay but then past that the secondary beneficiary is some portion would go while you've got minor children into a family trust to take care of the minor children your oldest two until they get them through college the other portion would go\nInto the special needs trust to perpetually care for this other child throughout life\nNot just through college and so it's a larger amount needed to do that and then what happens is let's say we fast forward Twenty years\nAnd this child is Twenty years old and you've got a million and a half dollars and mutual funds\nOkay them your other children are grown and gone or close Twenty years from now right that the dream the dream that law yeah we're kicking them out so they're going [laughter]\nThat's the legacy by [laughter] but it's out of that then then what we've got is we've got you know\nYou know John Denver lands on the helicopter gets out things cut your rights and then goes off into the sunset type of thing so you know when that day I think we play Cincinnati I was hoping for life um my father through his uh insulation company had season tickets at mountain airfield every day every year so\nWe would go and we would sit and section one of five directly behind a visitor's badge so I saw a lot of crazy things as you can imagine over the years sitting right behind visitors bench because we were like third grow up [noise] I'm In the interactions between the visitors than\nIn the eighties was actually the reasons behind why the chant started in the first place\nUm along with just trying to have a little bit of innocent fun but in eighty five uh we started off your too and I do look kind of promising and then we hit the slide and our our fence\nWas was not really putting up any point we lost six games in a row\nFor letters home and during that stretch my dad still wanted to go to games he wanted to stay there till the very end they refused to labor labor is one of those fans\nYou know he began doing this little chance uh when we would get first ones and him and he said you know there's there's something to cheer about at least you know support your team get first down you know at least show some support so he would yell W the you first down clap his hand point\nAnd a first down was at least something some sort of accomplishment I guess we can say in\nValue that better that season at first I was a big deal\nYes it was somebody who was um Miami\nBoston College Penn State they all showed a little bit of you could say unhappiness tour a little section as we started to do these little first down cheers and dad could see that it was actually kind of getting out of their skin a little bit little harmless farm but you know it was it was actually affecting them you know they they thought it was funny considering\nWe were getting blowed out and we were sitting there term for first down but we we we we keep kept doing it and then then my dad and I am in our little section there we we added the oh at the beginning to kind of like even rub it in more\nAnd you know it was kind of an antagonize or I guess you could say is is really how it started off but along came the you know we we we did the eighty sixth season a little bit but alone can eighty seven seas and we began during the ... right at the beginning of that year against Ohio\nI'm by October off into starting to run I mean we were introduced a major Harris we started putting up some offensive numbers the first ... downs came more plentiful\nThe chant become more heard I guess you could say and people start picking up on around us and it started to grow a little bit and the weird thing about it was in the beginning I guess the people around us ...\nThan what we were saying you know the W. B. U. heart right so all the other people around us were in like a\nFirst down [laughter] they weren't actually and and be honest\nWith you that that happened that way you would hear people in the nineties doing the uh uh uh they didn't do the actual ... view part but I always thought that was funny but\nYou know and then of course eighty seven was was pretty good you're along came the magical eighty eight seasons you know\nIf you remember the T shirt time for a major bold right and it was it was it was time for us to to show what we got and as the points wrote up in the season went on an eighty eight chant grew stronger and stronger the students starting to pick up where it was cool because once the students got a hold of it\nYou know its history is that right it's just it's on you know and the students really started to get involved [noise]\nAnd ah you know the the the the part that I really remember\nOkay I got a minute so you got to make a quick or go ahead\nOkay at Penn State game and eighty eight I looked around and I was like wow this thing has really taken off\nAnd so anyway my dad passed away in Nineteen Ninety four from ss daily armor [laughter] um I still have

that that's going to go to Toledo quarterback\nAnd you know I Know my my my heart that that Alex was going to be a very good quarterback I don't know if the rest of this eight necessary and you know we kind of wanted to play that way and he's kind of you know come out of his show and he's made throws and he he can use his feet and\nAnd ah sometimes it it ... you know he does things that are always designed he makes plays out of nothing and uh it's really nice to have him and and he's you know don't want a great job and do we I think we're going to return to re skill position besides too wide receivers and um [noise]\nFor next year and a lot of those ads for new\nAnd you never know what you're going to get and what we're lucky to come out of the first five games for and won with a bunch of kids but you know those get has made plays and you were used in three different kids detailed back in a in a bunch of wide receiver so we've been very happy so far with all those guys\nOn the outside he got demonic quarter and receiver a touch downs but how about his impact on special teams as well I Know you had to kick returned from ... game recently he's got a couple on the year how much does he have game changing ability based on what he does an special teams\nYou know he's actually has three ... returns on the season and I think ten touchdowns collectively and um [noise] you know I a he's a he's been very dynamic he's\nHe's been a player whether you are the ball's in his hand he's even done a great job ... hand with blocks and different things and uh I I Can't tell you that I saw this coming I'm you know he he's been a hardworking kid in the program and ah he had a good junior year well quite honestly didn't play very much\nOffensively use a corner for us last year and I know he was going to give the opposite side of the ball and go to bed [laughter] um but I got it he was ready when his bomber was called he was ready for senior year\nHe worked very very hard in the off season and a show\nWith anti Christ daugherty of wheeling part coach uh when the rankings came out this week ... in at number eight a with a win over John Marshall friday night uh you'll solidify a spot on that topic where you get a guaranteed at least one home game\nUh I'm looking at all of the teams that are probably going to make it in class triple A. and I'll tell you what\nSecond eight is going to be tough it's important I think to start the playoffs at home if you can\nI think this is one of the first time that I remember in a long time where I don't I don't no one's going to do after that first week well how that's going to shake down because there are a lot of teams and I bought a mate that their aims not normally down in there and uh I'm Glad we're not one of them [laughter]\nAnd ah you know I thought for a little bit we might slide down there but uh\nThere's some really strong programs that are going to be down in that you know eight to sixteen or not is sixteen and um you know ... teams are going to have a you know really tough openers in the playoffs I felt that way I think it was in two thousand and Thirteen we opened up with south Charleston and I thought was really um\nYou know they were really good ball club and and uh I think that it's gonna be a lotta interesting first we mash ups\nNow he talked about this match up with John Marshall and the importance of that game like bread was asking about go when I look defensively some names that jump out or a couple of seniors to remains not grass Dylan would sixteen and fourteen tackles for laws that they kind of lead a a very solid defense is not your patriots club\nYeah both of those guys who played a lot of football especially Dylan played I think three or ... or\nAnd quite honestly in Dylan's defense whose ... year but but things are in a way from him and I would too if I was calling often supplies I Would stay away\nA would set the strength and shift and and do the things that some people have had to do to stay away from him and and the nice thing is to remains in the middle of the defense and it's pretty tough to run away from a linebacker especially one that can run like him\nSo you know we feel very lucky to have those guys and and that done a great job not only in this year but in their careers\nOf course you know a lot of coaches speak about having a twenty four hour or forty eight hour rule and whatever happens on friday is gone by the time practice rolls around Monday did you get a sense that that your team was able to in the past three days of practice Barry what happened last week and get refocused for this product\n[noise] yeah I think so I mean when you look at our wins and losses\nUm they were down to the wire are it's battled whether they ... up or down\nThey stayed the course they don't they played hard you know I I talk about the two law says that we lost at the very end to end but quite honestly I'm not sure we deserved to win the university again um you know we want now with about Thirteen seconds left so I'm a you know I think when the kids have that mentality and and they did that for you\nThat are going to be able to put it away for a week or so and and get together and and go hard again and uh I Would expect I think about that\nAre responding thought for your body or you get to gain friday night and we talked about ten minutes away your kids know their kids so on and so for what have you seen that you've really got to concentrate on this Friday night for your genes would be victorious over John Marshall what did they do\nThat has caught your eye\nWe I've got to win a lot of scrimmage on both sides of the ball and\nI knew that sounds like coach speak but if you go into a Marshall and you don't you don't win the lotto scrimmage you're probably going to lose so um you know they're going to play a little old fashioned football they're going to play with a full back a tough one and and maybe two and a lot of times you don't see that today football and\nThen all of a sudden here comes drawn Marshall and everything changes very similar Bridgeport some of the things they do they they it's very different where Fifteen Years ago it was very common and uh so it changes things and and you got to be ready to be physical and when a lot on both sides of the ball 'cause they will be physical\nA buddy hey you've always been so gracious with your time when I called I appreciate that and the best of luck on friday night okay\nNo I appreciate you guys give me the opportunity to speak thank you so much\nThere you go had good Chris Daugherty wheeling park a well guys you know I I was looking I yesterday actually at the schedule and does the last week in the regular season man we have so many good games and all three classes as we\nYeah we do and he talked about that John Marshall ball club and and they were playing without Justin from apple last week and they put a sophomore and Alex Burton rush for two hundred and Seventy seven yards and for touchdowns John Marshall clinched a second straight playoff appearance and\nThat's going to be a good one as you mentioned John Marshall wheeling part but but also in what county Joe that Parkersburg zone Parkersburg game as well\nAnd I know a check in with my buys later in the show but you know Parkersburg south give them a lot of credit they are in position for multiple games possibly hosting in the first round certainly they've Clinton one game already that can be no worse than six if they get a victory on friday night so the patriots doing their part to make and what should be a great match up and brought it\nYou go and then of course we got Huntington spring ballet and we've got a greenbrier he's looking to win and get a playoff spot the first time in a long time\nA capital middle and south Charleston that's always a good ball game so really a lot of good games let's just AAA and will highlight the other divisions as

a great job I'm In all those roles\nJoined by summers county head coach Chris vigorous coach your match up against bill on friday night or the position you guys have put yourself in with six re wind you know you control your own destiny for a playoff spot they're also fighting to get in and they're fighting essentially for the football program at the school because this is the last year at the school is going to be in existence\nHow do you how do you prepare you guys for a match up like this where you know you're going to face an opponent that is absolutely playing for just as much as you guys are oh\nI mean that's that's what we've talked about all week with our guys is that um you're you're going to face a team that's that's essentially the best word to use a desperation because you know if they know when the seasons I heard it probably non playoffs do\nYou know by extension you know their their their season you know their school is over it's kind of um [noise]\nYou know they're going to have a lot of emotion you know they walk off the field\nYou know they're gonna wanna walk off the last time as fate will power to as winners as as being successful so you know every single one of their kids is going to fight with everything they have and so our kids you have to match that intensity and\nUm especially early on if we can measure since the early on and they do some things are you know and get things in our favor\nUm then I and I think that's it that's key for us or the longer\nYou know that that you know during the game and they have confidence that um you know that that makes things really hard for us in a a list of their ... kids are or are we were prepared and um they they play really hard and so you know it it'll be it'll be a tough test I'm absolutely for sure\nIt's all for it and they all for their games at all sorts of things in the state you know they they've lost that one two three and like memory so you know they're they're scheduled there they're

Sherman like played really central lot of teams are going to lose for those five I don't think there's a secret there\nUh but still and I think Joe you mentioned that a man is that they had the loses on friday night that's it period\nWeather still scenarios that exist that if they do lose that they could still get in and out and bought a lot of team licensing I'm behind it and so basically what's called like it is it has to win because you know a child is going to win a Pocahontas you know teams behind them are going to be able to play their way up and and so\nUh yeah Fayetteville with a

proficient game but but overall this season ma'am Parkersburg has really been doing a great sign on both sides running and passing the football you're averaging two hundred and sixteen yards the game on the ground to twenty two through the air\nYou have to really liked that balance heading into a game against Parkersburg south on friday\nWhere it works out pretty good productivity over the

and are you were over there and the eastern panhandle on Saturday Night weren't you\nThe bulldogs instantly had to punt on their first possession I think they just got mad [laughter] but yes again ever needed nothing is Seventy nothing and what really strikes you any any team that has to defend Martin's bird\nI mean you literally have to defend every inch of that field sidelined a silent and that's hard to do because they have so many weapons at receiver so many options that really opens up the running game and I think in Nineteen Kearney what he has done\nIn the absence of Duane grant
