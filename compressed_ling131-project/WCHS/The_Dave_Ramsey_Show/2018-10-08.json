Ohio who their coach is is\nThat we're yeah he got ... right and then mount ... in mountain union for college and he can coach man I knew all about\nMass one if you do yeah can't McKinley with like those guys for the state championship one thing I'll say about a player this play the mouse one he's been well coached and he's played in front of a lot of people and that kid he didn't ... I was shocked when they said he was a freshman and he was their third string quarterback\nYeah they've been pulled they've just plug guys in ... now so the question Saturday the ... camp their original starter maybe back they may go to this kid again but either way you're you're walking into a game where you better be ready to play on Saturday\nYeah I uh you know this team is different on the fence they don't make a lot of spectacular plays but they hang in there with you if this team would learn how to close games off\nYou know they they have one and nobody's been able to get them over the hump but if they ever get over the hump because I think this guy's pretty good and I think he does a good job but we had more time will tell you a fantastic story about him but\nAnyhow I think this is a this is the best team we will of played to date even though the records not very good I think it's a better than anybody we played\nAgree with you well those will have guys can coach you know that right\nOh yeah the ... you know like I say Ohio has got great high school football\nAnd the kid a I'll say one thing he threw the ball well any scramble around well and uh I don't know how long the devil they can change quarterbacks after what that kid did I tend to remember I Wonder what about the tail back in the back\nHe was not back on Saturday there was talk that he's practicing that said they are going to decide that later in the weekly I didn't need him either on Saturday but I'd feel better for West Virginia if he would just sit out again there hasn't been any word on that David Montgomery referring to there and he's a player is a player you had a player alright coach I'll tell you what\nLet you run go get a drink water get ready for your show comes up at seven six we'll talk to you next week following the game in Ames, Iowa state as always love talking to you thank you for the time\nYou know love talking to you guys up the\nOkay we'll say there he has done Neal and checking against seven six his show follows a sketch hunter there's never enough time I got I got a million more questions we couldn't even get to him oh yeah absolutely right All right let's get squeezing hearing about thirty seconds left\nLikes and dislikes didn't like the penalties still like the offensive potential if they put it altogether agree here's a light here's a like in favor of the gold uniforms like gold uniforms Letty brown and running ... brown running well dislike red zone turnovers Kansas scoring on the last play\nAnd then going for two and then by me out they were going for two points yeah\n... was a this text typical that we played to our competition why are we throwing inside the five with the running game\nWe have certainly been that great you know he'd\nBeen ruled successful throwing but Kansas Day and it was to ... point there that is the first team we've been screaming about why don't team stop the slant before right we haven't seen anybody do that they uh\nThey did they did a good job they all said they really talk about being blatant to take David cells away\nThere were a couple of times they took that safety they weren't even disguise and more the safety was going he\nWas just rolling over distilled in the slots and are you guys are we said somebody's gonna eventually do that now we'll see what West Virginia's counter I mean that's that's when the coaches get their money right okay right somebody figured this out now we've got to figure out what the next step is yes exactly exactly which there is a next step short there's always I don't know you step such coming next\nPlenty of time this week to get into Iowa State ...

because they had extra block or in the back till they get mad at protection the first day it was hard for them so the ball down the field because he was able to pressure I\nCan get pressure on him when he got back in the pocket is I wasn't able to do that as well as a second ...\nAnother aspect of a stockstill skiing he was able to hurt the hurt a few times on the ground as well he wasn't the leader Russia for middle Tennessee but um he was pretty close so he had thirty\nAnd yards on Thirteen carries a to barest Thomas had forty two yards and Fifteen carry so the running game wasn't the

was was called ... where he does it fall apply are also a though rage and\nI I think ... what happened in the game he made some couple of runs may first hour to offer it kept our secondary involving
