Ohio\nOh gosh I mean it was the longest two weeks I think I've ever had in my life of not having a game you I mean you have something to look forward to but it's it's three weeks away\nBut we definitely we didn't start of a we still got after it and we did what we needed to do that sure we were staying in shape and uh you know getting healthy after that ... game for sure\nBut um yeah definitely definitely along the week\nThat pike video game that they've just mentioned in it and that's a ... team that's got six victories now you guys turn the game in the last minute with a game winning touchdown how important was that that play where are you able to get into the end zone in the final minutes\nWell I mean I I guess you could say is pretty important but that whole entire game you know every every play in every snaps important and I think we executed the team I'm almost as well as we could have an a game like that\nAnd um you know all the time comes you just you gotta make place and you know as far as myself I'm a play my ... a whole team plays a running backs receivers everybody's out there making place so I think you know throughout the whole course of the game\nAnd I never think the last play the game the font the game\nNow that's a good point good point we're talking with case in pain he's the senior quarterback at point pleasant high school who just throughout his career just put up silly numbers ... let me throw out a couple of names to you and you tell me what they mean\nTo you as a quarterback and they do the big blacks as a team when guys Josh ... Lee and other guys Andrew Jones\n\nWell you know ... he's he's bought 'em up Josh manager you know they're going to my best buddies and the and the whole team were off wall real close knit um you know hang out together and all the time but Josh wildly he's you know he's just a hard nose player he he where he needs to be when he needs to be there and I can always count on him\nAnd Andrew Jones you know I can always count on him to get where he needs to be as well you know I like him as a target and I'm definitely you know the bond is there that same chemistry there specifically with those two players I'm as we're talking about him and I would rather have anybody else in this position\nNow even starting quarterback for a couple of years on this big blacks team everybody knows you can run you can throw tell me about his office when you've seen the last couple of years where does this point pleasant all kinds of stacked with some of the last couple of years when you've been a quarterback\nWell I mean as often as you can do just about anything with it and it it takes time to grow a church door scene he knows that himself especially with the person do you have\nUm it's it's definitely hard to defend and I think with the players we have any spot and everybody knows what they're doing um where I Will do great things with it you know it's it's a lot of fun too I mean the pissed off and says it's a blast once you get different things go on and you get um new installs if there's a lot of fun to run\nJoined by pacing point pleasant quarterback case in pain case in ten straight playoff appearances coming into the season you guys headed there once again\nSeven straight or seven victories in each season over the last decade how much pressure is on you guys year to year to keep this tradition going out of the great play that you guys had over the past decade\nOr I mean the pressure's definitely there or you don't you don't want to be that team to break that streak not or of making it to the play offs um but you know once again we we take it day by day and I'm obviously we have the playoffs in Milan\nWell you know what we talked about early in the season and I I think the first time was on the show with you guys with all the new faces on our defense and and the staff and the players and there's a lot we have a lot of bodies a lot of players that play on that defense and they've\nThey've really improve throughout the season and then they need to continue to improve so you know proud of the efforts so far but we are to keep going\nHis freshman Neary Russia's for a hundred and thirty three yards is sophomore year he goes for eight Seventy three and a hundred Americans love those numbers in the rearview mirror this year going for almost Nineteen hundred yards through your first day game\nTell me about the improvements you've seen him make this year in year round just the junior under diverge county football team\nYou know he has always been\nKind of a gift a runner and if his ability to change directions and\nThis past year it grew a little bit and that extra dimension that little bit of power and breaking tackles as really you know put him over the top as far as the year he's having and I want to say this about a hundred cars I've watched him his whole life he's employed youth football here ... year\nUm he's got those Eighteen hundred and eighty three yards or whatever and and he's only played four quarters and three games I mean almost every game is season we'd been well up he hasn't played bass for second quarter\nObviously based on the results you've had eight teams aid victories it appears that focus week to week is not an issue for you guys did that come from your seniors do you guys have to as coaches keep them humble ordered the players kind of self policing themselves in that yeah that's\nThat's a really good statement I mean for us it is weak the weak and they always said some goes and ... and we have been talking a lot about the food you know for age for us\nStaying healthy humble hungry and hard working and so far so good and we've got to continue to do that we'd just like the coach head on earlier we were literally look at the next own and and and nothing farther than we had to go with the beginning of the season [noise]\nYou know and the history of our school\nNo football team and made it to the playoffs back to back years and I want to say this you know 'cause I Know coach stansberry my dad played for him and they had tremendous teams in the sixties and seventies and some eight to nine and one teams but I think back then they might have taken two teams because over the years they didn't make it with an item on record\nThat uh if we and we should have ... taken mathematically I Believe last week you did by making it this year will be the first team in our schools history to go back to back\nDown to the playoffs then that's good stuff that really is I talk about just looking at the next ... next opponent is coming to your place you the number six team in class single a when the rankings came out yesterday from the essence they see you got to welcome in the number four\nIn just in personality sleeping or eating habits of beer or worrying social isolation spend time with your kids having fun and helping them learn coping skills for when times get

keep remind them that of of the focus and in in the commitment it's going to take every single day for us to get to that\nAnd when you look at the last two opponents in the regular season and we we talked about river view but then also van at seven in one in that final game of the regular season both those games at home I mean bands one five and a Rogue River views won three in a row I mean you gotta like that's got to be on your end of the regular season you got to really good teams coming up getting ready for the playoff\nHole I absolutely and it's like I said we just um\nEvery week just to just try to stay focused and take care of ourselves and\nWe're trying to you know make sure we take care of her view Friday nights for we look too far ahead that by endgame force that's going to always a great experience for our entire county and and for two communities um look we're just we're just having a lot of fun right now the kids are having fun\nCoaches are having fun and we're just looking to get better every day I mean\nUh you know it's we can and we're still jumping around and hoot and holler and ... and that just goes back to the type of kids we got and that type of system coaches that I got up to you know great assistant coaches and in my name gets put it in the in the paper and I'm going to come on the radio and stuff but the I got a lot that's really good assistant coaches are\nWho are committed this program committed these kids and it's just been a great a team effort all year long\nMichael getting back to your defense just thirty six points allowed in your seven victories for your five leading tax lawyers are seniors guys are playing a lot of football for you did you kind of get the sense that you guys were building towards a year like this with having so many seniors that are playing a lot of snaps\nAt so we really have a lot of experience comeback and we have a lot of you know your question marks herself so that we graduated to a very good a senior class from a year ago graduated about half of our starters on each side of the football so we knew it so we've got some seniors out there who were\nUh you know really experience so like I said it's just kind of this group since they've been sophomores of F continue to to lead our program and can have a lot of success so we do come in the end that we had an opportunity to have a very uh very suspicious and\nI've only been to let you go I you know I I you guys us coaches you can only really look till the next game 'cause I Know that's what you tell your kids and that's the way you have to go about it you know your radio announcer you can do anything you want to even if you're wrong which you are most of the time and it doesn't really make any difference forget about it but see I was kind of looking ahead myself\nAnd uh see I project and I hope this ... project you do went out I projected you finish and nine and one and I projected you finish six\nAnd you know who would finish eleventh in that scenario\nWho's that then [laughter]\nYeah I've uh it'd be back I looked at I Would have lifted its legs and then come up with that said closely and for ... yeah yeah\nThat that you know who slipped fat when it gets there was that would be a that would be incredible\nYou know if they didn't have to do with game planning to\nKnow if I'm not a whole lot of traveling for imitating or you go but the ... that would\nBe pretty incredible like sit in ... I'm a German banks get together for a football game it's a it's a great night for the county and I couldn't imagine what things will be like if if that scenario played out\nBuddy well you take them as they ... best of luck against uh the raiders coming up on friday night okay\nThank you very much and I appreciate you guys having Neal\nThank you Michael appreciate you buddy and are the guys it's great and when you're doing game night and you don't have the outdoor and all of a sudden you get a head coach from another teams and here's the score urinating so yeah you you mentioned that I remember\nThat when he he called interact called and sent that text you and kept you up to and I think the other great one was I don't remember which game was but\nYou had a young man sitting in the stands with his dad and he was sending you updates and you ask them if you can send you an update when the game was over in ... with the text back like if my dad let this that\nLaw and my dad lives me said or the end of the game I Will say okay I'll take that I came up here's a guy and I haven't talked to this guy in a while Kevin White men head coach now Frankfurt falcons Kevin ...\nFred how you've and it has been a few years\nHas been too long been way too long but we do it all definitely\nWell obviously you haven't forgotten anything I mean you're falcons are playing pretty good football tell me about your team buddy\nYes they're praying real good I'm I'm really proud of him I'm dark seniors\nComing in they had a winning season since they've been in high school and they really had high goals Scrabble winning season\nAnd to make the playoffs and they say well we're setting and seven or more than you know that we're we're ... we're having a winning season and hungry crack into the playoffs and you know they work really hard and ... and then\nThey're not going to be more crowded ... effort that the court in um your dream real Susan and throughout the season it's been very\nYeah seven into one you opened with five wins you lost mountain ridge Maryland bank on September twenty fifth twenty seven Twenty one than back to back wins at Washington than home to Petersburg and you've been off for a week getting ready for Kaiser coming up this week how was the a week off for yourself and in one ...\nIt was good I I have not having a game or a friday night but we need it if I we we have some kids that were\nThat needed to rest and needed to heal their bodies up and uh it couldn't come at a better time so you know the the last week you know we didn't get too hard or we wanted to hear Walker and and then we we had a good week this week I was very\nVery happy with what they've done this week coming out and they they know it's a big game and [noise] they're focused and and every day practices are than really you're\nEight games you're averaging forty two points a game of scorn forty two veterans seven out of eight of those ... are you guys ahead of schedule compared to what you thought coming into the season\n[noise] I Would say yes coming into this and we had to things and brings up and I didn't know will you know what's out there what kind of direction but go and but yeah I'm I'm pleased with what we've got all fence and you know we did where where do we are starting to seven I'm warm but we played some things that are that are down about ... and the teams that played for some of them are not\nUp to where they've been in the past and ah you know we've more fuel we've had some great battled for more fielding and each party and Scott Walker season and their their butt down right now the ... but they'll they'll get it back or coaches are working hard and um\nBut but I'm like so we got good ... we have some good players so I'm not taking anything away from our game because we have good players that come out and work hard every day and in in wild land so you can't take anything away from them\nLet's talk about one of those players a dozen pollock ah to me and he's the next level kid and my and my close on that\nYes yes he has some schools looking at him and then a he's a good boy work short yes he's ... he's got a lot for seats are full blackie plays linebacker and and he's our cap ... captain so he does a good job leading the team\nOne of the strengths of your ball club is obviously running the football you're averaging two hundred and Seventy yard the game on the ground and\nIf the numbers are workout right for those games that you want out of your age have gone over three hundred yards rushing so maybe talk about that all of a sense of line and that back field or two hundred and Seventy are the game on the ground is a good effort by Frankfurt running football\nIt is and we you know we like to run the football people we know no we\nOn the football we we also will throw it in there with like a mix it up with a reproductive only a run run first\nAnd I you know we probably we probably average anywhere from ten to Fifteen passes the game and I and I think that's good for what we're trying to do without running game has been very good er line as worked very hard I Know I got good coaches good assistant coaches and\nHere's Jimmy ... worked for Bill cuts wind does a good job with them but we had been doing a great job I just hope friday night you know ... is a very tough opponent um they play very disciplined on both sides of the ball they have a good defense they're they're very well coached\nAnd it's it's gonna be a tough task to come out a friday night and uh you know do what we've been doing\nJoined by Frank her head coach Kevin White men coach I Know you said it was a little strange having any by week uh but you were able to scale Kaiser last week and their game against Bridgeport knows a lot of players there as well what was the biggest takeaways from the Kaiser game in what you have to do to slow down that running game\n[noise] well they definitely have a lot of weapons and and it's scary you know they run it off and it's very well they run a lot of that jet sweep and they run plays off the jet sweet and the quarterback\nIs very quick you know you face the jet sweep and then come crawling up in there and it's hard to defend in you know it's easy to over over pursue it and then they got red but after he was a great receiver to they sort of the ball to definitely going to have her ... her hands full um conjure they you know they last week they battled back they were down ...\nNothing and they were back and uh I was impressed with how they how they fought back after being down and they've done that several times this year they won some big few big gains by by coming back one in particular was the weird game you're down and I think they were down forty two to forty or fourteen I mean they come back and one forty\nOne forty so that says a lot about the character of your team\nIs quite possibly Kevin a playoff game for both your kids don't see things\nCoach now at five and three and you've got your traditional we tend to weaken eleven opponents and Notre Dame and Madonna particularly with Notre Dame and seems like one or both of the teams in this game every year are in the mix for a playoff a possibilities is there are different bugs when the Irish come around and we can\nWell you know I'm sure there is you know that ... game I'm no rivals\nLike say both the ball clubs are usually in the playoff hunt and uh you know you're getting at the end of the season and you're trying to get that extra when you try to make the playoffs or whatever so the kids replied extremely hard on both teams so you know it does make it pretty interesting\nYou know around when you when you started this season I Know you you you had this like his to quarterback system with Seth casino and Levi Karen ... is that still in play right now\n[laughter] it is and if you look at ... fly before quarterbacks um\nWe've throat in the mix of hotter board Shaun Hayes a little bit of a wild cats and you know those two of that of an excellent job whether it's a law where like say Levi on staff and you know it's sort of\nWhat we want to try to do what we want to try to accomplish and so or or gives of adapted very well to us and uh you know it gives us strength in different ways so uh we're pleased with what we're going\nHow many years you've been a clip until now coach\nUh this is started I think you're thirty four just stand here uh this is twenty fours the head coach\nYeah that's what I was thinking I remember when you when you started there are back in the ... just about Ninety four Ninety five somewhere in that range and after that yeah that was it\nYeah tell me about how you've seen this program change I mean obviously you've got the stadium there the turf I mean you've seen it from a lot of different vantage points to claim Patel over those thirty four years and twenty four the head coach\nYeah you know I was the assistance my buddy Ross more yeah and then Russ or whatever the winds bargain and that's what I took over and you know ... whatever he left handed me the key is like a lawn mower or or get above the field\nAnd uh you know my kids grew up on that field and you know we were way they can lower and we talk about old memories of waiting mowing it in the field house\nAnd I'm like I say the program was really gross like say the facility is ... with the failed the track of the press box the whole was still it is so\nUm you know for us ... there was a parade or you know for ten years we were in the playoffs eight of them over for a two thousand four chain run for pain we were state semi finals and\nYou know like I say it was just automatic seemed like we were in the playoffs I'll always miss the last few years but a lot of the things that\nYou know going into why was this that the plows let our kids have really play break on I'm just fortunate enough that part of everything required to tell 'em you know there's just home from a um\nI'm right now one of my former players back ... with us and that's a poem you know I was free and they haven't gone back on staff\nOr you go hey buddy or run out of time going to let you go you got two more games left in like you say you just just keep on taking care of business you've got a lot coming back next to your best of luck to you okay\n... thanks you guys very much\nReshaped ... Wilson while twenty four years yeah coaching CBs it's been a while and I I remember when he took over I mean it's a curious\nHow many years it's been twenty four years runs more are really good head coach he took over for\nAbove the ... he's a good coach remember seeing him a lot and he's right just been a couple of lean years but he will have him back that's for sure not I timed to name our games of the week in a we made a statement earlier in the program\nThat it should be easy and I think it is but a AAA let's start there and is it is it impossible to get past the first game will not up your Parkersburg at Huntington park at Parkersburg south it's not that hard to get past the ... were not reading it passed and stuff for me I'm a Jew joke\nYeah I mean we would Morgantown at university and the other week you can maybe put them in the conversation based unimportant to the playoffs for positioning for both teams but yeah I I think we know we're going this yeah\nI think the clash triple a metro his game all the way you can still be undefeated muscle ... undefeated Martin's Bergen ... we'll see what happens who knows Martin's bird uh right now the heavy favorite going in or even Brian Thomas alluded to that but we'll see we'll see how it goes so that's our triple a game a week are double a game of the week\nAnd they even I talked about this last week during game I did with ...\nYeah we did and a\nSpring valley at number one and AAA and point pleasant at what number six than double a hard look past that game and double A. but I tell you what James Monroe has the playoffs sitting right in front of it the next two weeks they're outside the top sixteen and double A. they're six and two they host Bluefield this week then go to a point\nTo ramp up the regular season at the mavericks want to get in the playoffs they've got a pretty much went out but can you really look past the top of the a double life on the two undefeated teams yeah don't you think what do you think Joe\nMiller Kaiser Frankfurt again any other ... you could probably say they're on the conversation but uh the zeroes in the last call them I think kind of make our decision for\nUs and then we get to class single a and ah we got about a minute here to talk about this but\nWhen you look at it is it really central man they were taken to the wire land and a half and Curtis McGee was hurt in a game as well and they get a shady side Ohio team that lost the first game of the season by six points east Liverpool they haven't lost since then\nThere are eight and one that's a good one ah we talked about the ... region Williamstown you guys decide and I'll go with you\nI think absolutely Williamstown daughters county this has been a game it's been circled on the bulldogs calendar all year should live up to expect to have big game middling trail oak hill that's a good one as well in order to do with the patriots after the red devil\nSo we'd go and William sounds always yup yeah All right Williamstown and now there's kind of that's that's our game of the way that's got to do it for us to talk to you next week\nNews has been brought to vie Concord University hash tag it starts with you in mind that Harrison tell these family resource network connected with your favorite school every Wednesday nights on a high school sports lying big presentation above metro news radio network\nI reserve am I just point five FM Charles\nVirginia radio corporation station\nFall y'all and I have has the warming case you're training for this week fifty fifty friday Senate\nDeck is stacked fluffy buttermilk pancakes layered with Enron filling and topped with cream cheese I think I can stand cake perfectly next real sunken\nAnd seasonal spices forget that this\nIs talk incentive stack kids can create their own scary they can take this\nMonth Korea candy corn and fresh fruit make any pancake creation and Neal when you add eggs bacon or something in golden hash browns wait there's more ... has added color the pumpkin spice company and French tongue tied to chocolate to their menu for a limited time to check out the menu on line that I hop dot com for hearty amen\nUltimate date burgers fresh salads home style meals and Mars and don't forget the I hung up and go ask friday at nine AM and go to W.

slowly and\nWe when we talk score before the game he made it clear there was no question about whether or not jaded Martinez your plate tonight after a two week ease ankle last night but he was limping heavily when we met with them before the game and he acknowledged it was store and you could see it on that play right there\nYeah and I would say I can curb their buster after you finished interviewing and I stopped to talk to him when he was walking down the steps he was in pain\n... and he'll take ... and you can tell when you ask a guy hey how's the ankle feel the facial expression

eight hours from now\nWould you oh there's a strike you wouldn't want on bogus\nYeah which I mean might make you wonder if Red Sox are able to win this game tonight and had to LA up to nothing that maybe you try to give JT an extra day or at least\nExtra you know half the game if you will or two on curve ball outside all three so perhaps if the threats that go to LA and they're up to nothing

disagree with you and you know the thing is they often just looks so bad two weeks ago it's hard to visualize them getting all the way back but they really should right I mean they really should tonight against Baylor secondary that has really struggled Oklahoma put up sixty six on these guys\nIf West Virginia's anywhere close to what we thought they were offensively they've got to be able to score some points where she'd\nOr you've had a week off you had a chance to sit down correct some things I watch some things on film and\nAs I mentioned when I first got here hobby it's all about making place yeah I don't care about getting back to the basics there's nothing else that's going to do or anything more for your confidence thing going out on a field and making a play of the player so that's what's going to give you that energy that's what it's going to give you to spark you need to be able to come out fast and get it going early\nWeekly you see that seems starting fast and I\nMean I'd love it I Would absolutely love it and you know I like your pick a do you yeah I like your pick I Want to have it no [laughter]\nNo [laughter] oh I'm going to stay with my pick but you know if the boys in Vegas think that there's going to be a lot of points here sixty six sixty seven on the line it's really a lot of points and somebody's got to score most of 'em right at West Virginia Institute touchdown favorite you might be right hobby\nYou know and again I just get hung up I watched the uh that Oklahoma gained some of the Oklahoma game and then you look at the stats and the sense of where you just want to deficiencies on this to be able to you and I don't know I don't think it's like I was a state where they can be coached up to stop this West Virginia ...\nThere's holes out there man there's holds out there in the west Virginia didn't screw it down and find some different ways to exploit this Baylor defense in the ... year then I've got big concerns about West Virginia moving forward they've got to get back on trapped\nIn this case cliche brand but you have to point this month when a Jeff drink is is a must win I mean isn't isn't isn't the seminal for the season this game tonight yeah because the Dallas just build hop it\nThat's the case right and that'll be the case tonight of West Virginia doesn't when you guys have covered everything over the last couple of hours you know but what can you just can use off into blanket veteran and\nWe don't know who they are putting them line yeah but what was that in order to talk on the week what are you saying we don't ... your getting better at it not allowed right\nFor them but no obviously the west Virginia game is is on the front and center that's what people are watching right now and I tell you what gauge in the early responses I Know it can be a scripted drive right out of the gate but I Will routed to Jennings was great\nBut there was too little short passes to start off with the first one to cells are we talking about not having any Russians on that drives those are basically kind of run sure just get it out quick\nAnd that was really missing from the Iowa State game a couple of weeks ago really trying to get all or nothing with this past plays and then that right out the gate just saying you know what we're going to go quick we don't believe Baylor can defend us one on one and so far obviously work\nBeen hold on big run by Kennedy McCoy Jeff but an obvious whole by West Virginia\nThat are ... their hobby on hold and a very obvious what it was a huge dresser sets West Virginia all the way back inside the twenty and so big first downplay here and they're going to go to Jennings again or sue Jennings picks up positive you are just going to be a second down and feel alone for West Virginia and I think that was unnecessary\nHold because the McCoy was going to the outside young hold the guy\nThat was going to get the run out of it up and what else what other storylines are all going to develop than I Do think\nI really see me first and foremost it's it's going to be this West Virginia game obviously mentioned Appalachian State and then they go you know the Georgia Tech Virginia Tech game is is sort of interesting because this is in the ACC a coastal\nAnd we we're on track this is just purely for me this isn't for any anybody else really we're on track for every single team in that division finishing foreign for and I'm just putting that out there because that would be the most ACC thing possible and I'm pushing for it\nI understand been comfortable CBS Sports dot com boom will check back with you in a bit ah on second had nine Jeff sub able to get great pressure will knock them down\nThis pressure all night happy angrier throws the ball short after that pressure so that's a nice job by the Baylor Baylor's defense and it was very short on the past and they have a chance for a third down conversion here at their own thirty one yard line thirty nine\nThat threaten us develop real quick what happened to the protection their\nOpportunity that they had to uh blitz of men and really got to them they bought six and so we were out there playing one on one\nOkay was was so and then uh we're just didn't have time to get the\nBowling alley and her in the I think it might get tempted even short you know\nYou know so now what is a West Virginia tickets ... Baylor they took a timeout yeah\nNo I don't feel snow the defensive coordinator he when he was a temple he was like blitz guy he just loved to bring him and I don't think he thinks he can match up maybe after the first Dr he says what the heck we're going to bring pressure to bring pressure and does what did nothing the first asked and he got burnt than the first the first ... first series\nWhich was OK quick take us so far in this ball game they took a time out West Virginians of seven and nothing twelve Seventeen left to go in the first quarter quick take on the early going Dave weekly give me a sentence to describe what you've seen so far\nGreater looks great and he's got all kinds of time to throw a Jennings was running free for the touchdown we don't know too much about the deep and so it was three it out yeah Jeff Kagan give me a sentence to describe what you're saying like the energy happy like the energy early from West Virginia yeah do\nI think we're doing is exactly what we need to get her confidence back you need to go down the score and exactly what we did she\nI think it's promising to see special on a first year you come out or you get into the end zone you work that game plan and ask what you strive for bread we talked in pre game about guys stepping up and making plays Greer with a play Jennings with a play Kenny Robinson was a play defensively guys engaged early it's a good sign\nYeah it is a good sign you got the whole call that's the first a mistake major mistake by west Virginian are coming up on a third and what are you got thirty nine thirty nine third and nine big third downplay West Virginia earlier on this season was about sixty percent on third down Iowa State knocked that down considerably to about fifty percent\nBread they did what's her name is still high up in the evenings on I mean that's been very effective for them or an area they've been very good at got to keep that going tonight gotta stay on the field and things and drives here\nYeah I just said if if [noise] Baylor is going to step up the pressure and and maybe they feel like especially watching that I was thinking that they can get degree or hurry him what does Greer do how do you all set that up instead of what I'm going\nTo be not going to be a big mistake by daily or if they try to bring pressure on men up on the outside\nThere's not at the other than our state there's not a team that has slowed down the ... West Virginia or receiving corps because now they're going to be matched up one on one down failed so that means you're gonna have to carry cover Gary Jennings a markets him David Sales all man demand coverage that too many options across the board that went autos battles\nWhich is true it's a total mismatch tribe play one on one with our receivers I think they'll continue to blitz but I think it'll be ... just exactly like our state did play an audio three eight or ... up and don't get the one on one\nOkay so I don't know nothing West Virginia leads Baylor early going West Virginia scored in three plays on their first possession and be able to win three un out now West Virginia's a third and nine there in their own territory\nYou got to keep doing the right how much better do you feel if you're western if you put some more points on the board here in the second possession and get it to to spores early now you're really starting to step on the throat a little bit can you get first downs and moved the chains\nSo West Virginia now with their first third down of the game the third and nine from their own thirty one that holds generally really set them back this time angrier Jeff is right on the money for a first down\nFounded spot they're happy right in the middle of that so they get a a a pass completion too Giovanni Hoskins for housing for twelve yards and a first down for West Virginia at their own forty three red where was the past when\nWe talk about and where do we go middle to a tied in early middle tight end I landed three\nMan rush and drop date and guess what they almost to a between ashes ... which would they tried to\n... ... ... if they drop ate the middle more open\nWell certain coverage it is in that time he got between the linebacker switch exactly what happened\nJeff Baylor is giving up six yards per carrier against ... often says including McCoy gets a quick six or seven\nGets for on the first down I'm Sorry for him for balance that out to toward the right tackle so second down a six year for West Virginia they cross his deal right at right around midfield\nBetter at it and all that went to the middle of the field I like the middle right it says in brain surgery just find the middle of the west Virginia when they're in West Virginia first down middle again wherever that hot\nAnd they went down field to the end zone Jeff distilled always write off his fingers\nAre just barely overthrown they're happy but he was in the slide here and uh he's open I mean he ... he beat the defender between badly\nWas what was the what was the boy or girl\nDavis is lined up as an inside receiver he basically got leverage on that defensive back and the flight or to throw it was just a little too flat by ... not sure if he got pressure there or not but just a little more you can do that you have a touchdown\nRichard I'm surprised you didn't say boys will receive\nOr should I ask because I figured they'd even the hands you got to make the catch exactly I wasn't finished a [laughter]\n... Bush citing here Jeff\nDevon Bush yeah and uh what we saw we achieve on often tweeted earlier tonight and that was a have on Austin right there huh yeah but I mean that's one of the famous place by Austin so second intent and he gains Thirteen yards on the place so first down down to the Baylor twenty five\nOh you like what you see early with this off and yeah and it\nDoes help to play makers back right lady brown back in the lineup Kevin Bush back in the lineup after injury so your full strength no offense away for West Virginia\nDone have you got your play action there didn't work button to\nOcean a game there ought to be a light and all of a defenders from from Baylor cause it's going to be to speed sweep was every time he goes in the game that's usually what happens\nJeff West Virginia goes deep but a pretty well recovered and um\nYeah it's pretty nice job there and I think there's things might have got it out too happy but they ... it\n... you also might have been held interfere with\nSecond down intend for West Virginia at the twenty five yard line\nOr Baylor's definitely given West Virginia some opportunities one on one on the outside so West Virginia was second in ten now and they do the little delay pick up a couple\nLady Brown's 'cause set up a third down for the mountaineers thirty eight for West Virginia here I tell you what you do like though even though out of all this mean West Virginia's dominated often so we one forty three to Nineteen but a red you're keeping bale bale where it's just not getting the chance to play off in ...\nYou're not but you got to put them away at some point right I mean if you're Baylor you're sitting here going she's we can't play much worse now let's see if West Virginia can add some points here But West Virginia's really had opportunities early you got score some points\nThird and ate for West Virginia from the bay were twenty three year West Virginia could take advantage of it and just ah they cannot think we've had about ...\nBaylor brings pressure off the edge of looked like a corner blitz there and pretty nice coverage by Baylor\nWhere he was the nickel bled cynical care from the field and they ran the linebacker out the exchange with him so basically we're blitz and play into deep forty four the line backers running to get those like what happened to the duty blitz whatever the routes where she\nWell you got some pressure but a Simmons actually came over right at the end of the last play and if you watched him closely it was a double move but he kinda threw his hands up like you know to Boston came to me but the pressure forced the urgency on a throw\nEvans daily with a forty or feel go attempts\nAnd happy it rocked no good no that's the so that they remember this right three possession yeah no\nThe score you only got seven and you could have had Twenty one here you know what and and now this is you talked about\nPlaying well early and getting something earlier she they did but then he got\nBaylor's all jacked up that's what I was just saying there you if you're Baylor you're on that side line St guys we can't play much worse than we have early penalties a turnover West Virginia's moving the ball and yet we're only down seven nothing let's go score right back in West Virginia had an opportunity to take this game and they have not done it\nWell right now I can promise you to Baylor coaches are telling their their players listen we gave up one early but we're still in this thing as thoroughly is still the first quarter let's get back to the game plan where right where we want to be good\nI mean they were turning the ball over having penalties are only down seven nothing the quarterback brewer has time this time and throws way down the field in West Virginia almost gets another one\nI think he wanted to give it back to them hopped in almost you know something going on there and it give police going to be back in ... West Virginia\n... it's amazing Jeff I'm much play action from both sides a lot of play action passing so in deep down the field\nAnd ah they will play action was open get back on the ball rolling as late as a third\nTime they've been that formation with three receivers in the boundary the first two towns you through the slanted the field so this is the first time they threw in the boundary and then again it's formation\nBoundary Baylor has second and ten and brewer wants to run in West Virginia is they're ... they're happy they're just the minimal yard aids given about one play and it's going to be third giving one given thirty nine at their own twenty four here\nIt's a shame bagel is not here for a couple of my ... I like him not only playing lies about personality wise that's a heck of a playwright that we talked about Charlie brewers ability to run with his legs great job by big way to get him tripped up kind of brutal\nWith you know he's got some feed and you figure a bigger hole your nose tackle brings him down he likes that that's nice now you got a third and nine for Baylor from or their own twenty for your lungs look in West Virginia so to see is\nThat the officers change into playing defense looked over and they changed their defense to let's see what we get we get\nA little bit we're done or you know exactly the brewery has a lot of time and fines you have an open guy I think he found ... no no that's um eighty four\nYeah it's more ... Jones happy for twenty two yards and they live I moved up to the forty six yard line where he had time\nThey found that looks like Steve they found behind the line backers in front of the safety they said what happened to fill\nThe drop date guys and that's what we talked about how often so that we didn't do last week they hit that intermediate cross or to like to Fifteen to Eighteen yards between allowing\nBackers and the secondary they played five hundred three D.\nBrewer again to the Arab picked off by the mountain air Jeff\nBrewer loves giving it back to West Virginia he's he does get bigger interception by West Virginia they return the ball\nAll the way deep in the territory of Baylor hobby and there is going to be a flag on the plate to\nSo the interception will stand because of flight came right at the end of the play an interception for West Virginia as they dropped again a lot of players but brewer throws his second interception right into a firsthand yeah right neighbors hands there you know just over three ... we had every was there\nA good job I ever remember she earlier you thought ... could have had one on the sidelines is twenty almost didn't have a choice like stuck in his belly right there he hangs on in Haiti not\nPull it up he there would have got mash about a a defender sitting right in front of him a but then you you make the decision to go ahead and stop on that and you give up the turnover of flag\nThink late hit for Baylor yeah Baylor came down on the ground and well radical penalty holding\nRight here by ... oh my God well that's a penalty that's the way he had there was another was a hold on West Virginia to\nGo to hold on to ask you own I'm Henry ask you Henry on the run back yeah they did moved back a happy to the thirty three yard line first intent\nWhereas the picture what does it wears the helmet where's the helmet was held back like the helmet out man it's a West Virginia they're uh they were thirty three yard line can they take advantage of it\nWhy don't you throw the tied into your ... and again and again our patio of motion\nWhere we did that I think yeah kind of wasn't there a new and improved isn't that what we ask Jeff the whole the whole time where we're seeing\nA lot of movement profits a lot of emotions and a lot of change of direct another flag against Baylor\nYeah it's all coming back up because I think well was it off ... look like they signal to things there\nBut the question right what was the player just it's I Know what a guard that they don't pass tightened up off the plate pass the west coast at a\nMotion to an hour and a lot of or as Bush than as a playwright off of it right after\nShe causing a lot of problems on that second level by Baylor that motion and now they're trying to do is just ... and then you just run exactly where they vacated from\nFirst and goal from the ten yard line in West Virginia would front of the middle and nothing they're seen him\nIn the bank or most viable bank visit the website and leave your banking dot com member FDIC caught we may interrupt you as conditions are ... but talking about these other games getting underway okay\nI've got an eye on

when would give West Virginia at least a share for another\nBig wealth conference championship they're playing Kansas so far it's a scoreless match there's about nine minutes to go in the first half Kansas nothing them on your way\nAnd soccer team nothing and that's the latest from the MVP banks scoreboard MB back your most valuable back visit their Web site at NBC banking dot com member up yeah\nAnd he still came right in front of it caught the ball for forty to your cat down to the Fifteen your line debate or but that would you be you had first and second down has really getting nothing is going to be a big third downplay here for West Virginia\nWhere he had Greer had a wide open receiver in the end zone missed him\nOh my goodness it may may may Baylor's defensive backs or awful acts to all passes or our midst yeah ... down the middle and now made and right here you don't usually see that out of here\nSo I mean how who is ... who is playing who is playing defense tobacco bay were me\nAnd that was the scouting report coming in right that's why the the biggest thought there'd be somebody points that defensive secondary really struggled but then be able to get those huge back\nFifteen your in laws on the stock copy comes right up the middle not picked up by West Virginia defenders to put the ball back on the thirty so this is going to be a forty seven yard or by daily\nThat's not an inch and well the guy walked a field goal guys that was the screenwriter so bright green was arms or I was I wasn't a drawback to protection was a little bit different should have been a quick hit her will held on to the ball\nYeah in ... minutes didn't take enough out of that guy on the on the initial\nYou got to hear him on what All right yeah untouched\nAnd there's times daily makes a good from forty sevens those daily or miss the person who made the next two\nBut why is this is Thirteen nothing should be twenty eight to nothing windy here but it's twenty four to nothing we shouldn't ... are we complaining to mind when you hear of a team happy have forced to go opportunities you still have Thirteen minutes left in the second quarter are going to get an analysis of your guys and let's go round the one we ... we'll start with you\nIs that ... West Virginia is able to move the ball the defense is playing well Baylor is awful so far but it just ...\nWest Virginia hasn't shown the ability to run when the need to pick up a ... and ... Lynch has been a big factor in the game I mentioned I'm ... I'm a moment ago he's got to block field goal he just short circuit that drive with a big sec I'm with you happy ... it could be it could be thirty nothing\nMhm remember I told you earlier game I second key to the game was what or when you're in the red zone Baylor lead the big twelve in his eighth nationally and allowing touch downs in the red zone so they're doing what they do their western is getting down in their pre scoring opportunities and the Baylor's tightening up\n[noise] but is there anything that you've seen so far any of you anything you've seen so far that would lead you to believe that they could win the football\nGame no no no brewers been awful\nNo but I'm able to you know what I'm doing here the guys I'm looking at how to pass this I alright ... who's gonna win this game barring some catastrophe so I'm with Egypt they win but this does not look like an ... ready to go when the big ... well no\nBecause we're still leaking oil which were totally dependent on the past and gang which means it's hit and miss which we overthrew one touchdown pass in and maybe drop the second one so when you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "25"}
