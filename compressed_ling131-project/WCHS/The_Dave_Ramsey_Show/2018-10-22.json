S. W. VHS network dot com\nBBC News\nThis is talk now to Karen Taylor the Washington Post democracy is editor at the post ... thank you for joining us this morning we saw with President Trump said in your paper or last night your first reaction to the study coverage ... much more ... the outer BS yeah um\nI still believe in the post ... still believes that this is not an explanation this is an attempt at a cover up I'm so much doesn't add up ah for me personally in the new law worked for general all\nOver the last year you know this this idea first of all this idea that he he wanted to return to Saudi Arabia is absolutely untrue um there was a reason why he came to Washington and felt a free and Washington he did not want to be arrested he did not want to face the same fate as many as acquaintances and associates who have been\nSwept up in this wave of crackdowns he knew that the very least under under NBS that uh\nThat Saudi Arabia was not safe so this this idea is strikes me is that he wanted to go back to strike says is not true and a second of all you know this this idea that a brawl you know this this man who was kind and calm and and gentle that\nAny sort of brawl took place that was April if anything ever going to get any kind of gray and says he walked into an ambush that was set up for him\nTo show that he was not yet a legal permanent resident of the United states even though he was working here for the Washington Post do you think the u._s. government did enough to protect him\nQuestion that we have and I'm I'm looking at the reporting that uh there was intelligence U.S intelligence that that wasn't planned I'm coming from a ... a bit of someone connected to him\nThat a plan to capture or or try to learn back a show it to a to Saudi Arabia um I was announced\nThe community about what they know what they can tell us at this point in a while I Can't go into the substance of it I can tell you I don't find this Saturday account a credible at all\nUh there's simply no way they dispatched a team of this large a and that the show he engaged in some kind of a brawl with that and the lesson was merely fighting for his life um but I think we can see where this is headed ultimately\nThe president is going to accept the crown princes denials a but it's hard for me to imagine that uh these orders would have been carried out without the knowledge of the crown prince I think this ought to be a relationship altering event for the U.S in Saudi Arabia that we ought to suspend\nMilitary sales we ought to suspend certain security assistance or and we ought to impose sanctions on any of those that were directly involved in this murder of this really ought to be something that causes us to do a re examination of our relationship with Saudi Arabia you agree with that kind of some ...\nI Believe that first of all the president should go all the way on this as far as this is your first step that's all it is it's really not a believable first step important they are in many\nThat he was killed when he was in their custody but there's no way that one person basically an overweight civilian has to be killed when he's facing up to twelve or Fifteen professionals they could have brought him down in a matter of seconds without causing any physical harm at all so obviously there was intent I Believe to kill them\nA simple one number two though we do have a relationship with Saudi Arabia that we should try to maintain and during the Obama administration I went to fight in the house to allow nine eleven families the zoo Saudi

unfortunately defined so much of the national conversation I'm ... you can you can add more to it or or you can um you can stay focused on on the future and why you did this and the first place and that's that's what we've chosen to do\nWell in large over the race is of course the president when Senator Ted Cruz ran against Trump and twenty sixteen there was a whole lot of name calling\nThis man

Republican agenda by Trump's passed policy of family separation at the border it's one area where Cruz broke with the administration\nPolicy is reinstated is this something that you would challenge\nWhat listen this is something we should all come together on when it when it comes to family separation everyone should agree the right place for kids to be as with their parents\nIf it comes to the president this isn't the right policy\nToilets and I've been very clear to the president would enforce the law that we should also keep families together\nCruz might be slightly to the

to be okay and I think without realizing trickle down economics doesn't work I'm tired of Washington having to spend so much time defending this president protecting US President where the jobs are\nGone I mean whatever not for people I'll tell you I Love my poor if I send we have a higher than if they're happy but look at the deficit\nLook I think the the issue is people are realizing this president uh is offenses he's of race baiting and so he's reminding people some of the things they don't like about him and that's the problem\nFrom all over Capitol Hill everyday one thing Republican candidates rubbing incumbents wish the president talking about a little bit more is the economy is their\nAgenda and the president this week made very clear his closing argument right he's going out there talking about immigration instead of ... hitting on the economy and some of the other issues that I think a lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill want to be talking about because when the president does go out and hit so hard\nOn immigration it also exposed to the flip side which is that Congress has been able to do anything on this issue the president isn't making an argument about policy here he's making an emotional argument and that\nIs a little tricky for summer ... and ... things\nAnd that piece from Ted Cruz it for ... for us to on the on the Texas Senate races that even someone like Ted Cruz it puts them in an uncomfortable position when the president's talking about immigration\nYeah like I I think if you were to talk of the White House their argument when the we were out there and we were talking about the economy are candidates for talking about the economy and we weren't getting a lot of traction\nUm but I have put my name and I'm going to make this a referendum on me and the only way that we pulled us out at stake side are base and get them gyms out and have them turn out now like that was put some of those\nCongressional members especially in those suburban districts\nIn an awkward place because they have to talk to that base but also back pedal from the president a little bit but overall the belief is that in addition to the Kavanaugh hearings which gave a lot of people out there for Republicans the president being out there and saying latching on to that there are about mobs or about jobs\nAnd you know it says what's changing the dynamic that ... silver less describe yeah and I was just saying this and won his name as we just heard from Nathan in this could all come down to food is the president energize more in these final two weeks correct for I mean what you're saying is I think they're applying to the pollsters here in Georgia and the pollsters are making it clear with tax cuts were not working\nAs a message for them it turns\nYou switch now and you say hey immigration stirs this\nIs talk of mobs especially after Kavanaugh stirs the Republican race until it becomes a base election in that same get people to the polls what you're saying after Kavanaugh's a hike or a spike Russia and the Republican level of enthusiasm for turning out participating in them return\nOn the other hand I think what you're saying is like the president\nIs all too willing to go about body slamming oppressed or go after the notion that the immigrants are really [noise] criminals are all MS Burger King or if he said this week\nLikely democratic voters if you go ahead I was just going to say but that\nKind of fear mongering I mean part of the why that we're hearing in the polling is not getting to the Y. and I do think remember it's energizing Republican men\nCollege educated Republican women and independence for saying this and the Georgia race are not with the Republican governors governors race they are not with the Republican Party and when he goes out there and talk about\nOn you know the fear mongering and horse say people are remind I don't like that and when and some for some of these five minutes now\nHold on for some of these candidates who were\nTrump being in their primary and there's a problem for them and their general because people are now having to back away and he puts them in a very tough position as you've said didn't just drop on the climate or he's living in the sky we know the sky Democrats are already on fire and democratic women are on the part we've already seen this\nProblem with fire as you can set fire with fire camp for girls they can get any more into the room with a number of years old when you're out on every democratic and showing while the number of Republicans ... ... we just step back for one second we don't know what's gonna happen yet November it's a lot if you like [laughter] okay\n[laughter] all over the past two weeks you know there was a very compelling analysis\nFrom Charlie Cook from ... political ratings he wrote just a couple of days ago there was one thing we do now is that one of the biggest mistakes Democrats have made a very long time was how they handle capital you know three weeks ago the Democrats could have taken over\nThe second half of all the way that is pretty much I I think again it not as clear cut your it was clear three weeks out the question is is that going to be sustained or is it I think that's right given the news cycle and the way that things that the conversation can't change who knows how long it will be sustained and Republicans clearly are betting\nOn the kind of thing I think they get a bounce from Kevin they're projecting that but\nThere is a ban it I mean you could see a lot of moderate Republicans being turned off by the way the Republicans handled they actually can also benefit from the entire conversation as well that's all for us right now thanks for sharing that on the line with

incredible mission getting science through to the very last moment and a series of papers that have recently come out are talking about some of those findings flying through that gap between the rings and the planet\nIt paid off and we're going to get to those but I'm going to save them because it it's like one is more spectacular than the other but but first a little review Twenty years in space Thirteen of them\nQueens Saturn almost eight billion kilometers or about five billion miles if you choose two hundred Ninety four or but it's almost half a million image is twenty seven nations involved in the mission four thousand papers and counting lot more to come\nAbsolutely I think that discoveries within the Cassini data will continue for years to come we really just have skimmed the cream of off the top of this fire hose of data that came back and so stay tuned there's more to come\nI Want to look back at some of this is an old science this is still very recent science\nAnd what's really interesting the the is the first thing I'm going to mention is based on images that the spacecraft captured in two thousand nine but I mean it's such a great evidence of how even data from a few years ago is unveiling new science and you probably figured out I'm Talking about\nThis paper that was published do just last month September of twenty Eighteen\nAbout dust storms Josh storms on titan\nIt's incredible Matt around at Cornell knocks it turns out that there appear to be a lot of wind and in the ... region around tightened where we have these dunes there is some data from the visual and Fred mapping spectrometer showing what looked like clouds of organic dust particles\nAnd so they've done some work on that and so the ... region would be the place that you would expect to see this kind of dust storm and it just took careful analysis and ruling out clouds ground fog other possibilities until they could come out with these brand new results\nThis crazy little world becomes more like our own planet it seems every day\nAbsolutely lakes and seas river channels clouds that rain methane so many things that are very very familiar\nWe could talk all about a lot more of the science prior to the six papers that have just been released but there's one more than I Know we should talk about and that is that still mysterious hexagon above the north pole which are apparently we know it really is well above the north pole now\nThat hexagon is quite interesting when Cassini first arrived the hexagon was in darkness it was summer at the south pole then as the seasons change that part of the atmosphere heated up and we could still see the hexagon in the images and lower down in the atmosphere\nBut as the atmosphere heated up starting in about twenty fourteen the stratosphere about several hundred kilometers higher warmed up and there was another hexagonal shape\nHigher up in the atmosphere and so as the temperatures increase that we went towards summer\nThat hexagon got more and more apparent and it matched its its corners matched the hexagon below so now the question is are these two hexagon connected in some way or communicating in some way and it's very puzzling because it's\nNot obvious that you could have this connection from much lower in the atmosphere to this hexagon that's brand new just observed higher in the atmosphere it might have been there but just too cold it took the atmosphere heating up\nFor the composite infrared spectrometer to actually see it\nYou may regret using that word communicating because you are higher maybe both of us are going to get emails from people say well what do you mean they're communicating their lives [laughter] no but uh but they certainly are fascinating phenomena\nAbsolutely maybe it's some kind of a wave process that connects those two hexagon maybe it's just one giant too that's connected in some way and so there are lots of puzzles still to solving those data\nAre not going to mention it immediately but this makes me think of\nAt least one of these six papers which as we speak there being published today are actually the press releases coming out today that we'll talk about these six additional papers they haven't quite been published yet we can talk about him because of the shows not going to be heard for a few days\nAnd I want to get into those and I'll take them in the order but ah I saw them in the press release that you shared with me beginning with\nRings scientist that you are some exciting stuff about stuff coming out of the ring ring rain\nIt's just incredible Matt when we flew through this region we didn't know what we'd find so in that first are but we use the high gain antenna as a shield to protect us from bigger rink particles in that region\nAnd as we flew through we used the radio and plasma wave antennas as our particle detectors any little particles that hit these antennas generated electric current and we'd seen that in the inside of this plume in the region closer to the ... and we fly through this region\nAnd nothing [laughter] we don't see any particle hits and then as we look at other day and that was great news for Cassini that meant we were safe we could fly the rest of our twenty two orbits and whatever configuration we wanted to to get the best science\nAnd it turns out those grains are tiny mostly nano grains about the size of smoke particles and so for the first time we could measure their composition\nAnd that's where the rain rain comes in the cosmic dust analyze or as we flew through this region measured the particles and they found that some particles in the ... region or we're probably going into the planet and they were made of water and silica\nBut further away from the equator those particles had gotten charged up they were spiraling along magnetic field lines\nAnd going into Saturn's atmosphere\nAnd that the ring rain that we talk about these tiny icy particles going into different latitudes around Saturn creating the ring rain but there's this other population that we've seen further experiments that go directly into the atmosphere in the Ecuadorian plane from the ring directly into Saturn\nAnd also we're either neutral mass spectrometer that usually measures gases\nThese particles hit so hard 'cause we were going so fast and Seventy five thousand miles per hour that they vaporized and so the island neutral mass spectrometer could measure the vapor and they found that only water but they found ammonia\nCarbon dioxide methane and a whole host of organics all the way out through the full range of the instrument\nIf you had let's see the kind of spectrometer that is a soon going to be headed to Europa Europa Clipper would you ... been able to detect even more complex that is heavier organics\nThat that's very possible Mac because perhaps what we're seeing this organic population are just fragments of bigger molecules that perhaps broke apart\nAnd this instrument is really designed to look at the upper atmosphere have tightened primarily and then once we found the plume on and sell it as\nHe was re purpose both ... and the cosmic dust analyze or looked at the particles in the vapor in the plume and now here's a chance to look at material in this gap so it's possible it it really intriguing up you've got the word yeah great to go back and find out\nThat Linda spilger project scientist for the Cassini ... mission to Saturn more is just a minute away this is planetary radio\nThis is David Dreier the director of space policy here at the

like he was not in to a game\nI mean they ... they showed his face\nAnd ah he's too good you know I go on in the season I thought he was best quarterback in America and uh I still believe that yes but he needs to go out and we need we need to make sure that he has successfully\nSo that means Jake has got to call place\nThat you know little drags across the middle a real quick are quick one to catch him just throw it out there and ... ... bunny rabbits run you know throw high percentage passes Hurley excepted often seen line doesn't have to do great great job because the ball's going\nBut uh you know so it's a combination of making sure he understands what's going on and having success certainly\nOn the other hand if he didn't have success and he gets act a couple of times and that that that the problem force\nYeah yeah absolutely the beginning of the game is absolutely essential you mentioned the\nState game against Purdue and you had one of your guys Adele Williams your former senator from your Ninety three tell me is the old line coach there are at Purdue did you did you think that Ohio State had some glaring weaknesses before Saturday happened or did that surprise you [laughter]\nWell it's surprised me now I think Ohio State was a great team and miss a great line in an age had trouble some people but\nYeah no I never ... that are\nPaying for forty nine points and Ohio State I root for him to pack them yeah and you know it's funny ... it's called me last week oh did he ... he called me and we talked for a long time\nIf I'm not mistaken do you beat Purdue when you were a Bowling Green\n\nFirst time that a no brainer ... ha ha ha and I don't mind telling ya Tony they answer on that hey hey\nHey coach your cell is kind of crap and a little bit uh\nI got that phone I think okay but anyhow yeah ...\nThat's what I thought yeah that was one that was one of your big wins was that a was that a carry coach knew one off on his on their shoulders game\n[noise] bought\nI bet you it was they\nWere really really handy and and the under dog yeah and [noise] yeah that's a you know funny story when when we went up there and play them when can it Curtis ... quarterback yeah hundred thousand\n[laughter]\nJust us\nA coach or your phone unfortunately goats your your phone is a your phone's wagon out on your there are a little bit I Want to let you I'm gonna let you go every self a or a great trip coming back up here hopefully we'll see a Thursday night at the stadium\n\nAnd so you guys are goes hey real quick little note I got a text from somebody that knows that knows these things yeah that that knows the TV part of this pretty well and they tell me this that Fox has the first pick coming up for the November third weekend the Texas West Virginia weekend\nLSU Alabama is another game that we can so I think that that's probably get top billing over West Virginia Texas that night game that's already listed in the evening and eight PM kick CBS for LSU Alabama\nSo it's likely if both West Virginia and Texas were to win this weekend that Fox would grab that with their first pick and install that as a three thirty kick\nOh this is ... three thirty here okay\nNow this is another one of these people that you talk to all people just people in in contact with people various people throughout the week\nI'm Amazed how many of these I mean this is not like last year you didn't have as many people as you were talking to you got to NBA people you talked to yeah you got Las Vegas people you talked to the night you take the pull the cover back I'm now you've got TV programming people to take that you are well you know you as you\nWell know that TV programming stuff has become like calculus\nLike\nGraduate level MIT got it it's impossible to figure out so it's better to just let somebody that knows how to do it tell you what's going to happen\nSo you think lean toward a three thirty\nFox game the the official that I spoke with that understands these things thought that was very likely both when\nA good deal good deal alright\nAre coming up on the program or who's on the Broncos to undergo tomorrow here in our culture and myself here tomorrow you know you're here tomorrow coach hunters here tomorrow coming up\nOn many of these same stations at seven\nOh six this evening we invite you to stay tuned is going to be coach knew Lynn who you just heard there and coach Bob Pruitt the coach knew Lynn ... show coming up on many of these same stations at seven oh sex so what do we have the knife or Monday Night football is it going to be a dog giants and the falcons\nThe okay um it is official now you may have been hearing the or the ... of this during the day I'm Ari Cooper has been traded from\nThe raiders to the Dallas Cowboys

Thompson\nThank you for ...\nMeet somebody uh he he uh not not this week but I'm\nThe good news is the thundering heard defensively has still not allow their first quarter touchdown and ten consecutive games\nIs pretty good goes to play a C. state too so uh\nYou know in in the last week brown baby was defensive player the defensive tackle so I mean we're really solid up front and have really good line backers uh\nWe're we're a good defense to a football team and becoming a good office the football team and our kicker are punter average a ride at forty four yards forty three point six but he I think he has\nThree or four or five inside the inside of the twenty and ... they they just had\nBad bill position whole game the whole first time and a well really the whole ballgame\nSo I think that I go ahead\nHere quarterback you said random ball seven ... times\nYes sir it's a new kid or you know the members of one you solve play against metal he'd have get under the age begins a ways they they did\nSome smart stuff though they do the first ball game but they adjusted their toll on screen past is now under their getting him getting him on target and he's followed the ball much better rather than to read option he's a big boys about six three or six for about two\nThirds no he's not afraid to run the ball and ah so ah he he's really a a field and good for the kid is hurt a probably a couple more weeks four he's back anyway\nWell that yeah yeah hey on that quarterback Enron boy at that puts a lot of pressure on that deep sense\nHats or I'm I'm Glad that that's coming out and given that big big strong back or you can spread 'em out Bob and still have a leading block\nWell they weren't ready for it or you know he uh every time he ran to read I he was in secondary uh uh before I buy testing but there was all it was he got for strike first downs run the ball is the first half\nWow that's terrific\nHere's another step for you I'm Talking about the Alice Thompson quarterback from Marshall\nAh he ran sixteen times he gain Seventy three had a loss of twenty three so we get to keep fifty had a touchdown along of twenty on the ground so he scores on the ground has a run up twenty alone\nOr he was averaging three point one man ... you take away a couple of sex you know maybe that's up there a little bit more ...\nWell I think it started aged are called ... teams sex and not take it away from the people were trying to run the ball in a but he he's he's he's running the office now he's back into a group is going to be a\nA N he's throwing the ball you know like what we thought he could do and ah [noise] ah\nI think he's still got some ground to make up there but uh he he's certainly a a threat for us to know what's the running backs we got her office in line improving the way they have [noise] I like we've got a chance to really have a very very special year\n\n... I've got a got a question for you to Bob knows the answer so I I'm not going to ask him but I Want to get your coaching experience on this so that they use trailing Seventeen is seven was six minutes and twenty four seconds left and the third quarter\nIt is um force and one you're on the Thirteen your Thirteen your on line ... ... what do you do\nYour your kick it into where you get into the when what do you do I can feel go\nNo no you're you're on you're okay you're you're on your own Thirteen yard on out yet coming coming out coach harm coming out yes you're on your own Thirteen year old line for the one you trail is Seventeen southern what are you doing\nI'm going to find a\nLink Kevin decided not to he decided to go forward from his own Thirteen your in line for them one and um he was stopped a kid he uh he and the ball to the sweet no gain marshal the next play gets a touchdown\nWell they do have a team to\nWell when you know ... you don't have many plays in your arsenal that averages which are fun averages and it's too early in the game you know ... not far behind touchdown field goal\nThat they don't uh marshals done scored till the last series you know but it deflated their team is just like punctured a balloon and right you know\nOh sure well I bought her skin reward yeah I mean even if he makes sick he sailed the whole damn field go yeah 'cause he's on his own Thirteen yard line coming out and the only thing that's silly you know how it is\nNow I'm ... I'm ... but uh after the game I was a part of the uh the impromptu a post game\nThe coach kept in a way of talking to some of the other reporters and he was asked why he went for it and he basically and again I'm paraphrasing um put it on the analytics of the situation they they got a car the analytic so whatever\nSituation guard told him it was right to go forward on Fort them you have an ardent uh\nFirst of all I Can't spell our pronounce analytics so I don't know what he's talking about how Burmese Beckley I it's a it's a new one on me I guess\nSome psychologists or somebody's figured out by us so it just takes that you know you always have a car whether you go for two points and all that so I guess it really was whether we go forward on board now say let me tell you what does it make all that was what the guards there you go to\nYou know he does many more like that you do you ever get the same\nThing to say every day [laughter] he'll be selling the guard\nWho am I Know one thing I Wish him back where where do you have to go very they were ... foot tall and um they own was home kind of the site for those guys I guarantee I have hundreds of football well\nEarlier and the ball game they lined up for for sale and and uh like there's going to go for the balls sort out about ... thirty five yard line and the quarterback punted\nSo uh you got a good roll out of it I mean it was a you know a Marshall did have everybody back so\nI I thought maybe that's what they do they come out and bust up a red three tight is as like a it's sort of what we call it a whopper look you know tied into two titans outside I'm also a line\nDrawn into runs a stretch though he lost shortage then the next play we'd go a little screen pass or it is oh oh so the uh [noise] we've got a bunch of people yelling and grain of bugs ... full custody of white\n[laughter] well I learned a long time ago you know for what's the point that for your time\nYou're listening to the ... show here on metro news on your host Paul swam we do take your phone call that eight hundred seven six five talk eight hundred seven six five eight to five five so the thundering heard with a victory now they're off they've got the awful week the mountaineers had Saturday off\nTheir an action will talk about that next plus a crazy weekend and the top twenty five law to shake up we'll get into all of that plus your phone calls will continue on this edition of the ... Bob ... show on metro news\nIn the final days of a big state more rooted summers and John is still in the minds of the prices on\nBreathing grand new food trucks on the ground now in Somerville and the clock is ticking the final days of zero percent for somebody who went fighting is happening\nNow admits the forty summers will do whatever it is still fit more drugs to get into the voting summers village C. amazing deal ... what about for you credible deals like this twenty eight Ford F. one fifty if she'll see super\nNazi of us are being fifty two eighty five right now\nWe're only thirty nine four Ninety four job or Thirteen thousand dollars in total saving obey a little lonely at mid state boards are Bogle wrote in summers bill will do whatever it takes it felt more brand new for drugs to get to vote in ... throw is your best and watch what\nWe'll do for you hearing the final days of trouble for about the road in Somerville seafood WVU dot com [noise]\nWell you know it'd be good for them to come out and started off was a good drive you know what I mean words six seven six seven years that type of deal you're down in there and and moves the football last discouraging for anybody but I\n... I'll be surprised if ... if they don't come out and really a really a show huge improvement of a sudden it's like\nOh I Would think to a yeah that's the kind of drive one of them and a half\nFive six six four to five they don't want him to come out and had a bomb on the first fly our want that to happen or one of them have to earn it in a beat Baylor around a little bit and they use up a little clock\nAnd or the next time we get to do it again I have time anyhow pause to answer your question started the game is important big time for West Virginia\nYou're listening to the ... metro news on your host ... on the phone number eight hundred seven six five talk eight hundred seven six five eight to five five we've got Robert in Charleston checking in go ahead Robert you're on with ...\nOr are you doing coaches\nGrill or are you doing\nAll right uh yeah I think the big draw a lot in the new things and that will be a higher you and marched or what you think about that\nI'm up for [laughter] ... well\nI got news for you know as a high you Marshall\n... it's like a high will say this to yeah we need more teams in our leak because in my opinion you know\nPlaying everybody and then have won a championship game just doesn't make much sense to me\nYou know Oklahoma's lost the game Texas has not they're going to lose just somebody how we can have a log jam and then to the teams got apply for the championship at the end of the year and then they got to play a championship game\nAnd then that makes no sense we need to divisions and\nThey are worried about him I've got it settled did\nI don't believe we need a we've really hit and uh you know I I worry about you know are so high up state getting beat\nHad kinda shocked me a little bit but the union or not to be right in our state you have four undefeated teams or two teams that played a murderer schedule and they've only lost one game\nAnd you know you gotta pick\nWas four teams and that's really really difficult and ah it would be so much better\nIf we had for early in each league had a champion and then those four champions play for the national championship\nBut now we have five in leagues so one lead is only going to be left out\nAnd not as good as the Southeastern Conference is you have a high Georgia or somebody that only loses one game there's a lot of people think they're one of the top four teams and I you know so\nThere was a lot to think about but the big twelve hurts themselves and what you're doing now\nI Believe I could be wrong but I see no dad going reason to play a championship game when you've already played in everybody's played each other hey it could come down a West Virginia and Oklahoma\nLast game of the year plan for the championship and the next week they play again\nA fan makes a lot of some of them was crazy and make a lot of sense to me\nHey Robert you still there 'cause I Want to hear\nDivisions before we let you go yeah I like to have a north\nOf aging like Texas Baylor Oklahoma State Kansas West Virginia and I you know for my feathering be Oklahoma for you that big gate that they are which they mark\n\nHow are you thinking about those guys you like those divisions if um if the big twelve what those two teams in\nMarch I liked the Marshall in there and we've already proof we'd be big world champion\nAre pretty should the phone call thank you sir let's go back to the phone we've got Bob checking in from Morgantown go ahead you're on with ...\nThis is the world the song I Love the word because it yeah 'cause I Want to get I mean what the thing about this hard thing [noise]\nDid he ask what a dock thinking about this or team about who's doing the hurting I say doc thanks you've really got a good football thing\nThey're they're playing really well now a ... he's really please I think he feels like that uh he's got a wakeup call to heal up here a little bit get some people back we're going to recruiting in\nFor re fight it and get after southern miss down in Hattiesburg that ball game in a I think dot dot feels about the way I Do read I think she's got a shot to\nDo with the rest of them are I think it uh\nUh he felt that way going into the year and a ... there was a had a green quarterback with our car got hurt so uh but we ... we rebounded well and I think he's real proud of what they're doing and excited about the way we're playing an opportunity we have to win the conference championship\nHey Bob how how good is so much [noise] they they have in a good year I don't even know\nNo they're they're a but they played a tough ... scheduled they lost the north Texas was the best teams in the league over on the other side played played all over fairly close in a pretty good ball game uh and uh\nSo uh ... one of my former a kid a blight for me in a\nA a southern this is what the two of the water to conference and a three and three overall they've lost re ball games but uh\nUh like the last lose in them and robot point but uh they they play a tough tough schedule they uh they always play too big boys\nAre I appreciate the phone call Bob we're going to take her next break come back and we've got more of your phone
