thousand dollars laid off in three years making Seventy two two hundred\nLives there are done for years growing market three two one well\n\nOh there is not that\nThere's nothing like that wow I think about it I think about it if you had been married three years and you had no payments\n\n... took me a long time to figure this out I wasn't smart enough to figure it out as early as they did well do I wasn't either I'm fifty six\nOh no one in three years it'll be fifty minds on\nYour mind as well you might as well be free you might as well make the decision when are you going to make the decision you're most powerful wealth building tool is your income when you spend the\nAverage car payment which has five hundred and six dollars over eighty four months right now according to national auto Dealers Association when you spend the average car payment\nInstead of spending it on a ... big car cash for your Garza said what rich people do pay cash for your cars is with rich people do I put guys from our cars rich people no darling you will be rich people when you start paying cash for your cars\nUm and that persistence rate and the size of the book business creates a certain amount of cash flow generally speaking the net profit after everyone including the owner that's operating ... a business have been paid the net profit the taxable income of the business\nTimes for or maybe times five is a small business equation on insurance in industry might be different than that I don't know but what what is the net profit if you were running this thing after you pay you a salary\nA support for what I have a God or it's you know and then than\nYou would make three hundred and ten thousand dollars in the first year\nApparently a profit I don't have access to the book yeah profit\nAfter after the rent is paid the secretary is paid every body I parent\nAt their payroll after ... after appointed after insurance I don't know\nWell that's not a bad price on a business if you can pay it all back in two years in\nA war that we can check it out here well if you if you're only paying six fifty four it was sixty five thousand down and you make three\nAnd you live on nothing you pay it all back when I got three ten to ten\nOh okay well then it takes three years yeah All right but uh uh that's that's about what I'm Talking about them and it sounds like it sounds like about four times the net profit because that does not include having paid you\nAnd so there are about four factor that's a fairly normal appraisal Rachel they're not ripping you off on the price of a but I Would not go into to do it I Would start your own\nOkay and then when you go make a bunch of money in your own if you want to add to your own by buying out another practice you could save up the money and do that is if you are making two ten in through every three years you could save up and buy a business is worth six hundred right\nRight and so I mean that's pretty cool we can do that later and add to your book of business by buying out other agencies are buying out other stand alone but I I Can't recommend I personally wouldn't do it if I was twenty five years old and so I was forty five years old or bust veggie burgers or I personally wouldn't do that\nUm I Would start my own and got it out I did that with this business we started on a card table my living room we've never borrowed a dime there's just under eight hundred of us working here an extra two hundred million dollar business in seven buildings\nSo um but we started on a car type on my living room and all

software\nAnd by nights and weekends I work in the film industry mostly doing onset audio on other things to find good for you very cool what kind of that was the thirty two thousand it was mostly student loans but then also a a car loan and car repair\nLoans to auction okay so you a single guy making forty seven thousand pale thirty two thousand and three years which is a you know basically thousand bucks a month give or take during that time average and uh that's the that's really watching what you're doing your most to\nCatch the whole thing yes it was it was a very tight ... when I was a at least at the beginning stages I figured it out that um if if I budgeted everything out and all of just the basic bills in food and gas I had about forty dollars leftover per month wow oh it was it was tied\nUp some extra jobs and that helped but you're over ... got a little bit out of film but some doesn't pay too much of a good deal good deal so three years ago you said you've started financial patient rusty how this whole journey again other than that I'm\nKind of a story well first of all my sister who's here um I did uh did your program in debt free screaming\nBut first heard about you and I was and so I learned some of it by us most is kind of but I also we're like oh that's good enough I got it\nUm which wasn't smart or um so then it was in twenty four teen which is when I moved sixty miles away from home just getting by myself doing apartment a sign a lease everything figured out everything was good and\nI had to move on the seventh of August and the third of August my car broke down completely engine died everything is done wow and so I'm like I Need to move I Need to move now I have no way to get there in a way to get my job when I get there don't know anybody up there\nUm so I was just ran out and bought a car and I end up to that point I'd been\nSmart and only buying a cash or using cash for cars but at this point I was like\nEvery it breaks down in a year I'm tired of holding like Paul ... and I like I was just like that kind of looks nice I'm going to get that one [laughter] I paid too much for it I'm pretty sure and um and so but of course I'd already signed a lease so that was something I hadn't taken into account right and so moved up there and about\nFour months later my that car the engine fry broke down the exact reason that I bought a new car is what happened and so it took out a car repair alone and um because I was like I'm not going to let go this car I just got a four months ago I'm going to keep it\nAnd um so yeah so replaces the engine at that point in time it was like there was I was over drafting it was it was it was bad um and because I wasn't budgeting and um I think I don't know if it was for moving gift or if it was for um\nFor a Christmas gift Courtney gave me a uh the box for financial peace but I was still stubborn I'm so like I put it on my dresser and I'm like I\nI'll probably do that I'll probably get around to sleep in the same room with the box it'll be just going to actually learn it you know by us most is\nAnd um it it didn't I didn't [laughter] so um I was still over drafting and actually it was I Believe it was April twenty Fifteen when she came up just to stay over my parmesan she could fly out of Minneapolis to do or that free scream\nAnd I'm like she knows my situation\nAnd she ... she will see that on open box as you will give me a lot of crap because she knows and I can't have that that's a good sister rules are exactly [laughter] so I'm like before she gets here I'm signing up for a class and that was the motivating factor\nSo I finally got it so I asked her fault [laughter] rightful minimum wage to do her debt free scream you get shamed in the process that causes you to be here to do your debt free sharing Zach Zach I'll take it that work such good family stuff\nRight there and I should say it ends up being a pretty good book into because\nI went out of them got out of debt and this last April and um the singles at my church decided to go on this big trip to Montana and I am I the same vehicle that I got replaced um you know the engine replaced\nIsn't SUB so I'm like I'll get I'll take everybody you know I can put a bunch of stuff in their own I thought I Would uh on I'll take it in for a ... you see with is I take it in for just a quick all change and to not before I go and they say oh you're about to blow a tie rod and some other things that's about a thousand bucks in his mind okay thanks\nAnd so I just do that and then I go on to the Montana trip come back and\nCame back in ... and uh my Lehman was also all of the\nTires were were just shredded and there are other things wrong so in a five week period I had twenty three hundred dollars with a hari
