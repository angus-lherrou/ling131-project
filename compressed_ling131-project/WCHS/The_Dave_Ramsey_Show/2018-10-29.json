David Price\nOn short rash who would have thought a couple of weeks ago maybe he's at the front of the parade if they get this thing after all the disappointments he's had in the playoffs how big is this opportunity for price to clinch a second straight series including the world series\nHe's only boy screaming well and you know this whole transformation of the post season a history of the performers whatever might be goes back to the post season of last year where he came out of the bullpen a couple of times he was really effective and quite frankly dominant against the Houston Astros\nYou had a rough outing him against the Yankees in this first postseason series and the divisional series but you know you go back to the bullpen session in Houston\nWhen he was warming up and ended up starting the next day he says he found something with this change up in that pitch really has become not only a weapon but a difference maker in October here a couple of times out ago it was Fifteen for strikes twelve for swing and miss\nSo he's added a lot more depth to it he's added more velocity separation while maintaining that arm speed and really deception that goes along with it but one thing we ... we haven't seen he's pitching on short rushed he relieved in between he got loose twice last night so\nFrom just a physical workload he's doing some things that are very uncommon in post season\nAnd that leads you to question who will come in after price Christian Bale uh we thought might start game five now he's going to be game six we don't know the shoulder that he had toward the end of the season the stomach issues he had in the league championship series you see any scenario in which we see Chris fail tonight\nPersonally I don't I Believe they are trying to give every\nAdditional day of rest across the aisle as possible they had to really\nHandle him with kid gloves throughout September and October so additional days arrest or prescribed certainly they're going to say he's available in the bullpen but I think that's as much gamesmanship\nAnd not tipping your hand as as anything but uh I wouldn't be surprised report cello finds himself down the bullpen tonight David Price did it on as normal side day I'm sure a poor sell all will be available have all the\nI Would be shocked if he were available tonight but you love what you're hearing coming out of the clubhouse in Boston everyone is saying they're available to pitch\nMaybe unlike across the field were guys are saying they weren't available by as being one of them so there's to me a completely different mindset that has been emerging out of each other to climb houses\nESPN baseball analyst John Farrell joining us in Studio is we get set for game five of the world series former Red Sox and

giants for these Red Sox in the playoffs he goes on short rest didn't like\nWhat would be better for David Rice obviously these last couple of appearances have improved he found something in

Senate he said it in an interview in September that he understood that he could win thirty five games and the regular season but if he didn't get it done in the postseason all those questions which

changeup\nHas been a crucial pitch for him it made while on the other side he gave one way for shah got knocked around the red Sox admittedly for hunting the slider\nThe pitch ... first shot his elite

the day you start listening\nA Ninety five you're starting to office of woman who had been defensive lineman earlier in the week I think\nIt was when I was we know about the Bolger injury in his senior season but\nIt is a coach I mean what do you do with injuries I mean you love to say next guy up go play but in reality it is that is that fair\nWell you know that's that's the problem with football hay in eighty four we were whale of a football team is it is that the year we played in a blue bonnet yep\nExactly last year last three regular season games because I think he had me playing defense [laughter]\nWe had nobody to play it was a it was unbelievable we'd been Penn State and Boston College back to back is that correct yeah you're right I remember a time when I'm Marianne I wasn't home with me and she's all jacked up and she says what's wrong with you\nHigh says we won the game but we lost the war\nI said we got nobody left\nBut we got them all back for the ball game and kicked the crap out of a TCU and TCU coach told me says done\nHere the by far the best team we've played all year and a ... that team could have really been special had it not for injuries now I don't I don't know if we have any major injuries on our team at least I haven't heard of him in a\nYou know we got a two day advantage we played Thursday in Texas played Saturday Night they probably didn't get home until four in the morning and uh I saw a lot of their guy being carried off too\nSo I guarantee they got some bumps and bruises\nWe got bumps and bruises but you know there there's a difference between a bumper brews in an injury and good football players have got to play through bumps and bruises that's part of the game\nAnd that's especially true as we get down to the stretch run here and you mentioned it and I agree with you I've been saying the same thing since last year\nThis is the opportunity for West Virginia to get to the big twelve title game is in front of it now you've got a couple of significant hurdles namely in Texas and Oklahoma now if you look at how Oklahoma State played maybe they're starting to figure things out as well but I think this one is so interesting to me coach just because what we're talking about medical\nStylistically this Texas team seems like it could be a little different than some of these other teams West Virginia's played we know West Virginia's built from ... speed and size standpoint to go against somebody spread all fences but if someone wants to line up and run straight out um that's something that they haven't been tested with yet\nNo a Kansas State was probably the first one to withdraw tried that\nAnd uh at that time they were they were searching for quarterback but just quarterback is two hundred and thirty five pounds so he's he's a different cat and ah\nYou know where they think the ball like they're going to run off tackle and then he goes flying up the middle that's a tough played a\nTough place to handle and a ... for a second you're not sure who has the ball\nAnd uh that split second can really help the off chance but uh like I say it's away from home and we have to control that crowd or a little bit\nYou know when Baylor came here and I know we screwed up and miss those first couple\nField goals but once that crowd gets into the game it's really tough on the visiting team but ah\nIf we're Brett I'm went to a little secret guy go we're listening if we are going into the fourth quarter plus or minus one touched down when whole\nAlright say that again going into the fourth quarter yeah either up touchdown or down just a touchdown West Virginia ... yeah\nThat's my opinion about that okay All right we'll write that down will write that down a like\nA good good early protection from the couch I tell you what we're gonna let you go here you go rest up you've got your show coming up this evening seven oh sticks on many of these same stations that people want to get in touch and called eight hundred seven six five eight to five five you got plenty more to talk about about the Baylor game and the Texas game coming up and we'll talk to you again next week okay\nOkay bred say All right thanks coach various coach Neal and checking in how 'bout that it gives you a production to\nAll ... up or down and watched down going into fourth West Virginia winters we have a lot of people who give us production is on the show I Will remember that [laughter] but when the when the ...\nSame reacts you got ... ... email us in there I Will I Do find that fascinating because of all the the injuries West Virginia has sustained especially with the linebacker position\nIt would seem to me that's got to be Texas's plant is lined up and say okay if you're going to bring Giovanni steward at me at a hundred and eighty five pounds that I'm going to try and run right at you with power and what will West Virginia's be response to that that's going to be the key question the huge\nAbsolutely a major I mean that's why your defense of one's got to be able to stand up and take care of the brute up front for Texas in at least keep them off your your small linebackers\nAnd score points that right when you have the ball offensively if you can get out to a fast start and get some points on the borders you saw\nAs you saw Saturday Night Oklahoma State did that they came out of the gate so fast that it changed Texas's game plan I'm with coach I I don't think they go into a game wanting Sam Eleanor to throw at forty two times during the game that can't be what they want to do and you saw the results\nAre should be fascinating plenty more this week to get into regarding West Virginia Texas coming up this weekend thanks Nathan Baird Lafayette journal and career for joining us talking a little hoops and of course\nNext to coach knew him as well another reminder his show coming up\nFollowing us seven six tonight many of these same stations eight hundred seven

I have to worry too much because if you win our release when the majority here you're going to be set you're going to be okay\nOh yeah hey if we went out we are going to play for the championship yeah probably against Oklahoma play um two weeks that are oh how's that sound\nI'm sure the TV or people will definitely love that\nYou know I don't know if I Do plan to same day going team two weeks in a

we have now we have Oklahoma at night yeah on the Friday after\nThanksgiving in or if you go back and look at our record over the years we haven't lost many night games especially when they really meant something so\nThat'll be a hard ticket\nYeah Oklahoma was going to have to be day going good to to beat is if a if we're sitting there playing for the championship\nCoach for the the game for the championship we played a little closer to Oklahoma than West Virginia it will be in Arlington, Texas a TNT stadium\nThat that's pretty close to ...\nThey should have a good crowd if if they get to that though to that point so ah they'll definitely a have a crowd advantage well then again you know about ... travels so\nWho knows what will happen I Would be pretty excited if uh\nIt was the championship game between those two teams and are really you have to point him twice but why not I mean I don't know of another way right now you can you can make this a better situation and the big twelve ... you've\nYou're playing the championship game I don't know if you necessarily need to but you're playing a championship game\n... ... two teams in the league at two divisions and you don't have to play\nThe same team two weeks in a row I think the\nTeam wins the first game probably is a little bit of a disadvantage going into the second game or when you're playing that close together and if we had two\nTwo more teams and we had two divisions six teams in the league in that division and those two winners would play for the championship of our league\nAnd they a little different\nAnd now we've gone over this before but are they are really two teams out there unless you're raiding the bigger leagues that\nReally add something to the big twelve and I know this is going to be more of a football problem than all the other sports with the uh two additional teams but I just don't know if there's another team out there other than ... from another major league\nThat adds to the big twelve right now so I don't know if it's a subtraction by edition\nOr I agree I don't know that either the two that everybody pops up is used and BYU but I I don't have any idea if\nIf uh you know if Texas and\nIn TCU and Texas Tech would be excited about Houston coming in our league so you know we we may which isn't just fine I'm just saying if I coached I wouldn't want to play the same team two weeks in a row\nThat's all I'm saying and what the heck my opinion doesn't mean that the egg on thing anyhow\nNow that's not true that's not true if you want to talk to the two coaches
