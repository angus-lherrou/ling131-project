I think that that's that's the that's in the hold and we just got up there but I think there are specific packages for both Trayvon west go and Giovanni Haskins that they haven't used yet\nAnd we haven't seen much doubled tight we know that's in their cars you did see it against Tennessee at times that that hasn't been in there I I think that would be I think that would be outrageous to think that we have seen all of the plays unveiled at this point because they haven't needed and why would you show all that right now when you haven't needed it even remotely\nSo yeah I'm a ... from the titans through for ... to a game you're not going to win your bed at thirty five you don't know that because that ... that Haskins package if you give them a dozen catches the [laughter] but I sort of think this is\nPretty close to what I thought it would be because again you\nGot me in the waiting lives out there do they said thirty five I had bright eyed guy had an\nArea where it's been trying to read into some of the comment I literally asked them Jake will they will they catch the oh yeah thirty five thirty five by both of them oh yeah yeah you're having another year he maybe he intended that\nTo to help him out a little bit that you're having another unbelievable year with your receivers out just like last year we sat here and said well who the regime has got it and you didn't need backups last year he had four guys that were just outstanding you're doing it again this year you just have it needed them\nYou're going to get twenty five to thirty catches up to your tied into position that as an add more than ten and a decade I think you get that that's fine\nI think the senator made a good point that they don't need them\nI think had the receiver have if the receivers weren't as productive as they have banned then they would have probably said okay let's start on roe laws all throughout the throughout the whole little bit to the ... but markets Sims\nHis emergence obese I think just like why do why do we need to do that we've got to get away twenty four guy with twenty three and a guy with twenty two if I'm not mistaken feed them all on the line so\nThat's what the early ... forty closer I Know we're out of time a source close to the Martin's were program saying it's a foot injury at this point for grant them foot injury ... watch the scores real\nTime all night long at W.

fell on hard times how exciting is it to be a polka dot than right now we look across the way we got here like two hours ago and there were already fans here from poke at they are very excited about this football team moving forward\nYou know you talk about a perennial power house in the Nineteen eighties that was the wind field generals they have tried to rebuild themselves as well and then I

the quarterback runs out of the pistol and\nWhistle blows and the snap came back\nIt was between the two guys who were I\nWas a false start against Winfield so that'll back them up\nFive yards that was\nPoker was hoping that get that while he was gonna say 'cause that ball rocketed right between the two bags and\nIt's worth the end zone\nModify them in these genes in some way right\nThe updated
