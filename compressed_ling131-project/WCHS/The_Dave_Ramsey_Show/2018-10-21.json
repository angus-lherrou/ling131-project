buying as well but it seems like a trend um that you know you're looking at the models and\nIt's kind of successful I mean the red Sox to an extent you know are able to do it whether it's moving\nLike we're talking about ... vets into the infield\nDo one on the way basketball in a gamble three\nBut not as much obviously is what we see what the cubs what we see what the Dodgers this year what we see

Virginia so now you're saying if you take a rain\nOr snow out as far as well as to it is now one final thing I Know you're busy but a lot of people don't know what's happening across from the stadium right now if you go to Carl Walker construction and look at our website so they'll talk about Morgantown and they talk about the stadium garage project\nAnd on the corner of the country or in the corner of uh what is it that way I view and on the in the old country club trailer park they're building a large parking garage now is the hard\nLessons I view it as a stadium garage project but I don't know if it's going to be ready by the strip temper October but they're working on it now\nAnd I could see that being a great tailgate spot at the top of that garage with banners hanging over the garage I think it's going to answer the first was much needed parking and it's going to end the whole ambience of the of the gate area where they think about that\nGreat yeah I mean I I don't know all the particulars on how I mean potentially may not be available for\nFootball games hospital may continue to control that use that for for their part I don't know they but you're right it would be nice\nOr at least on the top level or the new new places the the um mid levels are never retail game spots and you've got nothing but concrete around you but you know top level could be nice but it's just I mean again if it helps the parking\nFor the football that's great but\nAnybody who's dealt with parking around the hospital knows how bad badly needed that is I mean they've got out of sight biking parking where people are gonna wait thirty minutes to get your boss to get them who work there you get the parking lot you know way off site so hopefully\nWill will help the hospital and ultimately maybe the football program no\nAbsolutely not appreciate the call let's grab one more before the break loose from Ripley next up real little welcome and thank\nGod I'm looking for a\nMountain near the I'll be coming up for the Bangor games ... matter of fact it will be halfway up their own valid you are getting and everything else you got to do the clock at a little bit up there and get a little warm up serve that way [laughter]\nI I don't know I think it's going to be OK during the day I think to be in the mid fifties during the day but it's going to drop down into the mid to upper\nThrough mid thirties getting time\n... so I mean you could be worse I was watching some of Wisconsin and uh was Illinois Illinois no yeah it was known to be banned demand now that's what's\nGonna happen I think that a\nCouple of not want to add a couple of things I Know I was at camp in a year or something and it may be out of it at all fifty minutes I'm not a real concern\nMe a little bit and of course I Love wheel and uh you know I just I think the world I mean that you know I was talking about why are they not throwing the ball\nAnd he's on the ball and you know when you have a lot of people and talking to my reading all the way he didn't want to make\nThat well\nI'm a call ...\n... when we got a game and so that got me and the other thing I Know that\nIs we noticed that when the bringing it back up and I've noticed from are getting killed it is uh is he called the all the ball and run or I'm\nNot that\nWell we talked a little bit about that this week in terms of you know I I Do think much of the early part of the season he was advised not to run the football uh on any kind of read auction stuff so I Do think he against Kansas he did it a couple of times a day with a little success but I I think he's you get leader in the season\nIs that presented itself I think he's got to start to take that again you not ten times again\nYou know he's not ... that way he's not even just got a house but if it's wide open and had indiscretion you set the ability to to run with it there yeah I I Do think he he does have to take it a you know I I really doubt if it's ... bother will agree or not was reasons issues and actually I think\nThe two games sort of go hand in hand because they were ... I don't think Kansas he was um\nYou know holding on to the mall too long he's probably getting rid of it a little bit too quick it in just a Sunni more senior forcing because people are open and that led to the three interceptions Indians on so I think because of that maybe he was a little bit more cautious\nAgainst Iowa State and didn't want to force stuff as much and again probably come somewhat natural but\nAlso if you if you see will West Virginia or throughout his career you know that he's been a plate maker because he's been able to scramble around hang on to the football for a long time\nLet somebody come open and then make a big place you that and it's worked for him so often I think that's natural for him and he's probably got a break a little bit of that have you don't want to take\n'em that completely out of it because that's that's often worked really really well but I Do think at times he's got to realize okay I held onto it long enough nothing's working let's throw this one way in the Clinton today\nWell one thing I noticed all bugging we're up against the break your top of the hour more checks coming in more phone calls coming in we're an hour an hour to go
