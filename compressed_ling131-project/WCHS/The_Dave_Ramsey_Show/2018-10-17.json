{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "Yes sir you see what I'm saying so that is a bargain and are they not they furnish liked ah towers in oil and stuff to ... ...\nIs a gas even furnished and that they can't remember no no no [laughter] there's one on one of the car manufacturers have emerged but it's it's ... it's ... it's all the maintenance and the tires though\nRight everything is the insurance and that to ya author see that's the deal of deal I mean you can't buy the tires and the insurance for three thousand dollars a year\nAfter but that's not a leash that's not like a standard okay they call it a leash but it's more of an Employee Benefit in other words BMW is losing money\nOn this transaction with you to your benefit because you're an employee it's an employee benefits either and they want their employees driving one of their fine automobiles and you guys do make a fine automobile\nSo it gets there yeah and I if I remember ... you have what a selection that for that is that the price of a certain car or is that the price of a car up to a certain amount in a life of a certain car okay the one that you liked or whatever yeah okay All right we'll do it's a deal\nI mean seriously you know you can't hardly buy insurance for that\nGot much less the tires and maintenance much less all about the loss in value but that's different than Joe walking off the street and leasing that car which he did it probably seven hundred dollars a month\nOkay you know and that would not be a good deal he should maybe by a BMW if he's got a lot of money and pay cash for it because it's a good car but you're you're getting an employee\nBenefit and it's a sweet deal for you I Would definitely do that if I worked for ... it's a bargain it's a great deal and are there are several of the car manufacturers that have really good deals for their employees but you just kind of have to think about it of if I was driving\nMe around ten thousand dollar car man you can't do that for three thousand dollars a year with what we're talking about here\nAnd you're certainly not driving up ten thousand dollar car what we're describing your probably driving a forty thousand dollar car so a good question thank you for calling in and um again it was a great deal appreciate your joining us\nAmy is on Twitter at day Ramsey is there an item or items that you refuse to pay for or by even though you could afford it now\nYeah sure I can\nAfford most anything I Want to do nowadays I mean not anything but most anything and some\nThings just feel weird to me I feel I just don't want to have that invested in that um I've got a friend that's worth um tens of millions of dollars and he's a watch guy and he bought a um\nA hundred and fifty thousand dollar watch which sounds just nuts but I mean he's got like ... million dollars that's a it's like most people ... okay I can afford to do that it just I just I don't know it's not me number one and and I um I I might spend that on a boat [laughter]\nBut not on a watch\nSo I mean you know it is just being authentic with you you know but uh\nUh so the boats bigger than watch\nThe second one [laughter] so you know it just\nIt's something that gets me funny but it's not really a value Judgement to say that my point is is that I'm not mad at him for spending that much he's got two hundred million dollars\nAnd if he spends a hundred and fifty grand watches nothing okay that guy's got plenty of money it's like most people bought a biscuit he gives away his his generosity dinners artist huge he helps lots and lots of hurting people and that's a very very small percentage of his world but emotionally I have trouble\nEven though intellectually I can get there and I'm not judging him emotionally yeah I I Would struggle doing that um but that doesn't mean it's wrong to do it just 'cause I Can't grasp it\nAh emotionally it it would be wrong to do it if it's a high percentage of his world and that's why we tell people like on your cars and stuff don't get into a high percentage of your\nYou know your your financial world where you've got you know you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year and you've got eighty thousand or for the cars well that's just stupid\nThat how can make a value Judgement on that that's not emotions just mathematically dumb but when something is a small percentage of your world there are still some things that emotionally you just don't feel right about but it doesn't mean that it's a more immoral for someone else to do it as my point\nAnd so and really a lot of you could learn that lesson 'cause some people judge other people because they can't emotionally\nGrasped that and just because you can't emotionally grasped something doesn't mean it's morally wrong there's a difference here and so anyway that's a good question I talk about a lot of that kind of stuff in the legacy journey book and only books I've ever written about well

welcome to the ...\n... thank you for taking my call sure what's up well\nOne I did at my company back when I Would call it a pool and really work hard for a long time and I got married well one of her personality traits that I fell in love with and I do love well\nUntil recently is ... ... and ... well that's how I mean why at any time he's the guy that goes over\nOn the highway to help her couldn't pay the higher [noise] um so he he's an amazing man\nHow long have you been a long have you been married\nOh what was that calibrated nine years and may okay [laughter] problem I'm having is I Can't I I I fell into the trap of saying well day for him he said they ran the fed 'em so now I'm not allowed to say your name or\nHer now I call you Voldemort [laughter] I don't work at these because he says you know you're in a with a lot of the house mhm site called the whole Harry Potter and get out and call your Baltimore and I do that whenever 'cause he's a big business guy\nMhm mhm well I guess you could talk to the Y. and asked them if you could split revenues with them or something like that in order to use their stuff\nUm a lot of was do that with personal trainers and in a sense this is a type of personal training I mean I guess if you're holding up I I Would suspect some of the yoga teachers or the aerobics teachers or whatever at the Y. probably just do a split revenue deal don't they\nOkay I I Would I don't I just want to be contract or I didn't want to be owned by the Y. and now I was\nThere that you're just you're just a teacher right now and what you get in there and you you work out all the kinks out of your system and you learn how to do it any developer reputation with people\nI but I and they may not let you necessarily have a business name on this they may just pay you as a teacher there at the Y. for right now but that'll get some income coming in and get you\nIn the field actually doing this and then the next step would be that you could actually rent\nPart time someone else's gym to do this with or part time\nSomeone else's ball fields to do this way up and you know you can you can start there if you want if you got the money if you got a little bit of cash\nNow I Know I'm starting from scratch and ethically and plan that I had that dream age for the longest time and now that I've had I can I can hear our cats empowered I'm ... right and you know where to go hat in art\nI think I might make some money kind of almost as a side job doing this exact thing at the Y. or at some place like a why first and as I said then you get the kinks out of your teaching methods and all that kind of stepped in the next step is\nYou take that cash and that gives you the ability to rent the gym or rent the ball field on a per day basis but right now let's say you go rent a ball field and and you can't get anybody to sign up for your course\nOh my gosh you just lost all that money oh wait a minute you don't have any money oh my gosh you just got into that no we don't want her that\nShe that that's what I'm trying to avoid so let's create a little bit of money while learning a few things about how to talk to people how to teach people how to coach people and prove out some of your ah dreams and your theories that you've got here by just poking around on under somebody else a roof a little bit and then uh\nThen we got a little bit of cash or we can go rent the ball field or rent the Jim Bob a day\nFor a little while and then um you know that way will break you if you don't get clients right off the bat ah when I started financial peace University Our a office building allowed us the people that were tenants in the office building they had a common conference room that you could book\nDoesn't cost anything but you had to book it and you couldn't just keep it book you had to just look at you know for a meeting you can you know other people go in there you should've meetings and he'll like a hundred and thirty people as a nice size little conference room and all meeting room kind of thing tables that moved around and all of that that's where a financial peace\nUniversity started is in that little conference room and I'm pretty cool if you think about it and\nSo but I had just book it as a part of renting the little office that I was in and show but it wasn't really my meeting room it was the office buildings meeting room\nAnd you could just use it and so I booked it in the evening and then I looked at and another evening and I looked at another evening and then I was looking at so much they asked me to start paying a little bit and then I started paying a little bit but I had a lot of classes going by them but I just the first night I did that for people\nCame thank goodness I didn't rent that thing for the month and therefore people come\nGoes we would have probably gone out of business that month [laughter] so that's what I'm saying it's OK to start it on a very piecemeal basis and started on the cheap\nThere's nothing wrong with that at all I'm really proud of you can do this ... or don't do it do do it it's time to do it it's time to get off the dream and move into the actual action go

SAC rankings are out for a look at those what's had across town to our state Britain studios where we are joined by job or cottage oh good evening welcome in\nGood evening Brett how are you good buddy already jammed up I didn't leave as much time as I had planned so let's just dive right in once you start with a triple A. give us some of the things that anything that jumped out at you with the newest rankings\nWill still looking forward to seeing how the top will shake out Martin's burden currently a number one Muslim into currently a number three those two teams will meet next week or so one of those teams you can be certain is going to be in the top two seasons and spring valley number two\nIf they went out which includes a match up in a week eleven against Huntington vacant stake a claim but the top two are at the bottom of AAA Morgantown still currently in Eighteenth needs at least one ... may need to win to get into the field at sixteen\nAlright as you go to double A. we've had a change in those rankings at the top\nYeah we uh seemed Bluefield fall back a little bit after they suffered their first laws to lower voted toward out of Virginia so the beavers now sitting at five months and you can practically put them in and sharpen your number one there'll be heavily favored to win their last two games against\nA grafting and against each Fairmont poker at number two now they had a a tough injury with other leading Russia eaten pain being lost in the season with a hip injury but the doctor now number two and it's going to be good battle with them and Nicholas county to potentially be two or three Bridgeport still in the mix the number four\nIs the feeling that Bluefield will work its way back into that number to spot by the end of the regular season\nA little bit they they've got a chance to do that are taking on oak hill in oak hill team that is six and one just like Bluefield in\nThis Friday ed Mitchell stadium so they can probably probably climbed back into the top for if they went out and finished nine and one or you could potentially have a great semi are great quarter final matchup between Bridgeport of Bluefield a four or five what wins a\nSingle ... did you think of significance as you look at the bottom of single lay and there was a lot of teams that are still hovering around the five hundred mark that could still probably find their way in a right now target values on the outside looking in their foreign three but still very much in the mix\nAnd after then you've got a Webster county team that's ... that's Eighteen a stack of four and three teams so it was six when team\nCould possibly find their way in in class say at the top ... view and willing central still now tied at the top middling trail camera Dodgers county Parkersburg Catholic\nA number of undefeated teams trying to get into the top for you probably have to figure that feeling central in Mountain View both went out there are going to be the one in the two because they have such a huge\nA bonus point lead at this point but the battle for three and four and a chance to potentially hosts too playoff games should be pretty intense\nAll right
