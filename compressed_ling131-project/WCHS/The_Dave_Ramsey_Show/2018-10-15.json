have that I Know a lot of people wanted it to be a more broad I Would have liked to have started earlier and had a two more broad but it was a good investigation I think we're in a better place than

certainly in the set up we're concerned about the investigation making sure that continues\nBut House Republicans have taken a little different position publicly uh but the Senate great for the Senate or a intel committee as active in a bipartisan fashion to make sure that we move forward the Bob Mueller concludes his investigation on his timing not ours\nUh so I I think that to Republicans need to

giant Magellan telescope has already gone on a mountaintop above chilies oughta comma desert\nIn honor of astronomy day on October thirteenth I sat down once again with Patrick McCarthy vice president for operations and external relations at the giant Magellan telescope organization headquarters in Pasadena, California Patrick I Want to welcome you back\nRadio but really I should be thinking you for hosting us again at the new headquarters of the of the gym Tio the giant Magellan telescope organization\nWell technically we're just a gym Tio corporation so for now we're using organization but we're looking forward to the time when it's a giant Magellan telescope observatory I Love that\nYou have twelve partners yeah in this project really impressive yeah we're very happy to have Arizona State is our new partner it's nice to have the whole state of Arizona on board\nBut Arizona states are real up and coming powerhouse particularly and planetary science was the new Center for space and science exploration of they're doing this asteroid return mission lotta fascinating stuff going on there you said all of Arizona because you've got the University of Arizona as well right that's correct still cracking up those mirrors\nAbsolutely an cranking is that right work is really going fast now sometimes you spend a lot of time thinking and preparing and testing and learning and then it all clicks\nAnd we're happy to say that on mirror number two they're going much faster than they expected it's really going outstanding they well so I think they've really made a breakthrough in the polishing of these off access mirrors using state of the art computer controlled polishing and they can really converge much faster now so we're excited\nWe're back with the only work going on in the mirror lab now they're working on mirrors number two three four and five and we had to move where one out of the lab just to make space and as soon as to is done early next year it's going out of the lab as well to make space for more work so we're working twenty four seven there at the lab and they're just\nThey're hidden in the park so these are all in the polishing process\nWhat's happening are you still has spinning a glass to uh\nGive them their basic shape right well we did the last spin in November of twenty Seventeen from your number five and the problem right now is if we made another mirror we don't have room to even take it off the floor uh-huh we've really got to work through other parts of the production line it's like a\nA a an assembly line and you can't keep putting things on\nThe input side until you have them rolling off the finish line and we're getting close not a rolling off we're number two and then we can think about the others the good news is we have all the glass from your number six in a warehouse in Tucson and all the classroom or number seven and so we've got everything we need to keep finishing all them years\nI'm kind of charmed by this thought of a of an assembly line for some of the biggest mirrors big pieces of glass ever made maybe that will ever be made\nI think in our lifetime they may be the biggest pieces of optical glass ever made but you hit on his point when you think assembly line you don't necessarily think precision but that these are these are large but still very precise optics\nAs I'd like to say as you get closer to the end you spend much less time polishing and much more time thinking and sinking in assembly line don't go together but in fact is this still the same linear process where you work on multiple marriages at a time it's just at the end it becomes a little bit of art and not entirely science\nFor anybody in the audience who may not have heard and our previous conversations or maybe the GMT is new to them you mentioned that these mirrors except for one of them\nThey're off center what what did you mean by that and why is that so key to the design of this telescope right the ideas we'd love to just make one giant mirror twenty five meters in diameter but we don't think we can make that\nAnd even if we could how would you ever get it to the mountain top ... you know it would probably fracture under its own way if you try to lift it it'd be very difficult to transport\nSo what we do is we take this parent surface it's a ... meter diameter\n... roughly it kind of cut it out like with biscuit cutters around the edge to make it out of seven smaller mirrors\nAs a result is all them years except the one in the middle or off on the curves size of the bowl and so they have their center of symmetry their access not only off center from that piece of glass but actually outside the piece of glass itself so they have this funding off access shape it's kind of like the shape of a potato chip that it's got a satellite structure\nAnd the challenge then is how do you polish this off access structure to the precision you need for an optical instrument would normally we polish optics by rotating them and using their natural symmetry so we had on learn a lot of things and learn a lot of new things um but as I say we think we have a handle on it now and we're on our second near\nThat this just a very short period of time away from meeting all of this ...\nHow long does it take from the time you pour the glass in that spinning up and to the time you have a a finished mirror or actually\nI guess because you are now getting better at it how long do you think it will take you start to finish for them to come right it it takes about four to five years but you made a very interesting statements that kind of reflects a bit of history don't actually poor little glass into the mold which is how it used to be done right for the ...\nThey would melt the glass in the big furnace laid it out and they had these people in these you know flash suits and flame protectors\nPushing this ... this later molten glass over to pour it in the mold and then go get another one um it turns out that has its limitations and you couldn't make and ate meat or me or that way so we put the glass in the mold while there's still room temperature and melted into place T breakthrough I miss stated\nBecause there is a great image on the website which we will linked to from this week's show paycheck planetary dot org slash radio which has like three guys on a platform and they're looking down at all these beautiful chunks of optical glass\nYes ... is it twenty times of glass handmade in Japan in small batches in these clay pots and then broken up inspected and then loaded in roughly five pound pieces into the ... and that takes a couple of days\nSo to go back to your bigger question how long does it take it takes about four or five years because the first step of\nOf building the mold takes the better part of a year\nMelting the glass doesn't take long but it needs about five months to Neal has to cool slowly so you don't build strange into the glass then there's a fair amount of handling and cleaning and inspection preparing the back surface which has to be very smooth to relieve stress is attaching a bunch of hardware that takes another year\nAnd then when you're ready to start working on the near side the front part that really matters that takes about two years there's about six or eight months of grinding the rough shape some measuring and then the actual polishing figuring in that policy and figuring takes about Eighteen months\nAnd mostly because as you get closer and closer you spend time thinking more about where to rub on the glass because there's and the founder of the mirror lab likes to say professor Roger Angell it's easy to take glass off we know how to put it back on [laughter] so you go slow that's like Michelangelo sculpting a piece of marble exactly\nTicks down to ... to the ... desert talk about what's going on there yeah you're moving earth yes we're finally I'm making some real progress on\nBuilding the observatory is just preparing the infrastructure so in twenty twelve after many years of testing and building on decades of experience Alaskan upon us we level the top of the mountain to produce the platform for the observatory\nWe spent some time doing geotechnical testing where you drill deep core samples you send those out for analysis to make sure the rock is solid that we understand its properties\nWe did a little more testing of the atmosphere but earlier this year about July we started the excavation both for the telescope itself or the telescope fear the concrete pure that it will sit on and the foundations for the enclosure that would protect the telescope during the day\nAnd this is a pretty difficult work because by taking off the top ... meters of the mountains there's nothing there but solid rock and so you've got to break that rock up\nAnd dig in essence a pit that's about three meters deep with very clean walls and then we need to dig an annual is for the enclosure it's about two to three meters deep and several meters wide so they're making great progress up there\nAnd from my point view one of the really nice things is they're not using any explosives dynamite nothing that could put\nFractures into the wrong could basically you know we can the overall structural integrity of the underlying mountain they're doing it all with hammers pneumatic drills somewhat slow fashion but very delicate and careful but there'll be done by about the end of this year and they only started in July so it's really going along at a great pace\nParty willing island get that feeling feeling of what he's saying we get the kneeling feeling right now\nJoining us head coach America's hall of famer Don Neal agreement to coach or a bread I Do and brother how are you coaches Tony and Brad surprised you\nOh right yeah yeah well that's a big shot\nWhen [laughter] I Know you just got a shot I don't know if you've got a big show art by man well\nWhat you see what happens you come back and well\nYeah yeah I Know I don't know I just stayed with you and I ... we had it all under control bread you you got a man you got a\nSolid point they coach ...\nYear at this game a long long time so you've been at the highest of the high points along at an event at the lowest of low points put something into perspective here forests wide games like\nSaturday happen at times\nWhere you know first of all I Wish I knew that exactly but I Know one thing normally it will happen\nAnd when that happens I you know for example against Kansas where you are not very good but it's like Kansas and they were pretty vague on fast and so playing not very well\nIt can cost us now this week we didn't play horse nickel and we played it said that uh I think is on the rise I think they get something going for him and his quarterback they have\nA lower ... they found in but they got a gym and looks like and Tony it I thought office of lead that's the course game I've seen I've seen this play for a long long time\nI totally I totally agree with your coaches statistically nothing went right when you're in those kinds of situations and again like I said you were there a couple of times not often but you were there were a couple of times you\nHave a helpless feeling well you know first of all we got a heck of a good football team they gotta they gotta make sure\nThat he lets them know hey we all still love you and your ... what good football team for good\nOr better than that let's go play ball\nAnd a because there's really not much for a million that you can say oh if you want to get up in front of 'em and rant and rave and all that crap or you can but that's not the answer in my opinion and uh you know you look\nPros um\nEvery now and then the Steelers look like and the gum you wonder why they do\nAnd uh you know yeah coach basketball team some nights at ball won't go in for craft but I'm like I don't think there's anything wrong with our team I was disappointed telling me\nThat we did not tax at five one there are a little better you know they did a good job of\nRussian us once in a while and then faith in a rush rush and straight guys and dropping a five wandering the streets deep and how many times do we run that stupid drop play on a\n... you know yeah so I met her\nCoach when you say attack that five under are you thinking across the middle then if they're dropping a bunch of guys bringing the other ones you thinking the middle is what's exposed when you do that defensively\nWhen you ... you know first of all you got to make a decision if you're going to throw the football you know you don't want to make a mistake\nSo yep the ball and somebody's hands and let him run with it and take your seven eight or nine and it's been a little more on that and find today going football player was your defense of what she don't want to do is try to force the ball\nAnd they pick it off what's the best place that's fraud is in between those linebackers you because you can look them off and throw the ball in the middle and the other thing for that is running a golf cart\nHell got five guys running backwards and you've got one guy on an Adam and nobody can tackle anymore\nWe can't tackle [laughter] I'm Serious [laughter]\nI've never seen such that one in my life and now you know like I say I was sitting there and low rent or once and fight Eighteen ... I thought gee that's a good flight but anyhow you know we just got to forget\nIt and move on you know you know everybody's last\nOne so and ... you know Texas a buck forty some points [laughter] yeah and everybody's\nAll excited though my guys are the greatest seem mark\nYeah go crap he can do because of that land\nUse a user is using up again you got to get going you still got you still got the juice I like it I like it that like hey I Want\nYou can be 'cause I sure absolutely ale or something\nIn there and and I will say this guy Baylor's done a good job\nMhm nerves or\nYou know they're getting better being more competitive very young football team and the\nUh you know he he's doing the right way yeah yeah I uh I'm not sure he's got enough folks\nWell time will tell coach I'm going to let you go on that no it's good to hear your voice you got to coach Pruitt anew coming up with the seven six on many of these same stations appreciate the insight stay well and we'll talk to you and the not too distant future\nTony world workplace where are we Ryan Thirteen\nThirteen and both both okay ... thanks go so you ... you\nTake care of the areas hall of famer coach done Neal and we are out of time thanks for being with us the ... show coming up on many of these same stations at seven oh six we'll talk about that and the more\nFor the senator right now I'm Tony Curtis don't forget three guys before the game new episode dropped earlier today check it out we talk basketball to have made Adrian Rodriguez wrote actually I mean\nWhy do you do for three D.
