all that means is your human\nBut his screwing up your life now and you're going to have to deal with it right yeah so as tough as it is I'm your daughter is not going to get one hundred percent of your attention anymore I'm your money's going to have to get some percentage until you get this thing back under control so as the student loans if they're not already on hardship to furrow\nUm if you scrape together five to seven hundred dollars and offer it to the attorney on this Fifteen hundred dollars is a lump sum settlement they'll take it\nMhm okay because we called today a hurry up some of the recall could elites that you know we ... what can we do and they just said um you can either pay the full amount in court fees and attorney fees or hire a lawyer well if even court\nOkay you're
