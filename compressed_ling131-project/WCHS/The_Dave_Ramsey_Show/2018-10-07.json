I Love your show a great day like [noise]\nOkay thank you well first of all I'm not exactly sure precisely what you mean 'cause he could refer to several things\nBut let me explain Enrico Fermi was one of the great quantum physicists who helped to create what we call nuclear physics for example he created the first nuclear reactor at the University of Chicago he helped to build the atomic bomb\nAnd he realized that there are two kinds of particles for millions and bows on\nUh for me on is like an electron\nSpin is one half a ... constant so the electron spins and it's a very small amount but it is consistent with what his call for me on some of the electron proton and a court or offer me on however they're also bows on\nThose on his head into your spins not a half but one two and three\nSo we have two kinds of particles one particle that makes up matter to electrons and protons these are the ...\nAnd then we have those on which make up the forces light and gravity are made out of those on\nHold and fortunately we have run out of time so once again this is science fantastic with professor Riccio Cancun and give us a call the number to call is six one to five six or eight months three five and maybe you can get on national radio\nTo give us a call and maybe you can get on science fantastic with professor Michio\nKaku [noise]\n\n\n\n\nYou're never going to get as much sleep is the one that's why you need to make every hour sleep you do get really count\nHi I'm Scott ... founder of born branch are sheets or handcrafted from pure fair trade one hundred percent organic talking hundreds of thousands of Americans including three us presidents sleep better than ever on board branch ... if you order today we'll give you fifty dollars off your first set of seats with criminal code sleep\nSpelled B O L L and branch dot com promo code we\nJust didn't seem that everybody either owns a car has a car story of course and that's why we're here I'm damn boots and I'm ready to invite you to join us every week here on the march radio network with little education and entertainment from your calls to a special guest ranging from Jay Leno to Jimmy Johnson simply put your auto questions answered so come on and get behind the we\nWill do the mental with us smart Saturday morning to eat right here on the voice of terms to Ninety six point five five eighty WC agents\nW W chew more three D.

you see nothing\nCan go faster than the speed of light repeat nothing this\nCan go faster than the speed of light in other words nothing can stretch faster than the speed of light and the big bang was

wait a minute I just violated Einstein's theory of relativity because the image that sweeps across the sky is going faster than the speed of light\n[noise] well I'm a physicist now and now I realize that\nYes the image when faster than the speed of light but material object that is photons particles of light each particle\nOf light did not go faster than the speed of light\nHere's another example

you you you think you've got to go with it but there's no doubt or they'd got pretty good you know getting credit I think there are front guys for big guys are pretty quick\nAs well yeah that's the thing that jumped out of him during the summer when he realized that is the with the bomb and wonders mobile they were mobile or longer distances you know they do some of those are longer runs and he was shocked at how well in the south or you know we'll see the only thing about that defensive line that surprises me right now and maybe it was because the hype was so\nLarge on him that I that was being unfair I think we see more Dante they'll and and we haven't really seen him do much yet but that's not the worst\nSituation because that means the older guys are hanging onto their jobs and not given him a window to get in there yeah I mean if you no\nMatter how good at your ... unless it's just incredible guy ... is having a place that for you in one of the wind positions it probably means

freshman might start go on for 'em so maybe it will prevent and you'll get a little bit more but you know to this point that you talked about so many injuries listens anyhow\nAnd had a son knock on wood in his defense of front and this is not at the disincentive you mentioned ferns earlier so I'll go ahead and address that and I saw him in shorts on the sideline yesterday I saw him walking out after the game I did not see a parade and flip flops or Tennessee always seems to be you know\nAnd a need for what you can discern from a guy walking through the parking lot he looked at it so you know maybe end of this month next month there might be a chance for him yeah November I mean you get through obviously I Would say\nThen you've got the semi long break for the Thursday gave for Baylor than another semi long game before you make the trip to taxes so maybe that the final fours about what you're looking for for both here in ... was probably not the next two\nBut maybe at the end and again we talked about what falls he's got registered available the pleasing no more than four games so\nUh you know that's when you sort of going to keep an eye on but Britain from I mean you used up seven ... or so or you know you get him on the field at least in some limited capacity ... students you\nKnow about the banked up garbage in terms of real ability to come by I mean\nThey didn't really addressed much with chief spirit now than it did say that you know says Joe Brown does in and he did say he indicated this week he he thought maybe he would come back I mean it was just post

evening to match in Martin's bird Matt hello welcome in\nThere and then I think one thing that I think we need to have a better right now I Want to think\nThat the bigger thing for me that there can't claim that they were at the way that\nIn that game I think that they\nMight not be done but coming in from where it thinks\nYeah man we talked about Oscar ... basketball recruits who visited a earlier and they don't have anything definitive on um you know what else mentally transpired during his visit I'm sure sure went well as I said it's\nThe only heard of the few visits to my life hasn't gone well they are and they were keeping this one just for Oscar hundred percent attention on him but I haven't heard this will be his last visit signing day\nOr for the early period in college basketball as a month away so he does it have really that long it's ultimately making decisions are Baylor in Illinois earlier Kentucky last week in West Virginia this week and\nHopefully we'll find something on the relatively near future on on what he decides you know obviously these huge one for hugging program kid that good\nWhen you go so I Can't give you a whole lot of great info on Oscar she was a you know\nYeah I mean obviously played well I I Will admit and in in the first games I didn't see a ton of yesterday but in the first games I saw from Iowa said earlier I thought there often says\nThey'll churches but I'm not very good I mean I'm but pretty obviously made them do a great deal yesterday now\nThe one thing you always liked his West Virginia's match up with its three three odds stacked defense and unusual defense against young quarterback has probably never seen anything like it in the angles and stuff that\nUh he has to be used to West Virginia ... you know bringing in coming at him and the blitz is and stuff that he's in the city so ultimately we'll see I mean if he can do that against West Virginia's well more power to him but I like mountain your chances against young person quarterback no matter who is\nPick off actually you're going to LA like we talked about it I got to take a heck of a deep as to hold his team under thirty points and Iowa State doesn't have the the they don't have a heck of a decent no you know the two good officers that they played so far this season\nUh one good off ants in one really good ... of the good office was Oklahoma State that gave up forty to the really good off as\nHis Oklahoma and they surrender thirty seven and ten point loss in that game so you know on paper and West Virginia plays up to their capabilities queen some stuff up obviously will ... got to be on target he fully anticipates if he won't have to buy games in a row\nAnd I I think it could be a close game but you know you think West Virginia is going\nTo win yeah I just don't think I have a stake in score enough points even with getting apparently just had a very nice game to overcome West Virginia to build\nUp All right let's go back to the phones eight hundred seven six five eight to five five Bob is next up on the sports on Bobby\n... on by Bob thanks for the call\nI I certainly I I just got I take your show when it came as I got her own type but I just got into our him or talk about some of them are discussed for\nFound rather Oklahoma losing patience winning I think that's a good thing for the trial to tell you why I wrote an average Texans dang bait everyone had much national ... come up here or is it was just\nFixing survey that we should remember next and ah they should be taught him that figure ... will take long for innovative and they've only got one of your top pass Oklahoma or wherever you're not ... the thing is there a lot better for\nThe three teams and stop them than just a two and then run around so I just say it's better for the man in Texas and\nYeah I can understand your logic could be from West Virginia side of things just to get him an opportunity\nA potentially to beat two top ten teams rather than just wants that goes along with your argument as well so yeah I mean ... on all those ... now you know we'll see what alternately happens associates continue to to hold serve and move forward in West Virginia is well among\nThese leaders they're part of this if you're looking at it just from the league\nStandpoint then I think the jury's out I mean certainly yes if you're a West Virginia continues to win and you get to a you know you get an undefeated West Virginia team they can get into the national\nUh playoffs then absolutely I think the worry is though is that you know Oklahoma continues to when they be West Virginia now they're sitting there with one last do they get squeezed out and all of a sudden you've got nobody in it\nYeah I mean from the big twelve perspective I mean if if they don't have a true dog in the fight in it don't care who gets there they just want somebody to get into college football playoff that I think all three\nOf those teams still have hope\nI'm certainly West Virginia right now is\nThe most hopeful those three but um you know but it's probably going to take any of those free winning out from here to assure the league of a of a participant in the final four so but that's you know again we're talking about before you get left out of the college football playoff everyone looks that you're leaving and wonders what what's wrong and\nUm yeah does that put Oklahoma more on the edge of not getting in yeah absolutely yep\nNo question I question if three teams end up with one loss against each other than the record against the rest of the league will be the same all wins what's the next ...\nOr ... how you did against the next team in order to be on before um so you know if one team has a win against\nThe saint Pete you end up for when he met and win against you you you're there to have losses a then that then obviously that team all ultimately gets there seemed to have a you know each ... two of them were beaten TCU or then you throughout the one that's lost and you can you go into the regular\nThey'll you'll be able to break in at that point because you'll have a head to head variable in that juncture so I start with many conference work down in terms of you know four five six and say you get somebody that's different than you break it back out to a head to head situation\nI mentioned ranking stop the program
