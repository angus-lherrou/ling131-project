around in my work track mhm and uh just was always interested in finances but really never knew\nUm where to start or where to begin and we picked up on your program and within a few weeks I purchased a total moneymaker ever read the book I talk or and I said we got to get on this I said we're doing it all wrong and we started it out and uh she just kind of followed my lead on it a while which is like that yeah yeah\nIt was it was I mean she's a follower and she\nWas really good I have um leadership [laughter]\nShe is in our word she didn't read the book really at all um and then eventually uh\nAfter I don't know about a year into the program she was starting to get mad at me because of the program and everything I said we just need to um instead of yelling at me we need to go to the financial peace and then you can hear it from the source right from Dave ... and then you can ... takes me on my back exactly\nYell at the the video guy yeah very cool okay so you got in there then and you saw it for yourself rather than just going oh the engineer knows the numbers\nYou know because I kind of how it started right yeah the engineer guy he's going to do the numbers I'm the medical personnel let him do the numbers and then you get in there and you see it for yourself so what happened when you went to the glass coordinator gave you a emotional ownership really in this thing\nHere I think it made it very tangible for me something that I can see and that the leaders of our class they were very open about their debt and how they had read it and that was something motivating for me\nFor me it felt like it was this constant uphill battle and on and I had this crazy burden because it was on line yeah it's a little bit of a guilt trip yeah lately and so that class honestly made me feel a little more support it and just give us the opportunity to truly jump in and know that actually getting out of debt with realistic\nWhen you first start Jim how do you do with this fast\nWe a that's a lot of debt and twenty I ... it was a long yeah it was hard we started the ... the very beginning of January in two thousand and sixteen now and uh it was it it was hard\nMe two years and

AAA eight to five five two to five\nYou did a new talk that honors and you do I I've actually seen little pieces of some of the talk and you kinda stitched it together in a different way and book ended it with some stories and openings or in a clothing store\nThat had everybody in the audience crying knock rod commercials so I'm an I'm an easy target right but uh I'm a I'm old shop the ground balls are crowded everything but and you and me ball and out there it was ... ... but a powerful story about your talk was about overcoming fear yeah a very tall\nThank you yeah it's a it's a really important topic and I've I've really taught on this topic for years with business routine because it's the number one barrier to why women don't go for it why they don't chase their dream or use their talents or start that business or a you know try something new it's really fear that hold them back and see if I can help them\nGet to the fear and through the fear that I can give them all the help in business that they need but when we started dreaming up smart conference taught on life balance for years\nThat okay let's keep it fresh let's do something new and a Jeremy Jeremy ... you know my leader and myself we're talking how can we apply this content that audience and really realize that it's so easy because everyone deals with fear whether it's in your marriage or or in your relationships your career and so I worked hard to take that talk and adapted for this audience them and I was really happy without\nA doubt yeah it was really really strong reading level stuff that was so much of it I mean I I've been uh I just was editing a blog it's a commercial break a couple of commercials reduction and by the content people on a blog article I'd written them a few weeks ago before I even heard her talk and they have that element of overcoming fear but because I think there's so much\nWe talk about transforming around here a lot right transformation trends for forming and\nGetting yourself out of debt transform your marriage or less parrot talks about that ritual him less with marriage and money a van or a you know Anthony with transforming with your teenagers you ladies in business and every time this transformation as a possibility failures of possibility and fear ... kicks in\nIt does and that voice in your head gets really loud and it starts to even sound rational and you start to make it make excuses that really make you make a lot of sense and you stay stuck but if you have someone that can speak into your life whether it's a mentor a friend a spouse that says you can do this and here's how and you lay out the path which we've been talking about that even just today that's what\nA you know Ramsey solutions is so great at getting people to plan with her with their money or their business and so on um that it's I Love that quote\nFrom the trial later said don't listen to your self talk to your so yeah it is listening to yourself just start telling yourself away it's going to be attacked and even how he describes it he's just so funny walks around talking\nTo us yeah when I listen to myself all hears fear and don't worry but when I talked to myself I can tell myself anything I Want to and it that simple and you can tell their self into something so today it's\nHere how did your new project is here I was little so book is cool this way on an even given anybody I don't know I mean no one knows so this is like big time announcement right now are holding my hand the business boutique\nTwenty Nineteen gold plan or your personal guide to getting results\nAnd this thing is chock full with a step by step process to change your life talk about putting this together and what's in the scope planner\nWell when I introduced it to our team a few weeks ago really the best way that I could explain it as there are different things that I use my own personal life to grow and to improve and reach my goals I read books to grow I Will use work books if I'm doing a devotion or Bible study I have to do list and I use a journal to write down goals and the calendar and a calendar\nHow can we pull all of these pieces together into a planner that connect those dots so for example in January we set gold and then we talk about what can we actually uh put those on the counter than we put them on the task lesson you begin to see\nHow those goals you set in January really can carry through the entire year and and the way that bill today was like I Would have coaching session so I have questions in there for reflection and activities to work through so if I was sitting down with your coffee these are the questions I Would ask you to help you get to where you want to be so it's really fun and then every single month\nHas a different topic in teaching to help you grow and this is kind of like a complement to the business boutique book it's almost like a workbook to help she\nPut it it'll last a month of August is taking care of view yeah and then you've got questions in here when do you feel your best what activates would activities give you energy and bringing joy and what things make you like yourself the ...\nRight and then you've got worksheets and then you got\nYeah places to put that on the counter so we cover a variety of topics from social media we help you plan out your social media calendar\nOr selling how to write out a sales scrapped time management how to keep track of where your time goes so all of it is super tactical and it holds your hand and hold you accountable even on a weekly spread I did a Facebook Live earlier and I showed the the audience the weekly spread we're at the top\nIt says things I'm doing this week for myself my business and my family and it helps you remember to make sure you're spending some time and some energy and in those most important areas there's a a place to write down what you're grateful for there's a place to write down your to do list\nA and all those things point back to the goals that you said at the beginning we revisit those throughout the year as we go so it's just an amazing tool to help you actually stick with your goal to share\nYou know the scope planner is um has got some of the elements that you see out there in these really nice\nUm journals or a devotional plans or whatever and you you combine some of those and it's got extra things in it that some of them don't have and um I didn't realize there's a real space that a lot of people pay like a hundred bucks for\nThese that's ... that's right normally there anywhere between sixty and eighty dollars some of them are a hundred dollars things nights and we spent\nSome books on the the just the design but the actual the actual product to sell the cost of goods sold was ...\nWhen we got that sample a few weeks ago I promise you I have not put it down I take it with me everywhere I go just because it's so beautiful I just want to hold it\nBut yeah it's a really high quality it's really durable and it's something that's beautiful you want to hold you want to keep it sits nicely with the business to take book and and how we're showing it for what what
