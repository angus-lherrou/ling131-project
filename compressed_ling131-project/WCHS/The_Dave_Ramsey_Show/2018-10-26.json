they cannot run the ball they cannot take control of the\nLine of scrimmage inside the tent has to figure it out you're going to throw it can't run it you better figure out a way designed some things to get the pat down there or not run the ball your ... and\nYou are seeing the intermediate passing game which we didn't see against our state so there's a lot um proven that\nYes yes there is I'm Talking specifically when you get in the red zone though you've got to come up with Sunday or you're not gonna be able to run it and if it gets to condense\nIt makes it a lot harder than is no doubt about it\nI tell you though this is these are always interesting parts interesting\nTimes in in a ball game to me because it's a Thirteen minutes left to go in the second quarter West Virginia's up Thirteen nothing has been all West Virginia West Virginia is two hundred yards bay has fifty three bay were turned the ball over a couple of times they would have had penalties\nBut what happens next if Baylor is somehow able to put together a drive in school or you got a four game and if they're not in West Virginia could squeak okay can be around I think this is a huge key possession of the first half weekly you agree or disagree\nWith that absolutely and you know you're talking about what's going on so far in this game West Virginia picked up their first the first the third Duncan version of Tempe they haven't made one since the early one for five on third down and that's where a lot of these drugs have been short circuit a short circuit down near the end zone of Baylor\nThey

near as defense is doing a really good job and I'll tell you I was watching that last a touchdown dry for the nine years and and\nI Love the call to to get Greer that ball in the Fort that because I've been wondering about that too he had been hanging off inside Baylor been crashing in and I'm like okay one of these times he's got a hold on to it\nAnd that was actually dead in the water Baylor had that strung out pretty well he's in for him to go out there and make a play like that and then just to throw that deep all on the next play when guys and I don't know grew may not be a hundred percent healthy but he's been overthrowing\nSome of these balls over the past few weeks and I thought that was just a nice one two punch by Greer get that confidence go and we we knew we have all the capability in the world to do it I I just don't think the execution is quite then there was a really nice job of him making some plays when they really needed um and and he's just been doing a great job so\nReally been honed in on on what he's been doing 'cause I Want to see if West Virginia can really bounce back all sense of what\nYou write West Virginia doing whatever at once right now on both

together in West Virginia has come out tonight just said what about hunger in writing I'm Out plus you're right in the face for the tougher team of you to\nSo you have to wonder how much of that filtered into that locker room during the week and got West Virginia fired up especially on the defensive side to start showing there the more physical team\nWhile Jeff Jenkins bay where what the football a wide open receiver form of Clinton\nYeah Chris plot and how the the maybe the the most a serious thing on this job we'll see if he comes back to your body Stewart was hurt who uh here early in the Dr ... her son was out in the field with him\nAnd uh not much was said in the kind of cameras went away but he's not back on the field so we'll see and I'm assuming he kinda got off over his

three million dollars or trying to May of ... what am I play we'll we're three million dollar prize that\nTook it that long to get to that argument is waiting for it\nI mean if there was all about the players pay them doesn't matter coaches them don't they don't they go they matter ... coach um doesn't matter Jeff where are we in this game I lost track\n[laughter] think Jeffrey surprised they didn't call time out right\nThere yeah they didn't they didn't in about a minute to go here and they've got the or for worse than ten for Baylor and see what they're going to do I think they're I think they're going to call a timeout they have they've called a time out here but they blew some seconds or ...\nOr they live in thirty seconds roll away I just kind of felt like they had to time outs they could have used one there\nThere are already my yeah do you do that song was like to Q. by half a if you do that like oh give us the ball back when we have forty one to nothing\nI mean get

defense to get any confidence at defense has\nBeen fantastic I mean I Know there's forty one points in all those yards but this defense right from the opening chip has been outstanding and give them a lot of credit and expand this out I mean give me gifts and a lot of credit for what he's been able to do with the defense given all of these injuries moving Giovanni Stewart down to play line backer it a hundred and ten pounds\nIt's unbelievable what he's been able to patch together and get the guy's credit you reverse of that but the thing that\nWorries me going forward is people going to get big artist what they did in the Big East we played at three right that means they're going to budge titans and the game and the big full back and just start pounding\nIraq with power plays that sort of thing so I that's the thing is always going to bother you are saying backwards backing named mark may grown in ... a good way to earn thirty five forty pounds and we we were definitely the deficit

home for no and mid America conference played trailing in the second half\nTo Toledo thirty to Seventeen western Michigan as also lost starting quarterback their backup Caleb ... who's a true freshmen has come in and thrown a couple of touchdown passes to keep them in the game but Toledo leads thirty to Seventeen and the second half of the Ohio University hop on Ball State thirty one to seven\nThere and the second half about near women's soccer team in extra time trying to win the big twelve championship\nThey are scoreless with Kansas zero zero in extra time addict they'll ask\nSoccer stadium and that's the latest from the envy banks scoreboard envy back your most valuable back visit their Web site at NBC banking dot com number up yeah say\nToys slavery doing it a nice job denied him back in there instead of to reap is with pits being out tonight brand well\nAnd that's that's gonna be the question when can you get him back because he was starting to be a guy we've talked all season about plane makers emerging on the defensive side and you're seeing guys didn't Josh nor which makes them plays Kenny Robin sit on the back in the ... was one of those guys that were starting to make plays so hopefully he's a guy you can get back fairly quickly\nHere yeah hopefully so and and one thing I Am impressed with ah what gave me has been able to do on the defense of bacterial those guys I think they're all athletic uh but they make plays for you you know I don't think there's one guy that\nKnock it off speech yeah yeah ... it's been a little chip you though on that you know we talk a lot though about the lack of the mountain tears running game but man there's no lack of talent in that back deal as far as these running backs cobra\nNo there's not and you got a bunch of options and quite frankly is not a lack of talent on the ... cents in line either I mean there's a lot of people that think you oughta Nick adjusting coat and the kids are pros you've got other guys coming along too so yeah that that is not it David I hear what you're saying for tonight but that's still my biggest concern for this team moving forward to is that all offensive line in general\nYeah they had some moments in the first half where they they couldn't run the ball but I mean it's it's pretty tough to try to criticize a team that's got forty four points of the third quarter another tie didn't catch what what's going to hide and across the middle of our peel off the way it is I I just\nTwo or three times right but she yeah I think that's that's the second one I've seen directly over the middle and gifts and\nI'm Sorry what she'd go no go ahead go ahead I was a ... aren't going to tell Jenkins I Know he was listening to me in the pre game when I was calling for tighter and across the middle ... thanks for the compliment I appreciate that I didn't have it on a\n[laughter] I Love gets\n... and I'm away twenty our past and now there's like four flags down so we're actually voted out throw sorted out\nOn the other games there'll be bank you're most valuable bank visit your website it in the banking dot com member of the icy colleagues\nWell at the opposite end of the spectrum you've got Georgia Tech do as a for first have touchdowns average any attack and they throw the ball once forty two plays forty one Russia's they've rushed for two hundred thirty four yards and Georgia Tech had the lead on the road at Virginia Tech twenty eight Twenty one\nAs they are just getting the second half underway Georgia southern up on the Appalachian State Seventeen seven\nWest Virginia wrap this went up in the first that\nLeading fifty one to seven what's been going on when we\nWere wages for where I wanted to point out Fred the kickoff before this last one the bigger has the ball now second the two\nBut when West Virginia kicked off they had\nIn their walk on a and a K C leg a true freshmen across nice Christian school who did not play but they don't have ... Chris Rock's a soccer player you know is that I Do read I don't need all yeah Paul like a doctor here in Charleston orthopedic doctor or an so Casey both kicked off and made the taco\nSo you know see his dad was a kicker in high school mhm never made attack on these life [laughter] I Know Paul\nWell I'd say that but I find you know you could see yeah see that's that's a neat you'll never forget that no that's affecting\nData hopefully you'll be back a few more times which means things we'd be going well is joined bin ... from CBS Sports and a little different game we're looking at tonight then ah ten days ago\nLooks the opposite and write us in the yeah well this is a get get right gain that West Virginia needed\nAnd I'm Brad and I were talking a little bit\nA fair I ... I I figured at some point West Virginia's officers would would self correct will Greer is too good he just needed to get the confidence back he did\nHe's been able to throw the deep all the cells um the everyone on the off into side as is stepping up run game and started even establish itself for a little bit more so I figured at some point that would happen bally's defense typically just is not that good\nI've really been impressed with the defensive after I I Know Baylor was able to score on that last drive they had a little bit of a short field and I tell you\n... backup quarterback coming out of halftime or like the worst for for any defensive coordinator only are you kidding me now we've got to try to figure this out there you go back to the Texas Tech game I mean it's it's the same thing all over again even though I think obviously the results are going to be a little bit different this time but\nWhat was it Brad to pointed yards per playwright once one a first down there was a one third down conversion or something I mean\nAfter wedding David Montgomery run all over you know I Know West Virginia was banged up in that game but David Montgomery rental overview rock pretty just made you look silly evading those tackles in the backfield ... you're in the right position sometimes just not able to complete the play\nTo come out and just make life absolutely chaotic form that to me even though it won't maybe get the national coverage it'll always be about Greer first and foremost that's been the thing that I I come away from this game going okay in West Virginia is going to get back into the big twelve title race\nThat's decide that needs to really step up and I thought they did they've done a good job and I\nAgree with you and I don't know you can expect a lot of two point eight yours or play performance is coming up in November but you're not going to need that either so I'm I'm with\nYou on the defense of performance art let's fast forward a little bit 'cause this one's over so as you start to look at next week for West Virginia West Virginia Texas\nThey twelve has to be holding its breath here a little bit though with Texas going to Oklahoma State maybe a bank that Sam Ellen gr still might not play the big twelve really need to Texas to win because it sets up a massive showdown in a good showcase came for the league next week it both teams advance\nAnd that's a big weekend too that the Alabama LSU and so you don't want to get everything will be secondary to Alabama LSU but you don't want to get to lost in that shuffle right you still want to have a ... game\nComing into that we can now to your point about Ellen gr\nOr Tom Homan said he's going to go he's going to play now is he a hundred percent well in football terms maybe he is probably means he's about Seventy percent but he's\nGoing to play how effective is he going to be I think that's going to be the thing to watch or whether that line moves in that game a little bit for Oklahoma State this week and I think will be interesting but yes to your point overall\n... if you're the big twelve you want a win out of Texas here because that's probably going to set up probably ... a top ten match mhm I'm In Austin on on November third so that's going to these huge and it's it's a really I go back to Texas being Oklahoma a few weeks ago I think this could be a bad match up for\nWest Virginia just because of how physical Texas' upfront very good defensive line against West Virginia's into your office of wind which has had some problems or how physical they are in the running game West Virginia obviously showing up tonight but I don't think that's necessarily their strength going up against the big downhill physical running attack\nSo I think a bad match up for West Virginia in the trenches but obviously if there's going to get back into the highs and raise these are going to be that kind of games where he needs to show up three hundred yards at three hundred yards four hundred yards three four touchdown\nIf you're going to get right tonight it's got to carry over for the next week\nYeah I'm just curious we've had this discussion here in the studio or you've been around this game a long time in how how important your style points [noise]\nAs far as getting into the playoffs are just as far as looking at the crawl all week in West Virginia led forty one nothing at halftime and to win you know it was like ... again Jeff with our fifty points yeah but I mean don't you need sixty\nI Want to have a lot of these guys are well Agnes yeah\nDown inside the far west Virginia leading fifty one seven could be fifty one fourteen and I think right now for it as a matter of fact it is a way to go to the signals are running in from the side and taking a look\nWith the river when we can see the media are they just gave it All right so [laughter] okay they didn't get\nTo your point to your point for the style points were in the first everyone decided what they were going to decide about West Virginia and the first thirty minutes of the things turned it off\nYeah oh I'm watching Georgia Tech not punch against Virginia Tech right yeah this is the this is the greatest albums that nothing at thirty five Twenty one right there was there was one punt that I saw in the Virginia tech guy must it was like okay no more Mr night everyone\nJust keep going forward on Fort down so yeah everyone has established that West Virginia did what they need you to to get back on track and I um you you got the style points so I don't think there's any concern there I'm at this point\nIf you'd be taxes if you'd be Oklahoma you could do it three to to you could do it thirty three to twenty to thirty two I mean do you do style points are into victory so I think you accomplish what you set out to accomplish tonight\nIt's still one Seventy one uh but uh [laughter] just greedy well you know ... hard to please you know what they what I'm saying is a boy and excitement what looked like what's he did he get some\nPeople in the process of writing Andrea already been good job buddy or again or a give and fostered called entered Blacksburg suiting you

they don't play games on paper the Herbert Hoover huskies are having a difficult year an extremely young roster is going through those growing pains with only one went on the season but they've got a thousand yard Russia and the belief they can follow him to win\nThe polka dots had been on what some are calling\nThe Revenge to wear this year over the last few years they've been on the losing end up games but this year they're undefeated and beating teams by an average of Eighteen points a game that may have lost their leading Russia for the season but to the doctor it's next man up\nIt is

visitor aside here oh white stadium and the windows are permanently sealed so sounds like we're in kind of an echo chamber but as our producer Matt Murphy suggested earlier no we're not in the bathroom doing the game [laughter]\nSo it's a little other the other than the steel windows this was a fantastic management to do a game from and like I said it's been a while since we've been to oh why stadium I remember we did it from the side\nOne year in the early days and the next time we came to do it they had condemned the press box and tore it down yeah this is the replacement for that or below the visitor side press box at oh why studying one of the few where you've actually got to press boxes\nAnd dates that we are again on the visitors side Hoover will kick off they've got a heat up to our right John Campbell the senior kicker\nBush the ball down the Dutch have not come on the sideline yet as Chris mentioned the huskies moms are probably not going to be entirely happy with laundry because they are in a white jerseys\nWith the blue pants the blue numerals the red help much sand the trend is read more than ... ... they are in all red uniforms the jerseys and the pants now Mr silver\nAnd the numerals are white back to receive the kick Fort Polk ... it's\nOh in the clan a hand he will be here on the near side and across the way it's Bronson skiing\n... we are ready for action on this rainy cool night here in Boca a kick in as a way it is going to be high end over end come down to the Klan a hand at the twenty twenty five thirty\nRight up the middle of field thirty five forty forty five fifty one man debate he is in to Herbert Hoover territory and he is slowing down inside of the forty yard line at about the thirty nine John\nCampbell the touchdown saving toggle for the huskies there and\nDo you what he he was the last man between the dots invade hurting me managed to get McClain a hand on the ground or in the mud and that is a great return but it's a pretty good stop by Hoover their position for that are so they'll start out at Hoover's thirty nine yard line\nAgain for pogo Jay cook is the quarterback clan of hand and as the tail back replacing Ethan pain start out in Hoover territory with receivers either way in a\nWing Albany or aside snap comes back cook hands at all to the Klan and the Clinton\nLed to hit up the line of scrimmage and drop for one yard law has one\nBig Mac Cummings for Hoover estimate the line of scrimmage drug in backward lost a couple of yards there that we have quite a cowboy they get out of your credit to the line of scrimmage I Believe\nShe lost to actually according to the change here on the near sighted Lucy or back to the forty yard line and that'll make it a second down\nCummings five nine and two hundred and fifty seven pounds senior anchors the middle of the defensive line for Hoover\nSchemes and Toby pain come to the near side as receivers where the ... on the right on second to an eleven pitch comes to my client of hands starts to the right breaks through a whole writes a tackle he's tackle down at the thirty are in line is going to be really close to the first down it'll depend on the spot\nEvan Bayh grew managed to get to him but not before he picked up pretty good yard it's very close to the first down but I don't think he quite got there\nNow he's got to be about a half yards short the ball the original want a scrimmage was on the thirty nine but it was just barely across the thirty nine so that'll be ten yards on the Kerry it's gotta be third and short\nForty five oh my God line nice block and he is finally got to stay on the state now still farmed attack or still spinning twisting before he is finally shoved out of bounds\nHave to get the official\nSpot on where that\nIs while you're getting the official spot I'm going to give Bronson skiing some blood because he should be responsible for the last thirty five yards of that run he absolutely got a block over there knocking to huskies on their backs on an opening it up\nFrom a clan a hand or head off to the races and get deep into Hoover territory nice they don't feel blocking schemes fifty nine\nYards on the Kerry and it'll be first down and the goal at the ten yard line\nAtlanta ham stays in ... drops back a broken play he's rolling down the near side looking down the field who got the ball puff what does the ball players and it goes out of bounds the husky defensive line you could hear all through our rights a husky coaches screaming that's a fumble and they just couldn't get to\nKnow in the flag comes out at the end of the boys or I have to wait and see what the caller is on that and it was intentional grounding since well so it wasn't a normal job was obviously a passion for the call intentional great actually works well for Hoover there does moon\nAnd let's ask them and we'll see where it went out of bounds where they moving back to keep backing up from where he threw it looks like it's going to be about the twenty six yard line so that the ends up being a Fifteen yard penalty\nWonder if the guard player of the game will be offended if we use his shirt to wipe out the window down 'cause I think at this point that's about the only right we got\nReady to use my handkerchief coaches beside me just\nOkay [laughter] and we may need to open up the doors to get a little non humidity in here so it was hot air in his room second down the hill from the twenty five yard line they pitch it to the Klan hand breaks have tackled breaks another one and then he shoved down inside of the Fifteen\nYard line side of the twenty yard line rather do about the Seventeen\n\nSo it is third and goal so husky these ants aided by poker penalties keeping the dust off the scoreboard thus far\nAnd three thirty seven to go in the first period here no score poker knocking on the door trying to get in there but Hoover hanging tough\nSo eight yard gain for McLean of hand it is third and gold cook up under center takes the snap pitches it to the Klan a hand they've\nGot him he did both lawyers is on the ground there is going to be a fight for it and I believe the huskies habits\nNo they do not it is for down and go recovered by one of those big all fenced in line\nAnd I'm not even the harbor was the one that got a hand in there is trying to make the tax will get a handle the bowl ripped it out at came bouncing out of there and one of the dot lineman covered it up and saved it but now it's sports now and gold and the ball sitting out\nYou know out there about the what's Seventeen your online\nYep right on the Seventeen it's\nGot to be fourth and gold that dots have got to get into the end zone the clan of Han lines up as a receiver on the far side\nAlong the schemes to receivers to the near\nSide here comes the blitz cook rolling to his left he gets away from the other cannot get away from the third man\nHe's going to be hit they punch the ball lose and it is going to be a turnover on down the husky de than doing what they need to do\nI ... I don't think they punch the ball is I think he was actually trying to throw it and throw it incomplete pass but it was a fumble because the referee through the bean bag however it went out of bounds so the ball will go over right there\nSo cook no gain on the play it as a turnover on downs\nAnd Hoover starts out first intent if there were a Seventeen\nWho I like that let's call it's a nice\nThat'd be timed it very well he came on a dead sprint timed it perfectly here we go\nTo first down and than it is going to be a quick hand off working right up the middle for Hoover again that's Kennedy on the carrier and our technique he got to carry that time and he didn't get much\nAnd that was Toby paying them to stop again for the dots actually lost ... ... yeah I got in the backfield and stopped him as he tried to go to the right side\nSo key with his first official carrying this debt books tonight goes backwards to the sixteen yard line where it will be second in eleven\nRain continuing to poor here at or watch stadium as they're trying to show live shuffle in ... and the official dropped it as he tried to catch it ... I Believe it was about that with\nWell the other fun part about this as we have this window in front of probably what about five feet wide and then we have five feet of wall and then another windows you and I are doing the Texas two step back here trying to make sure\nWe can see world ... miles like how did I get into this mess [laughter] I'd argue part of this or\nDo I get stuck with these guys ball back on a sixteen yard line it is going to be second down and about eleven for the huskies snap comes\nBack white one guy I don't know what he's going to be hit from behind now he draws I got a receiver down the field diving and making the catch was out of bounds it is and complete why now a diving effort\nOver on the far side by Evan my girl of the huskies and he just couldn't hang onto\nThat's really a shame too because ... y roll into his right through that ball with heavy pressure on him and actually the ball was caught he just came down out of bounds to bring up third down to about ... uh twelve\nYou think feel position but we begin this cute all night you know Hoover needs to get a first down here because it'll give ... short the OED\nWill poker so short field all night to get a minute and\nThirty two seconds to go clock stops on the incomplete pass they'll send a receiver over here to the near side snap is that they run the screen and they wanted it to go to key\nAnd they weren't ready for it he got the ball out of his hand a little quicker than he wanted to it falls in complete and it'll be applied yeah\nForced to get rid of it great\nHe's just had a little more time is when passwords they're\nSo brunch and schemes trucks out to receive the pun and he'll be standing at about forty five yard line\n\nHere in the opening quarter cardinal conference match you up here I'm five eight ... poker and Herbert Hoover and it has been back and forth game there is the ... on it is going to bounce right in front of skiing he picks it up at the fifty\nYard line comes to the near side I grabbed him by the ankle they bring him down to forty eight one day I Will say about Herbert Hoover their record maybe one in seven but these boys know how to pack\nI'll tell you what Evan my girl made a great play in the open field to get a hold a scheme and that's not a United schemes good athlete loyalty and we want to create ... block went right after him and brought him down for no game excellent excellent job over with the coverage\nOf the return only ... drop\nWhoa that's about as good as it could have been now if he hadn't hadn't fielded it probably would have rolled down into poker territory but that's about as good outcomes super could have hoped for their\nScoreless ball game here in the opening quarter poker with their third possession of the night there first to of been riddled with penalties and good defense by the Hoover husky stick receivers laughing or to the right cook out of the pistol and I think we've got to eat or a phone started ringing lay again the leg aim is to go\nAnd that will drive you nuts because you just got the ball for penalties so more in the first quarter against us or against the dots\nAnd probably cost them a touchdown them at first drama with thing Hoover trying to stay undefeated they want to stay in that\nTop four host a couple a playoff games here at a white stadium so it is\nFirst down an Fifteen from their own forty eight yard line cook drops back and a false start penalty against poet yeah they\nWere showing presser Greg ... is one of the guards to pull up early\nSo Hoover using pressure and tuna night talking well here for a bit of a meltdown for the dots and follow up and will be so for a book\nThat makes it first down and twenty\nBall now sitting on pogo is forty three forty three are\nSo they're going to come out send to\nJust you know it's one of those ... you just get so used to not seen it but cook actually goes all the way to the sideline gets to play from the coaching staff comes back out\nTwo receivers last single to the right on first down and twenty four poke a snap comes back they want the little flare pass out that my client of hand he makes the catchy across the fifty yard line down the far side like forty five forty and has brought down the inside of the thirty five yard line and it's got to be a first down for the polka dots\nGot it all back in one shot there from a climate hand that's going to move to change\nTrying to figure out will get the chain spotted again just kind of an unusual angles that he's like yeah I'm thirty three yard line\nAnd if they get it out to him on that perimeter guys boy and that's what they do to get into his hands that's been the most successful plays of the night to plan a hand on the perimeter\nTwenty four yards on the past and catch and it is a first down to in the backfield are going to hand it off to the full back looking for running room off the left side for the ... of all that time was Dylan tailor\nThe sophomore rumbling ahead and he will pick up a good Seventy yard\nYeah everybody's got up here we go to second down and eleven\nAfter the four yard gain\nBy Hoover key the tail back and now the huskies look at a long distance play and they want to throw\nOut white bread from the sag looks fires the pathway on field it is incomplete pass intended\nFor Bradley and he just couldn't hold on to a big old Paul came up out of that power\nGrab the wide by the back of the neck and I thought he was going to come down he spun out of that very nice work and somehow got the pass off of it Phil incomplete very lucky one sector in the backfield\nRent white by the way now ... of for passing on tonight\nSo its third down and about eleven\nBall sitting just across the ten yard line\nBlake lock down to about eight seconds\nBrent White up under center with an eye formation behind it drops\nBack well groceries on his hit right as he throws it looks down the field in it is intercepted it adds a forty yard line if it were down the far side line and shoved out of bounds we're trying to get the number on the defensive back all the way across the field looks like\nIt's going to be maybe Jacob ... hand damn it on our number six thank you Ethan Miller with the pick off it has intercepted\n\nAll that bad though because I mean that's kind of were a ... anyway that was going to a little bit of real presents them with a return yeah yeah [noise]\nSo the answer to thirty or by ... by aids and Miller\nSo that puts the onus back on the Hoover to eventually decided on it all night pocus have the field position
