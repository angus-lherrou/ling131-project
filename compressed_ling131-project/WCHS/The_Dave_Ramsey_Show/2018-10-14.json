David Montgomery I think I'm Dee both sides of the\nMoment but I mean they did get to pick and they've got a touchdown out of it\nBut you're going to do well I didn't give him enough right what if you\nThrow in special teams ooh he's still at the\n... yeah the ... what's your ... I'm Indian air French really I'm happy guy typically I mean [laughter] you're you're happy to have greater at or I'm gonna I'm gonna go deep last [noise] but uh because you got a touchdown he got a turnover and got a touchdown but are\nYou are struggling now West Virginia ... our state has the ball back and I think you're going to flag and what has been for a ...\nYear get flagged their hot they they have the ball at their own forty one because of the twenty yard just write hunt return that West Virginia Twenty one year ... return to West Virginia mystery tacos on a so now what you do get flapping above their part that all anyway\nWhat okay there was there was a little hand Schechter and you're throwing a flag on that\nToo well there was less hand checking their that on this still touched down it's not going to matter because butler has has declined the penalty until you catch but jeeze\nThird possession in a row for Iowa State that started at the forty or\nWho were legal man down field so and I pass it off send them all on him play the downing emirate break West Virginia who needed that he's a couple of breaks\nAnd you better get a stop here because it's not safe that stand your your your in jeopardy getting run out of him here that label that another kind of down on their\nYou know his right now it's Thirteen just seven I was the lead in West Virginia Thirteen twenty five what's going to the second quarter and after that touchdown which West Virginia a great field position on the on the interception mostly the office of West Virginia is done up in the last couple of positions nothing ADA total yards happy for the west Virginia\nYeah this is the this is the one so far the first half we talk where the mountaineers defense needs to\nReally ended up bringing it looks like we're going to bring it all\n\nSee what the freshman does your third and sixteen and I hit the tight end and the titans go scored a touchdown wow so that's in Nineteen yard touchdown pass Charlie Koehler so colors had two big catches here that's an eight play fifty nine yards Dr four minutes him for seconds\nOr how does it got six seven to Seventy one get away from a defensive back that's what I Want to know\nSo what do you do just drags it looked like he was going to drag across the middle just hot out shed the block make\nA kayak would ask you Henry pushed off ornament in reversed\nWill tell you well boys this is a this is you gotta worry not it's not even a winner last right not read it you got to get back in the game because you're getting absolutely drug and blown out of this building were getting her but ... yeah I mean this is sort of like Alabama against West Virginia right now\nAnd that's a great\nMismatch for our stated that they can keep going back to that one\nDay Whitley what you see their\n[noise] got to get somebody on that tied in coal is made to big plays and you know that was third downright third goal yeah third sixteen Gordon sixteen what was the goal of a certain way and they could have got a first down at the three yard line [noise]\nI still think you need to plays on like the guy to be a pastor and what what do you do when we did that they do a bit yeah\nRock pretty right now six to nine Seventy yards two touchdowns and one pick that uh [noise] let's see were just talking to bounce a baby with red welcome to the kitchen\nAnd I think it will I mean and I like a man I just don't crave Rhone everything Fred when we were never behind when I've been in here [laughter] right on the bright side on the right side\nIf there was ever a team at West Virginia that was built to come back this is it that got the quarterbacks they've got the wide receivers they can come back\nYou know in my ears are day because that was the that was the conventional wisdom but this I always say defense has them totally bottled up right now yeah they do they do\nHave an answer for number twelve in the middle of that field making hits all over the place and you know when they get that far ahead they play a soft zone and they will make them be patient and they have to work their way down the field\nThat other players thirty three Braxton Lewis I'm goes back to where he was a missile coming out of the secondary\nTwenty seven right now nine Twenty one left to be played in the second quarter good news is there's a lot of time but I'm not sure that's real good news right now Jeff where the mountaineers boy\nThat you know you've got to get some kind of drive I mean West Virginia's best drivers really that they had a short field on their touchdown drive and besides that you're either cruise been running for his life for the running game hasn't got you know done much I Wish they spend a nice job on the fence questions you've got to put a couple of first towns they really do and get a nice drive\nYour right Jeff I mean five place for plays yeah workplace three place for a place that's the drive so far for West Virginia out of the gate\nA twenty four players for Iowa State twenty four the mountaineers but my goodness gracious total eighty eight yards of off in West Virginia compare that Brett how the hundred and Ninety One right now for our state\nAnd just you know read I mean you've got to get the defense off the field some I mean they I mean you know get the officers on the the old world even have a\nMountain when they've had the ball so um yeah really\nWhat's the total play here surprised when they saw it did twenty ... twenty total plays it seems like more than that in favor of Iowa State right now but get a give Iowa State a ton of credit they are clearly better prepared and better scheme up in West Virginia's right now there do they have more answers for West Virginia in West Virginia does for them\n... ... a lot of problems for our office this from to disguise standpoint and it's hard to figure out where they're coming from and they haven't really been able to handle their butts at all\nYou know what in in ... you said that about pets are and what we've got a flag what's it called here or there is no celebrating\nHere that's accredited while you're taking ... take a celebration probably just do something else yeah right I mean the points to ... might be a first down\nWhere where they call in here so it's still going to take the dead zone touchdowns afterward ... again West Virginia they're taking on the kickoff okay well let's take the point of points and they ... on the kick off our heads okay them so oh man\nIt is who yeah breathing a little better Bigelow get that and wow look he heard on each step right through there I don't know why you gotta surprise\nYou see three hundred and forty pounds ... at all any I don't want to it's a tried there can pass just hurdling guys you know\nPets guys absolute I and I know he got kicked out but you live with some of that stuff don't you I mean it got picked out earlier today and\nSay well the view is that right Tony gifts in his said that's right David long he lets him patrol wherever knowing he's going to be out of position but he's going to make a lot of places that make up your way to go with the bad sometimes you get some bad so I got to be out a position as ... as you just come back over and say we'll give you a helps you out there I got to fix that\nCredit to their coaching defensive lady tell them to play every played on the which one's going to get you eat on the which one is going to get them see that show you play every play huge\nGrade and by the way Fred that's a\nIt's a it was a dirt pits return that ball or Seventy two yards for the score so Seventy two yard touchdown returned by pitch after the bigger low block and hey all of a sudden where you're going in you look you're looking at twenty seven twenty seven to seven possibly now twenty four team\nWho ended up it comes back to ... hours to kicking at the end of this game show but it's an interesting point I just got a block for a touchdown and selling well not the only one struggling ...\nThat I guarantee you that coach and they saw something during the week that they probably showed him there because he didn't hop through there and just by accident I think when those guys step down they stepped down their heads down and they just he just jumped over our is two hundred and twenty pound body\n... about three minutes to go here on the first apples take a break come back with more on ...\n...

I Know West Virginia doesn't need a lot of all kinds of options but get Kenny ... on the offensive side she see 'em ... did did you see a ... I mean he was running while looking like a third base coach waving the route thirty leaving a bit of West Virginia halo in their chance\nHere with their with time out angrier runs in he's rocked but it's going to be a long run for West Virginia a Fred Greer all the way up on that run up to about two where he ended up to thirty six yard line so Fifteen yard run by will Greer\nHere with West Virginia with a fresh set a dance trying to score offensively I and to possibly take the lead in this game before half three stories out of bounds inside a minute left or he's going to lose about a year ago\nMay Jeff just noted from WVU that that block to feel go return for a touchdown that's the only the second time that's ever happened in school history ... the last time it happened to Harold kid took one back against pit October Fifteen Nineteen Ninety four\nYear old kid here you go and many remember Harold ... I remember the ... by then\nWhy not [laughter] so I was looking at the man [laughter] I was looking at your votes\nSo here's a big second down a level and play for West Virginia I just trying to find a spark offensively getting getting help from the defense tonight with the interception a and also with the with the block field goal and nothing there for West Virginia store third and long here a little bit that was a weird\nI tell you that the guys I mean obviously nobody down field that's why is holding the bolts alone but you had had a way they're released why not just dump it to pettaway gr didn't even look down and kept looking down field there were nothing was available yeah they're playing itself prevent on free man rush and he was out of bounds that we go yeah\nWe're very on will Greer like night tonight the one he didn't throw away that he steps out of bounds and again it looked like he had passed away in the shutdown well it looks like to me though will Greer always wants to home run ball though\nHe always welcome pens on\nRoutes are calling for calling deep routes and it's not on Amazon coaching just a\nBetter some kind of bean bag slide down here it looks like I'm ... broke me because he stepped out or the official\nThat was standing right beside him did not see him step out because he was looking down the hill with a whole lot of\nMuslims are concerned we have got to change our route packets were playing right into their bracket coverage worked on ourselves that we do nothing inside it seems obvious does watching what are we doing off\nAnd so that's a great point so explain that a little further so so what looks like is available from if you if you missed mix up the routes at this point what is their\nRight we we have got to start bringing our receivers into the line of scrimmage closer to our to our box and be able to play some kind of levels concept against that whole drop or that we've seen all night long\nBut the ... going long that's all we're doing going along and the middle and I will not be that\nWrong and outside of everything has been outside to the sidelines we've got to start bringing it in inside between\nThe has a deep crossers and the intermediate routes between ... and the secondary and that that will be open to three five three three deep dive underneath that's maximum dropped three men rushed\nAnd Oklahoma State found that exact route a bus last week the west Virginia and not been able to hit one of those yet\nHe says thirty no maybe he's been over ... because ... last week in\nHis team on now back to the hobby and the crew\nGame line at halftime mountaineers trailing twenty four seeing and when you start looking at some of the stats Brett how it gets a little frightening for staff total often still yards Iowa State two hundred and fifty yards amount that here's a hundred and\nTwelve ugly ugly drop down a few lines because I think I think all you just peel away almost every step there and go straight to third downs one of seven for West Virginia so when we talk about us off and can't get anything going it can't get any momentum that's why can't be one of seven obviously they're going to have to get that corrected\nWhich means when you get the third down you're probably looking at third and eight thirty nine usually that is an indication they're mountaineers again a penalty why is not bad three for thirty eight Iowa State three for twenty five\nThey have eleven first downs mountaineers have six first down in the first half six first downs in the first day you were just saying that that\nOn third down how far was the distance you asking you shall receive a ... average third down distance for West Virginia nine point six yards yeah these are averaging third intent which is a recipe for disaster as you're saying\nYou know no question about that so uh well it has been ah it has been a typical though a half of often for the mountaineers if you think back to the last three games\nYeah I think that's the most alarming thing to me guys as okay we talked all pre game about the officer protection we knew that was going to be an issue coming in but but what surprises me read with all of these weapons all of the different receivers multiple running backs too tight end it doesn't seem like that's getting deployed in any way shape or form here in the first that\nNo I have spread earlier who were getting the ball to yeah yeah exactly we have enough stuff to talk about what we're really not doing anything on\nSense of where I think it comes down to losing the chess game kudos kudos to cable his guys were doing a great job this week we've got to go in and when it on the white board at halftime muffins\nOr let's say we can do that right now let's see if we can get some scores for you

bank visit our website of envy banking dot com member FDIC\nMight get Joe alright mountaineers apt to half as we mentioned twenty to fourteen trailing and ... and Jeff we talked about it the entire first half mainly about how bad everything was yet the only trailed by six you got to be feeling pretty good\nWell yeah I think that's one of the message that goes to say you know they're saying in some areas of the game you play it about as bad as you can play at points in that first half and look guys you're right in this football game if we just we just do the things we know we should do let's make some adjustments that's the message right you know then we're going to be OK in this game\nAnd uh you know so hopefully that do that is the case dry what state you're probably saying hey look we could be up this many I mean we we kind of shut ourselves in the foot we're moving to football were doing some other things well and so that their message just make these adjustments ... we'll see here in the second half took place to play\nA ... I mean you just can't you got to be able to I Am encouraged to read I Am encouraged\nBy the way that we're seeing the fence played the last two Sears\nYeah I think if you're looking for any sort of positivity of coming from the defense of side of the ball and that's hard to believe that when we played the way we played in the first half but we have made it drives and I think more than anything we're coming down and serving and we really playing with\nEnough to level talent ... or second theme guys at a couple of positions than it is killing us tonight\nWhen we look at the other games we've talked about with the mountaineers had a bad second half and then they had a bad first out but now they have another bad first hand ... who's been on mostly what unit the office of you know\nThe one that's supposed to be making all the fire and getting the season was their office and we'd rather put the defense back together so you know for for the most part give me that a pretty good job he has an ... I think we look under cheap little bit now don't you\nI yeah I agree with that I agree I think that's the question coming into this would have been wouldn't have been about the ...\nI just I'm baffled by this with all of these weapons all of these different guys all of the diversity\nIn the ... and you look like you do in the first half that that to me the most disappointing by far not even close\nEven though there are a little bit different coverage wise and and and it's even easier when you get ahead 'cause you can play a softer zone and enforce them to take what all the underneath stuff to try to the beach you\nHere's the mark of a good coach amount of money in of always thought this what's your team during the second half can you adjust yeah you know what's going on can you just in in\nIn in we'll see what happens but if we can mountains in in turn up the heat and start playing well then we we did a good job coaching\nAnd they basically to drill at home even more I and ... in the first biggest part of the first half I was in another room watching on TV and I have the sound up Tim Brando said to start the game when you look at West Virginia offensively pick your poison so even bay or agreeing but yet hasn't been any boys in so far\nNo you know it's funny last week against Kansas bread and I were debating and the second half about West Virginia's running game 'cause I you know I've I've just been lamenting the last few games but I I I Want to see them try to run the football and here's an another game where they just kind of just went away from the running\nOr understand there's a there's a past first mentality here but\nI Would like to see them be a little bit more balanced on our fence and run the football I mean they've been a couple of runs in this game where you know McCoy was wide open up the middle for his big run his twenty six year old Ron ... had a big run like she don't try to run the ball a little bit\nYeah but I think Dave to to back that up there you've seen two years now worth of evidence that's not just what this all fences designed to do with your right yet some pops but this is they throw it all fence and it's going to be a throw it all fence and they just haven't been able to run the ball effectively for the better part of\n... when you're like consistency you don't do it we can wake out 'cause you know you live but the past and your dad by the past\nYou know all the teams that win championships I'm Talking about the history of college football has always been a great running team look at Alabama there one first team they still are if they're even better now with the quarterback but you're going to have to knock the rundown and and so if we can think continue to run the ball like we should win by like when when a lot of games\nOkay Jake and gave me both down on the field so is it in your guys' opinions up to the coaches in the box seeing what we have been seeing watching it on TV\nWell being a defensive coordinator for Eighteen years\nAre always judge things but what kind of information I'm getting from the box if I if I if I thought I had good eyes which means that I'm getting good information they see a lot of stuff then I'll I'll be on the field because I think you make adjustments faster from being a deep into a corner you can grab guys and fix them soon as they come off the\nField because you know three downs you might be right back on the field and some of your line backers may be on the team so after two dads are gone so the faster you make adjustments to better\nBut if you don't have good ads and and you don't you're not getting the information you want than the coordinator should go up up top\nWhere they say that's a different on the offensive side though I think it's harder to see some things in the box and you communicate and get on the white board defensively and they all sorts of sad that they should be able to see what they're doing in the\nBack end right yeah I Would if I had a choice I'd rather be a cop cars I see more I can see a lot better\nBut the adjustments that need to be made at half time\nFor adjustments is better for the coordinators to be on the sidelines because they know the defense or they often it's better than anybody and it's there's and it's their macular in\nOrder to get things fixed and not only that from being from a player's experience when we got to make adjustments getting on that ... and having a coach show you exactly what's happening gambling it immediately and that communication from the players to the coach from the field to this makes a big there weren't what typically happens\nIn defense we we have the secondary coach up top that you have to secondary coaches ever since I last West Virginia two thousand one I've never coached anywhere in the second the they didn't have a corners coach and the safety because because everybody plays nickel and dime now there's a lot more guys to coach\nBut you know I don't know if people know that out here but he was offered by Texas a and M. and Alabama\nAndme Alamo yes our so wow well I think he saw the handwriting on the wall of Alabama\nAs who he was going to be I don't know if you play like that you might play a lot more news is pretty good but yeah there you know even though to they were just stockpiling yeah there I have a good Alabama three and gun they take a guy that throws for nearly five dollars yeah we do they donated here to our third string yeah exactly it's not bad at all let it for ...\nAs for certain but they play for West Virginia defensively what are they in coach\nIs to just debate dismayed by us\nAnd Washington has another has a taco for last that he got Josh Norwood and shake Campbell coming up to make the ... to to yard last a on a day but Montgomery carries you Fred they've done a better job of Montgomery at the very end of the second half and then here are very that the first half in the store to the second half\nCredit shake Campbell guys right shot through there and made a play solid tackle gotten down behind a lot of scrimmage second longest seems a lot more comfortable in front of that my position than he did outside earlier in the season\n\nWest Virginia second the twelve now for a ... and again another completion of rock pretty and uh\nWe brought this famine will he linebacker and one of them fell down and then there's no pressure whatsoever\nMatthew eating twenty three yard line or twenty three you're completion from party down to the west Virginia thirty two\nIn Norwood was turned to all the way he was in the day he wasn't even\nClose to the receiver that time as he's been around three sixty before he founded\nA run by Montgomery a four three yards from the\nThirty to\nGive him three on that and uh down to the west Virginia twenty nine so it'll be second seven\nStrong utilization of play action play pass stuff they've really seen us commit to that ... or early in the second half the using it well\nNow again adjustments Mae West Virginia Steve got to be made again\nWell I think it'd be just trying to play their ... which is ... man front in general which means you out or a number of the running game by one so I think he's forced to and when you do that you're going to play soft corners which means basically one on one out there\nSince an incomplete pass phrase is going to be a third in seven for Iowa State at the west Virginia twenty nine to be an opportunity here to lease for so what would be alone feel go\nPretty it was going after

seems like he did have I'm Talking about just Norwood here had a little bit of the Jersey they're butler butler right butler back and not looking back it up yeah yeah and so that was the second in Eighteen Fred and so that's\nA date of hopelessness played in his case over there so coming out of the break and defend our defensive guys here are either going to say what ... what do you say they're reads they caught him on the interference\nThat's a good call but it's a dagger my gosh we we have his arm yeah down his arm yeah you know these are what it is a tutor so to ... he used a such a great job just buying an extra second you know but that's what\nThat's all that's almost perfect what you want to flush him out making ... he's got the right road ride your initial Heathrow both throw it not catch the ball and you commit a penalty in past our friends\nSo we see a jet sweep here for the first time and a ten yards\nPickup might give them a eleven here I think you do you do give them eleven nobody are after all these other ... you're right they give you can get them there but he can't make the tackled right right\n\nYeah that that's the key right there you go [laughter] you may have happened was that in the wind in the correct spot but they still have to come up with the boy will\nJust out of control I mean you can't you can't run there are controlling open field and that you will make a tackle\nWhich is really time consuming drugs they've had here at the ball\nYeah West Virginians had the ball for what three plays a tip three plays this entire third period which now has six minutes and thirty five seconds remaining image so it has been time consuming what are we got a penalty flag thrown this looks like a whole that whole knows\nBut I think it takes place don't you a good question I think well yes\nAre you going to take the players are going to back him up what would you do the way we've been playing business I think that they could play [laughter] ... that's the worry about [laughter] you might be right let's see what they decided to do though\nIs a personal fell ... shop block that\nThey're going to take it at Fifteen that's holding them now it's a big one fifty ... ... ... ... different as twenty five now again do Jeff here you go the mountaineers or putting themselves in a position where you have to get off the field and if you even\nGot to get a couple of opportunities this Dr Fred 'em to do so but it hadn't been able to so personal style Fifteen yard penalty marches them back to their own forty five yard line just me first and twenty five for Iowa State\nAt their own forty five huge penalty so now a big first down from ... in a\nWay to go mountain or he is slippery in Egypt so you go ahead and recount the plan that will die but yeah it's a when you're at a loss\nFor one will no longer walk heading to want to do it looked like it was gonna be a four yard last though any side steps and get something that's not even Montgomery that's the second back how 'bout shaky I'm Down here the the chicken I think he's had a pretty good game tonight Steve he's been around we've called his name a bunch in the backfield there\nYeah the whole thing about the three three second middle back or a lot of stuff gets funneled to him and he has to make a lot of places where I read\nYeah you can [laughter] kind of had a lot of lettuce is lesser [laughter] especially six one ... red haired guys right I yeah\nAnother politically well though records well another ... think by purdie I got a couple of mountaineers up in the air but then ... comes up to make the taco so it's going to be the third and Eighteen\nHere Fred threatening and I think the Rick pets is gonna\nPump fake in his sleep 'cause he's there again ready to make the play and party with the pump take his pits goes flying by Norwood did Steve what you were saying on that part is going to run the football there's some of my helmet on in there and make them feel it\nExactly make him pay\nThird and Eighteen at the forty eight yard line\nPlays avert your eyes nobody will ever get your eyes [laughter] this is that there has been a nightmare scenario so far the third and twenty three\nAnother penalty there Dave weekly yeah\nBut it it really makes third and twenty three I'm outta here you leave and I'm going home\n[laughter] it looked like the right side of the law and move\nYou know they tried to help his day with these penalties [noise] no I doubt it yeah\nNo doubt Norwood that was the other was a good topic\nAnd I don't want to I don't want to over exaggerated here but this to me feels like the game certain twenty three you need to get a stop and get the ball back and see what you can do might not be the last chance you get but if you give this up and keep this Dr don't you've got major issues there where is the worst Eighteen\nFinding almost sound like a ... [laughter] don't let him get closed anything right now this is where it yeah West Virginia has\nTo get off the field here and get you get the dolphins back on bringing bin ... from CBS Sports and and been I I don't know if you've been watching this game particularly or not\nBut the mountaineers of had three ... plays in his third quarter\nWell Iowa State is is done a really great job defensively down the field of of taking away the long ball but then the other part of that game plan is\nLucky you don't know if and when will grand company are going to get hot and the passing game is is one of the top wide receiver groups in the country so one of the best ways to make sure they don't get that shot as as you want to\nTake all the time that you possibly can on an offense and they've done a good job of that but the thing that I've been most impressed with in watching Iowa State as thoroughly rushing three on on almost all of these places\nBut they're just doing such a great job down the field and they don't really trust that you know West Virginia is going to be able to to do anything with their protection that they're having a lot of success with it and then there were only showing I think on some of these players there are only show in like a box of like five guys and yet West Virginia is still had\nA couple of plays or when they tried to run for middle and and just had an absolutely no success so really loving the way the psych loans are just\nClouding and pulling all their guys back in just daring West Virginia to throw it so I I don't think that's going to be your game tonight I think you got to try some some shorter passes and and get some things out a little bit more quickly\nThere was a third and twenty eight Fred because there was another penalty on Iowa state of delay a game and they pick up Seventeen yards on the path to bally's and now the psych cleanser punting so West Virginia will get the ball for the second time or in this task at the ten yard line with three twenty two left in the third\nSo to Ben's point in time for play maker Steve that this is where you got to senior quarterback he got tons of receivers somebody make a play here\nAnd one in one thing I Would then one thing I Would question 'cause I I have I've been flipping around so I haven't had a chance to see every single play even there there's only been three in the second half as West Virginia experimented with tempered all's they try to get anything going in that regard because it seems like that would be a natural countered and I\nJust haven't though you have you haven't been able to string together to consent to play that have worked so you just really haven't\nHad any you don't want to try out your ... you don't want to string out your defense then if you're just going to run three plays and be off the field yeah exactly exactly they've done that already something deep south that's long\nGone at least they're going to have Jeff me tackle ... girls at yeah about twenty\nFive Okay Mark help head away and he's care when he's had the opportunity to carry a boy he hasn't done bad tonight that's a good good uh first downplay seven yards will take the other seven yards gained by pet away a for a second in three for West Virginia here\nYeah eyes words as had seven tackles to answer your question they're coached on\nAnd so we get a first down run there for your game by pet away for\nThere to Forman box with the safety twelve stand back yard\nWe have five blockers so usually able to run the foot really really well how do you account for them in a scheme though so what makes somebody missed you've got five the buck for will but we don't run a true those game right yeah we do do it I don't know a little different\n[laughter] I got confused that time the rest of them do their\nMountaineers or looking at what Jefferson yeah nursing ten first intended to twenty three yard lines have been ... been still with us right yes yeah I'm here to hurt how how\nLobbied be proud of doing their own little or seem really own steam and that's fine you know we need it as well\nTo John and ravens were John good evening welcome\nIt hey guys how you doing Hi John thanks for the call\nAnd good hey I just want to kind of touch on the point that you just made there are there are some definite issues um we've seen them here's here's where I think and I'm not going to conspiracy standpoint I'm actually going from what I Believe the ... there's\nSomething wrong with you know we've had we've had too much of the samples are\nThe say hey he and and I and only\nA couple of examples he's outside the pocket\nHe's not throwing it away he didn't want to make that for her is hurting I'm telling you got something going on in a little something they're more\nAnd I don't know how to put in for work and how to articulate it but there's a little something for something else going on and I I tell you something else not only did he seems to be hurt me and it seemed to be thinking clearly which is probably um\nA roll down effect from being from being hurt I mean there is definitely something going on what your thoughts on that\nI I've heard that none of the coaches will ... express any kind of issues ... yeah well I mean he yeah actually had some sort of rug burn issues last week in had ice in rap and all that on it\nOr last week after uh the Kansas game which is understandable but I don't think that would be the issue that would cause that problem but I'm not going to completely dismiss what you say uh you know will may not even admitted to a lot near some self image trying to be a tough guy in ... you appreciate that but uh they're ... they're you know I\nI don't know I don't know that there is an injury\nBut I won't say that you were completely wrong either I I don't know one way but um you know decision making I don't I don't know obviously there were things he he needed to do from a decision making aspect that he did not do but I think he looked down there and for the first time I didn't\nIn wide receivers running open in wasn't quite certain as to how to attack that and he's still trying to figure out a way to make plays in all of a sudden you know safety blanket David cells are Gary Jennings and then the big guy and it mark assumes none of those guys\nAre close to open and he's not a guy that likes to eat football and throw it away at least not with regularity and it's probably what he says and quite often and they just didn't have a whole lotta\nShot opportunities\nAre John pre she had to call but a good thought there were six fifty five on the show at eight hundred seven six five eight to five five one eight hundred seven six five talk is the uh the phone number to what's called in and chat with us a couple of tax for we go to break\nUp from the some of those three will still have the opportunity to win the big twelve title head coach needs to take control the office Greer needs to be challenged on his game management you'll need that skill in the NFL\nI'm Still all in kind of smiled when the Iowa State fan stormed the field that was the ultimate compliment to our big time football program it was a big deal to them hope our players noticed go mountains\nUm question about the Drake hits and the severity of his injury again I don't know I'm can only speculate first meeting opportunity smart as being over some but we know how that goes usually on injuries but\nOn their ... or ... or at least I I I'll be at the conference call and then be there the ... and again it like a lot of things in today's a world especially in the college football world or this isn't just directed at Dana but finding out a injury information on players getting opportunities to\nInterview more than five people\nOr is that thing in the past ... you know I I'd love to be able to know what what exactly is up with pets Letty brown\nWhen Joe Brown actually will have a realistic chance to play all those type of things that that people would like to know I'd love to be able to report those who you are but we're not given an opportunity to get through questions are two answers\nTo those questions in again not just West Virginia\nOr it starts with\nUh the guy who grew up just down the road and ... I mean he's the ultimate ... in controlling the message and because he's so successful and he does it everybody copies what he does\nA text from a thrill for stats don't lie ... company coaching staff mediocre if fast\nHad years to see it developed thirty percent winning percentage in the big twelve versus power five teams with a winning record under ... we start playing quality teams rest of the schedule and I don't look forward to get any better\nOr another uh West Virginia tech from mayor to a to both teams playing on the\nSame field don't find excuses for an average team was an excuse it was an observation that it was a legitimate lobster yeah I Would say slip some too I mean the end you know ... of blame equipment guys maybe I don't know that we had to write cleats on I don't know but the fact of the matter is is that uh\nUh yeah both teams are playing on the same field but I was states used to playing on that field\nNow and he's not used to playing on true grass very much I'm ... years where I I didn't see any of the certain skill guys wearing you know the the longer screwing cleats onto the still use the\nUh there longer plastic yeah so what's your new is using the shorter molded cleats for the most part so maybe that was their issue they didn't think in the pre game that that was going to be a problem\nArts a final what's actually for the break to eight to ... it's all needs to go period totally and completely\nUnable to adjust his game further solidify that quote I Need to watch the film so he he's paid a pile of money and can't decipher what the defense is doing to his play calling in real time with a series of question marks\nI you know I I have to agree I to me from an adjustment standpoint looked like West Virginia to the same thing in the first step that came out and do the same thing in the second half and expect a different result yeah trying to find something\nDifferent and ... again ... got to be better just like all of them I mean I I like Jake great deal but uh you know that wasn't that wasn't a performance gonna bring confidence from a lot of people\nAre bright protect more phone calls coming up bill John\nTom Phil will take your calls when we come back plus some more taxes and our second our three or four talk three oh four tightening up between the rams are the Broncos Broncos backed within seven ... on the move with for\nThirteen to play in the fourth quarter they have the ball at the bronco twenty eight yard lines ... continues from the green turtle\nYour home away from home during the football season come up on college football Saturdays or stop by and\nSee them a check out their delicious menu next Thursday night here for game night in Morgantown sports like continues after the\nMetro news isn't just radio it's a multi media company that uses powerful tools like television radio and the Internet to help regional and state wide businesses brand and grow\nTheir mortgage our website nobody would be my produce dot com boasts an average of over six hundred sixty thousand you monthly visitors were three point three million average monthly pain to be this allows our advertisers to brand themselves with people who depend on WB dot com for their\nDaily news sports and the latest government affairs experienced metro news consultants developed digital advertising campaign set off or aggressive creative digital strategy including geo Benson and search sites and can\nTextural returned to drive traffic to your website these proven digital strategy is rebuilding highly qualified leading increased customer base where your email in at W.

that's a you know to say this team is better than what they actually ours is ... ... it's not dark hurts a lot losing quickly as badly as we did our should read you know if I Want to say if I Want to be optimistic can I say we were wearing on the field\nAnd uh you know we're really didn't have the trucks are and we need and next time or at home it's going to be better and that has something to look forward to ours are or are we got big issues obviously we've got issues in the sense of lime and my second question would be what do you think about a\nCoach work Warren and what he's done a has he done enough to keep his job\nYeah well you know dean is ultimately the guy that decides all those those issues I I thought that um you don't ... early in the season I was crediting Joe wick line and even last year with developing strong past protections in keeping will were really clean\n'em but the run game hadn't been real assistant under Wilbur not as much as it was under wrong crook but uh the past ... has been better\nBut certainly the last couple of games that now seems to be an issue in and again I mean I hate to point the finger just one guy but there's a glaring error you know spots\nGuard that it's been a huge problem in everybody's attacking that area every blitz comes through that area I'm In West Virginia king get healthy there uh get ... indoor Joe Brown back in there fulltime ... played a few plays brown didn't play at all\nUm can you get better I'm just that simply I don't know but uh certainly like to see what's going to get the best guys back on the field\nJoe I jump reshape the call or text from a sick say one area code Travis and\nGreg is Dana coaching for his job for the rest of the season\nUm well you know if bill's worry comes to pass in West Virginia doesn't want another game then yeah that could be you could have a coaching change I Would tend to think right now the way you're at financially again if the bottom doesn't completely fall out maybe that changes and\nAnd and who knows but I'm a I I think that it's the decision that\nMany programs making that is are you ready to start over\nI'm not saying that they don't overspend is Vince Lombardi with the guys five in one this season with a number Thirteen team let's not panic after a while I mean if we you know if things go south and well we're we're talking about hot seats\nAt the end of November that's a different story but here in mid October and now that that doesn't make any sense to me\nA text from a four to three area code off its according or has no answers what about using more than one backs of the time multiple tied ends\nI've seen real rare thrown a tighter windows I don't think I think with all the ... and those interceptions he was struggling defense struggled but she'll be able to win without performance just couldn't get to ...\n... a hundred and they didn't they didn't have struggles trying to get to him but um you know I get in West Virginia ... use multiple tied into at times um they don't typically use multiple back so they haven't done that for a few years occasionally they'll show that look but it's\nIt's a rarity but again that their strength through the first five games it's been throwing the football I mean ... ... again you want a reasonable rushing performance but\nYou've got to where you are because you were thrown for three hundred and fifty a game and so that's what you're trying to accentuate\nA six to nine\nSays uh okay this is Justin from Bridgeport is that um\nLet's see I'm Sorry and make sure that said no no and I just read or is it just may or by the stats could scholar our actually have better numbers by the end of the season thing\nOr by the end of the season that will rear and how does Greer only get Fifteen passes off in a whole game well ah the reason he got Fifteen passes off in the whole game as one you only at forty two off it's a place you know and the other reason is\nHe at ten Russia's seven of which were sex so that is seven more opportunities that you you would have had to throw the ball would have been twenty two\nYeah and I'm ... of the I mean the other three Russia's we're\nProbably at least two of those were scrambles them and it may have been one designed no option run or something in there but uh you know they just didn't have no place to get any kind of rhythm and they they couldn't um sustained rise\nAnd said five places the longest drive one one of three and third down conversions they you know you start seeing and drives all sudden everything starts working for you but uh the way that was he couldn't throw the football more than Fifteen times because you didn't have it or not\n[noise] a six four zero\nIs the exchange for the tax remind me of the ... game Thirteen either we have to go there when we ran the same six to seven plays all night it was like they knew exactly what we were going to do was the worst effort since the Thirteen to nine ... game\nA different places are being run I mean different routes were being run a different runs were being called but yeah you're right I mean it was it it looked all the same because it was all the same results\nYeah and ended up St Paul roses and since ... forbid he went on to become the head coach that I was being now he gets a now he's no longer at Iowa State but that I don't know why I don't yeah I Am I going to be\nYou yeah get your sample hat on here for eight three like I said in August when I predicted seven wins Jake gets out prepared now to Justin\nBut good defensive coordinators and wit blind cannot coach run blocking and\nI think that guy text that every single week on a job where wind can't coach run blocking and uh you know unfortunately another another week where the you know the numbers bear out\nOr not Joe with lines coaching ability but\nUh the rushing totals were not good when you carry the ball you attempt twenty seven carries one point nine yard for Kerry average now of course in fairness the backs Kennedy McCoy was six yards per pop and more tell by the way it was a for the sec numbers bring\nThat down you know it was an odd rushing game obviously the numbers tell you it was it wasn't great but he popped a couple of big one yeah only six and sixteen yeah but you know it was negative sixty from will grow that brought you down to under a hundred but they were able to pop a few but again it's just in seeing in in doing that with\nRegularity when so often you were getting a light box um just didn't\nYou know you should have been able to do that even more than ultimately they did because there were times it was often a foreman box and West Virginia could run into it\nA travesty coach on or what was the time of possession well it was as you would expect our state thirty seven minutes Twenty one seconds to West Virginia is twenty to thirty nine so\nBasically Iowa State had the ball for an entire quarter more than West Virginia look at the first court\nHas said nine minutes for West Virginia in the first quarter after that for forty seven five o seven and three thirty\nSeven so um you know less than Thirteen minutes in uh the final forty five\nA fourth quarter was was the worst eleven twenty three to three thirty seven and time a possession\nArt thanks for the calls and the tax keep rolling in will head back to the phone lines coming up here in just a couple of minutes Phil smitty Nick and Scott we'll talk with you you've got a ton of a tax coming into and we'll get to all those in the next thirty nine minutes we promised will of\nBlew a blow through the rest of 'em here three or four talk three or four is a number of attacks worth the green turtle sports like a ... to the top of the hour WB Metra news dot com and on about your news radio network back in the moment\nSo [noise]\nTo imagine a world without all the news and okay then people would look like in without ... based power plants we wouldn't have reliable the electricity electricity prices rise local\nCommunities would lose jobs in our national economy which over so yes we can imagine a world without it it's pretty scary things to\nWean code based electricity\nFor reliable\nThrown jobs they contribute to a strong us and\nGlobal competitiveness\nThat's why coal they used to say this to our energy solutions now and for many years to come\nBy a\nNo money every school sports in the mountains in states like new mother or your favorite team up all night long am I gonna schools more it's going to sign a nicer for law and\nBryan Singer and Jane Hanlin Saturday morning get a final scores stories and more on school scoreboard our ranking I mean I\nThe city that seemed why sports line continues in two minutes on metro news voice of West Virginia\nI had ... young yeah there are issues there but I don't want to panic at this juncture yet\nLet's see if this continues for a long period a longer period and then\nYeah Tom you mentioned uh feel position from the special teams and you're spot on a you looked at Iowa State they started drives it's around thirty nine thirty five forty seven forty one thirty four\nForty four on the night while West Virginia or outside of the sudden interception um started I'm twenty five twenty four twenty five twenty eight Twenty one twenty nine eleven twenty five and eight so\nThe ... and nobody tells us anything um but um I Believe ... got a bit of a knee injury situation he taped up\nPretty heavily so I think that explains soon as ... funding problems early um the pooch kicks by Evans daily I Believe or by design\nIn the first quarter basically because they were going into the wind and they didn't think they could get the ball I'm into the end zone he did have some touched backs later I'm so again sort of a mixed\nBag in that regard [noise] yup I'm\nAppreciating call a question from Brian in Martin's Bert something we talked about earlier as will revert doesn't seem like himself a again Brian I'm no facts\nThe evidence of that meaning that\nWill not send anything the coaches haven't said anything but again a knowing West Virginia is a current history with a letting injury information league um there's a possibility he is hurt and you know they don't know where they're not saying\nA but something's not right I mean we know that certainly didn't play with themselves and looks slow to watch\nYeah you know didn't know that was the indecisive and he was ... is there an injury to cause part of some of that and it could be I but I don't know I don't want to sit here and T shirts because I'm not positive with that but I'm not going to dismiss that possibility either\nA question from the five fifty or observation I've also noticed that will ... doesn't seem like a sideline leader when things are going bad not just this past week he goes and sits on the bench sometimes by himself he would never see a Baker Mayfield are doing that\nYou know a quarter of you know again the players don't have to be ...\nOr to be to be leaders are at times and you know\nI'm not a quarterback some more typically cerebral not necessarily the the out front guy that he's not dealing with mark Bolger didn't say boo to anybody and he still does it for the most part uh unless he's currently\nA but you know that's a that was that works really well for mark so you got to be who you are um but that doesn't mean you can't lead in it and that's not saying that he doesn't need to go out and you know\nThat's the people on the back or kick them into butter or whatever needs to be done you\nKnow that's a little like back to the phones Phil from wind field home of the general still good evening walkman\nHey traveling Greg you know what I'm Down here visiting my in laws in Greenville South Carolina\nAnd the claim some people are still ... so it in the way it is [laughter] but you know what\nThey feel they have seen they seem to do All right since then\nI you know what ... they got me in Trader Joe's today and they were like hey where you weren't at West Virginia stuff I see here what Trayvon just scored shot a [laughter] a good job\nBut here's the deal you know what we are no longer the hunter where the hunted we need to grow up and these guys need to quit our own line got our butts kicked it ain't no difference in our state and Penn State the first time we can stay\nWe played a crappy game will Greer is still one of the best quarterbacks in that country we had a bad game guys get the free over we haven't really played anybody that challenge this last grow up we gotta wait for prayer let's go kick\n... bought and go on right let's forget about it and go on\nDo you need to do and a half to yeah I mean there there's going to have to\nYou can't go back in when now I mean ... that was over so I you know I get it right the ship would\nYou hey if we take if I were state had to reset button with rock party do you think they'd be three in three right now\nThere are certainly rocky hours early with ... yep yep\nSo less buck up and we still can win the big twelve I don't know what everybody's wandering about we had a bag gang it happened\nBeat Baylor we saw TCU struggled taxes isn't great\nFor Russia's when the big twelve and go on right\nSounds good which you're playing for ... sounds good to appreciate the call a seven thirty eight let's talk with the committee in Charleston my could even\nThey fell on them they were hurt so most complaining somebody rag thirteenth on the country\nWell I mean it was pretty I mean I I Know my you're you're one of the biggest amount of your fans I Know but you have to admit that that was a pretty bad performance\nAlert there's no question about it but I mean as bad as we played\nA in the third quarter until the fourth quarter we were still in that game all we need to touch down and those those things just happen I I'll guarantee I told the screener that our state and party will never play a game like that they did Saturday Night again the rest of the year\nThey made every play they made every ...\nThey didn't miss anything we never got to the quarter of a I don't know how many times on the on the blitz and that we almost got to the guy they just they just have one of those nights and I really felt great I I go long as you're given a deep bench\nA C because they stayed on the field the whole third quarter\nI mean what what we run five plays in the third quarter\nYeah something like that and in the defense get them within shouting distance at that point they were the only reason West Virginia was only downsizing until the fourth quarter\n... but I think there was a problem I think there was a problem with the shoes\nI hate to sound like you know you know that but they I I watched the guys running a lot of routes and they never did track runner out there running life circles trying to get back around so I I I Will give the dawn the day and\nThey want to quit and it got little I'm I'm curious if somebody if they'll if they'll ask Dana tomorrow night only show about that because there was a big voting issue for us 'cause we fell down the whole the whole game\n... as I said there were there were slippage you know again that they were playing on the same field but one thing I I don't think they had to show this week because the open we so you'll have to wait for the press conference on Tuesday there's also a big twelve a teleconference tomorrow that maybe we can get a question or two in\n... All right thanks guys\nAre too many three sheets call we'll we'll get some more calls are coming up we're in the home stretch here last twenty minutes\nOf the programs and mix Scott in Jason hold the line we'll talk with you\nGot to blow through some tax will do that are coming up as well just like touching the five nutty shake cable tackles people he reminds me up Scotty Jericho you shake Campbell played a extremely well last night in place of a deal and talk or eat or Shays limitation however comes more in past coverage\nYeah though I thought you know he him playing it in the middle I'm where he doesn't\nQuite as athletic he can just be a you know a guy that runs some tackled a tackle and mixed apples um I I thought that he pretty well I thought he did a good job I didn't see him get exposed at all like maybe he did a couple of times when he was playing outside linebacker earlier in the year\nUh seems like sixty percent of West Virginia's recruiting his own\nAnd it ... be yet last dominant opposites of line West Virginia had rich Rodriguez was the coach and defensive backs can't cover anyone you got a good number of them go on to the NFL and stick on rosters which means our coverage schemes are terrible\nI mean Karl Joseph\nNye or what the point is is he saying is the yeah the ... and those two guys were good yeah your\nKids are doing now and go through a whole lot of the ... in that you know which is West Virginia get creamed drop in terms of recruiting do they they don't they've gotten to the players of the years the ... you need more and uh they've got enough now you get them healthy I think that that'd be thing I'd like to see more than anything at this point\nUh Clint cricket fold the medical staff and played well because remember the hit to the head against Kansas so yeah I mean it happens so you know players players can play hurt\nNo and they don't they're not under you know any and take a lie detector test\nBut on their home they'll come up yeah they are you feeling okay uh two six six with the three three five stack is it normal for the defense events to crash at not keep containment anyone can run outside on us watch closely in all of our ... crash inside thoughts\nAre depends on what the the actual scheme coverages for that sometimes they'll play they'll play him wide sometimes they'll crash but usually you'll see the the linebacker behind them\nOr do the opposite right you know so there is that he did to go outside linebacker oh we'll cover the inside gap live on the line comes hard down inside the linebacker is going to have outside responsibility\nIt's very clear to me that the teams have completely figured out this off into scheme plus West Virginia can't run the ball period the whole team was enough of the game of steps shake Campbell and that falls on coaches a meanwhile for a one or this is the um\nTo deal with ... to make you know I don't want to make some bad place here because I'm a let people down they built this husband yeah you know campaign for me and uh\nYeah it is odd that it you know I mean he's a he's a smart no yeah ballplayer Egypt coach's son so he's he's been coached there was like throw the ball\nAbsolutely um and the other aspect it did I see this I mean obviously West Virginians had some struggles to last\nPrior to this scheme and a half but uh to the extent we saw yesterday no I I was just as much in in surprised as it happened I mean even Kansas which obviously was bad\nWe talked about the turnovers but I yeah I'm going off of memory here but I I I think I'm right West Virginia had twelve possessions in that game ten of them got inside the Kansas forty five\nI'm now three of them were turned away and the red zone because of\nTurnovers and there was also a fumble deep down there so West Virginia to score authors but but the audience was moving up and down the field that will not be a again that was Kansas um Texas Tech was obviously is such a huge first half\nUm you could almost understand a little bit of let down in the second half but to be completely stone wall like that\nWas a surprise um again there may have been some office", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "14"}
