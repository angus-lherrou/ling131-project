some time to learn and get better so uh we we've battle through that and the kids are getting better week by week day by day and I'm hopefully we start to get a few that got back\nAJ how confident are you that you can get some of those guys back and do you you had a a a rash of injuries sets David the concerns among some other guys does the by we come at a perfect time and do you hope that after this week you have a chance to get some of those guys back\nYeah that's a goal um we lost really a three of our best players on the football team they were all three way starters\nAnd it looks like a we're going to get to those guys back hopefully in time for east Fairmont [noise]\nAh you know like you said the by week's coming out a great time for so we're using this week\nYou know keep working on fundamental things and and and also have fun and got a lot of competition in practice right now on the day we had an ... squad scrimmage and uh it it looks like we want to have a Davis and McIntyre who's are starting inside linebacker and leading tack learn author full back so\nI think we're why those guys back for the rest of the year\nAnd ah but yeah it's been great experience for these young guys and it's going to be very very beneficial for us down the road and I'm I'm excited about that\nIt's not going to go to Jane Harman those liberty Harrison mountaineers in in Asia as you mentioned now you do have a by we coming up this week what's it like uh as far as your practice schedule you give kids some time off or or you go real light to try and get them together every day what's your schedule with my week\nNah I mean honestly uh we have so much work to do that there's really we we don't we can't afford days off right now so\nMonday was just normal day for us we're like in an air and lift them and get our film Enron and you know usually we'd walk or a little bit for our town next week when I Do at this week the wider news on last night uh\nWe were having a great practice until the thunder and lightning lightning started on this kind of cut us off but ah the kids we did some fun stuff\nIn the locker anger China wait out the lightning but it didn't look you know we can get back out there in a tonight we had the inter squad scrimmage and\nThat was fun little red versus blue thanks so won't finish up the week and hopefully continue to work on the basic thing and just get better at what we do we're not\nNever been to the kind of program to install a bunch of crazy things and and do that we just want to continue to get better be in a\nWhile and and so I think Joe kind of mentioned it's a little bit too so you get the all week here coming up in a week seven after the first six weeks sounds like that might come with the about the right time and they knew chance to get some more working with these younger players and get some other guy sealed up\nProbably not exactly how you thought it was going to come into week seven at the three and three record but probably pretty ... gland the week this week\nYeah definitely um you know the rest of our\nWe got some good teams coming up in east Fairmont another record some scores are given up a can be the saving 'cause we have one game film from them earlier in the year against graft done and and you know they're scrappy I think they're young to catch on a good job trying to build that program and all with RCB and\nAnd Louis County coming up in the south Harris and there's not always going to be a dog fighting in a year a week seven was a great time for us to get a bye week especially with a situation we're in health wise and you know we're going to try to use this to advantage the best we can't\nWhat's your numbers looking like this year they just\nIt's actually the most we've ever had a since I've been involved with liberty high schools and uh you know in two thousand ah we've got forty nine kids on her last year this year and\nI'm very pleased that the bad thing is we've got new uniforms we only or forty five [laughter] trying to\nFigure that out there in his youth and drawn up hurt anybody's feelings are fully but um you know that's a good problem I have\nNo say okay I got to have at least four

coach and the\nJoe you were around that area for a long long time with Eighteen years or so and I know you\nHave a a great relationship with those coaches but hey Jay he's the kind of guy that he just likes to get in there and his he said kind of keeps it simple just want to get better at what they do\nThere and get better as something that they've done each year he inherited a team that didn't win a single game the year before they went five his first year six seven nine last year get to the quarter finals and you know this year to get to nine is certainly as it's unlikely that would have to make it very deep run into playoffs but\nUh you know that's a program that's on very from from sitting right now from footing right now in a mountain in football program certainly on the rise\nAnd you see that don't you because like you said Joe ... and ... charm and talked about didn't have enough jerseys for all the kids that come out and I was thinking that's a byproduct of back to back playoff

I Know this is a a soccer program into soccer club that chemistry in unity really seems to be one of the keys for the hawks this year\nYeah I mean we got a lot of young guys on the team but ah everybody we have a really strong starting lineup and we got to a couple of guys that come off the bench who really strong\nSo I mean we have depth and together the team I mean we have a really good bond on this team and a lot of skill and then we just bring it into the game and I mean in our results show for it so\n[noise] judgments as they've just mentioned do you guys windy Ovie ac five eight title last week against wheeling park at wheeling island stadium one to nothing in overtime goal kind of talk us through that goal what was the set up on the play and how did you ultimately executed\nUm\nThey threw it into Brock picket and brought it showed off a defender and laid off back to Mason Mason took it down a line and put it in a amazing cross and then um I just had it passed their goalie and we want\nIt's amazing I didn't understand a word he said five to ... to ... by the way a Joseph just so you know it uh Dave Jacqueline as the soccer guru this crew but let me ask you this you are right now as we mentioned undefeated top ranked triple a team in the state\nUh back in what was it twenty sixteen you finish second as runners up in the state but is this the year is this you can look ahead you're not they'd go you can look at it this year in your mind that maybe university gets that big trophy in Beckley coming up\nThere's nothing I Want more and the whole world than to leave my senior year of the state championship and a ring on my finger and I really think that this is our year\nI mean I've never been more confident but you I mean being confidence not always a good thing so we're we're we're being smart or plain each game as it is and we're going to see how are the season takes us I mean we got five more games left in the season to a playoff\nOr folks that are getting better each game and then when the playoffs it and we're going to start hammering every team we can plan our best game and we really think we can win it but we're going to be smart and are not going to get too confident\nAs I look through some of these box scores and kind of read through some of these game recapped especially the last couple of weeks everything I keep seeing his\nJokes to be a four and maintenance Shockley Mason Shockley just to be a for either on the assist on the cross that led to the game winning goal in overtime begins wheeling park but you know obviously talking about the one hundred school of your career last week for ... man Mason Shocklee is right there and everything that uh\nAnd they've all stuffed up and different roles in different situations and they're well prepared and take a leadership role what we're trying to do and what you're trying to get better each week and see what happens\nBall club is born to with the two losses Fairmont senior and Bridgeport for R D be this year and kind of mixed in between with three wins and then a win last week against a very good Lewis county team so Lewis county and Bridgeport the last two weeks the six point loss to the Indians than a four point win\nOver Lewis county coach what did you learn about this RCB team over the last couple of weeks\nThe biggest thing that we've come away with that we're just going to focus and we had a tough week last week I'm a big ball game with work\nAnd which we we uh we have no mistakes to really a bad situation\nTo to kind of give the getaway take nothing away from Bridgeport they played extremely hard there are a great football team but we feel like we're we're up to five minutes to go we should have closed out mats mental lawyers and the young kids make the mistake that much on the coaching staff it is one of them\nWe came back into Louis County we focus a ball game it was kind of increased out because if we uh we we drove down to win the game on the final job and really I Am proud of the kids\nWhy they respond to a diversity I think that's the key and they really focused on what we're trying to do in these last four or five weeks\nDuring by Robert Byrd head coach Josh grown coach a couple of games last year very close games went the wrong way on you but you got one of those games in your favor this year going back two weeks three\nYour ad ties are you able to hold on for a twenty to fourteen victory for you guys to get to where you want to be in the postseason picture how important was that result back and wait three\nBullets use force number one from the standpoint of confidence and being able to realize that you could go play good football team and on the road and then we had a rain delay and the kids they focus to repair and came out really performed well you know I'm Out of the first six ball games that we played on the road we played really\nFor all the ball club uh Fairmont west and British Fort Lewis counting cars are are all really good ball clubs and we've we've been physically challenged and mentally challenged with the kids have responded\nAnd the biggest thing going forward is that we want to make sure that we're working every day to get ourselves better stacking days back and practices we talk about that all the time the season we really just want to focus on ourselves and continue to grow and get better\nJosh team you've had to focus on this we can practice in Elkins ball club that's that's two and three\nBut when you look at the games they've lost a okay I get why there are two and three uh what do you see when you look at the tigers right now\nWe've got two great running back to the extremely hard and you know there are ... long civil when they're going to come out they're going to hold on just sweep you they're going to track to run our so defensive weighs about a ... a family mecca shoulder picking the right it's a\n... just the right approach to what we're doing mentally we've tried to get a lot of mental reps of field work in this weekend and we preach to the kids that are aligned correctly\nAnd make sure that we follow the guards and and our our workers correct you know don't want to get caught with your eyes of the backfield because of the Mr ... so that's the biggest thing that we've worked all their physical ... the place of quality teams we we've got to come in friday night prepared and ready to play with strapping on\nNow I look at the bank field I see the youth and\nThe veteran javahn Davidson six to two hundred and five pounds senior Jeremiah king six one two oh five a freshman talked about how they complement each other in this RCB backfield\nLower blood first of all we're blessed to have to call the young men like we have run into football and the five guys we've got our front are really good so\nYou know gee has been doing this for four years now he understands what we're trying to do he's really kind of taken reminders Wang and German miles responded extremely well a germ mouths going to be a tremendous back the next\nThree and a half years for us ah we know that going into it and they're both similar style runners their downhill they're able to hit the corner and runs stretch but they really seen once it gets a shoulder square around power would run inside zone\nThey really stick their foot my one cat jumped cut and go and they're powerful they're big kids they're extremely intelligent\nThe leadership roles are German my take on a great leadership roles of freshmen are very proud of him and we can only got everybody says well we're going to get the G I mean he's going to come out and run a hard and play a song levels do we need to in order for us to be successful so we're blessed to have those two young men\nDavidson king obviously great combo evaluate your passing game as a whole if you would you got your second year starter in sophomore Xavier Lopez running things Bryson Lucas has taken some steps forward on the receiving game and obviously interest Managua has been a known quantity for a number of years now\nSure and really what we talk every week we go into it you know we're not going to talk about trying to hit the homerun won't take what the defense allows us to have if they're going to give us the out in the hits is on the fly at the mall take that they're going to come up in prices were going to mess around and pick up the ball shot here and there were willing to folks and on you know the numbers they give us in a box\nOr we're not really worth folks from trying to be vows to or yeah with him when he's run of all twenty five women just throw twenty we're going to take what the defense gives us we're going to put our kids in the best situation to move the ball\nBut points on the board when the ball game\nBecause there's not a great job physically and mentally they share preparing himself he's growing leaps and bounds from last year really understands Wilbur gone with what we're doing so I mean I feel very comfortable for get into a situation\nWhere have you got to throw it twice offer thirty times we can go when the football game doing that but again the biggest key for us to just to take what their make sure we're moving the ball and and doing good things with it and I think we're going to be fine\nJosh ... is it fair to say that a Robert Arnold ... is just a tank\nAbsolutely uh both sides of the football you're talking about a kid but four years of hard work and work extremely hard in a way for him great student great family just a great kid the whole way around he's going to get opportunities at the next level to go play\nHe's a physical kid um he understands west hand crank it up and go on and he's been a great leader maybe not so much vocally but just because his actions in in a way prepares himself\nAnd the way conducts himself on and off the field I couldn't be any more proud of the kid or just a great role model for us in just a great kid to have in the community and on the team and he's going to always represent himself and us extremely well\nThose aren't the bee club with my account correctly only has about six seniors\nAre not an overly old team just sixteen years on the ball club they sophomore quarterback or a freshman in the backfield going along with John Davidson would categorize this is kind of a young and building team or just the kind of bantering of some upper class spin on it\n[noise] well we think we would play too many fresh for the last year and everybody knows that um I think we've got enough guys play enough quality games now to where they're in a situation too I I consider them up a craftsman me yes we've only got six seniors yes we're young ball club still\nBut those guys play a lot of reps have taken a lot of that they've been in some difficult situations it had to face adversity so going into this thing I think that we are veteran ball club even though we're still young obviously we've got great leadership out of our six seniors they've done a tremendous job\nAnd I think the teachers really right for us going forward in the program but I really expected him out and do what we're supposed to do and a half of our busy sex four or five weeks and get in the playoffs and and hopefully go make a rod I mean that's the ultimate goal\nYou got some challenges coming up in the back half your schedule a you know liberty team is three and three right now but when you see them they're probably going to get some healthy guys magna with Mary team that can put up a bunch of points you got this week\nBy we how do you use the by week to get ready for the back half of your schedule\nFirst before mice will violate ourselves all by ourselves down over the last six seven weeks while we're going to check our tendency\nOr if I wait where we are in the program and maybe we need to prove all along and change up some of our of the game plan and I know where\nYeah you don't want to come out we can awake out and getting the same group on and you have a tendency to do that kind of calm when you're successful run the football you're successful football you kinda get next thing where you're calling the same thing I don't want to do that our kids don't want to give her kids again that's opportunities a tree grows when we go forty program\nSo well with ourselves first and foremost um ... condition and will will they walk on the fundamentals of techniques that they got to eat anything I you know\nReally well for this whole thing is fundamentally you've got to be sound you got to understand what we're doing our trying to attack so fundamental to the guy you're waiting are so that'll be the biggest thing we're doing now\nAnd we'll get your ... want to give the kids are there to offer I think they deserve the rest of the law to walk over summer I mean you're talking about\nThe three week period and then in August in their kid gets a lot of walking already and we want to continue to grow but they also have the same time you know they're just a raft and folks on espncom with friends and that's key to exercise fresh corn and vote we already so I thought well actually you can like\nMy body a bust of luck to you this Friday night against the Americans tigers at home for you and or or we'll talk with you soon okay\nLook I really appreciate that they talk\nThere you go to Josh corral though it was Robert she birds flying eagles they are four and two and a good shot I get the shot or getting in that field a team that's for sure just in case you're wondering about the er American League\nWildcard game the Yankees you gotta to run home run from Aaron Judge and the bottom of the first\nAnd it's in the bottom of the second now they needed to nothing over the Oakland they you know you're up to date on that we can find a break come back we'll be joined by veteran head coach Freddie sign on those undefeated Bluefield leave or stay with us on high school sports mind\nAnd almost all the times with family I mean it's a lot of families or you know responsible hardworking people I mean I kind of thing and so it's just that we're blessed in that way because I Know people that you know they get their record deal and all of a sudden some cousin and they didn't even know comes out of the woodwork you know and\nI have not had on a I've got some cousins that I don't hardly know but none of them came out of the woodwork they stayed in the woodwork good for them so it's not looking for money and why I wouldn't mind seeing some of them but I mean I don't know I'm looking for money we don't even know you are so um it it's something everybody deals with I think you know you hear people like it a lot when this\nAnd and then crazy sets in and their family and or I I'll tell you where else I've run into which where they are and I fell\nPlayers man they got to make signing bonus and crazy comes out of the woodwork on them I mean they get some dysfunctional crap in their lives and it's amazing and are people who feel entitled to a piece of their success and it it it really is really isn't a homeless problem\nStephanie is with us from

want to get yourself in a pinch where the bank calling notes or that they're allowed them to call based on the way that is written in like that lack of liquidity is was it could put you in a problem

thousand dollars a year and you've got to turn those on line of credit it's probably a baby step to hide them uh the point is we want to work through the debt but we want to get on with return\nBut in an emergency fund in a reasonable paces well and a figure out where we are going from there so good question Matthew is in Daytona Hi Matthew how are you\nI'm In good and you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um how do I have for college and not go into debt\nOkay how old are you Eighteen Eighteen very cool what are you gonna study\nUm possibly um\n[noise] pretty much anything that I can get and who were ... I can\nI T yeah she said okay so you like technology yeah All right\nWell um I I think the first go before you go start your education process is you need to have an idea of what you're going to study because that will change the answer to your question that you asked okay so let's say for instance that you wanted to be a Web programmer\nAnd um I've got folk guys on my team that make 'em\nIn excess of a hundred thousand dollars well in excess of that that that are right ruby on rails code\nOkay not a bad career and uh that's an example of an IT type of thing okay and Web programmer writing code now\nIf you're going to do that you would not need and it would not be preferable for you to get a four year degree in information technology that's not necessary to do that\nYou would need to take some classes on how to code and you'd want to learn you know some of the basic IT things and so I Would probably direct you towards a vote tech type school\nOr which is probably a two year degree while you're studying and everything that and I would tell you to work your tail off in the technology field uh and if you can\nUh you know bring coffee for people who are doing code and just watch over their shoulder and learn from them and hang out from them and you're a new hobby is hanging out with people who are world class code riders voters then uh you know and you're taking some classes that'll get you and they're more than a four year degree will get you and then it's a lot cheaper\nBut it depends on what I mean when you say ... but you could change your mind about I'm ... I'm not going to do I T I Want to go into business well then you might want to do a four year degree with a degree you know the specialization in marketing or finance or something like that and in that case the answer would be different on how to pay for it here's the thing you want to the number one\nCarefully select what it is you want to study and that it makes your eyes light up when you talk about it you kind of smile down inside when you talk about doing this\nThing whatever the thing is okay you know once you've selected that then you decide how to study it if it's a four year degree if it's a two year vote tech degree\nOr am I going to go to a community college for two years and then go and those credits all transfer and then go to a regular school I mean for your school for two years to finish up or that kind of a thing\nCommunity college is a lot less expensive and you can get your basic side of the way for the first two years for a four year degree if you want to start the second thing once you've determined what you want to do and how you're going to do it then the second thing you do is college\nCost is the number one cause of student loan debt\nAnd mayor and what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a huge pickup truck\nBoth or transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of you know the mall\nAnd and so if you if you don't have any money and you're saving up you can't afford a Bentley you can't afford to go to a super expensive college and there's nothing wrong with that by the way I didn't go to a super expensive college so you go to an end state school\nThere in Florida you go to the University of Florida Gainesville or you go to University of central Florida right there in Orlando a wonderful ... wanna but wonderful both of them in state tuition not that expensive and uh that's thing one your college selection\nAs at the least expensive college that will help you get the degree that you need to get is what you need to aim at\nWith rare exceptions and you're not going out of state and you're not going super expensive private the second thing is then you start looking for scholarships and you make scholarship hunting your full time job\nOr an after school job that kind of a thing and you start applying for and filling out the scholarship forums and riding the essays and\nYou'd probably ask for a thousand scholarships and you'll probably get turned down for nine hundred and fifty of them but if you get fifty one thousand dollar scholarship she just went to school for ...\nThat'd be pretty cool not a bad part time job\nThe third thing is planning on working a lot while you are in school don't borrow money so that you don't have to work work\nAnd get good jobs jobs that pay a lot dog walking cutting grass jobs people don't want to do what they pay a lot to do I'm not talking about minimum wage crap and if you're going to live on campus go ahead and be an R. A. B. a residential advisor or written that's not what they call it what is an R. A.\nHow it is it is a resident about okay so there you know the the babysitter in the dorm okay and uh you get free dorm for doing that and sometimes free tuition for doing that and sometimes free tuition free dorm and pay for doing that she'll be an R. A. if you're gonna live on campus\nOr work in the cafeteria get free food do you live on campus if you can get a job working for the university the tuition might be completely free\nAnd that might be different to something to look at it so that's the kind of stuff you look at but figure out where you're going what the steps are to get their figure out the cheapest way to get their cigarette scholarships or somebody pays you to get there and then plant on working your butt off\nAnd those things will get you through school completely debt free in this day and time and it can be done Alex is with us in Baltimore hey Alex welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nAnd Mr Ramsey ... thank for everything that you do thank you\nI just wanted to give me a call and I didn't want to I Am that free I'm On baby step three I got five months saved up to my ... my fix my but here's my question and I work full time in a retail establishment and I have a small\nOkay so as I said earlier in the program I don't know anything about us see but I find that like it just in intrigues me and they've got\nThis massive massive battle coming up on a Saturday So uh Tony ... doesn't know anything about it and ... he does and he joins us on the program are doing first off how do you say the other guy's name besides McGregor\nUh that that would be Habiba ...\nPlus you okay so give us give us the skinny as to why this is such a big big fight\nThis is the skinny skinny of it is that uh\nYou're taking two of the guys in the most Activision which is wants to see firefighters cut way to get there so we're talking about the ... first and you know hundred eighty pounds roughly and they're they're simply the best\nAt what they do and you're completely different category so Carter Gregor everybody knows man he's got no Supreme countries our talk this\nProfound you know garbage before the match and then back it up and he's sort of did this in two years than um and then sort of sort of began by storms and leave the company no dollars ... century so meanwhile you have to be\nA here's this Russian guy who comes out on the sea he's undefeated which is unheard of and that he just takes people and the rest of them\nAround he smashes them so it's it's the matchup between the two styles of your standard boxing I'm Wondering in there as well as match that of wrestling so just to world colliding or and then to death guys probably they're fighting in the world right now\nYeah so I think that's probably a good sushi senator so here's the deal one guy fights one way or the other guy fights a completely different way so people are wondering which one's going to work and the other dude\nSo you've got army versus Oklahoma year round the triple option versus thrown around fly around different style\n... exactly what it is so like I'll be like when he gets the way he has his whole goal is to get them on the ground and basically he just suffocate people\nYeah exactly they'll just they'll do drowned them to pressure he'll just ... he'll he'll he'll use this song bow technique which is which is Russian of enrolling their limbs and just hiring them out and not being able to move and meanwhile where he's well he's constantly trying to gain position on you know just a bunch of new in the face of the entire time which manages to a really rare and guys you can imagine\nNow for those that don't follow this this was the guy that was in the boss that McGregor attacked\nUnderneath the Barclay center when he threw the or the through the the big metal thing through the window the bus right yes correct\nSo now they're coming and and uh and he said that when he gets McGregor on the ground he's not going to end it early he just gonna sit there and torture him and just keep talking\nThat's essentially what he does you're going to go on YouTube right now when he fought for a guy named Michael Johnson he just let them down and how to end up against the fence and that I'm so tired of the audiences\nYou you you have to give up you know just I have to fight for the title and has broken Russian and that's why all these sort of them to a a a cold sort of you are right now everyone's jumping on his back because he's he's frankly a culturally hilarious or not that way but it's just he's he's very direct and I think everybody can laugh broken English\nAll right so yeah we can so uh so who wins\nIt's such a tough call started taking that day and then they'll I can think of is can be goes in one of these takedown 's writers try to negotiate the clinch and Conor says it's dynamite less and and it can be over like that that's why it's so intriguing I think um it don't it it it ...\nIt can be over so quickly it's it's all I I don't want to say it's pointless to speculate that you have such a hard time taking all the factors into account\nWrestling is a superior style striking if you can maintain that I'm really all depends on a honors punching power and can be Jim ultimately has come down to\nWrite I'm into it man I Am again I I I don't know why it just makes me shake my head but I find it interesting that it's kind of like the old pro wrestling stuff right now what they talk so much trash it's unbelievable but yet the differences is real actually hitting more than for real for ... yeah oh yeah for real\nYou know that that was one part about there's so much on the line for such little payoff or Ninety nine percent of the people\nThey're doing this but they're they're they're totally willing to risk and also just like to watch a football players moral best basketball players in the world wants that spiders in the world and the stakes are high and the the it's intense\nAll right well we'll let you get back to your afternoon nap [laughter] so you take care areas so I guess we've dubbed I'm a resident UFC expert\nAndrew caress pretty good break down yeah I mean that's why that's why it's so intriguing it's just these two completely different styles\nAnd they hate each other I mean legitimately I mean it's not for the show you can just we saw the press conference I mean the things that macgregor was saying to him I mean it got involved in family it got involved in so many different things I find that completely completely\nI don't know what will you stay up no aggravating I tell you I Can't stay up past midnight you know that I'll find a way to get a tape and I'll watch it\nI guarantee you when I roll over in the middle of the night it's like three or four in the morning I'll hit my eye pad I Want to find out who wins it wouldn't be one of those things will be on my head all night or what about you would you have any interest at all you just like not on your shoulders none at all\nIt's still just haven't gotten in the ... there was a time that I enjoyed the boxing like\nMcGregor talk so much Mac yeah oh yeah I Do want to see this guy get them on the ground and torture\nWas Andrew was talking if you were watching the live stream that was the clip we're playing he had the guy against the fence yeah and and then was just punching him in the face\nWill you watch huh you you have all costs money no no no I just go to read it and get a restraining [laughter] and I say there's there's a budget wise you just go to read it just got rid of the guys will have it on Reddit\nDon't worry about that we should have stuck you know stuck you about that on that question I asked I think he would avoid there's action I think he would be in it'd be a big money's gone gone we should ask them send them a tax I'd like to know but at

opportunity to go out and\nAdd some teams not only from a football playing standpoint but also in all sports membership and we're\nPretty excited about what the future is going to hold for the mountain east conference on a number of friends that you know\nOriginal membership has lasted six years before any changes common as you are you guys well Noah ... you know you you lived it through your period of time as a as a player and shortly thereafter changes going to come to conference makeup and holding together a group of like minded institutions for as long as you can is what the goal is but\nAt times circumstances will change and you know and within that there's been some opportunity for them out east conference and uh\nYou know from our standpoint we're going to the uh uh in the majority of the overwhelming majority of our sports\nAre a geographic footprint is going to drink significantly football's going to be the only exception there and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment but on top of that\nAnd we're going to have two institutions coming in that have twenty two and Nineteen sports respectively and that's going to allow us to significantly increase the number of championship opportunities we can provide the student athlete that all of our school so\nI'll within two years we're going to go from having sixteen championship sports in our first year as a conference or six years ago to having twenty three championships in them out and eat and that will be just one short of the most championships than any conference in division two has so\nYou know considering the the role that a conference plays in supporting the missions of our institution increasing those opportunities to provide opportunities for the schools to then drawn more students in a it's a win win for for all of our institutions were very excited about the addition of prosper state I think that's going to be a a very\nNatural rival for Fairmont stayed over time they have some outstanding facilities particularly they're outdoor facilities are outstanding at\nA at prosper states and uh they're a little less than a just a little more than an hour from here so we're looking forward to prosper in states edition pending their acceptance into the NCAA division to membership ... front desk than we're very confident\nOr that they are going to be accepted done this coming summer though there's much work that they have to do we think they're well prepared for the rigors of the membership process and then on top of that David ... is going to be\nJoining are living in a full time basis they'll bring twenty two sports to the league they will have every conference championships for other than the one of football but how much they'll solidify all of our other conference championship sports was extremely valuable in there right in the middle of our footprint\nAnd then North Carolina Pembroke is going to join us for football when you look at the quality program they brought in their first ten years the essay program they made the in the playoffs in super region to one of the strongest super regions in the country three times in their first ten years the program\nAdd that to the Fairmont they the Charleston that have been the postseason experience ah I think we're going to be talking about a very deep\nAnd strong leg and we're going to have some uh some institutions they're going to be very motivated to chase that mountain east conference\nChampionship in football being the only sport where our schools are going to have to travel\nOr down south to Pembroke once every two years but in a high profile sports hopefully it will open up some recruiting opportunities are down in the Carolinas and expand the footprints in just one sport to give us a\nTo give us some access to down south and throw in there we're going to add championships an indoor and outdoor track and wrestling which a lot of people have been hoping for for a long time we're really excited about what the future holds [noise]\nI think is very uh for one good players to be able to get better exposure you're going to get to travel you mentioned [noise]\nAh you get to the bus down in North Carolina you got to get a different experience so or not only are you going to travel a to Charles and you're going to let that trip to take a take you to UVA why they get so just the overall experience I think it's going to be better off for division two athlete in this conference overall\nThe average trip in the league one way is going to drop from a a not including football where you've got that one sport where they're gonna have to travel once every two years down the Pembroke but in all of our other sports the average one way trip in his leg among fulltime members are going to drop from two hundred and two miles down to a hundred and sixty\nA little over a hundred and sixty and that's going to allow it to ... uh with our schedule them a lot more contests where student athletes are going to go over play come back we're going to miss last class our institutions are going to spend less money and travel which is more money that they can then put back into their program to\nRead at this point do you feel comfortable that the shuffling his his come to an end user is there a possibility of future expansion\nFor this but I don't know that there's any commissioner in the country that would say yes to that question [laughter] um but uh but but we certainly hope so and the the the best thing that you can do to guard against that is create a circumstance that institutions have so much that advantageous to them from travel\nTo to a similar way of thinking that that like minded that that we talked about among\nThe institution and if the league is very competitive and as many sports as possible you know I I my hope is that every institution that we currently have in the league just does not have a circumstance where\nAt Duvall rows your field Fairmont state and the Notre Dame college in his key match you up at Notre Dame rank twenty it's in the nation it's the first time and program history that they are ranked back to back week Wilson is a coin toss with the damn bar graphs\nAnd declare allow that so we can hear tales it's called of the coin flipping for the guy\nTale [noise]\nArts and Notre Dame college as one of the top and elected to receive the football and when you've got a running back like Jill McLaughlin why not put him out there first and get an opportunity to get your all fenced off to a good start\nYeah I

yellow McLaughlin are going to turn around and the ball out for him in that Fairmont state even going to be sent back waiting for it\nAre there we go Notre Dame and Fairmont states Rashid mentioned
