possible downside is all there and upside is very little\nIf you get to the point that he has extra money the weddings covered and he's debt free and he wants to pay on me that's just ... big pile of

MVP caliber regular season album slumped in the postseason aid for thirty nine which will keep pets do you think we'll see in the world series\n[laughter] well he's such a great player I Can't imagine the great Milky beds not showing up for this series is it two oh five\nIn this postseason proving again the degree of difficulty of this game this guy was arguably the best player in baseball all around this year and he hasn't done what we're used to seeing in the postseason\nI think he's going to break out in the series or a bunch of ... but it does it matter with him he has left these ride easy it's behind and account he hits with two strikes and I think this is going to be as if they need to coming out party this'll be ... bats in the world series\nVery nice that's encouraging buster only at Fenway Park it except for game one of the world series let's get to the pitching match up buster Chris Sale been nine days since we've seen them out there on the mound what are the expectations\nIt's hard to know because we don't know exactly what his health status is it's been interesting the last twenty four hours to talk to members of the Astros in the Yankees organization and they have so much admiration for sale\nBecause what they see as a pitcher who is really hurting they see a pitcher who's deliveries been altered by whatever's going on with the shoulder we see the fastball velocity but Chris Sale is made up his mind to plow ahead and did try to pitch with what he has which is much less\nThan what he typically has ... and we said this is the beginning of the Yankee series we said at the guinea the Astros series and the same is true in this game everyone at the outset of the game will be looking at the scoreboard to see what his velocity is\nBecause if it continues to go down and it has to start by start by start the last three times out\nThat tells this story about how he's doing how he's holding up physically if you see eighty Ninety Ninety One that's a big red flag for the red Sox\nAnd Tim Clinton Kurdish all last year game one World Series eleven strike outs know walks in seven innings what makes them so dominant\nWell what makes them so dominant is his understanding of the art of pitching because he doesn't throw as hard as he used to he doesn't have\nThat same jumped to his fastball that he had three years ago but to beat this good with his slider and his curve ball now to have this kind of understanding what he's doing and no matter what anyone tells you he's the most wily competitive picture that I've seen in some time the way he works at things and he's got the most career innings pitched\nA hundred and forty one in the postseason without a ring and don't think that doesn't weigh on him and he's been awfully good as the last seven post season starts three point three to E R a I expect him to be good tonight whether he's you know throw in Ninety three instead of Ninety eight\nMark has to share with buster only Tim

after you make the catch the other night did you ever get a chance to go back and watching a replay and what'd you think if you did\nI went inside so look at video the pitcher and they showed it on replay the TV's Rockland clubhouse I saw just a really cool moment something that I'll be able to carry with me the rest of my career and ah and my family happened to be there so I Know that was really exciting for them as well\nYou're talking to one of your coaches when you guys get to Fenway Park here for the workout on Monday said everyone was doing tons of reps in the outfield there what did you learn about plenty of feeling somewhat yeah we're just trying to\nGet a feel for the wall try to get a read on how the book and a bounce off and you know if it hits below the top half as really unpredictable so you know you just gotta kinda give us some days than than uh always be back in a centerfield left field in a store that might have to come out from time to time\nOh unusual from your perspective on his plate in a lot of parks is it playing the outfield there\nIt was very different plan left field you don't have as much they directed behind you you know so like I said I was going to come into play a lot and you just have to try to get married than BP and practice and they can\nFor sixty seven on base percentage in the postseason what do you feel like you're doing well I Wish I had an answer\nHonestly I think I'm just a simple fun at mechanical arm and a good spot right now so I Can't stand the ball better and are given myself more time to react to the\nWell

they weren't uh wear extra under sleeve maybe but other than that and I and I appreciate it Chris testing back to you\nKnow I busted Chris Taylor will bat fifth in the Dodger lined up all righty is in the Los Angeles lined up tonight I'm Mark ... baseball tonight on ESPN Radio in the ESPN ... World Series game one first pitch just after the top of the hour\nAnd let's talk about the Dodgers and the red Sox lineups LA led to the national league in runs scored Boston led the AOL and runs scored let's go inside the numbers brought to buy progressive home insurance getting a quote is easier than ever we woke him in ESPN's or ...\nAnd crush singleton both on the shelf pencil performance line from Fenway Park singing those light up switch team has the better line up\nUm I Would say the Boston Red Sox because of the fact that you know obviously you mentioned that each team respectively their league I'll let it runs per game but if you look through this postseason particularly if you've seen the red Sox grind out his bat hit the ball the other way shorten up and run scoring opportunities\nI think they can hurt you in a number of ways whereas traditionally with the Dodgers are you've seen them swing hit the you know it's a long ball and they can get into that swing vote 'em and not be able to shorten up and with writers and scored positions and get those runs across so I I definitely in that direction\nI tend to agree with you again and again it's about compact a Boston to deal with that we looked at the Eighteen hits they got what two strokes and the ... in the previous series this is what\nThey do they just grind out that they really just I'm a late into use in in so many different ways of swing and miss factor plays big for the LA Dodgers the matchups played big for them also and I think\nThat they found a lot of success in matching up with the lineups but we're going to see if there's a weakness now going against the Boston Red Sox especially starting staff that you could potentially see\nThree left starters going I'm going for them and what I mean by that is a water Rodriguez even though I Know even the Penn I still consider him that long guy that starter that could go through a lineup not wants to sometimes even twice\nMCI Boston makes a lot of contact how do you make contact with the breaking ball [noise]\nHow do you make contact with the ball will just that's just one look\nThis is what at its core brought to the\nBoston Red Sox has the same philosophy that they had in Houston where they made a lot of contact last year they can adjust according to pitchers Judy Martinez plays a big part of this also his philosophy the way he studies pitchers\nOf bacon adjust to high ball pitchers low ball pitchers and most importantly they commit to one side of the plate this is something to that not to last year but this year they have and I think the addition of Judy marching as his top them to do that in in a very special way that we were that we're seeing so far for\nA single ... with us from Fenway and sing a talked about it off the top of those outfield dimensions Fenway as very quirky how does that affect this game\nWell I I think it's definitely gonna affect the Dodgers in you know first even before we get to the outfield configuration when you look at just the handful of guys that I've ever played a game here at Fenway Park I remember going back to two thousand Thirteen when the St Louis cardinals came in and\nThey'll look on those guys faces so many of 'em that had never stepped into this atmosphere and it is it there's nothing like it in baseball I mean you could say that New York rivals in its own way but Fenway to me I mean this is like this is the place where you're going to experience\nI'm such a well rounded balance of passionate fans and so much history in this part so that is going to be the first thing for me then you take the outfield and yeah absolutely what's going to have to happen is backing up on every place for the Senate feels it can be really busy that he's got to go hard on every bottle that every all the right making sure that if it's miss played\nHe can back it up and keep perhaps in extra base it from turning into a triple or inside the park homerun\nChrist that does happen to you because it happened to me the first time I played you and I grew up here for three years as my dad played also with the red Sox from eighty to eighty two you see that law and it's really close and if you've never played here you can fall into that trap\nWhere the picture now starts to attack your aggressive in trying to pull the baseball and this is where ... which is behind the plate tonight basket when he gets to be behind the plate here they will exploit when they see the hitter especially where they stand in the play the rest of them is on pitches inside you'll see a lot of foul balls hit\nTo the pool side and if you see a lot of ground balls the law to roll over to the pool so\nThat means that's where they're going and sometimes by the time you figure it out it's too late so not having batting practice today also plays into it I Know they were out here yesterday but the first day you're like oh the second day you're like OK I Want to try and my approach they didn't have time to try that approach so it's going to be interesting to see\nThat and it also you know from yesterday you had the workout nobody's here ... you get game day BP there it's that next level getting closer to game speed which they\nDid not get today and I think and I agree with you that that would break the ice even more to get their\nEduardo present Chris Singleton from Fenway were rain canceled batting practice earlier today considered toward on baseball tonight five and seven eastern time before each game and of course you will have the call\nOf the world series here on ESPN Radio coming up next on baseball tonight presented by David seats what will define success for sale tonight plus in October defined by bullpen and we have a pair of Asia's tonight so how big of an impact will the bullpen have you're listening to the world series on ESPN Radio and the ESPN or [noise]\nWind was shot that\nCleats up slide by Machado while a member of the Orioles in April last season began a chain of events which started a mutual disdain between Machado and the city of Boston two days later Red Sox pitcher Matt Barnes through behind Machado it had level that led to a shouting match between an angry Machado and put joy ... who was in the Sox dug out\nFast forward to the next series between these clubs in may when another Red Sox pitcher with real behind Machado and this time it was tonight's game one started Chris Sale and Machado made his feelings known after the game would have thought of the pitch\nI mean does that stuff that you\nBut I mean I'm not on that side of the nation [noise] they're still thinking about that same fly that I did that with all those no intention in on hurting anybody and I'm Still paying get thrown out of them\nAnd I've lost my respect for like an addiction for that for the stuff everyone over there\nTwo days later Machado executive Monica ...\n[noise]\nAnd once again this is going to take about forty seconds to go around the [noise]\nTo be exact took Machado twenty eight point nine seconds to round the base is following that home run on the Sox fans won't forget ness in\nA whip the highlights from last year and joining us in Studio a man who was there that day John Farrell a former Red Sox and blue jays manager and John how is Machado holding up in this villain rolling your eyes going straight from Milwaukee now to Boston where we know Red Sox fans will probably rail pretty hard on him again\nYou don't work I I think the Milwaukee series because uh Aguilar is right in front of him I I think it did have an effect on in the crowd Milwaukee was certainly on him\nWhether or not that took him out of his game where it was Milwaukee's pitching but you could see that the performance really took a kind of a nosedive in the final game but I think coming back into a familiar setting in Fenway\nHe has always had that uh antagonist field to to the red Sox fans for the slide with much with the royal uh that I think has had an effect on him being able to get back on the field but still I think he takes this uh in stride and I also think in this series against the red Sox I think it's present modeled but\nOne of many Machado was engaged and it's playing at a quicker temple he's a very dangerous player\nAnd he'll be in the cleanup hole in a game number one is going to face Chris let's do the starting pitching match up here sailing cursed Shaw a sales had some time to recover or since the hospitalization after the LDS game on start what's going to be his key for success tonight you know I\nThink when you look at the last start to for walks in foreign things work against Houston that's very uncharacteristic and usually when a picture of his caliber really any quality major league starter starts to miss fire within the strikes on then you start to wonder okay is the shoulder fatigue really something that is persistent and it keeps them from commanding\nThe baseball by repeating an arm slot so I think it's the command and then how late of an action does he create with his lighter because without that slider which is a wipe out patch\nI he's much less effective it makes you more of a fastball a change of type of picture which are very good weapons you know we're talking about one of the top five pictures in the game but that's why there is such a key for him those will be the two kids from me\nJohn Farah with us in Studio was manager for the red Sox and also for the blue jays won a world championship with Boston back in twenty Thirteen they're less title a Clinton cursed shot the velocity has been down that's kind of been the storyline with him he's lean more and more on his are breaking pitchers\nCold night at Fenway was a little rainy or earlier in the night I could that affect the grip especially on the devastating Kirk\nYou know that the temperature might be one thing but if there's moisture in the air\nThat's the thing that's going to allow him to maintain that grip and create that's been we saw the last game and actually to the last three starts that he's had a the curve balls become much greater usage for him like the yellow through thirty two percent fast balls in the
