at my kids and I was like well maybe we should start saving for that men stopped paying for my pain [laughter]\nOh it was your lawyers well it was both\nOf our okay All right really started in about a hundred and forty eight years ago and we were willing it down but we were just sick and tired of it and\nWanted to follow your plan we followed it kind of half way more than Davis playing a leading up to that but the two years we're refinance the house Fifteen year followed it step by step\nAnd uh\nWe got what happened what was the conversation or the thing that happened that movie from age to really doing it\nI think it started to see the light at the end of the tunnel I felt like it was doable versus just something that we could\nNever accomplish ... job which that'll KPMG and so I mean you can run a half marathon or marathon and then still sprint to the finish went that last hundred yards you still got a little gas in your tank and so seeing the finished can cause you to get intense right absolutely yes I Know that's kind of what happened and so\nWhat is the secret to getting out of debt what do you tell people when they show you paid off all your debt when you say you pay off your desk and they say how'd you do that\nWell I think we first started to start to budget together and really get both parties involved all in I was a little bit more passive early on and then I learned to really look at the numbers and then we got really focus so we use every dollar\nWe're just all in yeah you know and she went and got her second job started work on that and then I was like well I Can't let her\nKnow do that on her own and so then I started working as much overtime as possible is oh okay All right and she got involved in the budgeting huh yeah so I'm I'm the spender and uh it definitely if the the nerve gets involved heavily it it definitely uh goes a lot further\n... savor your they're involved in well in both of your work on it there's just accountability\nAbsolutely that was the only thing I was gonna say is keeping to their accountability accountable yeah they're um we also um me like a vision board um and so we had like chains we really got the the kid who was involved in and take links off our teams that have have them involved and they\nLoved it okay cool cool so how did you guys get connected us\nDad and I got absolutely

kids all the way from Cedar Rapids to mark the moment that their family tree changed\nAny to mark stuff and have milestones you mark things in your life reset things you know their family tree just change it already change but they market today very well done Edward is in New York City Hi Edward how are you\nHi how's it going better than I deserve what's up\nSo um I just want to try to summarize it um [noise] I just had a big change in my life um I found out my girlfriend is pregnant which was pretty exciting and then a couple of months after that I found out that it's twin [laughter]\n[laughter] okay so\nIt went from pretty exciting to now I'm kind of scared\nTerrified yeah I mean\nYeah I have a car loan that got me worried um I have a two years left on the financing plan mhm I just wanted to figure out if I should get rid of the car or if I could hunkered down in budget a bit better\nAnd I think you're saying I think you're stretching the few dollars that you have really well so I think you're I think you're very responsible people I don't think you're overspending I don't think you're crazy I don't think you're spoiled brats um and I think he's a hard worker\nMuch yeah\nWell I think you've got all that stuff going for you and that's why I Want you to win better than your winning and so I really think you guys put the kids to bed and I turn off TV light a candle or two and just sit on my porch and talk and say\nWell we got to make some more money um and it's not 'cause money's everything is because when you are or you know doing the best you can do with the dollars you have and they're not stretch and then we've got to look at something well what are we going to do to create some additional income short short term and long term\nWell actually we did last night and I actually got a job in the local library but after I pay for childcare I only bring home about thirty to forty dollars a day [laughter]\n[noise] so that's that's not that's not the answer then right\n[noise] and we've got a better a better income coming in to afford childcare if you're going to be working [noise] am and he's got to have a game plan\nAnd I don't know whether he opens his own butcher shop or whether he becomes the most famous butcher in the world doing it on TV I don't care what he does [laughter] I'm not saying you cannot be butchers but uh you can't be a butcher their ten years from now and be anywhere but where you are right now\nIs it makes sense yeah and so\nI I you know what are we going to do with the skill or this thing or did he just fall into this cause your parents were doing it or you know that's kind of exactly what happened yeah and so but I mean what if they'll let's just kind of take the white board out and start over erase our life on the white border second and say gosh if we can do anything we wanted to do what would we do\nYeah and then let's go about doing that and you wanted to comment today and walk in and throw you know throw your knife down and walk out that's not what I'm saying but I Am saying we need a plan that takes us somewhere\nWhere we say okay this month I got a hundred bucks left over but it's not always going to be this way but it is always going to be that way if you don't change something agreed agreed okay I think you can do it you're good people this is not a\nIt's not a character issue and it's not a a lack of a effort issue and it's not an immaturity thing you guys just simply mathematically it's income minus outgoing there's not much income\nYeah so on and he told us\nWhat how do we go about things like that but my parents that it you know like it would really be\nWhen he's gone to drill here they always talk about how inconvenient for that and it's so hard on my dad if you got heart problems and he has to take over all of the work that they're very very small operation\nOkay so let's kind of think about this for [laughter]\nThis is not working for your dad\n'cause it's not working for has not working for you yeah so this whole thing and working but I don't know I mean the way I bring it up is we love your own we'd love to help you but we are starving to death over here yeah and we're not going to continue to do this anymore and you don't have to do it today\nBut you you know you can say you know my husband is going to we're taking classes and he's going to be a an X or y or Z two years from now and that's what he's going to start doing 'cause that's really his dream\nBecause here's the thing\nWas somebody is going to make some decisions to shut some stuff down or you're going to be sitting exactly where you see it\nOkay and I you know\nBut ... you know you cannot be in this thing of oh we have to starve to death because that's the only way my parents have a good life\nWithout a doubt that's not that's not logical\nThat doesn't make sense right yeah you're right and the truth is your dad if he's got a heart problem and your husband is not there he probably needs to sell this close\nRight yeah\nAnd and so when you start thinking about that or does it make enough to support you guys if your dad was out of the picture\nDoes he need to go home [noise] [noise] well it in\nTheir late though it's not like we divide equally more not like we're not at all part of the owners of it\nI Know but the owner cannot operate it without this particular employees what you said\n\nOh well I guess I Need a new employee or then you talk about selling it\nTo you or giving it to you or something I don't know y'all can talk about it there's a lot of different\nWays out of this mess but continue to do the same thing is not a way out of the mess\nAnd um so ... and let's change the day and and it's a change for the jerky and nobody is be mad and ...\nAnd throw weight around or say anything unkind but we just have to lay say now five years from now are we doing some different ten years from now it'll be something doing something different and we're going to make more money as you all are starving to death and get them that's where all these fears are coming from stress in and out of your dad's good people too and I think you're likely

company I'm traveling a hundred and ten miles a day roundtrip commuting okay I'm I'm averaging about four hundred dollars a month and gas\nAnd I'm having a little bit of trouble kind of stomach moving to this new city because of the fact that it's the ... higher up there [noise]\nMy rent right now is only seven hundred dollars a month up there for all and that's on a two bedroom apartment a one bedroom apartment up there starts at a ride around thousand dollars [laughter] so my question is which I Do about that where your dry or [noise]\nUm I'm driving to carry North Carolina\nI think you went shopping and one of the town and there's another another town Kerry Kerry is not that dramatic it's not thirty percent more expensive than Burlington\nI'm wrong something's wrong with your analysis here\nWell everything that I've done research was I Can't find anything less than non fifty to a thousand dollars a month for a one bedroom apartment [noise] and I've been digging for almost thirty days now okay uh trying to offset the cost of gas and be closer to my job\nYeah again that I'm not I'm just not doing what you're doing but um but I I'm not I don't have the emotional ability to commute like that some people do but I Can't do it my commute seven minutes or so I Can't relate I'm the I'm\nSure I I just I really think that I mean I\n... I have never seen anything that indicates that carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive than the rest of North Carolina I mean\nYou need to move twenty miles from there instead of a hundred and ten miles from there to get something cheaper but I'm the numbers are giving me just don't work I I just ah truthfully I think you haven't\nLooked in the right places I think you're looking in certain neighborhoods or certain types of apartment complexes or whatever I'm going to continue to shop and learn and I'm probably I mean I'm ... you may need to dial it out pan back a little bit and\nDial out just a little bit mileage was from where you are looking to get ... you may be in the most expensive in the town I mean I can imagine that there is an area of carry this that expensive\nBut overall this I carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive rents than Burlington no that's just I just don't believe that um I can be wrong but I I don't I've never seen that indicates that\nThe one in North Carolina is that much more expensive than the other and now you want to compare Manhattan to ... Texas we can talk about this but that's a different issue and that's not what you're proposing so I think you're\nI'm very clear that a long week full of serious story now it's time to take a break and look at the lighter side of the headlines with now with the news now to the new celebrates American culture and politics in puts it all together in a ... meeting going to join me doing\nIt to them after meet the press lady she just now which is right here in Charleston five eighty WC H.

it's a long time coming it's a lot of planning but now it's just you see one bill and then another bill go another bill go into more terror comeback one month in another month never looked at it feels really good\nCool what do you teach a law oh good okay so a law professor and empty ... not bad at all the way to go\nIt was a lot of work to get to where we are a bit and uh\nYou know coming out of medical school it's um\nYou you have this big lump of money that you owe and I remember getting statements in the mail from the loan company and I would just kind of open them and put them and put him to the side because it's so overwhelming you know and um I I was nervous about having\nTo make an Eighteen hundred to two thousand dollar payment every month for ten years and then end up paying almost double what I'd a borrowed ...\nUm and it's basically like paying off a mortgage so um we were\nWe actually had a great I'm attending physician that during my fourth year med school actually sat us down and said\nYou know we're we're going to talk about money and we were thinking oh easy and it teaches top billing or how to run a practice and he's like no some day you're going to make a lot of money and you need to know what to do with it so you don't end up like me and my sixties and I can't retire because I\n'cause I have that still wow um and so he's he's the one that I heard your name from and got the total money make or a book and read that and\nI'm probably it was another year or two before I really started the program 'cause\nBeing in med school and not having any income living off loans it's kinda hard to figure out how you're going to pay out that while you're taking out there and make 'em and then Alan and I met and we were engaged and\nWe want us to start or mirrors off rice or we want to get on the same vision for ... or ... or what have you with a sort of what our future was\n... so out Allen actually had a when we met he had already paid off all his school loans and had a lot of the savings and I'm like hey you want to get married I've got a hundred and fifty five\nThousand and that um and so I don't think I feel really guilty doing that a little bit yeah yeah\nAnd our church I'm at the time was offering it for you and so I was like oh we need to go to the class because I'm terrified and I don't know what to do and\nI'm so we did that in that was in two thousand twelve where she did that while we were engaged and so we got married August twenty twelve and so\nTo this day you know before we got married we had our budget ready to go on the spreadsheet ... from the nerd and uh [laughter] to this day we can tell you every penny we've spent since the day we got married so that's been that's been an interesting journey but definitely a blessing\nOf a new one month later ... things done yeah so what do you tell people with key to getting out of bed as well\nGosh it starts with communication or whether it's we're married are engaged for years by herself to me so much talked about it um and then it's setting the budget discipline on it there's no problem changing the budget but it's just it's actually spending ever since and figure out where it goes into the building just went to do it\nYeah we've gotten very good at 'em cash flowing things there's been a lot of course over six years a lot of unexpected expenses\nAnd we always say that if it weren't for the budget than we wouldn't know where to get money from ... um we've actually cash slowed three cars in the span of time um and then about two years ago we um\nWe we were having some trouble I'm getting pregnant which you never think that that's going to happen and um\nYou know fertility stuff isn't really a it's not like getting cancer it's not like a medical emergency or anything but it's definitely a very stressful um and so we we were very glad to be able to have the\nFunds and know where to pull money from and we actually ended up doing to round of IDF which was very expensive um and so we're happy to finally be pregnant\n[laughter]\nWe're not we're not going to call her day so good [laughter]\nSo we just you know going through the stress of that and I see I've seen plenty of friends go through that or want to adopt and not be able to because they don't have the money or they have to find rates for years and years and so we were just left to not not have to put that on hold because of money you know I'm so that was definitely a blessing that maybe I\nDon't know yet but beyond that I ...
