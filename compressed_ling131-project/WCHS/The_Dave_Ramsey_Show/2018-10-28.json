[laughter]\nYou know that's how they I don't know if they still do it at one time that's how they grow it ties in her high school football playoffs well they I mean if you look at the list again I'm it's in there\nI mean now it's the last ... a bunch of potential tie breakers book coin flip is in there to get you into the civilian failure by the metaphor doesn't hurt you know at a limit to beat

first up on our toll free number eight hundred seven six five eight to five five ...\n[noise] yes good evening guys I'm nice to be the LA ran\nSix out of the games in the state of California this year\nUm one thing about this Texas game and by the way Texas is a point to have favorite right now\nIf you lose your probably out if you're when it doesn't really solve anything in terms of getting to Dallas\nAllen you just said Texas could\nIf they win they could they could stomach another loss not really I Wish they could be in the last game of the air and get an because of the tie breaker\nAnd West Virginia wins\nAnd and would lose to Oklahoma\nAgain I was Stacy Texas than Iowa State we get sent over West Virginia because of the tie breaker so Iowa State is going to decide a lot of who gets to Dallas because Texas Oklahoma State Oklahoma and W. view are going to beat each other up in the months in November and I were state's gonna sit back there was much easier schedule\nAnd sit there with high breaker advantages over West Virginia and certainly over Texas every being in the final game\nSo why and what's that\nYeah possible but you know if they're all to last teams could there there could be three of 'em so now you could get back into that many a typewriter\nAlready I don't see many I don't see it through the entire here I really don't I see I see the winner advancing Saturday and then hoping\nThat Iowa State doesn't mess things up a Iowa State is going to determine who goes to Dallas and it could very well the Iowa State being a team or what\nTo me the most about this game Saturday is very simple this Texas bring their leg and 'cause they only bring their regained a couple of games a year they brought it against Oklahoma does is West Virginia I'm Marcie enough\nProtects us to bring the Reagan\nNow when Gina Smith went in there a few years back\nWe still be you know but I I felt they brought their a game that game\nBecause West Virginia bring out the best in Texas Saturday That's the big question because one if they if Texas brains are again they're going to be tough to beat but I'm not so sure they they are they they haven't shown me the ability to bring their ache\nExcel lobster twice I think the question is is do they have it I mean does they do because you you'll get their best shot Saturday there's no question about their their ... against the wall now\nI had a good joke all\nDay but they don't want their backs\nAgainst a wall in games they they they don't bring their I guess\nThey don't they don't show up different coach ... will soon\nYou know different cut out\nA couple of things that well yeah and I couple of things about recruiting because guess what is November here next week and uh we have an early signing period in December and it's been kinda quiet West Virginia currently forty third nationally six in the big twelve we lot recently lost a four star\nStill waiting on his kids from alec with a\nA things have slowed considerably in terms of the recruiting Greg ... is the our corporate kid coming are we getting any more for stars\nI'm we're up their kids out there certainly are the defensive backs mount quickly that you speak of there's also a wide receiver from Richmond named Allie Jennings who's highly thought of [noise] um did did honestly is going to commit to West Virginia they're just sort of he's holding off to announce it officially\nAnd now the news and that's a dentist game like Thursday night and then he had to back off of it yeah yeah I Want to do this and\nOne of those new ceremony so ... yeah let's not do that yet but the real reason so much stuff is slow down is West Virginia is still very much in pursuit of transfers to go kids and they're not going to a lot all their scholarships\nAt this point in time to high school prospects so there are a couple of big ones out there and they're still involved with but\nThey've you know I mean they your things way back\nAnd we may not near as we know what the transfer situation you may not know that until may or June mhm so they're going to have a couple there at that point in time that they can grab a kid or two or they may get a Jew go get her to a they probably could use an offensive lineman defensive linemen\nAnd a defensive back in terms of kids who could play for you next year so that's grad transfer or do you go so [noise] West Virginia's got twenty three available scholarships this year and that's you know you're at Seventeen right now so you got six left\nUm you get another high school kid or two that only leaves you you know for a for the transfer market so that's not a whole lot so West Virginia's you've just been way way back in terms of taking kids they they've taken most of what they're going to take in the rest of them other than one or two are going to go for transfers\nOne interesting thing about Alabama this week if they lose the LSU and they're fourteen point favorites but I really love LSU has been in every game this year\nAnd they love playing for their coach and they love playing in a\n... in Baton Rouge if ever if Alabama loses this week they don't control their destiny for the SEC championship game and that is an amazing thing football is just beginning the muffin November's going to be fascinating\nAh as far as the injuries for Wu five ACL's tears in less than a year\nI think unfortunate and I and I wonder if there's a coincidence in there or if it's just a stroke a bad luck and then also on the basketball poll if we hang in for the first two weeks\nIn the eight people and will break that record of a fifty six can the record I think I think if we get the fifty seven we break the record I think the records for six you're right\nSo this ... break then move is that if that happens will lift officially or we officially going through the golden age of WB or basketball\nI don't think there's any doubt I'll be honest with you I mean yeah I mean you know certainly\nThe hot rod Jerry West there a rod dorm was was something but just look in terms of NCAA tournament success a prior to two thousand and five West Virginia had won multiple games which we now consider the sweet sixteen level twice\nIn fifty nine in Ninety eight or since then they've gone seven times so yeah I mean without a doubt yeah we mark this on NCAA success which is what will mark college basketball any more it's not even close\nAlan ... yeah yeah I mean you know there's there's something to be said for playing for the national temp ship they did back there but um\nI I think you're seeing how to make that final last push I'm not not taking their pro toward things are winding down I think he's actually getting some recruits that maybe they weren't getting before and and getting a level guy that\nYou know might be a two year not to not one of them probably tuned down and and I heard her subway and are getting some guys that that that you want and not having to just say\nYou know if if things go well you next week since the now if these below you you're falling for yeah I mean they've been knocking on it pretty closely last couple of years but\nYeah I mean I I don't think just run over by any stretch and then he got in the states last year yeah maybe maybe they're they're you know maybe they beat ... you know I think that's getting a ticket for Maryland Baltimore County in in a game of course as you get Marshall\nLike again so they can they got to lower the team there but uh but they play teams I think all of them made the final four\nIn this run when they've lost in sweet sixteen with the Kentucky's don't notice and sat\nAround ... hey we broke some news or friday night or during the awful oh what was that a webcast or do you remember news dot com Oscar Sheboygan coming to Morgantown to play\nBe at home in front of the uh the TV and time for the three thirty kick off the football so the IRS defeat Purdue level final no celebrating\n[laughter] not saying anything although arm out all that are\nA Ninety five eighty nine was the er the final scores that amount and here's the feed\nA Purdue in their scrimmage or just some some notes or that we can talk about the ... West Virginia did twenty four turnovers amount and use force that's where you start so oppressed Virginia was alive and well a is pointed out boundaries were down a couple of players feel vote and still recovering\nFrom a what is you know minor injuries hopefully\nUm and also started walking out they did not play but that was more of a precautionary\nMeasure yeah I think that one is semi minor I don't think that's one that they're they're worried about long term the Beatles or you know they've been talking about that for two months so that's when maybe a little bit more issue but to a play in score that well against the top twenty five program without\nTwo guys that are are almost certainly going to start for you this year that that speaks pretty well now getting these these controlled scrimmage is you know how much stock you put in a final score but I think some of the numbers that you look at individual you can tell some things\nYou up twenty points for each of a modern\nAlso had five boards he's at seven assists than the game and to turnovers uh fourteen where's your main Haley he finished um three or four from the floor\nGot to the free throw line ten times eight of ten from the line or chase parlor finished with Thirteen points at a pair of threes on board non from the floor of Jordan McCabe finished with Thirteen points in Twenty one minutes six assist three turnovers\nAnd one steel on five and seven he was also three or four from beyond the arc eight points for Wes Harris\nA seven for Logan route Seventeen minutes to go along with three boards six boys for Andrew Gordon a five points for brand a nap or for for Lamont west\nThree points for him at math use and a bucket for Derrick Culver who played Thirteen minutes in the contest West Virginia twenty five assists on thirty four made baskets I did have Eighteen turnovers about eleven steals\nAnd God outmoded and the game thirty nine to twenty seven shot a fifty eight percent from Florida second\nAnd look at the the get we haven't talked to a whole lot about because you know and everybody talks about McCabe and then uh you know ... gets a lot of attention as well but\nA Jamaican Haley may be really really good for this team and he could you know is is a six seven guy who could play anywhere from point guard too\nSmall forward you should pass it million apparently announced it some scoring ability as well yeah I've heard that they want him to take some shots more more so than he might be inclined to do so\nBecause he just got himself and they passed first passed second point you know and uh and that's fine and then that that a real heavy on the defensive and when he's six seven without that kind of reach 'em I got it again\nLooking at the numbers that would be great to see if if that was a lot of perimeter shots going up and those were breakaway lay up type things where you're feeding guys um but if if he told me Culver was going to get to\nAnd that lasted don't get what for yeah I Would not have liked West Virginia chances sand ... and\nA rather than just wouldn't like there's much less scored ... points yeah\nSo you know good ... and again Penn State will be a obviously public exhibition but the but the ... the lions or I mean they're not going to win and then the championship this year but again I think that's a a legitimate contest that you'll be able to decipher something from it\nYou know no offense against the division two schools at West Virginia has played or what a plate if not for the Penn State game but this will give you much better\nPerspective and I think you would get by any of those do do do you think that is\nLower level at the missions now start to go away because fans would rather see you play somebody\nThat's the one in that game\nAnd it's not going to count anyway you're not risk you don't risk hurting yourself by losing a home game it's like it's like one on the house\nYeah that you really want us to live be as good as was live business still be two and ... everybody looks at you and goes\nWith the ... and that was happening you know that they'd be like a top twenty five ... most of the team home yeah no one ever members of it by playing that the one game your fan base gets excited and\nYou know and again you're not risking anything DNC allowed this last year and they\nThey actually allowed it again this year as a chaired the charitable game both of them for hurricane relief but you would think they would just keep that going forward and even if you I mean what the heck of a lot both I mean allow you to have a a lower level team and then\nAlso allow you to play a D. one exhibition as a charity charities game\nIf you want to keep super secret\nGame scrimmage in there as well that's fine but you know I I don't see where it really hurts to have another exhibition in their ... affect the hugs about that\nHe's all for it but you know then he starts taking shots at the NCAA and you know I never do anything that makes a lot of sense to me so any well he's on a lot of those committees now maybe get some things that\nCase in point Marshall defeats liberal today one Thirteen to want to wait Dallas became Henderson center this was a global team\nThat I think is going to be better than they were selected them out in these topics but they're they're picked a you know in the in the middle of a pack lower middle of the pack and the and the ... see that at a couple of uh transfers including Jamal\nHollered or who score thirty for or against the hurt today but the rise none from Fairmont had Seventeen points he at fourteen assists one turnover today for the former a polar bear a fair amount of senior\nOr feel blood so formally Marshall now one bowl\nPlayed in the state uh fourteen points in ten boards in that game meanwhile they heard about twenty five from CJ birch today a Jared west former state player of the year from Clarke's for Notre Dame sixteen points and had three assist in the contest John Elmore took Seventeen shots made six\nHe was oh six from beyond me are finished with sixteen points but had not assist one turnover so I'm all in all there was a entertaining\nNow written as well and that's why you know again\nOutside the embarrassment factor I don't mind the the two games ... tribes you're going to tell me the kid from wheeling Jesuit last year the big kid that didn't matched up against the west Virginia or was the conference play the year\nHe was he was an ice layer and it was sort of fun watching that kind of match up so I don't mind seeing seeing that a little bit but certainly I think coaches would love to be able to get more opportunities at an exhibition game against the true do you want\nAnd who is it predates me there was a team to came in here and want to that's what makes the game\nIt wasn't eastern Kentucky with no it or they can northern when they were they were they need to have ended up okay absolutely and I think it was a ... I mean so it wasn't yeah one of the ...\nReally really bad about near to the main Mick hugs the cause that would not have been other like all those northern Kentucky guys so yeah it's yeah you're right so those those things do happen though you quickly turn around and move on\nAnd now let's bring in the uh the spring football scrimmage against power five team you are to make sure that darn springtime gets played you don't call it up to a different below six days at the other one absolutely yep yep that'll happen government money to work out to be on TV sure All right we'll take a break

that was coming in to Charleston for that game\nAnd ... you know they're not going to bring a big twelve game down there if you want to see the ... play you should be willing to come see James Madison or whomever it would be but they started complaining and I think Wu officials just ended up saying well you know what\nIf you don't want to see that game we're just going to keep them all in Morgantown so I think that's their attitude whether you agree with or not you don't have to put a in talking to them that that's a feeling I've gotten\nSo you think we're we're probably never get an agreement here electric power from school right\nNow you will at some point um I Do think that it it some juncture do locate it potentially bringing out power five school they're on a neutral site but\nYou know semi neutral site and then returning it like they did Florida a few years ago [noise] um Oklahoma prior to the big twelve days um but I ... again it's probably a few years down the road\nYou know okay we've got this I enjoy your show and thanks for taking my call\nI appreciate the call as always let's let's stay in Morgantown speak with another Bob Bob that evening\nIt's all there were other world catch a [noise] what's up Bob how you doing\nOK okay and and the one thing what 'cause it's like and what they send them a lot more [noise]\nI think this one's going to be tight I mean I think this is a very close game I mean tech I I'll admit probably prior to Thursday I Would have thought all Texas Texas was playing well West Virginia coming off that lost Iowa State you're going oh you know what a but based on the performance\nPerformances in the last you know four days or so I'm all of a sudden I've I've turned thinking I don't know if I've turned it all the way around\nI think this is going to come down to one or two\nPlace I think this one's you know comes down to the end of the game and who you know we always talk about who's going to make plays at the end but also\nWho's going to make mistakes at some point along the line West Virginia does not have as good a turnover margin as do not want warns independently yards are also higher than the long horn so those are two areas West Virginia you can't afford to lose in Austin yeah absolutely\nBobby bay it's always good to hear from you about eight hundred seven six five eight to five five bill in Charleston is next up getting the gold card\nHey Travis man how you do on a limb and Greg a travesty and if if we were on the cable and finish up\nAnd that fifth place or Greg half a game out of four well they make up the state game\nNo you can't there won't be any opportunity because it's all been in the big truck championship game which is the only available we can you could do that\nOkay so oh boy that would be bad for your for your playing one last game than everybody else\nYeah the thirteenth data point so we'll see there's a lot to go and who knows what happens not only with West Virginia but everybody else around um but you know does that hurt West Virginia I Can't say that it does but I Can't say that doesn't either we don't see how it varies out to get there\nYou know yeah OK are Greg and travel um basketball wash are they going to be a good enough to get an at large were not an automatic but an at large\nOh I Would certainly think so um I I'd be really surprised\nIf this team is in a really solid NCA contender um again they were picked third in the big twelve there you know they're going to be six seven teams at least from this league make the NCA tournament so I I don't think now here at the end of October\nI don't think that's even a consideration is if this isn't in the tournament team again and then when you get in the march you never quite certain how\nHow things go we know match ups and all those type of thing can dictate what you're doing it once you get in there but I think this is a really good team\nWell the the big twelve a travesty is powerful enough\nOr that if you or have a lousy non conference record you can make it up\nBy doing well in the conference\nOh absolutely yeah\nI got that choice if I remember correctly Greg ... what a or the old Georgetown group used to do or they were favored is scheduled ten pet safe and go ... you know and then I went to a very low or the strength of schedule but then they got into the Big East\nAll of a sudden they the the strength of schedule goes real high and they've already got their lands\nThat ... thing and the way I Would think\nOh yeah Syracuse are certainly always was the one they'd they'd never left the carrier dome or until tournament I mean it took\nOff from spider so uh but you know again West Virginia's got enough tough non conference games um enough quality non conference games that\nStrength of schedule won't be an issue of his team's half as good as I think it is it's it's ... it's going to be just fine in terms that now again let's see how they ultimately play a injuries\nWhatever can can kill you but I think this is this is a good basketball team despite the loss of drunk current extra mile\nWell dance that really puts a lot of emphasis on why on road Windsor ... home when\nSo when you're on the road or even initially you better do pretty good\nYeah and even more so now you know they they're not going to use the RPI anymore they're using the system called net um which is going to put even more emphasis on road games\nSo yeah I mean that that can be even more of a of a factor moving forward a West Virginia doesn't play a ton of non conference games but certainly once you get into the conference or they'll have nine of those uh to add to their resume as well\nOK gentlemen thank you\nAll right thanks a lot appreciate the call or text before a break eight nine five happy with the wind but we'll take more than a win over Baylor to convince me that West Virginia's a top ten to twelve team of the nation running game is still lacking a jak says\nBigelow and David along or is good at er is as good as we've had in several years\nBoy and I mean you know what students' heads nice defensive players I'm more so\nOn the back end or when you think is a ... year rights and Carl Joseph and even ... of the world um you know all of whom are playing in the NFL um but I think I think both those two are are playing well I'll be interested you know again\nWe'll see how West Virginia does uh during the season\nBut what kind of NFL future just can you ... have you know his knees have been such a problem earlier in his career at USC that that could ultimately be an issue that will hurt his pro status but he hasn't had any injuries you're West Virginia and he's played like an NFL guy\nYeah no question or jak also asked uh what was the final Columbus they Texas last night uh most went to bed early thirty eight thirty five Oklahoma State\nHas the bills a big lead but hangs on in the end to win a terms of of the rankings as we remark there

I'm Sorry Seventy eight scholarship players are a little bit under the eighty five limit\nBut they have twenty two um players are that are transfers who are on scholarship so\nThey're almost a ... they're actually a little bit above that twenty five percent mark so and it's not going to go away I mean in in especially in today's world it's not just WVU um it's you know it everybody's going to use it more prevalent now\nAgain they still Seventy five percent of your roster is coming from traditional route so you'd better be able to to develop once they get here\nYou are right to take we'll be right back final segment of show coming up\nYou ever wondered just too far the friends of coal well there are fifty thousand West Virginia families who support the state's coal industry and they look a lot like you honest hardworking good neighbors who won a future for themselves and the state\nThere coal miners housewives schoolteachers mechanics doctors college professors pizza delivery guys your friends of friends of coal know and understand the importance on the coal industry to our state's economy\nThey know about the sixty thousand jobs the coal industry creates in our state\nThey know about the twenty five billion dollars the industry bumps into our economy and they know that without coal our state would face if economic catastrophe come to think of it that sounds like most West Virginians let Congress no you are a proud West Virginia and you are a friend of coal", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "28"}
