[laughter] really no no I didn't think so [laughter] so that's that is simply ... the super six meeting where we are Iraq was a normal gonna have to actually yeah I bought a house in the ... I'll see you have an iguana okay the Sunday Morning to NPR Thanks guys\nAppreciated burning Dolan executive director the W. B. S. A. C. executive director of the Nicholas county grizzlies football program is gene Morris you finish trick or treating buddy\nWell uh I think I think the trick or treaters are finished here\nYeah [laughter] do you have a lot\nAh we had several you know it's always enjoyed\n'em and it is it is indeed All right let's talk about the grizzlies\nAbout something enjoyable as the season you've been having so far I mean you go into the game coming up on friday night against an old rival enrich would undefeated or talk to me about your ball club right now heading into week number eleven gene\nWell the the biggest thing is is always a concern most with most coaches and uh that's health and and uh\nSo far are we we've we've managed to ah to stay healthy throughout the entire season and we've\nGot some uh you know some guys find a little bit but not as much as having to really said anybody out so you know that that uh has really helped us as far as you know getting the chemistry and making sure we just\nYou know get on the same page together and and just get\nFor each week and I think that uh the guy so far have actually done that and and it's just a you know we simply because we have to do a replacement plug in people and and and take people out and those type thing so you know right now I think we're getting a little better as we got\nThey were talking to coach biased in Parkersburg just a couple of months ago about the balance the big red Savage or Nicholas county ball club is also balanced often simply a hundred and Seventy two yards rushing and receiving a games the numbers are almost identical\nSix in the last seven games you squirt over forty point to tell me about this grizzlies often\nAnd the balance you have with Jay go down in the bank field and Jared Graves that quarterback\nWe're all you know that that is a that's a lot based on you know with with our receivers and uh and and and share your greatest being able to get them to football and he does an excellent job there and uh you know it's it's it's just\nOne of the things that I feel that you really have to make sure that your football team has that ability to to run and the ... and you know\nTeams are going to try to to take things away from you and you've got to be able to capitalize on it I you know a long time ago I I heard an old coach say it's not a bad teeth answer unless you can take advantage of it so you know you have to be able to do both things I think Jacob both as a tremendous job\nUh CNN ... and having great vision and being able to cut and and and do those things I I think he does a tremendous job\nAnd are off into line of course you know they're they're the ones that they're keeping that keeping the pocket cleaner they're creating seems and you know those guys I think you know a deserved just as much credit is receiving corps the order back in the running backs I really do I really do believe that and\nAnd uh you know a Nick Kaiser and and Luke where rose do a tremendous job is receiver so\nYou know those guys really work hard to make sure that they get themselves open so you know right now those are you know those guys as I mentioned there they're not all of them but they're they're kind of the uh the main ones that we kind of lean on on friday night and I think\nRight now again it's it's the chemistry that they've been able to develop throughout the season and and the injury bug has kind of avoided us that's far and we're we're keeping our fingers crossed that continues\nOther side of the ball coach and you mentioned on all things a lot of the guys you mentioned where seniors but on the defensive side of the ball you're for leading tackles Denver McCown Coleman grows Timmy Baker Andrew deal all those guys are juniors on that side of the ball and you guys a little bit of had a schedule based on what you've been able to do\n[noise] um those guys played significant rose last year sophomores and uh they they had some growing pains got knocked around and and then had to had to learn on the run so to speak and uh yeah\nI think right now they are they are really settled into to what they're doing and and what what we need to do as a defensive unit\nIn order to be able to stop people and uh it they are a little bit ahead of schedule but you know they were forced into action um last year and and I think that uh that really helped us in the end it's helped us this season tremendously\nYou got a game coming up on friday night or against it you know we've been talking about rivals and uh uh this is certainly a rival game even though are you a man or a strong\nA double a ball club undefeated the lumberjacks of has struggled a little bit this year or two and seven on the season but this is a game that are that you need to play isn't it\n[noise] it really is I I think it's just you know it it's it's all rivalry it's it's it's one of the things that that makes friday night football I'm One of the one of the marquee type things in your community and I I think it's it's enjoyable and um you know\nBoth both communities kind of you know are centered around their schools and I think that that also makes an important hey we've been on the other side of this one when they've had a pretty good football team and we've been struggling so we understand in a you know the the the upset minded or\nA teen over there and rich would as a you know they're going to come out and they're gonna they're gonna hire some things that they've been working on trying to take advantage of us so\nYou know I I think it'll be a competitive ballgame or ... as far as that goes in and and it really you know I I really enjoy you know having a having the opportunity to play 'em and you know I think they do too and I I just think it's good for public schools and both communities I really do\nIf you can win that game and knock on wood on friday you go ... and the regular season I Know the focus is on the first weekend in wheeling and December but tell me what ten into would mean to the program if you can get the lumberjacks this weekend\n[noise] well you know if if we can is the first time I'm really in in the Nicholas county high school school history that they've had a team that that has been able to to accomplish that goal when you know it's it's always good to be\nThe one of the one of the first when when those type things happened in in our community is really behind us and you know they're they're supporting us and uh you know we're we're excited about getting this opportunity and get into this position so you know that it it's a little bit more of an incentive to to go out play hard and and and\nAnd accomplish the goals that we sat at the beginning of the season\nGoes looking back at your season in looking at everything as a whole\nA couple of the games you had very early on a victory by twenty points over north Mary and who's going on and and gotten four wins a victory against a very good shady spring team after that a to point victory how big were those games right at the start of your season to get things going the way they have\nA lot of things they were they were they're really big I mean they they were those they were the ones that that got you believing in what you were going and got the guys excited about having an opportunity to to to play at a high level I I think both of those laws were were really\nBig big measuring sticks for us to see how our season would go I mean uh you know we were down at half time about twelve pointed north married and uh you know which is pretty much the same scenario or with shady springs at home\nAnd ah you know they were able to to battle and and\nYou know to overcome some varsity and uh and when windows football games and you know that just kind of\nHelp the confidence and ah you know the the the ability for us to be able to do that was just tremendous and and it kind of kind of kicked off the season in a in a real positive direction and and gave us that confidence we needed to be where we are right now\nOnly gene always a pleasure my friend a best of luck against\nI give me give me a couple of cheese for friday night what do you got to do in order to pull out this went over to like again\nI think we're going to have to establish around early in the game because it's supposed to rain again or if we're able to do that then that's going to open up our passing game\nI was in a in a hundred and seven samurai man a jade unless we move Brett out a little bit Robinson to a slot when he's not running the football I think that's the biggest key is our our line controlling upfront and being able to run the football and stop in the past with them\nAll right my friends always a pleasure to talk with sand best of luck on friday night okay thank you very much\nRegime you Sam ElBaradei is the head coach of Notre Dame speaking had coaches you see where it Marilyn did today I saw that reinstated their head coach and then they fired him\nYeah [laughter] did they reinstate him justify firing interesting theory and it's amazing how something like that\nHow how does Maryland make that mistake and then and encourage it within twenty four hours a day that that that's the interesting part of it\nYou know but it's Maryland what can we say I need to take a break that say that you did a Jake Bowen senior running back for the

then a mills and joined the job regard it\nAs we take you up until nine o'clock talking high school sports are good by the youngster has joined now by\nJake bowling Jake a six one two hundred pounds senior running back from the Bridgeport Indians Jake welcome in buddy Hi thanks for having me or pleasure you like running the football don't you\nYes [laughter] it is\nIs like a Iraq I'm not either get out of the way or get run over right\n[laughter] that's the way to do it man yeah how's the senior year banned for you buddy\nIt's been great I mean we've we've done a really good job I mean white and one now coming out to come up to the end or the them are playing Lincoln this week hopefully we'll go we'll get a win and then you gotta get get get get some good job in the playoffs and hopefully one state championship\nLast time out for your Bridgeport Indians was a road game it was a at Kaiser you had last weekend off that you went to Kaiser a knock dumped the golden tornado twenty eight Nineteen\nYou had a hundred and sixty six yards rushing in a couple of dust down take me back to the last time Bridgeport was on the field a couple of weeks ago how big was that when going into Kaiser in getting that road when\nIt was definitely a big win I mean it's definitely a hard place to play at Kaiser I mean we went in there and we fought to the very end\nAnd they started to come back towards the end of the game but I'm Glad we uh we I'm Glad we fought it out at the end [noise]\nJake statistically for you this year and spend an incredible season but how much of your success is owed to the guys that are in front of you was there a point in the year where you really felt that there's all sorts of line was starting to Joe and come together\nYeah I mean after the bird game I mean they they made a bunch of holds for me in that game and we fought the very end I mean there's a bunch of young guys on the line last year we had pretty much all seniors on the line and they all graduated so these guys are really stepped up and down a great job this year\nYou know you talk about seniors graduating and you you got quite a few seniors on this ball club but seemingly it's just a year after year regardless of what you lose as far as that senior class a tradition for the Bridgeport Indians just say next man up let's go keep the tradition going\nYes every year we had a great team I mean it's often be a part of this or that winning a winning program like red sport football and I mean it's been an honor to be a part of the\nYou have a couple of wins kind of in the middle part of the season you knocked on Robert The bird by six then you went on the road and be bought cannon ups or by one so\nWe talked about how big that when at Kaiser was midway through the year beating the RCB by less than a touchdown and a one point when I can and those are pretty important wins right now aren't they sitting in a new one\nYeah they are I mean I'm Glad we pull out towards the end of the game they were really close and it says our guys never give up and fight 'til the very end of the game [noise]\nJoined by Bridgeport senior running back to the bone Jake you're you're on the verge of history and a chance on friday night against Lincoln to become the programs\nAll time leading Russia you need only Seventy four yards to do so how conscious of this record to have you been I'm sure some people have told you how close you have been a over the last couple of weeks and what would it mean to you with all the great running backs that have come through Bridgeport to stand alone as the best\nThere's been a ton of great run about coming through here and bread for some time for running the football so it's often to be to be getting that record and I couldn't have done it without the great teammates that have been around me and the line making holds for me I mean I'm a ... it's off the record bridge\nBoards known for running the football gee I didn't know that I had noticed\n[laughter] a winning is become something that you guys are used to doing no secret their ... and if you finish nine and one are you going to be at home for a couple of games at least in the playoffs that means a lot playing their Bridgeport in the play offs to be at home doesn't it\nYeah it does I mean we had the whole town comes out and watch us and our students actions that number one in the state a lot this year so I mean it's often play in a home with a great a great atmosphere\nYeah the final game of the regular season though you're on the road at Lincoln and tell me what you've seen so far and film studies and ... you know don't give away the secrets of the game plan so to speak but what are you seeing Lincoln I mean obviously we know you're going to run the football but how do you attack this ah this link and ball club defensively\n[noise] um they've got to really get running back and we're going to have to stop them and hopefully a good job on our hands when they have it and if we come out with when\nJake obviously the line is a key ingredient in your running game but the banks that join you in the back you know with the with the things that you guys Ron How important are the up back to have back in the guys that are also alongside you in the backfield\nYes Dr pancake and author Florida and a great job of Bach and very this year and um I could make it to the polls without those guys leading through\nSo the last title the Bridgeport when it's about twenty fifth gene you or what a freshman\nFreshman okay so we might as well go out with a win is a senior right yes that would be awesome [laughter] I bought it we're going to let you go you know it's a it's fun I can I can just hear it in your voice it's fun playing\nOr ... if I play all seeing uh we got a chance to\nDo an essay see which is which is big ever finished a season all of those things ... ... can we can do friday night but um\nNo ... as a great job they're all show up at a you know it it it it always seems like a battle or there's a whole lot\nThat he does get a job if not better than anybody else stuffed animals and law you know and talk about kids and got some kids will be a lot of large human beings after\n[laughter] where's the beef [laughter] it's spring valley coming up on friday night isn't it\nOh my gosh I mean a a a ...\nBrat obviously grace in mouse Evans put a great numbers in the run game all year long yesterday will Adkins announces he's going to be attending Glendale stain playing for the pioneer football program how is he matures this year and know what

in the past ... about six foot five and that's one or the bonuses or\nYou know you got ... and you don't have the world pocket along like we got to last year with they're going to go you know I'm feeling really good ... out routes good in a you know when when things get along really\nWell ... see if we can go to the air and road runner up in the short little different than what we really don't have\nA life partner they'll let you go wow I Know it's a it's an exciting game and a lot of folks around the state's going to be watching the score and listening to a game night when it comes in so best of luck against the high landers into will see a Sunday Morning in Parkersburg okay\nAll right then good go\nThere you go thank you bred ... the head coach Abou spring valley timber wolves guys are getting a little time tonight which is good\nTo pick our games of the week and a a again I think when you look in AAA you could get that one right there Huntington spring valley I mean you could certainly get or the game between partners for example in Parkersburg\nJohn Marshall in wheeling parks a big win a you've got some gained ... you figure greenbrier east ... has to win\nIn order to get into the playoffs for first time alone time so uh a lot of key games in class AAA David what's your thoughts first of all\nWell I think you're right I think you can't go wrong it was a couple of days and you know I was leaning towards Parkersburg south in Parkersburg but um\nYou know just the way Parkersburg south has been playing in the last month and a half in Parkersburg finally being healthy I think that's an intriguing matchup and would county but but you don't pick a bad when you go spring valley Huntington I think if I if I when I go there would county match up do you\nHave to believe I Would go Huntington spring valley and certainly the ... the games that they mentioned are excellent I think those are very strong candidate\nA lot of consequences on this match up if a Huntington is able to win that they could potentially climbed a ladder you know possibly leap over Parkersburg south of the number five spot\nSpring valley with a chance and this is so huge to be able to clinch\nA number two seed and they can do that with a victory they know they're already going to be home for at least two\nPlayoff games that can make it three and it's so huge when you know that hey you avoid Martin's bird and be you can be at home the rest of the way [laughter] yeah they I didn't mean that I didn't mean okay let me make it sound like that but no but it right you know you're right anybody who voice from Orangeburg in their half of the bracket that's a good thing\nOkay so ah you know I I ... everything you guys have said is true I just seem to ... to me was that rival game Parkersburg South Park has ... I think it's you just go with that one up okay there we go some Parkersburg ... South Park has burgers aren't AAA game of the week glass double A. a Joe what's your thoughts first of all\nWayne poker jumps off the page out poker give them a lot of credit they're undefeated that speaks for itself and you know this is a team that had won five games and the previous six seasons and there are a game away from being tend to know\nWithout Ethan pain is still been able to get their way through the last three games but Wayne is playing great great football seven consecutive victories I'd say that has to lead list\nDavid no I agree I I think that's the ones that are absolutely just leaves off the page you Wayne and poke guy I heard a Joe on sports wine earlier tonight talking about Ethan pain or I guess that's the game of the week it's just been updated and uh [laughter]\nBut talking about Ethan pain and al ... has a managed to still when with pain out but Wayne blonde one seven in a row and I'm really really interested to see how these two teams play out coming up on friday\nYeah I Do too I think that's without question the double a game of the week Wayne in pogo class a single a couple of uh entries I Would think wouldn't you I mean wheeling central magnolia van Sherman or some interesting games there\nI think van Sherman because of the consequences involved and you know the way this plays out this could be the first of two meetings that's been possible they could see each other in the first round of the playoffs if everything uh plays out there already clenched playoff spots\nSherman can clinch atop a bird with a victory van in all likelihood would be in the top aides I'd say that might lead to list David I agree\nI also think they get villain summers county there is a ton on the line and that game\nAll right let's go let's go van Sherman way by good vantage German good yup ... already there we go that's our three games of the week don't forget coming up on a friday night\nIt will be game night beginning at nine thirty
