guard was it is a condescending to our understanding because we could only comprehend time in terms of past present and future and yet God\nSees it all at once there's no future no pass it is all present tense with God God who sets in the heavens will\nLaugh he will have them in this region he mocks him when he shows speak in his raft and fix them in his\nDispleasure you see\nI have said my king\nThis has got the father talking about God the sun I set my king on my only\nYou know in science yeah right I've done that you say but he's not sitting there in the mind of\nGod it's already accomplished it's inevitable that it will accomplish that the son of God will rule to enter righteousness and justice with a lot of iron from the city of Jerusalem and we'll fix\nWill punish\nThe heat ...\nWho who'd you imagined a vein thing who reject the idea of God even in their thoughts must listen control\nOf the thoughts and actions he will laugh he was speaking wrath he is a\nGod of knowledge our God is a God of knowledge will and emotion\nThe God that I Know of the Bible that God is not tell us or robotic\nIn Egypt and there's a whole\nOf things that happened he is he is a lot about mistreated in prison for God and and then in the grand scheme of God because of God warning of this going to be seven years of great abundance\nSeven years of famine and this was revealed to Joseph Joseph reveals that the pharaoh and and so far he's given this high position of authority and influence\nSo the famine comes and Jacob tells the remaining sounds go down there and buy some grain so we can survive this\nFamine when they come they have to come to Joseph because he's a minister in this whole uh enriching thing that's going on in Egypt\nThey come to him he recognizes them instantly but they do not recognize him they didn't expect and there are probably some of his uh his his Egyptian uh accessories probably\nA lead to that so he understands them he then goes into a series of of events sort of to to test their character\nAnd he's not yet revealed here in forty three who he is and we're going to swoop in to a gym says forty three inverse twenty six and if you have a Bible feel free to use one of ours their the brown uncovered volume's in the back of the seats if you need more bar one\nBut we're we've been here especially when judge just came home they brought him to present which was in their hand into the house and bow down before him to the earth\nSo they're coming back to to make this arrangement for the buying the grain and so forth but notice what he says he knows who they are they do not know who he is and he asked him about their wellbeing and said is your father well\nThe old man of whom you spoke is he still alive\nEven though he's not revealing his hand at this point the first question they ask us have that in other words\nTo have this first attitude and we see it began to unfold here and it's simply this if we're going to have and to if we're going to have the right attitude has to be an attitude where it's going to say of caring\nOf carrying an attitude of care that is part of that command of the ten commandments to honor our parents and the attitude of care and noticed how his tears expressed in this particular averse how are how is he is he alive is he well\nIf you and I are going to be that role some day or this day\nOr you already have had that day in your life experience you have to do this seek to know the situation of the parents what what is going on to be aware to ask the right questions to ask ask how you doing how you're feeling what can I Do to help how can I and sometimes you have to be\nVery curious\nAnd do some investigation to find out how you can best help but you did to care to be aware and you have to take the time to ask\nTo call to visit to check to to investigate to do that regularly\nThat's what a hard of hearing and that's exactly what Joseph does in this story now the next sections in forty five and I'm not going to read because I got a lot of stuff to pack in and not a lot of time to do it but he eventually then reveals himself to his brother's okay\nAnd the second point I Want to give is this an attitude appears now he's saying and trying to know that situation but secondly we need to seek to work in harmony with the other members of the family\nAnd I know there's sometimes is is difficult of getting a whole family brothers sisters extended family to work together when there's particularly in need for those that are growing older but I assure you you cannot find a family anymore dysfunctional then the family the Joseph was a part of and if he can pull it off God's able to help us do\nI mean after all they wanted to kill him they sold them as a slave they remember what they told of their own father they they took his coat of many callers gifted and go blood and took it back and basically say hey dad you seen this before\nDraw your own conclusion that ... the conclusion that his son is dead I mean this this is this is multiple layers of family dysfunction and basically he calls the we have a job to do collectively and it's just saved his family to say this life and administer to our father\nAnd he's going to tell them to just will say the fuel but he's going to take in bringing down the Egypt and care for him now I also understand working together is is is difficult a difficult because\nInvariably when you're caring for someone elderly ... if even for multiple children multiple persons in the family someone who's going to bear the biggest part of that responsibility is just the way it is that's just the way they don't be bitter about that and if that is not you than you do everything you can to support that person as best you can\nTo give some relief to give some prayer give some financial aid if needed to be there to do what you need to do\nIf you have children\nAnd your children are watching you helped the generation before you you're training them in a good way how maybe they can come along and help you someday\nIt is good training\nMy children my children are sick of hearing it probably to this point actually use the yesterday and a phone call with my son and ah whenever my children I Do something and they say oh dad thank you that was really helpful that was really good ah my standard answer is pick me out a really good nursing homes and [noise]\nThat's the pay back that's the paper\nBut there's a certain amount of training that might come beneficial to use some day so work together cooperative cooperatively and sometimes that means you have to put aside some of the hearts of the past\nBecause dad or mom we're both need us right now we're not going to worry about settling all the scores getting everything right we have a job to do collectively right go through all the chapter forty five and go down to versus Eighteen\nHe's not revealed himself to his brothers and and now he's going to start the process of this this care OK\nVerse Eighteen he says to his brother's bring your father and your household income to me I Will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you eat the fan of the land\nNow you're a command to do this take hard sell the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives bring your father income and do not be concerned about your goods for the best of all of the land that Egypt is yours\nThink about this he's not just going to take care of his father\nHe says oh you brothers you rascal he wants and Benjamin who was not part of the original problem you come and do you live here and bring your children ringer grandchildren bringing a goat Springer she bring are servants bring your stuff and I'll take care of everything\nTalking about some generosity in spite of the fact he had been mistreated here's an example like veterans inside that's one of the great lessons of of a story because we just bring them on a so here they okay he wasn't just\nAnd for a family he's caring for a try I mean he's caring for law and most of all it is it is centered on his father versus eating bring your father Andrew households so not only work in harmony thirdly safety provide safety\nAnd care safety and care most of the two things care safety safety care see care\nAnd safety you are not only nouns are also edges this is what we do and so they come together in this case that needs to be living arrangements\nBy the way many have you been there and had to deal with that and that's not easy [noise] uh I don't know if it fast they're they're traveling on ox carts but maybe you've been there to the day when\nIt's time to give me your car keys because it's not safe for you to drive anymore\nAnd what do you do well you you the safety has to be bound up with care but you know wherever you need to go I'll be there to take you and we'll make sure that you don't get you're not you're not stranded you're not left out and somehow you we we we we have these two concepts together and to be there\nBut that's part of the responsibility of caring so ... says okay you just have to ask them what can we do to make things safe where's the best living arrangement what's the best situation and we do it out of a heart of care and my God help us to make those things will slip over after forty six were just a moment\nIt in the first one a this is now when his father finally arrives\nIn Egypt okay we're going to spend the remaining years of his life\nVersus twenty forty six of genesis\nThen he said Jews before him to Joseph to point out before him the way to go in and they came to the land of the ocean which is a portion of Egypt were twenty nine so judges they reading his chair and went up to go to beat his father Israel and there's this other names Jacob Israel and\nHe presented himself to him and found his neck and wept on his neck a good while in Israel said the Joes now let me die since I've seen your faith because you were still alive\nRemember he spent Thirteen Years thinking the sun was dead eaten by wild animals and suddenly he has what he never thought he'd have and they just go and there's this in the Bible describes it in language but you can just you can picture you can feel it can't you can you imagine if they just in price\nTo embrace this Sunday never thought AMC and two raced his father they wondered if he would ever see again brings us the next thing we're sure would express love and continual concern expressed that live for ... for for Jacob to George owes of his son and come back from the grave that's that's how it's so\nFor for Joseph toward Jake if there was that same sort of thing and we need to take time to express that loss\nAs people get older the world and get smaller and more compact\nAnd more restricted that's the world that we need to enter into and reassure I'll be there for you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "At Home with Gary Sullivan", "city": "Charleston", "day": "21"}
