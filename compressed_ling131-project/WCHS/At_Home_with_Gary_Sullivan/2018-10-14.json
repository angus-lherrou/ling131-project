a young bird and flies soars and\nJust loves it it rises above and\nVerse says that God who for years and he uses regimes crowns ours\nThe cause of the fall and I'm going to say just because of the fall\nInto San we're left with some relational liabilities before us prior to genesis three mankind Adam and Eve were living in paradise can you imagine I mean they were they were living work humankind were originally created to live\nIt had a perfect environment there is no storms there is no bad weather every day was wonderful you didn't have to work and slave and wonder where your next meal's coming from you just went out and pulled it off or whatever you want to that day and there was perfect health unending life\nFellowship with God know relational difficulties and then she after three comes along and it's not my purpose today to give me an exposition of the first half of this chapter but do you remember man kind of ... and he was tempted Adams participate they had one thing to do what they had one rule to obey\nYou need of every tree except that one just to stay away from that one\nThat's exactly where say ... zeroes in on they succumb to the temptation they feel guilty they hide themselves they tried to cover themselves [noise] God shows up and then he speaks inverse fourteen God says is that the lord said to the Serbian because you've done this you were cursed more than all cattle\nMore than every beach to the field\nOn your belly you should go and you show eat dust all the days of your life\nAnd I will put him to the between you and the woman in between your seat in her seed he show bruise your head and you show bruises heal mess by the way the beginning of the gospel story\nSatan will also receive a fatal blow the humankind will receive a DEA belt tightening blow but it will be recovered and because of the seeds of God alternately the persons of Jesus Christ\nAnd then him or sixteen and again speaking first women and he was ... to do we have the woman and two women in general and then we're Seventeen and following to demand so let's reverse sixteen to the woman he said I Will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception\nIn pain and she'll bring forth children your desire shall be for your husband and he's shown rule over\nYou\nHave a certain parts I sort of pull at one part of a certain parts of this that we probably understand he says you're I'm going to multiply two things your sorrow well we're living in sin curse world we're living not in the paradise that God originally intended were living in this fall world mark and pockmarked by sin and this devastation\nAlso says I'm a multiplier conception I as best thing I could ascertain but that is because now we have death entering the humans scene\nAnd not only just to ... or they multiply and fill the earth but death is is is a factor there so God I think speeds up the woman's ability to conceive\nTo speed up the process of reproduction multiplier conception in pain you should bring for children and we understand there's two probably aspects of that a birthing their child is a painful experience physically but also the pain of that he would know into some sense we know that we're bringing children into a less than perfect world\nMarked with sand and all that comes from it the key phrase here is that your desire\nShelby for your husband but weren't desire is an interesting Hebrew word is pronounced test you call\nThe next time it appears as in the next chapter of the Bible\nIt's where Cain and Abel you remember that story the first two sons of Adam and Eve and came kills able you remember that the first murder and human\nHistory and God says to ... to ... he says sin is lying at the door it's the same word as desired work towards your husband\nIt literally means is reaching out he was saying came the temptations desire to this is the thing you're considering doing is reaching out trying to get his clutches on you and told you to itself\nWhen he says here your desire is this that it means that a woman's natural inclination is to reach out and connect and we start with this point relational why liabilities come here at the fall\n[noise] all the things that cause conflict have their genesis here when in fact it doesn't happen in the original creation because that was perfect so it has to have in the fall and God gives us some clues here they happened at the fall\nAnd you see here but the thing that changes that we're going to look at in several things obviously change is that she will have this natural build in desire to connect we would say it this way women have a hard wired\nNeed to connect\nI use the word hardwired because this is not environmental this is not experiential\nThis is part of who we are as fall and creatures and how God sees us as he relates to us and how our our our creation now adapt to this new reality\nIt simply means this that women have this need in this longing to connect you see as among mothers and there's just something about this nurturing spirit of mothers have I'll tell you someplace else you see it\nI find a group of elementary age students like if some of your teachers you can you can experiment on this tomorrow okay if you can try this don't tell you when you're doing it just be secret about it but find a group of you know for fifth sixth grade girls and and listen to them talk okay what are they what are they talking about [noise] oh\nMy friend your friend my friend my friend I don't know if you're my friend you're my best friend forever would you be my second best rented for infringement for infringement right\n[noise] what do you get a bunch of ... guys together\nJust had a real punch in each other and you know competing against each other and\nYou know kind of jockeying for position in favor it's a whole different dynamic and I think this was indicating to us that there are some gender specific differences that are just part of who we are there's variations there's differences and I know we can't we can't talk about every every nuance but in General Allen see that as the case\nSo her basic nature is she wants to make a connection with her husband she doesn't just want to be there she wants to have his heart she wants to know I'll tell you where you see this\nEnd of the day husband and wife are together he's come home from work she's either been at home or she comes home from work uh guys you've been there I Know this she says sweetheart how was your day\nAnd there's the classic one word answer that we typically would give right fine trust me that is not the right answer she doesn't want to hear fine and\nBe done with it she wants to enter into your heart\nAnd hear about your fears and your dreams and your hopes and and how you relate to that and it's not just that she's inquisitive although she is but she wants she wants to reconnect\nOn a heart level\nAnd here's us them guys after ... fine give me the paper find turn on the news fine you know feed me so there's this hardware connection let's talk about the the ... which is around ... to men for just a moment 'cause it's here in the text\nThan the enemy said because you've heated the voice of your wife and if even from the tree which I commend you say you should not eat of it here this person is the ground for your sake\nInto your show eat of it all the days of your life\nBut thorns insist symbols as your\nBring forth for you and your show eighth or but the field and the sweat of your face usually bred to return to the ground for out of it you were taken for dust you are and the dust you shall return\nWow that's a that's a heavy load and especially the death\nGoing back to the death of the earth part\nBut if you take that as a whole you take that as a as a comprehensive whole here is his hardwired experience men have a hard wired need to control and I don't mean that that they that they're controlling or over control and but that's just the basic nature to take that which is chaotic and make it orderly\nThink about Adams' experience what do you experience the world was perfect\nEverything was in its place everything worked there was no frustration\nNow you flip past since what do you have you have almost nothing but frustration you wants food you got to go dig a hole and plant the seed comes up and hope it doesn't die before it reaches fruition\nAnd you're gonna have to sweat and there's going to be all these things against you for ... it's going to be suddenly this world that was perfect in the paradise they have now been banished from it and now he is living in a chaotic environment what he wants to\nDo above all things just take that disorder and rearrange it so that it's orderly bring it under some sense of control\nI Know this isn't over this is a an oversimplification there's there's always variations to the rule but I think that's why men typically like machinery better than than usually women you know whether it's a car machinery or even something technical or artistic or they say they like to take that which is an orderly and and make it orderly\nOh I've got that car turned like a kitten most women say cats per cars don't her I said this is the machine it's a thing\nBut we like to we like to get it all working and everything worked like everything orderly\n\nBut also we know that is not the case so those that leaves us with some liabilities because we understand that\nWe have this building frustration that the world is not orderly and particularly when you enter into a relationship with a creature that is not your kind a woman who wants to connected you want to control there's there's an interface there", "show_name": "At Home with Gary Sullivan", "year": "2018", "city":
