to find love and particularly notice how it's\nThat's how it's framed he's talking to her husband's about loving the wives by the way this is very similar to what we looked at last week\nOr if you look at birth twenty two he's talking to was twenty three is talking to was the first twenty four he's talking to was so three versus the also mentions wives again in the very end of thirty three so ... wives get three and a half versus\nHusbands get versus twenty five twenty six twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty thirty one thirty two and half a thirty three\nI don't know if we're just slow\nBut I think it's probably because he wants to wake up husbands to their God given responsibility to love their wives obviously why should love their husbands and parents love their children children their their parents and brothers and sisters so this this is a great all purpose truth because it it fits every relationship love\n'cause that's what we want to focus on this morning it's sacrificial now what does it mean for us to sacrifice well if you're going to sacrifice something that means you're going to have less of something so the other person could have more of something\nGot that you have less they have more dangerous time to say what I'm about to say that might mean less football and more conversation\nThat might mean less screen time and more face time that might mean less work and more fun it might mean just pay attention\nBut whatever it means for you find out where it is and the point you need to work on this is the great thing about God's word Holy Spirit can take and just just just find a place where that puzzle piece fits and snaps into a perfect place in your life\nWhere is it in your life you need to have less of something so the other person can have more\nThat's how Christ's love the church husbands love your wives justice Christ love the church was sacrificial he calls us out on this this is going to cost us something\nThis is going to be giving up something that might be a value to otherwise it involves surrender and it's certainly involves actions not just words you\nAll you want to understand there's an old saying that says you know they said talk is cheap\nAnd that that has explained because the supply is so much larger than the demand is one of the reasons is cheap but I remember years ago I worked in a photo lab and with digital photography no one knows what that is anymore at least had this stuff and cameras called film and you had to do stuff with it to make pictures I Love it so I was one of the guys that made pictures out of it\nAnd that one day someone came to the place I worked in a ... and there was this was big bouquet of flowers being delivered by flour I mean he was outrageously big I mean you know like I could never before to that point in life this\nIs a ... outrageously big bunch of flowers and and they said this for certain person this lady whose name was call came and got it of course everybody's you know look and wonder what this is about\nShe she takes it back into the lab where we all worked in the you know you're close quarters or ensues um she she pulls a tag that reads it was tied back them over the Olin below cars over to a trash can and just go\nBam and we all go [noise]\nI don't know what that was about\nBut the flowers were words but somewhere somehow there was a disruption of action\nSo it's not just just just to the fright expressions it's not just words in actually sacrifice love requires sacrifice you have to have less of something so someone else can have more of something\nThat's what Jesus did for you and by the way you're on the hook when because as as this has have Christ love the church and don't think of churches a building where the towers people on it or across on the side the churches us it's it's you it's me it looks the very end of that same verse\nHusbands love your wives justice Christ lead the church and gave him self for\nHer\nLove gives to the other person\nSomething you have is transferred to that person to give to give you think of all that he gave to us he gave us his love you gave us this attention it gave us his teacher he gave us his patients\nAre starting to someone this morning after the after the first service and and we were talking about a particular subject and the person said I don't know why God doesn't just rained judgment down upon this on this on this planet of hours\nAnd I said it's obvious God is a lot more patient than you and I would be\nAnd he certainly is he's got to just be thankful he's given his patients he's given us time to grow up he gives us\nA second chance and a third chance and a fourth chance and a four hundred chance and a four thousand chance he said God gives us for getting he's given us gifts to the spirit\nSo that we can we have unique and special ways to serve him\nSo how do we apply this now remember he's talking about ... love your wives at the beginning of twenty five crisis gay themself that's the gifted he also loves through sacrificial love so how do we have to put this and I'm going to give me some suggestions are giving you one find something that you can do less that someone else going to have more\nAnd you might well just jot these now as we want to make these a matter of prayer and we bring this to a conclusion but what can you give you have to know something about that person about what they they need and what they liken what's valuable to them what can you give them\nNext month in October\nForty years ago so we're to forty fifth anniversary of when Julie and I had her first date\nWe were a young poor college students at the time we actually met at church the church that I started attending we moved back in Raleigh county and and the ... in this church and I didn't know her family she played the piano in in the church and sermon was good but the piano playing caught my eye\nAnd uh so we were introduced in the basement of of this church and [noise] so anyway um I found out early on that because she was studying music that was her thing and I found out ... early on we were from different worlds\nI was Beach Boys and beetles and she was Bach and Beethoven okay so we were we were in different orbits together\nYou know different orbits and we want to be together and one one friday night we were there was a date with that money so you could go anywhere so so what do you want to do she says I'd like to get down to the library and listen to ... new world symphony\n[noise]\nYou know what I did I went down there and put headphones\nOn and and listen to the [noise]\nBecause it's what she liked give her what she likes and for years and now\nThey ruined it by the way but we used to get tickets to go to this this was in the center they frequently but ah now they only do Saturday Night concerts and I've always tried to keep Saturday nights at home just so I'm ready for Sunday so when they lemonade to friday nine concerts you haven't seen me there for a while but maybe they'll fix that someday\nBut which is I mean go to there and listen to this music because I wanted to give this to her and they're not actually learned to appreciate some of it\nAnd some of it\nBut you give and so what is it that person these what are they like given that blessing you're going to figure that out\nBut give them what you need to figure out what it is and just be giving person\nOften times we get so fascinating so fast and I should say on our own needs well I'd like you to do this for me I like you not to do that because I don't like that I won't you I Want you you should not why don't you\nGive him is very much focus the other way you know the opposite of love is not hatred ultimately the opposite of love is selfishness I Want love is what you want and what you need\nHusbands love your wives just as Christ's love the church sacrifice and gave in ...\nGa they got help us to take a few steps in the right direction\nNow he goes into another section here in starting embers twenty six that that again is this inner woven whoa weaved together do aloe to your doctrines of Christ and the church and husbands and wives all brought together in into one unify whole he he\nGave himself ... twenty five that ... he might sanctify and cleanser with a washing of the water the word that he might present or to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that she should be holy and without blemish\n\nSo he's he does these things for the church and noticed that there are all things of significance than you might sanctify and clans sanctify means\nTo make holy makes effort put in the category of specialist usefulness the God of the words God belong John Donne belonging\nAnd Clinton with a washing of water by the word where's this cleansing come from he's given this word\nThis is powerful stuff for cleaning up\nThis is this is spiritual detergent that God has given us to to to flush out the the the the accumulated and sticky nagging remnants of the old man that's still the part of us the washing of the word", "show_name": "At Home with Gary Sullivan",
