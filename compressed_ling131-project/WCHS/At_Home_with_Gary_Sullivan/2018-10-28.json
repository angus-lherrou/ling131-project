ever growing animosity towards Jews and you wipe it out and it comes back up why\nFrom the Eighteen hundreds to World War one Nineteen forties Nineteen Seventeen the pages of history are filled with

without the people and\nIt came to pass there's always that animosity I could take you to earlier his race where you eat in a school all the way back\nBefore let's go back\nTo the crusades food different who said so called Christian crusades we're the enemy was the Muslim and the enemy was also from the Christians the Jews and the Jews were killed along with the Muslim is by those so called\nChristians which was a political campaign not a Christian outreach and all history\nDo you realize that the year that I Love the sale of the ocean balloon in Fort team Ninety two percent of the ocean blew the same year hang Ferdinand and queen Isabella of Spain\nWho paid for the voids you love Bush with his three little ships\nThat same year they X fail to all Jews from Spain who would not convert\nTo Christianity why such such animosity I've even who back for that matter but why why is there such a tree\nListen to the Bible and just take this you are a Jew in the time of day and and we're in\nThe synagogue or is this temple rather and somebody read that the kings says the earth first to solve the to the king says ears have set themselves and the ... council together against the lord adding that\nAgain is annoying Ted\nWho would you see is the is knowing you would think Israel and you would be\nThe Bible speaks of Israel was be God's annoying did speak should guards people Israel as being he is in here it is here is the reason for the\nOn going animosity hatred against Jews as witness in the synagogue\nThis habit in Pittsburgh here\nIt is not just that the nations are\nAnd why is that is a byproduct\nThe food is the basic state that is the nation's are against God\nGive me any\nAct of aggression against God's people the Jews is an active rebellion and aggression against the God of the Bible you can skate that\nGenesis twelve one two and three\nAre still in the Bible timeless\nNow the actual type of literature and the type of writing style if you want to say that way it was John Roberts of that is history he tells Jesus story\nStreet in sequence and in roughly chronological format he he begins the beginning talks about his beginning was you know John the Baptist and the baptism in the beginning of ministry and all the way through up to the crucifixion resurrection and so forth so it's a history we understand we understand that kind of literature\nAnd then there's first second and third job which are if you use the the church language very pistols which is a fancy word for a letter\nOr so their form of a writing a letter addressing believers that he was not personally with but sent them this letter we understand that the form of of writing a letter is different than writing a history it's more subject driven than it is a narrative driven\nBut then we open this book of revelation if you've ever done this before if you've ever tried to read through it you don't get too far until you get this big moment of\nWhat does all this stuff about four horsemen and beast rising in angels in vials and judgments and dragons I mean it suddenly we're just sort of rock back on her heels of saying what is this all about what goes back to this word apocalypse\n... the style of writing but the form that God chose to put this in\nIs what we would call and this has been true in their day what we would call of that forms I probably wouldn't\nBe the same term but it's apocalyptic literature is a different style\nAnd it's a different style is full of symbolism if you see the word signify down in the end diverse one that means that that means that it's signal something get it's symbolic\nAnd there are several reasons that it does if you think about this is a powerful way of describing he could've described in the text of scripture there is this coming to Iran nickel world dictator coming on the same\nI just sort of slaves they're like okay that's a description of history class but it said he says I saw a beast and suddenly\nOur imagination is ignite and and we're paying attention and it says something about the ferocity the power the character the instinct the manner in which this person is going to approach his son his his limited role in this world for a limited time\nSo it is full of it is full of symbols\nAnd this type of literature has some key words and you might just want to notice the words would be as or like or a parents\nThey're all they're all comparison words\nAnd by the way you see those words just absolutely scattered throughout the book of revelation and the reason he says this was like that and that was asked that this was in the parents as it's because he doesn't have categories to put the things he's seeing into\nThinking with me for just a moment but still thought exercise may help us understand the nature of this book in this type of of of writing\nImagine that you have a job and is your job to go to a very primitive a village somewhere in the in in in somewhere far off place and the people who live there have know have had no contact with our technology\nAll of our modern conveniences I'd never seen it they don't have any category for it I don't have anything to try and your job is to tell them that the company you work for is going to be running electricity into their religion how wonderful it is going to be for them you can you imagine trying to destroy they'd never seen electric they don't haven't seen any of electrical appliance\nAnd you say now here's how this all just get everybody together ... I'm going to tell you this wonderful thing coming it's called electricity\nMeans nothing it's sort of like sort of like moving fire\nThat is what it's like and way off somewhere there's this thing called a generator but you don't know what that is you don't understand about resistance and homes and boats and watts and all that stuff\nSo it is so this this machine that this this thing moves and as soon as this this moving fire along wire but you've never seen a wire before well it's sort of like\nIt's like a vine strung through the trees actually they're not trees there are polls which you've never seen polls and actually polls are trees with their trees that we cut down took the limbs off and then we start to treat back in the ... never mind that's way too complicated\nThe vine just goes through the trees and it comes to your hot and it brings this moving fire to your ... and up in the top of your hot it's going to be this light but well um\nThere's going to be this little it's like a little son and when you when the ... real sun goes down and it gets dark this this moving fire is going to come in and this little son is going to light up your hot\nAnd now after ... when you normally would go to bed now you could stay up late and do more work\nAre you excited about this new invention we've got four yet\nAnd you can run this you can run the electricity into your stove but you've never seen so it's sort of like sort of like a a hollow log like us up and down the hall and you can run this electricity and you can bake bread without getting smoke in your eyes\nYou see what you do with that you have to do all comparisons all analogies that's what that's that's what he has to do in this book because we've not seen the likes of the things that he's going to describing this book so it's a parents it's like it it signifies these things here's the important thing don't miss the forest for the trees\nDon't get fastened on all of the seven hundred and forty four thousand sixty six sixty six ... and and all of the beast and in in angels because come back to the first one is the revelation of Jesus Christ\nAnd the big picture will get into more detail later as we go through the basically the revelation is the story the account the pre story if you will of God the father fulfilling a promise to God the sun that he\nWould rule and rain over all the nations of the world and ... of his rule there would be no end by the way that's the theme of the book of Daniel as well\nAnd many of these these symbols that you see in revelation you can find their their their their predecessor if you will back in in Daniel and Isaiah and he's the CEO and those type of books so we're going to a lot of comparison that way since the revelations ... well what do we want to reveal that Jesus first of all here's what we need to do we need to see the\nOf Jesus see his power his ability his rights and rode his ability to rule and the significance of his rule and how he is going to arrive at that rule\nAs we come all through the twenty two chapters of this book\nTo see his power you say when it says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him to show his servants service that's us\nThat you if you're one of his children you want to be serves God wants his service to see\nJesus in a whole new line it's not to show those who are the skeptics or to show those who who don't care if the show his servants so part of this way of writing is so that in his spiritual truth that believers can understand\nAnd also those who are not believers probably are going to say what is that all of them\nBecause this is special truth\nFor those who are followers of God to encourage them by the way this was written probably around Ninety five eighty or John was the last surviving of the twelve apostles he\nWrote we'll find out later this chapter that he wrote it when he was an exile on the island the pat mostly was basically send out there to be in this uh this prison to be away from everybody\nIt was a time when the Roman empire was persecuting the church in fact I never was on the throne at this particular time that pass a law that said every Roman citizen if you want to be part of the society and have all the perks of benefits you would have to once a year ago and to a temple\nAnd take some incense and throw it on the altar and say the words Caesar is lord and that's what you had to say\nNow if you're a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ you ... you're not going to be saying that that's not what you believe and because of their rejection of the divinity the idea of the divinity Caesar persecution was now mounting the church was under attack\nBy the way that might be another reason why it's written in this form because this is going to talk about a cane them coming that's going to supersede all the kingdom's even Rome itself\nThat being the case uh this could not be used against the church and persecution it was like he was like code language and unbelievers going to say that just doesn't make any sense at all about peace and angels and all that kind of stuff\nI don't make any sense at all for us who know the truth this has gone revealing Jesus Christ is\nSo no his power see the power of Jesus I might give you some words today we're working on her word power will let me just give you two words and we see the power of Jesus as we encountered him and his exalted state number one look and secondly listen\n... look\nLook at him consider him think of him notice him mark him\nLook let me give you a couple of practical ways to do that\nAnd we've just begun I also want you to finish in this study together okay we've got a long ways to go but what we've gotten wills ... we're going to get there but I Would encourage you to look I read the passage before you come on Sunday mornings or Sunday evening okay and\nYou say what am I should or shouldn't read well we're stopping at verse three so just start immersed for and just go to the end of the chapter okay I just read whatever's next okay the re before ... but ... says this is familiar to you you've already got some questions in your mind that you want to get answered you're already thinking you're opening yourself to the word against the look", "show_name": "At Home with Gary Sullivan", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "28"}
