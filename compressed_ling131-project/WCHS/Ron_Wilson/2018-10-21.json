performance continues the Ninety it here at this historic program please join us next time for music and the spoken word\nUntil we need to make peace be with you this day and don't wait\nYears you know [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nThe\nDouble do you see a jazz\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nMm\n\nWell I I Know that my dad handed down a guitar to me when you family heirlooms and I I Know you know about guitars yeah\nBut I honestly can't think of something on this earth that means more to me than just the love of my family being able to to reach out to my parents or my siblings to\nAre still with me I'm just so grateful for those opportunities and I'm grateful because my parents taught me the love of grudge I'm sure that's a good do you have a favorite position\nYou know it's interesting most of my positions like you just said are are reminders of people and relationships you know probably one of them would be the Bible my parents gave it to me when I was eleven years old and I still have um\nProbably my wedding rings would be considered at most prized possessions yeah you know still where the engagement ring or the same but yeah I guess we all have things that um would really be devastating to us if we ever lost\nWell in our message today with Zach will be discussing the things we hold on to the things we put our trust him apart from God\nI think this looks different for every one for example if you knew God was calling you to do something new to take a leap of faith what things in your life would hold you back from following his voice\nKnow I think so many of us would say that money is the thing we put too much trust in but I think it goes even beyond that\n[noise] this message had me think about comfort whether it's in our daily routine or or even in our ministry do we get too comfortable to allow the Holy Spirit to move in a more powerful way\nYeah cup or it can be a dangerous thing for trusting in the tangible falsely believing that some of these things will always be constant like our job or money when a significant or an expected life change occurs it can throw our world into chaos\nBut if our trust us first and someone who never changes that's a peace and stability that this World Cup offer\nThat's right well it's as you know Bernie there was a time in my life when there was a very a drastic significant unexpected life change that could very well his uh put me into it and the chaos for the remainder being\nBut at that point um I had to look for the peace and stability that the world can't offer because that's the only thing that holds you up\nYeah and ... that witness testimony that you displayed\nOr whether you know it or not has impacted literally generations of people at the least of which would be your own daughter yeah and people who are standing on the outside praying try to just\nCall down the angels surround you and your family as you went through that loss I went through a similar life\nChange when my brother in law passed away I\nI didn't understand how a such a young age God\nWould call someone home but cats are\nUh unfortunately took his life and I'm as a husband I didn't know what to say to my wife you know what scripture verses do you read or\nWhat prayer you're supposed to pray and someone who we loved dearly a pastor at our church at that time major Ronnie Robbins just share the idea of hope with us and reminded us that our hope is in Christ and there's nothing in this world can offer\nThat comes close to God's love and the hope that he gives us in a life long after this one\nI Am so lately and so I Hope this message encourages you to reflect and pray about this topic\nLet us know how it spoke to send us an email if you would at radio at us as the salvation army dot org or send us a message on Facebook or Twitter just search for wonderful words of lie [noise]\n\nWell hello there and uh we're gonna continue on our series and trust but today we kind of make a shift\nAs we now examine our trust in us and sometimes how we have some too much trust in ourselves and so we're just going to be looking at that and how we need to balance that out with our trust in God\nToday in the six message we turn to for Samuel\nFor Samuel chapter seven and which we find a the Israel lights been subdued by the Philippines and we find this this great uh this great man of God Samuel who gives these instructions to God's people when we look at\nFirst Samuel chapter seven we find Samuel giving these instructions to the house of Israel starting in verse three says this\nIs Samuel said to the whole house if Israel if you are returning to the lord with all of your heart's lunar ruins your cells of the foreign gods and the ash wrists and commit yourself to the lord and serve\nHim only\nAnd when you do this he will deliver you out of the hands of the ...\nVerse forces and so the Israelites put away all of their other gods and served the lord only\nAnd we see the rest of the story on how that Jay the Israel lights one over the Phyllis teens why because the lowered delivered\nBut you see the truth is is that Samuel had to give that instruction didn't he he had to say put away those other God's you know I I don't know about you but me from time to time I tend to put my faith I tend to put my trust in things other than God\nI I tend to put you know I yeah I have great faith in God but I also have a great faith my money I have great faith in my automobile I have great faith that I'm going to have a job or a roof over my head and at times if I'm not careful I sometimes put more faith\nIn those things in those substance things rather than the things on scene\nAnd on this day the message from Samuel to God's people to the Israeli ... says hey you need to put all of your faith your trust in God\nThrow away all of those other gods\nNow don't hear when I'm not saying I'm not saying that we need to throw away our money or throw away our houses or cars or things like that\nBut what I Am saying is this may we examine our trust right now our faith in ourselves\nAnd see an ask if maybe we have a little too much in that\nEr em a story for date for today comes from a preschool\nWhenever it was in preschool or she actually uh\nNow let me just go ahead and say this we have the most perfect daughter but for whatever reason when she was in preschool she was an absolute these\nI don't know what the deal was but every day it seemed like she would come home with this little toy in her pocket which she stole\nFrom preschool it was a little pig of all things a little plastic dirty pig that for whatever reason every single time Shelley would would take him his clothes off at night and start to throw him get ready for the ... there was that pig in her pocket\nAnd every night it seemed like Shelly had to have that same talk with Emma over and over again Emma\nYou're not supposed to do this at stealing don't do this why did you do this and every day we have to take that pig back to school apologize to the teacher\nDo all those things and still it would continue to happen we continue to happen now\nShelley and I thought we had the most brilliant plan what we did was as we literally bought her a whole farm\nYou know the little people the Fisher Price little people far we bought her that it had pigs it had cows it had a big barn had a tractor it had the little people and we just thought that for sure because I'm a how these things that we thought she loved then all of a sudden she would stop stealing a pig and sure enough I must stop stealing a pig\nFor a whole week but\nWe again had to go back to him and say ... we just bought you the farm Weiner ... still stealing this pig to what she says\nBecause daddy it can fit in my pocket I like it because it fits in my pocket\nBefore I could get to a ... am I thought you know something there's so many things that I still hold onto because it's so easy it's so convenient it fits in my pocket it fits in my understanding\nBecause of that I can only imagine that I missed out on the opportunities when the blessings that God has in store for me he bought the whole farm for me\nAnd yet I still just cling onto in trust in the little things\nThat I understand that can sit in my pocket\nAs we start to examine our trust in ourselves that we understand that we have a God to spot the farm\nWho has so much a store for us\nWe've got to trust ourselves less\nWe must decrease in order for him to increase\nThe spray bottle we thank you so much we thank you so much that you're a God who has bought the farm for your God who desires to deliver us your God who has greater things in store for us bother we've got NPR pockets of those other little gods but there's other little pigs\nThat just get in the way if you're black\nHelp us the trust ourselves less so we can trust you", "show_name": "Ron Wilson", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "21"}
