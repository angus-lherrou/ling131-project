[noise] well hello again so excited to be getting into God's word with you once again as we now\nAre in our seventh message together examining our trust now in ourselves and our trust in God and today we look at Matthew chapter Seventeen to put this into context we find Jesus coming down the mountain after he had just\nGone through his trance figure ration with his own disciples where he was revealed\nOr even more so to his disciples and heading down the mountain that day it says this when they came to the crowd man approached Jesus and note before him lord he said inverse Fifteen\nHave mercy on my son he has seizures and suffering greatly he often falls into the fire into the water I brought him to your disciples but they could not heal them\nFor Seventeen Jesus Says to his disciples ... unbelievable perverse generation how long show I stay with you how long should I put up with you\nBring the boy to me\nJesus review the demon and it came out of the boy and he was healed from that moment into disciples came to Jesus in private and asked why couldn't we drive it out\nHe replied because you have so little faith I tell you the truth if you have faith the small as a mustard seed you can say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move\nNothing will be impossible for you you know I don't know about you but I Would think that the disciples had at least a little bit of faith they literally\nFollow Jesus they left their jobs they left their families they left their lives and they went and they live and they work and they went along side Jesus\nIn for a Jesus to get so uh I mean Jesus got pretty tough on them right here and for him to say you have such little faith I start to question what is Jesus\nMean by that is if you were to look at Mark's rendition of the same passage you would find Jesus saying this kind of demon can only come out by prayer this kind of team it can only come out by prayer you see the disciples were literally trying to take the demon\nOut in their own power in our own string yes they were with Jesus yes they trusted him but all of a sudden they started trusting too much in their own power in their own strengths\nRather than in God's rather than in God's\n[noise] you know growing up one of the things that we did for him as we paid for her to go to dance lessons and I can remember it was so funny to be honest with us as little girls would go to these dance classes can and will took ballet\nFirst and when I say first I mean literally first because after a few lessons and\nAfter her first recital Emma thought that she had absolutely accomplish ballet she was ready to move on to the next thing\nAnd I can remember saying you know daddy I'm ready to take the next dance lesson 'cause I Know ballet I've done the concert I've done it all too which is that I'm a all you do a squad up and down up and down I Know that ... ... I think\nBut when they're little girls it's literally just squatting up and down that's all it is but in her mind she was absolutely accomplished ballerina and so she was ready to move\nOn she got a head of herself\nWe do that from time to time don't we\nRight here we see the disciples themselves doing that\nAs literally here they are trying to do God's work without God's power\nAs believers we are called to do his work were called to be his hands in his feet but guess what he has to empower us to do that I Love\nIn the book of acts where it says will receive power\nAnd the Holy Spirit comes a point us\nAnd at that time we will get to be as witnesses all over the world God desires to empower each and every one of us\nBut maybe not get ahead of ourselves maybe not put too much faith in us but made that faith and trust be in God who empowers us", "show_name": "Ron Wilson", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "28"}
