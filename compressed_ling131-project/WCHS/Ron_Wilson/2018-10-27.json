{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "Wrestle with how do I get back in or how do I get myself out for a little while\nOur advice do you would be to consider dollar cost averaging if you have to do something and Brent what is dollar cost averaging and how might somebody use that approach to you know maybe ... some of their emotional battles that the wrestling\nAnd hearing my I mean simply put dollar cost averaging for most people they understand it in terms of when they're putting money into an investment they'll start there but when you are putting dollars into investing let's say at the four o one K plan\nMost people choose to have those contributions from your pay spread out over the course of the year and you can go typically on line to your four one K. providing you can choose X amount of dollars or X. percentage of my paycheck taken out each and every week or every other week or monthly or whoever your pay cycle works\nAnd the thought is is you're just going to be on a disciplined approach putting a mountain over the course of the year so that regardless of whether the market is a downer sideways\nDuring the course of that year year consistently putting money in and on average size ... dollar cost averaging you're trying to get an average share price or value as you're putting money in rather than trying to guess is the market at a low should I Try to put most of my foreign K contradictions in in this paycheck this month this week\n'cause a lot of times again people aren't going to get it right so it's better to kind of had your bat diversify the timeframe over which you're making investments spread it out and over time meaning that your average share price or value will be a safer way to invest rather than to try to kind of put it all at once\nYou know you said some of their Brent that hit me people think that they're concerned about getting it right and as a result they're even more concerned about getting it wrong and so they'll just sit and they won't do anything they won't act\nAnd you know whether or not they want it to reduce some of the risk and take their dollars out of the market or vice versa dollar cost averaging is something that\nCan at least appeal to some of your emotion and some of the I can at least get some of it right I'm not going to get all of it right because depending on which way the market moves you won't get all of it right but you can ease your way in the end or use your way\nOut of the market by you know let's just say you have a hundred thousand dollars in a portfolio and it's all invested and you're sitting here you're freaking out you can't handle the stomach what's going on\nYou know maybe you consider taking hunks of that out slowly\nAnd dollar cost averaging your way out or vice versa if you have dollars on the sidelines and you're thinking I Want to get in I Want to figure out how to get my assets working for me rather than going all in dollar cost averaging it might make you feel a little bit better and\nRent this is really the challenge we're trying to manage our emotions as a part of this overall investment\nProcess mark in all honesty is is going to sound like silly and somewhat obnoxious advice but for many they'd be far better off if they would just turn off the TV not read all the investment articles they can get their hands on all the times because for most one confuses them\nTo it causes a lot of stress in their life and sadly most media sources no the bad news cells better than good news\nSo they tend to hyper focus on the scary stuff and the bad stuff and it's just the way the human brain works most people are more afraid of possibilities of losses in the opportunities are again so they focus on is that it's dangerous

something it's like you so much for being here today\nThank you thank you for having me it is a very\nInteresting world that you come from one of a crime and murder an investigation and and I'm Wondering how\nOne that gets started in down a career path like that you said that murder chose me to the title of your program or how did it managed to do that and with your path a significantly different from that of your peers\nYeah yeah when I was a three my mother was a victim up or murderers who shot ... times domestic violence type situation um and I guess the title it's a yeah I'm I'm a spiritual guy so it's based on I think I was pretty destined to do that I think that was that that that that God chose for me\nIt made things a lot a lot clearer for me I understood more than than most especially the part where Osama grandparents' experience in the loss and you know all those vulnerabilities and fears and\nI'm grief so it's difficult for me to to work a case in brings some closure to it I think it was just prepared for that\nAnd is that foundation that tragic foundation in your life something that you have at the back of your mind or or perhaps in your subconscious when you investigate crimes how does that shape how you'll pursued a your career and how you pursue cases\nYeah you know I think it's probably more subconscious than anything and I think it's probably the motivation I don't know I just have a passion for a feel strangely comfortable at crime scenes and and you know it's kind of feel like is what I'm supposed to be\nWhat drives people are in your experience giving your investigation is to ah to the act of murder most often I mean what what brings people to the point that that they would take another a human life and your\nExperience well I think I think some people\nJust have that propensity for violence and you know it it's always the same thing you know those bill seven seven deadly sins loves greed\nYeah those those type things that that kind of drive people and I think when a person wants to control the motor control whatever it is going on in their life that's what they do I mean that's the ultimate control I suppose I think that\nUh you know violence is something that you know I think everybody's doing it but but I think there are people that that just don't have\nThose those innovations or or the mechanism that stops

concerning to a lot of folks around Bram well who have made a big investment down they're putting up cabins camp grounds and that sort of thing to cater to riders but\nHe said don't forget they are going to reopen it but one thing that they are concerned about and this is a little bit bigger of a problem and they don't really know what to do\nIs folks who um who or what I I guess for lack of a better term are outlaw riders where they they they might start on the head deal McCoy trail and then they move off to somewhere else or that's trespassing that's not your land and that's against the law and even in West Virginia\nYeah so um I talked to a gym for best these about these issues this week\nWhat we're doing is you know a ... kind of trial system which is primarily located in Mercer county it's on\nMining coal property and we have some mining operations that are expanding in it and as part of the expansion and gosh knows we we need and welcome those mining jobs because they're putting a lot of West Virginia is to work\nWe're going to have to move that system or to an adjacent partial our property and we'll be bringing the current system off line December third which is pretty much at the end of our riding season and this spring will be bringing a new system on line that will still be the Pocahontas trail system connecting into the town of Bram well\nThat will be further away from the the current mining operations and we do this you know for the safety of our writers you know we don't want our riders in or near these active surface operations and certainly we need to get out of there are folks way because those those mining operations or economic development\nThis is not unusual I mean the way the model works used the ... part of the agreement if if they agreed to allow you to run a trail on their property\nThere's always the possibility that that could be reopened the for mining or ... or some other you know mineral extraction there and that's part of the deal when that's going on the trail it becomes a secondary user\nOh absolutely and we we move a folks don't realize that that our the seven hundred and thirty miles Hatfield McCoys trails we have we probably move Seventy two a hundred miles a trail around\nEach year sometimes it's a single trails sometimes it's half a trail system a timber ring a certainly goes on throughout all this you know are footprints two hundred and fifty thousand acres so you you got imagine at any given time probably fifty thousand of that aid reaches is being tampered so\nA lot of times with the timber will go back behind them after they're out you know a year year and a half later in the timber operations created an entirely new systems for us the mining takes a little longer but it's it's it's it's very planned out so we know where the minds are going and were able to sort of sequester and\nBlock those places often end to work around those operations and\nAnd this one in Marshall County is is no different than any other one is just the first time we've had to do it on that system so I think it's new to the folks in that area but if you were talking to the folks in Gilbert or\nOr manner Logan they they're familiar with the fact that sometimes we take these off line for you know a month or two months usually in the winter to\nTo recon figure and you know we we can't say enough about our relationship with the natural resource extraction industry the land holding companies the coal companies that timber companies the gas companies\nAre they work with us it every step of the way uh you know and and and they put a great importance on what we're doing and and our job is to get out of their way so that they can you know create jobs for West Virginians and the same time we're we're creating jobs and tourism\nThere were there was some concern however that even though that you don't actually closed off the drills that go to this acted mining sign some people were still running in there on those and and you indicated that there are some the control of people do on your trail is what you're saying\nOh absolutely and it and it and it's and it's a it's a problem that's that's hard to get your arms around because we we do have our maps and we have our writers that really adhere to our map some follow our maps but with with the advent of technology and and when you go on line there are these\nThese digital maps out there and folks are actually somehow getting their hands on these these digital maps of these GPS maps are GIs maps of areas\nAnd what they don't understand is the people that created those actually you know sometimes are sending you into to what it would be dangerous areas you know they're sending you into areas that are permitted and bonded an active minds sites and they're sending you into areas where there might be an active timber operation so\nYou know we would recommend that everyone that if you're here riding the ... trail system stay on the Hatfield McCoys trails use our maps are maps aren't are not going to put you in harm's way and\nAnd these these other maps that are out there these digital maps that individuals are making you know oftentimes they're they're on properties that that those ... shouldn't be on and and and it's really problematic for us you know we try to police and help the landowners with that but\nYou know it it really creates a hardship on everyone is especially the businesses that have made investments they want this property to stay open in the end the biggest threat we have to to losing this property as our inability to manage this activity in conjunction with the natural resource extraction\nYeah no I don't think a lot of people I mean you know someone hears this and goes well you know\nWho you to tell somebody they can't read where they want well in your trespassing that's against the law so I think that's the one thing that needs to be pointed out here is if you're not on the head of going through and you have and follow the rules you've gone off the reservation so to speak and then you are trespassing illegally on somebody else's land\nA absolutely and and it's and it's you know it's not just open land it's land that has a lot of activity on it you have coal mining and surface mining and underground mining you have natural gas extraction going on you ... you have timber operations going on and\nAnd all these things you know there's an expectation that they have a buffer so that that individuals private citizens are not on these active bonded sites where these sites were were an active timber operations going on\nThey're sixty national parks of the more than four hundred sites in the national park system and those are places where hunting is not allowed except for as as you mentioned there grant teeth on for a very specific\nPurpose and very specific time period and one species and I think there's interest in having the re designation the cost of the national park brand\nUm their parks or for people go and expect them to be places set apart they expect their not to be on the they expect a high quality experience\nThey expect to see native species by sitting in Yellowstone or maybe even a Florida panther in the Everglades and that brand has power or the calls at ...\nSo you all have a concern that if this happened because\nThe advocates ... here in West Virginia or are dead set that ... that if they don't allow hunting in this national park if that becomes origin then that's a deal breaker you all seems in ... I don't mean to put words in your mouth but it sounds to me like you all are fearful that this is the camel's nose under the dance\nWell it's um that's a concern that I'm\nFor sixty years or more for for many years for decades the national parks have been a place for hunting is not allowed now I'm In the other national park sites including the river gorge national river\nNational recreation areas like Delaware water gap in Pennsylvania New Jersey hunting is allowed and it's it's actually allowed and dozens of parks where it the purpose of the a place that's been established is much more I'm much more broad\nI think that's one of the things that the causes confusion here is that there are different designations for all these different places but they're all under the management\nOf the U.S department of been interiors national park service that's the actual name of the organization or the agency that runs the\nBut just because it has national park service and the the euro hit a logo out front\nLuggage never to gorge is not a national bart gives the national river or you know in Maryland is a national seashore all these different designations and I think just for the average person that the the ... about the Park Service they see the brown area and the girl that's national park will no not not to the letter of the law is not\nRight it is there at least Nineteen different designation and from time to time there is some attention about that uh the most recent national park service director\nWas interested in shrinking the number of designations for that very reason and the confusion is understandable\nAnd I think I mean the correct me if I'm wrong because this happened when I was in middle schooler were or will certainly was not in this position or when they designated\nThe national Park Service management of the new the new records national river they tried to get the national park designation and it was rejected because it didn't qualify\nAnd if I'm not mistaken they actually created the term national river is a designation just for the new river gorge to get it under the or the national Park Service management agreement\nBack in um the seven days when this debate was happening there was one just to take a step back\nThe river gorge is really blessed with so much support for the area and recognition of its outstanding values and some controversy old developments upstream in North Carolina\nReally in the sixties and early seventies gave energy to efforts to bring some level of protection\nTo the lower river in West Virginia\nAnd one of my colleagues uh one of my predecessors at\nThe national parks conservation association was involved in facilitating the discussion about what's the best way to protect this place for current enjoyment as well as future generations\nAnd the national river designation was then a fairly but it it had been used at the buffalo river national river in a\nSaw 'em there now I Believe five national river designations project for that very purpose to recognize the outstanding values of an area there was some interest in making it a wild scenic river designation\nOf the wild scenic river system was set up around the same time\nAnd um the the problem with that is with the wild scenic river designation only about a quarter mile river corridor can be preserved and interests and recognition that they're that gorge\nI'm as it is a as it is that that would be insufficient\nYeah there's there's several [laughter] to several dozen miles of river that are that are protected through the uh the system in West Virginia\nRight or if when I say a quarter mile a court I mean a quarter along the river right now the the new river gorge extend more than fifty miles\nPure yeah we're talking to joy ... with the national parks comfort conservation association they too are opposed to the idea that said they do they are opposed to the idea\nOf ah the national park designations for the new river gorge here in West Virginia joy can you hang on until I told you I was going to have you about ten minutes beds mother questions are you in the u._k. going on\nI'm I'm I'm great okay
