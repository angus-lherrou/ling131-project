{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "You've got that hundred thousand dollar initial deposit that you put in\nYou then would have a death benefit so in the event that you passed away and so I ... the example I'm giving used for sixty year old female in relatively good health so keep in mind that these numbers are going to vary depending on your age and your gender and all that good stuff\nIn that instance a hundred thousand dollar premium that initial deposit there is a death benefit associated with it of one hundred and Ninety six thousand dollars so that that initial one hundred thousand dollars you never have to put any more and in this example that we're sharing with you\nYou have a death benefit of one hundred and Ninety six thousand dollars so let's just assume that you go through your life you never ever needed\nAny kind of long term care services you pass away\nYou would have a hundred and Ninety six thousand dollars income tax free that would be passed down to your beneficiary now if it's a spouse that the kid whatever it might be this sort of addresses that well what if I don't use it\nObjection that excuse that reason for not liking long term care insurance the dresses that\nNow let's just say that you actually did need some long term care services the way that this policy works in the ... the one that we're talking about specifically is from a particular insurance company but there are a few different options out there so I don't want to get hung up on the product or the the actual company that offers at\nUsa financial we are advisors are independent advisors and so\nThey take shopping this in evaluating different options very seriously so let's not get hung up on a company or are the specific product but the idea here is that\nIf you needed long term care it leverage is that third bucket so that you had that first bucket of your initial premium that deposit you've got the second bucket which is the debt benefit in this case a hundred and Ninety six thousand dollars\nAnd then there's a third bucket and this example of four hundred and forty four thousand dollars which is a pool essentially of money\nThat's leveraged off of this this life insurance and long term care combo that you can reach into in the event that you need coverage for long term care\nNow there are of course going to be specific rules within the policy in terms of how you can access it how it works\nBut at its most rudimentary level it's creating a few different buckets that you have a premium in one policy or one bucket death benefit another and then a third bucket of a long term care pool of money\nAnd again if you didn't need that long term care pool no harm no foul you have that that benefit to fall back on\nI gave me an example of the ... the one time deposit do one time premium payment of there are options for you\nThat can be monthly payments ... payments and that sort of thing but I wanted to the reason why I'm sharing this with you is is a part of the long term care readiness check up in the emergency action plan we're going to evaluate\nAnd we encourage you to look at all the different options in terms of how you can pay\nFor this potential threat to your retirement\nIf you've taken nothing away from today show I Hope that you take just this one thing which is\nThis is a very real risk and if you're nearing retirement or if you're in retirement and you haven't at the very least addressed how you would pay for this need this long term care need in the event that it came about in your life or your

early as well thank you although you to your fisherman so this is not really early for you is not at all\nDid anything about it I mean I called yesterday and said I wanted to get you in here deal and then I left a message and he called me back and I said well we can do it on the phone I didn't realize you guys live and cross lines you go we go to the station I was like super it's always better when they're in the studio with me so thanks for coming in and this is great\nBilly wants to talk about your fishing man you are a junior or senior senior and I drove a high school senior this year\nThe or how long have you finished on the on the bass high school in the ... circuit\nA this'll be my third year third year there aren't they did you fish youth tournament when you were really little like elementary middle school or do you eat in okay but then you got into the high school ranks and go with more serious about it like oh yeah a lot more to say\nThe or the high school fishing has really come on in recent years and burn your the coach I guess if his team correct yes how many are on this team\nOr just to dealing in his teammate is Devon calling Law Order I went to high school okay so but you represent your own school when you go ...\nActually I'm here window to have a team of nature don't so me and him want to be partners so we had to join the club ... to actually have a team that we make it work so it's not that\nI got you well they're probably ought to get a team because they've got the state champion [laughter] it was pretty good no team in your the state champion don't even tell me about that don't how many years have you successfully completed the I mean if you want it more than one started just just last year was your first year winning it\nOr the first year I ever did it at one point champion but I didn't win the state championship and then last year we won points and state championships\nSo let's explain a little bit to people were talking about their points or accumulated through a series of tournament you have throughout the year at the end whoever's accumulated the most points vi you're finished in each of those tournaments\nWins wins basically that's what it is\nAnd then the tournament champion the tournament state tournament championship that's a one it's a one time and yeah so it's kind of like if you win the bass master classic versus winning angler the year yeah pretty much that's that's kind of what it mirrors that I've\nAlways maintained that the anger the years more difficult because that's a series you had to be successful like over a series of tournaments say championship you can get lucky with one big fish and suddenly you want it kind of like the bass masters classic but suddenly it gets all the publicity\n... so much bigger title but this year you you stepped up your game you went beyond that because there's the the high school fishing ranks and then I think they have college fishing as well\nBut it's something they have had within the bash federation ranks or the bass ranks for years he was the uh ... ... is the the state championship for adults I mean that that all guys and their clubs fish you wouldn't want that thing [laughter]\nSo you're the high school state champion and you're the you're the adult state champion and all the other fish where you're going to wind bother and showing up where you know tell me about first of all this talk about the high school championship tell me about that tournament that was back in may\n... that was on may twenty does that sudden and\nIt wasn't bad that this respond and at the time so it was obviously good fish and there's a lot of this got\nUm a lot of people cite fish we kind of went away from everybody everybody what everybody else was the one kind of their own thing we weren't site fish and we have fish in Maine like and I'm Still in everything we had to limit early and then we had a good shot at it but I only put them keep fish in the boat late I really feel that so it actually turned out to be really good day\nIs that a tournament where your fishing as a team or you individually on your own yeah we're a team in Allen\nI got you so you and your partner won the state champion gather this now you said that you finished the main like in may pretty much anywhere West Virginia you can catch fishy even the worst of us can catch me that's a great time to be ... I asked because they're they're up shallow but if you want you can get them to have you know what you're doing and apparently you guys did\nYeah we are we and catching deep it was a main like by it but um we had to catch them as far back and brushes you probably get some we'd want something different that we knew nobody else was really doing and it worked out\nYeah 'cause everybody like you said they're looking for fish up on the beds that are crews and then that can can sometimes can be a productive way to do it and sometimes it can be very frustrating 'cause you're looking at fish that will not by exactly so so you decided to go with the with the ones that were that even brush\nYeah we knew they bite so we went for him and it just it worked out in our favorite how did\nYou know they buy it obviously there had been some pre fishing\nOh yeah yeah there is some facing the weekend before we found them fish and we didn't go back to them because we knew were there until tournament day and they were definitely that\nWhen you pretty fish like that explain how you do that because you don't want to shore lip everything in there how do you uh how do you gauge whether the fish are going to be there or not\nGot to really cover the whole lake as much as you can in heck you don't know how much time you're going to get a few hours a day two days so you got to cover as much as you can and I'm Will shake fish if they buy them we won't even hook them what is um let them see that debate after a while and he was we got another bank and catch one or two fish\nOut of there as fast as we can we do soil up all the fish in there so that ...\nThat's got to be just ... you got to have a lot of discipline to not catch him on his body and it's hard it's very good vision [laughter]\nVery hard but the bigger the bigger prize is you know a couple of days you got a tournament here and you can come back and then when you want to catch them that Brian what's your role in all this you just drop the boat pretty nice weather\nAny time of the big motors running I have to drive that other net that Dylan and Devon they pretty much catch fish they net to fish themselves they handle the law will pretty much all I Do is a drive\nAre you allowed to offer advice or assistance to them in any way other than driving the boat\nYes during the day you're allowed eight time out and you can advise the button advise them what to do or they have questions they can ask questions\nI was a time out I mean do you literally a rod down I mean how do you determine it on our I mean yeah pretty much [laughter] and and they also have to\nTake a break or during the tournament for Fifteen minutes to eat and drink to make sure the hydrated and and uh they you know eating\nWell if you got good fishing who wants to do that on Italy has hired federal higher then only [laughter] that's the one time I won't eat as a fissure by what you need later on the way back to the ramps and I'm so those are ... sounds like there's some pretty rigid rules and there's high school format\nAnd yes you know that now you're in the boat with the two guys you brought it it I thought there was a situation and I don't know if ... ... ... where\nYou had to be with somebody you couldn't be with the two guys you brought you had to take somebody else and then they went with another boat or they switched everything up that is that's not the case then now so he's just whoever you your vision of boats you came in there\nYeah pretty much I got you I mean some kids will out to like ask for both ... and they'll say somebody random but as long as you have a boat coaching boat you're good\nYeah and ... is it a requirement that you have to have at least one voter calm or do you have guys that come that don't have anybody with a boat and they just found a place for him to fish now you got the idea here as it gets to fish up\nLike you have to have a adult with you mhm and I'll tell you for seeing guys out there that has the bass boat and has the time is a great thing that the kids are that they want to fish and it's very rewarding to be out there with a missile by it\nSounds like you might learn something and [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nKind of interested in that list of brain a little more here [laughter] so that was that was in may which is we just discussed you can really you can catch a lot of fishing may in West Virginia no matter where you're fishing even if it is it set in setting at times can not be\nThe easiest like oh my gosh you ain't kidding yeah ... ... talk about some of those are the worst days you had there I mean sometimes it's like pulling teeth up there\nOh my gosh we went there and I even had a bite frustrating it's hot sunny can in there and oh my gosh\nYeah but you have to um do you have to adjust your tactics how big of a mind game is that what you were talking about how you make decisions on the water\n[laughter] electronics are big thing nowadays I mean they can basically tell you anything you want to know which I Am I guess I guess the cheating with fishing but everybody uses them\nSo I'm sure you can go over the place now and you can tell if there's a team that there is that good so I'm right now obviously the fish are pulling back up of the banks because getting cold than the dead of summer everybody knows you got to go deep it's not a secret so you got to fight for waters and um fight the water for everybody else but it's really first come first served a lot of the times so the race\nElectronics are great and you're right they can tell you a whole lot of information that we didn't know years ago but the one thing they can't do is make that fish by\nYeah that's absolutely you can go over Fifteen bass and they'll never buy a single\nThere you can drop that lower you can watch that lure on your electronics round right by the out if you're not working at correctly\nOut fish that as well I'm not finished the state tournament but I have fish to qualify and you're right you get drawn the first day and you have to fish for some of the you\nProbably you probably know but no no a lot about them yeah and you ... if you're a non ... out of their boat and the way it works is it both guys get to vote for half the day didn't work out that way 'cause sometimes I was so bad I was just going yeah you go ahead I'll just ...\nYeah but the guy has offered it to me about it and take it out as I get to their boat I don't I mean I was catching fish anyway so I was happy salad like I was on ...\nLet me tell you any day that you can sit in the back and not have to run that trailer motor and you're catching fish that's a huge moment she had a look at your water if I don't have to run that stupid drove a motor that can be a pain yes they can so tell me about your down your your two days on the water last week\nThe first ... I Know he's pretty popular in the bass world in West Virginia He's\nI'm Amazed you even found fish should be worthwhile [laughter] uh yeah I have\nTo get a guy we laugh though they had a good time and we fish soup already\nOn the record allows good friend of mine too so [laughter]\nYeah it's a really good guy had a lot of fun um I did something I'm not used to I mean fifty before but not the way he did it and um we put up on one side and I swear we never moved we sat there the whole day and I don't like that I'm usually won the move around a lot and um\nSome you learn when you get old son [laughter]\nYeah we sat there I Swear we fish thirty for the water all day as I don't usually fish that deep but um I had a job to adapt is kind of with electronics we need to fish for their leaves on granted out and um\nWhat were you fishing ... what what technique where you fish in deep like the was it a drop shot or\nI'll started I started off with a Josh I didn't really have a whole lot of ... then I put on the ... and um I caught two or three fish really quick on it and um I knew from then I had a gut feeling came that that was the right they yeah and and I never put it down the rest of the\nDay what was while doing or where did you even pay attention and a half because that'll get you into trouble and he was a reason I ask is because you fit you see a way to go fishing you may not know how to do that but you're trying something that you're not used to and suddenly you're out of your game allow law had a little\nBit of a rough day and I felt bad for me lost them she theory about everything he had his boat but I started we get goofed off I started giving crap at the end of day just messing\nAround with orange dated you got a ... a little bit you should've started today that way that's the way I Would have done this\nA so the one thing I was thinking though have you ever fish they Carolina rig oh yeah they even fish those anymore ... still real popular but yeah that that oil you don't hear a lot about the old man over here and I asked is am I hate to thing but I'll throw\nAll don't don't have it on the Carolina rigs on there's a there's a lot of fish there have been caught on and it doesn't change over time\nIt's just fisherman change mhm so second day tell me about that because apparently at a pretty good first day she felt like you might be in contention during the second day were there any nerves there was one\nYeah I was in fourth place out of the first day and um we we fish deep so I kind of expected to go back and do the same thing and and I was with a guy named Steve Martin of the best man I've ever met really and um he was like All right we're going up to the rivers where the waters dirty old I was like great as the ... Clearwater all day all my fish are going to be completely different is gonna be a different day I was nervous\nI didn't know what the protests like I'm In fourth place it gets a bunch of adults I never thought I'd even be in this position\nAnd I'm On the grade of screwed like there's no and he took us up he took me I've been there and he was a good guy he told me everything he caught fish on the first day and I mean offered me anything and I'm honestly I watched him catch about two or three and um I knew from then I was not throwing the right stuff because I hadn't even had a fight and I was thrown out I was there not Jake again\nAnd I'm the water was law dirtier and I'm honestly he give props to him I didn't have ... and um he's getting fish on and he gave me one ... and um I caught every fish that day and that's been about\n... he's always curious miner bait [laughter] wherever your travels carries ... and even if you don't use a girl\nYeah there is a dirty water I Swear I'm first of all the fish in Clearwater and every fish the second we chase dirty water the Lakers clear and as they went on and we just followed the muddy water 'cause that's where we get that on the ... and he had to get back to be qualified for the state team too so we both had a heck of a day\nLike you said it it it's the same lake been two different to entirely different ways of fishing boat successful\nMay exactly I don't mind that almost identical weights really it was like point three off from day one today too so um\nWhat was the reaction though to the guys when when you came in with those two big bag like holy cow this guy's serious\nI don't know I kinda I didn't really know what's going on but Steve when I got in the boat he said yeah the big talk like everybody's talking about you throw in this big down here in deep water and I was like how the heck these people not started Jake's allow right around telling them out during the day but it's okay um but um\nI see allows you to go around telling them that you were doing something entirely different they were throwing that deep ... [laughter] yeah but\nUm I don't know that are just like give him a hard time [laughter] so so you are the state champion probably the youngest one they've ever had I Would guess that qualifies you for the state team where were you guys going fish next year for the a camping trip\nNext September we get all the way to Maine fairly small mouth fisheries I'm excited about that a lot of small amounts that are on the lawn job but\nHopefully it'll be worth it no longer I forget physicians okay I'm In I'm excited for any time you get more than ...\nThan you got the high school championship where's that going to be\nThat we already had it actually I that was August I'm On Kentucky like\nOh that's right okay real hot but you know and that's the thing was I Can't wrap my mind around is that the high school championship run usually goes by the school year right you know so so ... this is last year's championship that you won't have you had any you've had high school tournament this year so far that they've had one so far okay where was it as it burns though\nEmerged how'd you do in that one [laughter]\nI was a he told me you're not sitting in the points lead African [laughter] is that what you tell\nA little bit of a rough we lost a lot of fish that day you can ask them and it was probably one of the most frustrating days we've ever had on the water\nOh I ...
