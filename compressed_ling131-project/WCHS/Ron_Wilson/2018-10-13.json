those dollars when liquidity becomes a concern for an investor\nOr an advisor for that matter is when they have all their assets tied up and things that are liquid\nIf you use a variety of tools to use our tool box analogy and some of your tools provide you liquidity you don't need all your other tools to provide you liquidity because if they do you're probably giving something up to have that liquidity just like with banks CDs that we're talking about earlier in today's show\nIf you commit to a longer term bank CD you typically get a better rate of return interest rate on it because your money is not as liquid as often in return the bank will give you a higher rate so sometimes having money not be liquid can actually be a benefit and that that you you\nKnow the other thing too that goes hand in hand with that as some of these new products will carry a longer term and so when we say term maybe let's just say ten years there's a ten year contract that you're entering into\nWhereby if you wanted to pull all of your dollars out if you wanted to put a hundred thousand dollars in and the next day you wanted to get a hundred thousand dollars out they're going to be some surrender charges that would be incurred and so some advisors look at that and say oh we don't like that well as long as you understand the rules and the terms\nThat might not necessarily be the end of the world and specifically for looking at a ten year product for example\nAs long as you understand and the plans for the intended use of that product to be later down the road maybe that ten years down the road and it's part of the overall plan\nThen it might make sense and you can overcome some of those concerns and some of those issues the big issue Brent that we have is we look at some of the problems with the new diseases that\nSome financial professionals use them as the end all be all it's the Swiss army knife of products we can do everything under the sun if you invest everything you have with this one\nIs a couple of problems that first of all if you buy a Swiss army knife in real life in a lot of people have\nIf that's all you have access to you and you were dropped into the wilderness and it was the only tool given to we'd all take we'd be happy to have it in a pinch in a bind it's better than nothing but if we had the ability to go to the store and get the right stuff into our backpacks before we left on that trip\nWe would have gotten matches and we'd have gotten a saw we've gotten the hatch it we'd have bought individual tools because they're better when they're by themselves and if you try to go out of it all into a little Swiss army knife so you know Swiss army knife approaches is done for a couple of reasons one it's kind of laziness sale\nBecause it's easier for the advisors and say hey take this thing it solves all these problems easier for me it's less paperwork it's simpler for you to understand yeah get it it might be easier on the surface doesn't mean that that are in fact in most instances it isn't better in in the financial world if you glob on too many features benefits riders to financial products\nThere's costs for those and sometimes the costs can get pretty steep\nWhen your glove and on all these extra bells and whistles to that particular investment\nIf you own in a new and you're thinking about in a newly we would

the beginning saying oh this is the\nThis is the information superhighway and television are all this was going to be the amazing new educational tool that was going to [laughter] to the world in size as it did but a far more often [laughter] I think in retrospect racket interpreted as pointed it often produce direct\nUm how you really seemed you and your brother John really seem to be\nStill optimistic folks who put forward the idea that the Internet does have possible a positive possibilities and and you know you demonstrate that in what you do it is it still possible for the Internet to to live up to what\nIt promised at first and and how is in in how how does that stand in the face of all the really awful and and all that stuff and disinformation that's clearly out there\nUm I think\nThat we are bad at a matching the effects of technologies generally yeah but we are particularly bad imagine the effects of Information Act or communications technologies\nUm because people are unpredictable and like you can say like like you can look back and say like cars are going to be better than horses and they're going to require a lot of space and if that means we can go far there are people will move further out in the suburbs of recreated and like you could sort of predict some of that\nAnd people dead and people made a lot of money predicting that but I like it's much harder to protect like the effects\nBut something on the scale of the printing press and I don't think anybody knew\nAt the time even fifty years after the printing press became you know commonly a news had any idea the level of change that that would bring and I don't think that we are at a TV like a radio to TV moment I think that we're at a written word by ... by monks scribes\nIn in like little chambers yeah to a printing press kind of ... yeah that ship was huge\nAnd really bad short term like it created broke things where they were wars and like the first newspapers were were ... and and they were misinformation and journalism didn't exist and we didn't have any of the structures and so now we're in a new world where we have no structure for any of\nThis this massive tool that [noise] you know if it'd be clear mostly controlled by like three or four you content aggregator\nLicense or thing and that's scary vote like we have gone through a process is like ... and I think it's

it is going to get worse before it gets better makes me want to retreat into my my monastery and right on my part but\nUm it was was that your writing process I mean how I I guess my question is how digital or if your a process and how much do you kind of everything else off\nAs you write or is it more of an interactive I'm looking up things on line I'm I'm searching of quote soon or things like that things like that because I I Know that has changed a lot over the last Twenty years or so\nYeah I definitely have to to do both and so I have periods of time\nI'm writing but also like\nI'm I'm aware that the thing that I'm reading is going to require research so it's like it's got a setting that I'm not familiar with or it's like a profession I'm not familiar with\nUm and so like there are times when I'm writing and constantly back and forth between Google Maps or like a ... an airplane or whatever and\nThere are times when I the software I write and lets me black everything else out and I just see a call them of tax that looks like a you know the pages in a book and that's more like for writing dialogue for writing scenes between characters\nOr or for reading things that I already know about and I'm familiar with because it's like my expertise as being a person who\nHas dealt with and watched a lot of people go through the dramatic throes of being famous on the Internet\nWe're speaking with Hank Green he is the author of the debut novel an absolutely remarkable thing it is an interesting process and what you go through as a writer it's an interesting process we're likely to go through as a society and\nI I I'm Wondering what you think that will be goodness knows how long the take\nOn the other side because yeah because I I really do believe\nBecause I I Am a digital immigrant is as many folks my age are and ah and my daughter is is a digital native and I see ... many wonderful things like you guys that that are out there that she watches and I also see lots of nonsensical\nThings that really maybe we'll make sense to me in another uh ten years or maybe it to her will will not make sense in another ten years so you know only only time can tell\nBut what do you think on the other side of\nThe apple men come from behind and knock off the patriots forty one thirty five\nThat fourth quarter touched down the winner on the road number seven Campbell ... one of the number seven Ripley both with wins last night\nGamble middling did it at home I even bought two hundred eighty eight yards rushing\nAnd the nights shutout Woodrow Wilson twenty eight nothing\nGamble middling goes to foreign for with the wind number seven Ripley winning on the road six straight wins for the Vikings as Ripley takes out numbered twelve greenbrier east twenty eight twenty six replays RJ Evans a hundred and thirty five yards rushing\nAnd two touchdowns in that Ripley when ... was pasted a losing effort\nBy Coby pine or a hundred and forty nine yards on the ground he also they touched down reception and the game\nReplacing one six in a row for the first time in Seventeen years the Vikings over greenbrier east twenty eight twenty six number eight Parkersburg south getting by Morgantown at home the patriots over the Mohicans thirty five to seven Parkersburg south improves do five into braiding moody\nA hundred and nine yards and two touchdowns for the patriots Nikki yellow another big game and on the backfield yellow a hundred yards and two touchdowns\nHe also returned an interception for a score\nNumber Gen John Marshall is five and two the monarchs getting by Brooke forty two to four dean John Marshall winning on the road number Thirteen hurricane falls at home\nNumber eleven Parkersburg is healthy and danger in the ... beating the Redskins thirty eight to fourteen Parkersburg quarterback Jacob Johnson three rushing touchdowns he also through for two hundred and thirty two yards through the air and the score Tyler Moore I Tyler Moore I'm more\nFor Parkersburg a hundred and forty five yards rushing\nAnd a couple of touchdowns\nNumber Thirteen university at home most thing ba cannon I'm sure and the hawks get a week eight when forty six tonight teen you wait just goes the foreign born with the wind and trying to find their way into playoff contention and head coach John Kelly said every game right now is like a playoff game\nWell yeah we said we entered the playoffs this week I mean we can't afford another one another but I mean\nIt's amazing week from week to week we get loaded holders and back and now we were flying again I mean it was just a he was magnificent thing or for touch the first and then we pulling\nOr even one of their assistant said to me we're shaking hands and said it kicked amazing that he's on one foot and carp us up to them I Can't imagine why he's likely to so a big night for him and ... and our defense coach Snyder working fetch coordinated needs a lot of credit because he it's hard to get ready for this trip on one week and\nHe showed a completely down so very proud of them and wait for the game plan\nSo university wins that forty six to Nineteen and coach Kelley talking about Logan ... four touchdown passes and a hundred and fifty six yards through the air\n[noise] where you can go back and they'll never stays and change that is the same\nI mean that's that's a saying in the last week I I really believe that a big mountain ridge had Logan played and unfortunately it didn't and we got beat so that put us in a real\nPickle I mean uh you know next week pressed and pressed is really struggling hopefully we get that way and then ah you know a Morgantown team which right now I'm scratching my head over because I Know they have personnel enough to beat anybody in the state and yet they're they're struggling with it right now so\nHopefully they won't get their ship right it until about two minutes after mohawk falls over so\nAh you know we're probably going to have to have those two wings and and I would think the way things are shaping up but um 'cause some of the things we'll be dog will give us a lot of bonus points so just focus this week just like I told her kids just focus so this is a playoff game you have to have it and then uh you know we'll see what happens if we get this and try to get ready for it\nWell university with that win last night we talked a coach Kelley last night went to foreign for with the wind and Fred ask coach Kelly about the importance of the mohawk bull coming up in two weeks\nYou know that's that's great you said that for we were sitting around the office talking about that we said you know it is a great rivalry of course I mean it ranks right up there with south in big red and\nThen you know the capital and in all all the all the robbers state but you know it's it's just interesting that I Know since we used to but I guess the early nineties when both of us got pretty good and started making the playoffs regularly how many times that term and\nYou know who is going to have the home field advantage who was going to get bumped down who was going to get bumped up a you know eating that looks like this year about who it is so uh\nBut that you know that's what makes a sport wonderful I mean you're you're every game you get where they go by fast here we are eight weeks or in any each game is so important and uh you know it's amazing like ten and\nUp and down and be all over but it really comes down to attend the game and it was the big terminating game and that's what makes it exciting\nYou know this is a senior year for university high as a mere Richards then he'll be going to WVU next year and he's multi talented in the back you know they can catch touchdown passes like last night against book can and I'm sure you can also run the ball is well any at a rushing touchdown and coach Kelly talked about his versatile senior\nWell really bail us out tonight because uh you know in order to the doctor postal team doctor said to me you know right at the end of the half he said let's get loads and out of there so we you know I wasn't a people don't understand thirty one to several leaders not\nThat's precarious to me so I said let's let's get a mirror in there and get another score and he went and got us work so\nBut you know he's like you said is he is just a mate quarterback or it just takes off these people when they receive or they have to double covering the and then you know Evan Perot had another huge night the night three touchdowns two interceptions or whatever and he's another division one kid now\nAnd of course Logan the division one kid so you know we're we're we're blessed some a pretty good talent and or even a dummy like making when a game or two with it\nAnd he's won more than a game or two university high head coach John Kelly following the hawks win last night forty six Nineteen over a candidate\nAnd the scores involving AAA teams from last night Hampshire gets there first one of the season they be Berkeley springs fifty two to Eighteen Jefferson gets there first went all the season they be loud and valor Virginia thirty two Thirteen and
