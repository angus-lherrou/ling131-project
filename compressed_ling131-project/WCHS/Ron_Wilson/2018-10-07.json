trusting God and in doing so in this fits message we're going to be looking at the book of mark the book I'm Mark chapter five and then a bookmark chapter five we find Jesus coming back\nFrom the other side of the lake in where he is there is a large crowd gathered around him and it says in March after five starting at verse twenty to that then one of the synagogue rulers named Jerry is was there and seeing Jesus he\nFelt at his feet and he pleaded or initially with him my daughter is dying he says please come and put your hands on her so that she\nWill be healed and live to Jesus it says went with him now\nIt's interesting because after this passage right here where it says Jesus went with him the versus after that we find all of a sudden the story kind of becoming a little busy because there's a large crowd following him impressing around them\nAnd there's a whole nother story that happens in the middle of it were lady comes up in in the midst of a large crowd she touches says Jesus was cloak\nAnd this whole beautiful healing story takes place\nBut in the midst of all of this going on\nThe people from Jerry's his house come and make him aware that his daughter is dead and so they say inverse thirty five you don't need to bother the teacher anymore\nTo which burst thirty six says ignoring what they said Jesus told the synagogue ruler do not be afraid just believe there's that word believe\nWe're talking about trust we're talking about faith Jesus is saying don't be afraid just believe he\nDid not let anyone follow him except Peter James and John the brother of genes that says inverse thirty eight picking up there says when they came to the home of the synagogue ruler\nJesus solve the commotion with people crying and Wally loudly he went in and said to them why all this commotion and wailing this child is not dead but she\nIs asleep verse forty says but the crowd there they laughed\nHim they laughed\nAt him now before we get back to that scripture\nI can remember growing up how many times ah am a growing up would literally make up words you know how that happens with children from time to time and sometimes they're made up words come from combined words your parents have you ever heard the word I Know\nBut in Fort Emma that became literally one word I Know but I Know but to which I had to stop them and say do you really know\nBecause if you did maybe you wouldn't be say\nYou see on this day the synagogue ruler literally had to make a choice I Know that my daughter is dead\nSo am I going to not bother Jesus\nOr am I going to just believe\nThere's so many times where the world comes at us and says literally you know what this this opportunity has gone this opportunity is gone so let's not do this\nOh maybe we'd be people who say I know but my guy is bigger my God is greater I trust in my God 'cause it was a world comes at us may we take those words of Jesus the heart don't be afraid\nJust bully\nAnd so as we read the rest of this passage we see Jesus saying to this little girl I said you get out immediately the girl stood up and walked around at this they were completely astonished\nFolks I Know the gods got something
