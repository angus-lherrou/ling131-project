I have the west Virginia commissioner of agriculture across the table ... good morning good morning Chris glad to be either I just have to know the historic perspective of having the two of you\nAre in the same room together in the last Twenty years I've done the show that probably never would have happened so\nYou're probably right 'cause I mean when I wrote in your office there was that there was an animosity but Steven I we hit it off right off the bat and we've agreed to or if we agree on most issues that we disagree on what we read on the one issue\nWhen you move on to the next issue of the real work closely together on like on the issues and things of that nature we've looked worked very closely together\nThe reason I have you guys in this morning though is because it's something that has always been very special to me and that is the hunters helping hungry program which since its inception has been a fantastic opportunity for hunters you get extra time in the woods to get to harvest additional deer even if they don't need them they can direct them to people who do\nAnd the biggest ... and I think even the amount of food bank says this was the biggest red meat donation they get every year just from this program when general hunters donate their mate\nThe biggest problem we've always run into with this program is there just aren't enough processors around the state geographically in some areas to make it you know worthwhile\nIn a state or you can talk a little bit about this program I Know it's something the dean ours always found to be very special\nWe it it it's very special to the dean or you know it was started in Nineteen Ninety two and since its inception in West Virginia we've had over twenty five thousand deer donate almost a million pounds of venison and we provide at one point three million meals in Nineteen Ninety to to the needy in West Virginia\nOr one of the things that I noticed in a in a tending our our herself the hungry program is exactly what you said there are plenty of dear to be donated we just don't have the processors\nSo after two or three meetings I said hey wait a minute let me call my good friend can't land heart overt department a bag he he can help us here and he graciously has we actually have someone from his office sitting on our our board now\nAnd we're starting to see new processors come on line and that's the important thing we can use as many donated dear as we can get\nTo your ... your the commissioner of agriculture you know all the guys are cutting meat out there what are you done to try and up the number of people participating\nWell actually it's been a communications issue really on we actually go out and we were talking to the may processors we first meeting\nI'd uh areas of greatest need and then we went out and we look for the uh processing facilities and now uh you know Glenn Adrian\nWho is actually the director of the one shot that does the fundraising governors one shot incorporate is does the fundraising is actually going out and talking to these processor to show how it how it works obviously there's I think there's going to be fourteen processors probably in the program this year\nFor USDA inspected and the other nine or or the other\nUh ten will be inspected by the west Virginia Department of agriculture meat inspection program so uh we're out there making sure that uh\nThe processors understand the rules and the and everything else and working with them because they have to follow certain rules for the safety of the meat for that is going to be redistributed to the citizens\nOne of the things that has always been hard to overcome is in places like the eastern panhandle or in the northern panhandle you have processors that serve\nBerkeley county or or Hancock county but they're in another state there in Ohio there in Pennsylvania there in Virginia those guys don't want to participate in West Virginia is hundreds up in the hunger program because their own state has won how hard it hasn't been defined in state processors to be part of this a particularly in those areas\nI think it's getting a little bit easier as we work collaboratively to educate the processor on what this is doing and the program has to be a little bit flexible 'cause the processor has to ...\nThis they're mature and managing property and just being patient ah but but yeah yeah it it all came together the first day of\nOpening a season here in West Virginia two thousand Eighteen yeah your job is deer in Boone county great ideas how did yeah which is which is sometimes difficult you know to do to find maturity or in the ... counties that yeah yeah\nYou do me a little bit about how long you been watching this here for five years how many different encounters have you had with him over the over the course of the five year period\n... something funny Chris uh you know last year last season opening day I took my wife out it was the um it was the first time we had hunted the property and five years I took my wife out and opening day season last year that buck came in to Thirteen yard\nHe was a he was a four and a half year old at that time and I told my life as I said I mean if you take him out so you take him in Haiti and she said no let's wait on the old mature but that was in the area he was a eight and a half year old eight point on and on our thoughts for that if\nIf he if we left him both of them together on the property that that old buck would be more mature and would run that younger bug with the large rack run him off of the property but um she said no she wanted to wait on that big at the old eight points and\nThirty seconds after she said that the old eight point came in and she was able to take him at Harvard them and uh but but\nThe process was you know we uh we were able to uh to get this land five years ago and I said to myself I don't know if it's going to be possible where it's a rifle county but I Want to give up my best shot so I started to manage the property we didn't ... we did not set foot\nIn the woods did not pressure that's that is the key to this that to the success I think of the of the whole story as we did not pressure\nOr we did not pressure of the day or or uh any at all when you can go into the woods we we made our presence very minimal or\nWe put together a a a feet up food plan nutrition playing for the deer where our plant food plots in spring and a late summer um to help carry the deer and help them sustain them to to increase the carrying capacity of the land so the\nMore deer could have a good consistent nutrition um and then I started I have to cut its hands cut some areas um\n... where there was a lot of mature chamber there needed to be some more early succession of growth\nSo uh uh uh optimize the habitat and under growth and um and just over the whole process I started I watched this box as a as a three and a half year old Chris he was about a hundred and teenage eight point\nAnd you know I thought man that's a cool looking here because he had really good a base is really good math\nAnd man from three and a half to four and a half he went from you know about a hundred and ten in shape point somewhere in that ballpark\nTo about a hundred and fifty five two hundred and sixty inch eleven ...\nLast year and I was like oh my gosh this year has great potential and um where this track lands just a hundred and eighty acres it's not a massive\nPiece of land by any means ah you know he was travelling during the ... he would travel off of the property and I was concerned about him being taken you know on on another property a during ...\nAnd all that kind of gotten out somebody else my buddy told Mitchell has found one in one of the sheds a on a on a a a piece of public land and are adjacent towers and being a\nAnd then another fellow at found another one of the sheds and work to kinda got out and I was like\nYou know this is this is the I'm not seeing him you know a I'd seen ... been watching him and I was like you know this is probably the year I made to I Need to make it happen yeah\nNormally about opening your ... how did how did they come to believe that he he was right there in the right time\nOh I you know I had been ah I've been watching and what about spotting scopes I have\nHours in a a footage of him he you know\nThose those box until it's usually until the acre in soccer is they won't be pretty pattern the ball\nUm but usually when I couldn't fall man there they will change their patterns and go to go to the acorns are but he was on a consistent pattern and where I had played in some uh some really optimal a species of plants that they they really like\nUm he was just staying on that track\nNow say this he was starting to come in a little lighter or you know as the days get shorter and they become more wary uh uh you know the\nThe more the season goes in and and even when the foliage balls\nThey become more wearing but I I had I had just been watching his pattern and just staying consistent trail cameras play a big role I had several ... cameras out and I was watching and the area I thought he would be of course\nHe never came [laughter] I saw a really thought he would change switches pattern exempted this\nThis other region a that was a little more secluded\nA but he he never did I but but just watching him and staying consistent with that is how on them\nAnd the day you're Jonny my mum what time of day was it in due to like ... ...\nLet's say in what I thought it was going to be you know it it's never clock or you know [laughter] you can never cancer or captured\nThe eggs before the pet because man I'm telling you what I'm man that buck he came in the same way I always kind of thing\nAt the same time but you know the wind\nThe when I was watching it all evening and and you know Scott ... is a really good apt to to monitor the wind and the and to watch the wind direction but it was it was a lot it was not correct that die for some reason\nBecause it was blowing in in um it was bullying almost in the direction he I knew that he was coming from and I almost did it\nBecause I didn't want to risk it but I thought if I get high enough in the tree\nAnd ah if I get high enough industry at will hopefully take my wind over top of him that he knew something was not right man the video that we got out of it coming in and my wife she was a help me fail\nVideo we got to have him he had his nose in the whole time wending and they said it was a ... in ... and that didn't cash\nAt forty six yard and I had a whole Ida opening and I thought man I'm I'm a need to take the shot because he's wary but I thought no I'm not going to do I want to wait just a little bit I'm Out of out of ... and I was confident out Seventy yard but I\nI wanted to try to get him in for forty yard during and uh just just to be a hundred percent cost that to be you know what I made to make sure that I put a good ethical shot on it\nAnd he came to forty six yards locked up I'm like oh no you're jerk and well he went in and he's going back and forth and [noise]\nThere's some other here in the field as well there\nThere are a little wary but he they're not as where you see it so\nHe packed it back and kind of walks back and walk back into the chamber for a while I thought it's over this at this time this is five Fifteen I thought it's over and uh I was watching some other dear we were failed and then and then\nAbout five forty five I look back and he he's coming in and go out below me and about thirty five yards or through the trees I couldn't seem for the foliage will kill you that cause now like oh man\nAnd he stepped out in the corner that field where the edge of the timber met the field and started walking that field edge walk that feel that he got he finally the first holy popped out there and he was Eighteen yards from me\nAnd I just I was patient and waited until he was a quarter ing away\nAnd um he took a step and I I I granted with my mouth just stop and settled the pan squeezed off and um he uh after after my shot he he ran probably\nMaybe a hundred and fifty yards\nAnd a ... and expired\nThat's ... ... how big the estimate is rocky is now\nYou know ... now this is a rough rough green score that we just\nDid a out here in New York a with a with a flexible tape measure but there was a it was what we got was a hundred and Seventy eight and ... my mind I don't work [laughter] ... yeah and that's the gross that ... that was the gross yeah yeah\nAll right well congratulations to you may appreciate you sharing that story with us and we'll have a big turnout on the doors major WB metro news dot com thanks a lot David\n... thank you guys
