P. Morgan some of the the big international votes for financials are up\nBut the the general tone of the market was down ... you know as far as the NASDAQ does the NASDAQ was down a one point eight percent today that's a pretty a precipitous drop\nAnd you know in order to before the ... the open this morning about that that story is whether a China was putting chips into to some of our products that are sold here to to spy on the United states\nYou know a lot of the big manufacturers apple of the leading one they denied that this is a problem but sometimes when the market is you know basically you know a ... for perfection any little thing will shake it up I think that's what we might be going a that might be going on here what are you what's your take on it\nI think that that's very true to remember you had another thing going on here so if I'm a money manager and I've been doing pretty well this year we had a good stock market than doing pretty well in fact the last couple of years if people manage money\nAnd now you know we're heading into the very end of of the year I Want you know if you're a money manager think like them I Want my books to look good oh a little bit worried about this China news what is that going to mean and that plus the interest rates and the higher ...\nYou know that it would make me question as a money manager is the very best place for me to be right now in socks and particularly in growth stocks and how are these thoughts going to be impacted by higher interest rates and I said all those factors are the things that you're seeing going into the market today\nMaybe a last thing I Want to ask you about specifically is is the Russell two thousand I mean uh I really haven't been paying that much attention to the ... to ... when I used to look at a quite a bit more but really the the action in this rally has been in a big bump stocks\nThe the small market or the ... stock index the Russell two thousand has really been struggling here\nIt has been and again we'll let's get back to the you know just typical market cycles that doesn't mean that I'm not going to predict what's going to happen tomorrow we'll have to see the when that happens that is typical late cycle action when you see when the small caps in the mid cap growth stocks\nAre not doing as well and you get more in the Dow that we're in before we got hit today the doubt earlier in the week was hitting these new highs and we had the NASDAQ which as you said at very tech heavy it was kind of falling out and that's a real divergence in the market when the Dallas soaring\nAnd then that that can the U.S and the are not so again when we were starting to see the differences in those in the market I Would say it's time to be a little cautious we're not going to go crazy here but we did have leading socks hit and it's just something that that we have to pay a little bit of attention\nTo you know I noticed that arises in a book the trend today it was up when most of the the general market action was them are there any sectors you like your\nWell that's a good question you know what I'll do if this thing continues to play out\nWhat we'll do is we can switch over and look at Fox read that might be paying dividends or some defensive names you write variety has been kind of holding tight it's not living up you know dramatically up but you know if we're going to find stocks and maybe we'll get people that did it then that are a little bit safer in the markets and some sectors\nThat are safer I'm gonna I'm gonna delayed it just one week let me see how this next week played that if we see any sector rotations\nOr if we see anything coming into favor as other stocks are going out of favor\nOr you know uh we had one of our guests from San Francisco on the show yesterday and they were saying the weather out there and California's been pretty crazy is now starting to rain consistently in San Francisco when you see during the day to day\nWe had a big range from a big storm came through a last night we saw a lot of rain and then today you know the sun came out and everything's fine so yeah we have in getting more rain I Hope we do get some that we need it out here of course but there's always that danger when we have these burn areas up in the mountains\nAnd when he got burned and then you get a lot of water on top of that you know that their soil erosion so we have to be careful of that that will well hopefully get a little bit but not too much\nYou know what I got to know to remind you you know you're ... the forest festivals this weekend\nBut you know it's funny I Know all the wonderful festival you know a ...

I bet you know if things are going bad in a in a high profile sport\nThen yeah I I think you have to say that that's what they're they're looking at but I just continue to wonder just how high profile sport\nIs football Kansas now they like I said they've announced this fundraising drive if they're going to really push that and put the money into it you know I can see it happen to me that's a mistake because if you do that I think you're just knock it right back to square zero again\nYou know I'm just looking around the big twelve and I think it take for example ... Baylor in TCU I mean those are two schools that literally had decades of utility I mean and and Baylor a you know go on with our browse ... you know the results obviously had been mixed\nBut take a look at something like TCU either they get Dennis ranch Yoani and then Gary Paterson takes over sometimes it's just the the one one really really good higher can turn around your fortunes I just wonder if that must be what Kansas must be thinking they've just got to get the right head coach\nRobert how many times that they try it yeah [laughter] you know how many have coaches they've been through what's the other commonality Baylor and teach you both massive money into the football program that is true of a\nBuilding entirely new stadium TCU their suites their renovations I mean basically that thing is a new stadium from the inside out the infrastructure the underpinnings of there but everything else there got to remake and huge upgrades\nSo you know I think that's a factor I I agree with what you're saying on one level that you got to find the right guy for\nYour culture or your area your program but you've got to make that commitment to it and he got to give them a chance to build it\nHey I gotta I gotta ask you after we talked so much about it last week how'd you do on your trip to Lubbock how's the travel\nUh it was pretty good and readers can check out our chalk board a I had to fend off my multiple attempts for people to clean my laptop going through security oh never never had that happen before a\nCouple of funny interactions or with a guy on line and ah with TSA actually trying to make sure that I wasn't trying to steal somebody else's laptop going through the\nSecurity line so I you know that was a little entertaining but uh got that long toughest trip out all the way now ... are relatively\nThere you go hey Kevin thanks for coming on the show we'll do this again next week\nI always enjoy it and put some thought into those things are we definitely want to keep coup", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "04"}
