Y. part as always we start our program with the whip around our exclusive round table of reporters from our state covering the biggest stories that matter to you that live here in West Virginia Jeff Jenkins has been on vacation all week long and Alex Thomas bills and good to see them in either that I'm Glad we've had a lot of fun this\nWe have we absolutely have it's been very busy these last few days but I've enjoyed coming on I really appreciate having\nMe on you or you do a great job Alex and I wouldn't go that far but okay [laughter] alligators real will join this was a more news headlines from Morgantown a job or Cato a before he uh fires up the metro news mobile and goes out to search out a ... a timely\nAnd a classic West Virginia high school football will join us with a couple of a high school not well we'll talk highschool football in just a few minutes\nYesterday we had so much excitement we did with the state Supreme Court and Margaret workman yadda yadda yadda so what are you got for me to that can you top it\nWell maybe not right now but will have to see the really the big news today is what's going on with the jury and the Alan ... and ... but not paid over at our website Wu Metra news dot com\nSo deliberations are still ongoing they begin Wednesday afternoon in the trial and remember it's not necessarily because the jury is hung up\nIs because there's a lot of information you have plenty to federal charges against law free\nThere is a lot to handle here so regardless of if they if they ask questions and they do um this is going to take a while so they went on to launch this afternoon and come back and they actually had a question\nSo it was a two part or so I guess you'd call it two questions but we'll just call it a two part question okay the second one is that the questions you get in high school year like this is two questions why don't you write five paragraphs on this but you get the idea\nSo the two part question was in the event of a hung jury on an indictment or a single count what happens and the second part is does it affected that single verdict so judge John ... he met with the prosecution the fence and they talked about it for a bed\nAnd you're so they agreed on the first part if that will um\nIf they invented a hung jury they don't want to go to that yet on the jury should not have to receive an Alan charge which would force the resolution in such an event\nHas for that second part of the fact they singled verdict yet so again there's still a lot of movement ... moving parts here brand actually put a an update just a few seconds ago before we went\nOn the air he put it on his Twitter page and the laundry update is there is no other update so right now are still kind of in this holding period we're we're kind of like okay what are the tea leaves say\nWhat is this question Maine and we're just in this holding pattern we don't know if they're going to read something today we may have come back Monday we're just kind

most trusted source for\nIt surviving I mean that's the big thing who can survive at ... you know the than the first round it was you know getting past the road will this rounded getting past the elevator and trying to trying to survive and not lose points\nAre at Talladega you know the drivers it picked up a lot of those bonus points to start off the air the playoffs like Carl bushes and the cattle are makes all the way in our church juniors\nThey're a little bit better situation but they're still not out of the woods because I mean you can fish last in this race and lose forty something point so I mean it's a race that is truly isn't a known as the one that has the drivers all worried especially the drivers in the oil out of the playoffs\nYou're going to go for it you're going to go for a win and do everything you can get to that when so that was was drivers at the playoff drivers I gotta watch out for two because those guys will be addressed\nHey you know Jason we normally talk a lot about the trucks with you and you know we just haven't had any trucks to talk about lately because they've been on a four week break but they come back this week\nYeah they run ... that tell you what it is such a fun right from the trucks run Talladega or just because they punch it's a big hole in the air\nAnd uh they always run tight they always run Whelan every race on a restrict or played in a big track like you know the Daytona Talladega is always exciting when it comes trucks so\nYeah they get back at it again with their playoffs a just an elite was fast in practice earlier today the kid that you know picked up the winner earlier up at a Canadian Tire motor sports park you know he's a guy that\nIn the playoffs that's poised to to make a run toward the championship and it's just a kid I mean truly just get so ah\nAgain truck same thing with cup it's an unknown you know somebody from the back of the Packers a team that are owned by Jordan ... and that as a driver that\nIt's kind of an old school driver he drives his hall or to the racetrack he doesn't have a big tractor trailer that a a a single car hall or that loads everything in him in three of his buddies drive everywhere and it's run these races he was third clicking practice today so it's the greatest allies are when you go to ... because you can have a truck that or a car that doesn't\nHave the the high dollar engine or an engine that's not than brand spanking new and few draft right you could find your ... your way up to the front\nHey Jason man I Love having you on the show because I can talk about NASCAR I can talk about the trucks and they talk about high school football that's that's a pretty good deal so you're back home and you're you're going to be the cattle middle in Beckley Woodrow Wilson game tonight what do you think of the game\nI think it's good I mean one thing with Beckley and we've known this last couple of years and when they made it coaching change about three years ago it was the problem with ... we saw was the number of that dropped out and you know it for so many years back was in the contention of the playoffs or the running for a championship on football we always do they're going to be their basketball\nBut they're having a lot of players and you know in front of a friend person as a second will say this as well at the fact that a lot of those players that were great athletes weren't going to do both sports they were concentrating on basketball\nThat was the big emphasis when they brought him to go to south and in fact it was kind of number of backup down that which is good they've got the talent that full speed or they're calling and have it for a lot of teams that record of the show actually how good a good thing but they are\nSo they're a pretty solid team and it'll be a great opponents and I forgot what will there ever attain that you know changed the entire thing in the middle of the season changing higher office look back at where they are with most undefeated season was a couple of years ago when the playoffs and seeing that route and pound the football on the on the test\nAnd it's paying off for although last week on all the Roosevelt free they suffered the loss but still there's a number one team in a state of Kentucky they played them tough they had to drive in the first half of them are over seven minutes long so are you are an autograph type football now we've got an active so I mean this is the perfect time of the day that you're a sports fan\nHigh school football than in the state of West Virginia\nYou got teams that are battling for a playoff position now\nAnd there's what's exciting you got the full Christ Air cool air tonight that feels like football yep if you're if you're a sports fan in general I think about you got NASCAR playoffs the NFL's on college football's a full swing hockey's just started the MBA tip off next week before you don't want to talk of basketball and we'll have it all together at once in a perfect kind of the year\nThere really is and you've got and he'll see as the game number one in the Dodgers in in the brewers hey you're you're a good guy asked is also about Huntington at Capitol tonight a ... at least Huntington next week uh the nights are already played capital what do you think about Huntington in capital tonight\nI think it's going to be uh going to be a pretty good scoring game tonight uh I think that um both teams definitely have got talent both teams have speed Huntington's down one you know one of the leading Rogers but they still got great guys that were behind them network continued to carry the payload as well so I think you could probably see some\nPretty good scoring tonight between both a you know carry Martin is a a heck of a quarterback to understand why is going to West Virginia next year you may be a great asset to them and they've got huge wind both sides of that huge often you couldn't the lines I mean this if I wasn't calling the game tonight this'll be the game I'd like to go watch so I think there'd be a good one\nSo a time Wilcox and is not going to do tonight apparently for Huntington's\n... I think that's what I was reading about and hearing about that ah you know he was out still he was on crutches last week and they're kind of get them back to see\nAll right they ... are you done with your truck season or do you go back\nWell I've actually I'll be back um this is a great thing with with them all round they allow me to take some time back because my son's playing ball I don't want to miss that sure so I'm On my next race actually the last race weekend I'll be down in uh in homestead doing all three races\nAnd are doing stuff with only with the radio but also at the track as well so I'll be done on separate championship we can\nThat's sounds good well listen enjoy your weekend home and literally and have a good broadcast tonight and thanks for coming on the show not a problem at\nAll right Jason toy a blood is insight into into the racing and got ... high school football chattering there as well really enjoyed that by the way is a big week a West Virginia high school football game last night where clerks Berg liberty beat ceremonies do a whole host the games tonight we number eight of the west Virginia high school football season\nSo if you're going out to a game or you weren't planning on listening to games don't forget that on the metro news radio network you've got high school game night that comes along at nine thirty and that's where you going to find all your scores all the reaction all the analysis that starts at nine thirty tonight on the network All right we'll take a quick break\nTalking TV and more when we come back\n[noise] you didn't get to where you are today by running with her ... blazed your own trail so why approach planning or financial future any differently at ... bc wealth management are experienced financial advisors help you accomplished unique goals within approach tailored\nTo you Mrs ...

[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nAll right here we go twenty six minutes Sylvie our on friday afternoon and you know what time it is it's time for beer friday with pat straighter he's the hero we so desperately need that\nOh [noise] here to answer all of your\nQuestions about to beer related items and be on how you doing that\nI'm doing great Dave happy beer friday\nHappy beer friday to you as well and you know what one of the stories you send me today I thought was very well timed it was an article that's in food and wine dot com about best non pumpkin full beers and you know what\nDoug on it we need to kick back against the pumpkin spice thing it doesn't need to really get into our our beer world at this time of year does it\nNo it doesn't end you know what I mean it's like today today is just beautiful I mean like fall is finally here and it just it just kinda got me thinking about it and you know I Know that we have talked about pumpkin beers in the past and are they tend to be a little polarizing\nThe mental ... that's a real understatement there pat [laughter]\nThat's me the king of understate the\nBut I found this list and I thought I was just really an interesting look at you know some some beers that are are seasonal you know seasonal beers are kind of the backbone of crafted here um you know ... you tend to find a little more\nA half if you will in terms of not only the alcohol content but I'm the malls back bone that goes into these fears so they tend to be a little\nUm I'll I'll use the term kinda thicker and the sense of not more viscous but just there is a little more half to these beers and um you know the very first one on the list is actually\nUm one that you can find right here in West Virginia and it's a it's called the bat backwoods bastard by founders ruined company I'm In it is a it's a sip or if you will okay yeah clocks in at eleven point two percent which is a big beer\nBeer you know you should be sitting down when you when you start working that bad boys\n... yes absolutely but it's incredibly complex\nUm you know the age of the fear and bourbon barrels the mole a bill that goes into this is really interesting and that you know the quote unquote of develops molasses caramel and vanilla flavor so it's a really interesting with I mean I'm not going to run through all these\nBut I got a couple of questions for you pat you're on TALK about on this list and and let's just go to some of the bigger brand names 'cause that's where most of the folks are going to matriculate how about something like the black blogger by Sam adams I I Would imagine you could get that almost anywhere\nYou you probably can um you know same Adams is pretty ubiquitous when it comes to the craft beer yeah ... there's a whole other argument there but\nUm you know the style that this fear is is a is a very traditional it's a short spirits a traditional German style um interestingly enough there's a couple of breweries right here in West Virginia that are making this exact same style um and in our very own point where the bridge grew works has a great\nUm Blackwater that they make\nAnd I'm a couple of other folks do you're gonna find across the state or doing the same thing but this is a a very traditional and they think are very appropriate um called dear hunger\nWell I tell you what ... that's a good tip on that and what about the Sierra Nevada is a popular brand and ... their October fest is out this month\nYeah well I'm Glad you pointed that went out to you know what they were were like we're like on the same page here and we're we're gravitate to the same things but\nThe October fest in Sierra Nevada does it's really interesting the way that they do it and I tip my hat jump 'cause it's very creative um they have teamed up\nOver the last couple of years or with the different German brewery 'em to create a collaboration beer for their October fest in so each year\nThey got a a a different recipe it's slightly different that still true to style um and it is out right now and I encourage you to try it because I'm In terms of it being around you know what this season goes you will not see that that integration of of October fest again from them\nYou know I I and I don't want to change my opinion on this a hundred and eighty degrees because we started this conversation with\nBeers were the bowl that orange pumpkin spice you know the break but the you know we talked about this a couple of weeks ago about beers that are are flavored with coffee and chocolate and a lot of people like him and there's one from whether ground that you sent me struggle street told me about that\nSo you know I feel like we talk about whether ground quite a bit and for good reason and those guys are doing an amazing job down there and the struggles street um you know it's a it's a breakfast out which is\nA you know it's a style that kind of created its own little niche if you will um\nBut yeah it has so it's like chocolate ... and those types of things built into it but the thing that I really appreciate what they're doing with the ... the um the coffee which they're using for this beer\nIs from chocolate moose which is a on a carpet rode out in Beckley if you've never been there you need to go check it out because they have a lot of stuff going on and it's not just their coffee blends they actually roast the beans there that's not something that you see a very often um and uh you know pairing up\nRoasted beans right there Beckley great beer made out in a a weather ground and and it's a fantastic beer and if you see it you should try it\nYou realize you know pat when we first started doing this like but we would talk about craft beer festivals and I think we could probably run down the entire list for the fall in like thirty seconds there would only be five or six\nNow it seems like every time you come on the show we're talking about a craft beer festival there getting bigger they're getting more popular\nSecond annual hops on the money is coming up and that's just two weeks away October twenty seventh\nRight yeah it's you know it's a couple of weeks out but I think that if you are thinking about going you should get your tickets now it's about a mile and part uh I I have not had the opportunity and myself to be at this\nBut I Know lots of people that have and I heard some really great things about what they're dealing with that and um you know there's going to be some outstanding beers up there as well so you're going to be in the Morgantown area October twenty seven I Would strongly encourage you to go buy tickets now\nAnd how about this I mean let's let's keep us in the Morgantown area uh Berkeley springs ruined company is going to have a ... take over at the black river burritos and that's coming up tomorrow\nIt is it's coming up tomorrow and the reason that I pointed this out I mean I Know that we've talked about black bear and a number of other a really great so places up in Morgantown but\nUm you know Berkeley springs Brewing Company is relatively new and uh they're working really hard I mean they're doing cap takeovers in a number of different places\nOr it it is not something that you're going to see that often you'll see it in Morgantown I'm but to have as many taps that they're going to have up there and I and I'm Sorry Dave I don't have the exact number but I Know that they're going to have a wide variety of their fears and uh it's worth checking it out because\nIt's a you know again it's not something that you're going to see all the time\nAnd how about you know we had a lot of fun I I Want to say about six or six weeks ago talking about this concept of beer hotels well All right we [laughter] we we both love this concept and there's one that's going on in Charlestown\nThere there is and\nYou know it's it's not quite I'm ... ... s extravagant about that um you know is what we've seen with taps in the room and those types of things I saw this over abolitionist they'll work uh over in Charlestown doing some just fantastic stuff I mean we've talked about a couple of beers that they have brood\n'em over the past couple of months that\nI frankly is a little um I don't want to say shocking 'cause that but it's exciting now that it's exciting to see it as beer as being brutal here in West Virginia Charles and it's such a cool little place and they've actually got rooms\nThey just ping pong and back and forth like everything else guilty not guilty not guilty not guilty guilty guilty and uh and and I really wonder I'm going to have to maybe go back and take a look I I Wonder what went on in the jury where they were able to differentiate between the two but the more important\nObservation I Would make is that\nIt came to justice law freeze behavior in terms of a public officials are trying to influence what was going on with this investigation\nThere were there were multiple counts where he was found guilty or he was found guilty of a witness tampering church where the allegation was that he tried to\nCoerce a Supreme Court employee Kim Ellis into a saying his side of the story on the\nThe author spending that we're so much about knowing that the justice Laufer he was already in contact with and intended to continue to contact\nA investigators trying to lay blame on others so law free found guilty of witness tampering\nAnd then there were allegations that he had lied to federal investigators are who we are looking into this case in particular about this cast your worked at the antique that ... that he had taken home from the capital to his own home or the jury found him guilty there\nAnd when us attorney Mike Stewart\nAddress the media those were the allegations that he really emphasized because he said you know if we're coming and asking you for your health and something we're investigating we expect you're honest answer as to do otherwise is frankly danger\nAre

West Virginia and the other five teams ahead of them that are undefeated\nContinue to win for the next couple of weeks you think West Virginia is log jammed at six and won't be able to move up\nThe I've ah yeah given everybody wins yeah you'd think you'd probably say that it can mean western in his game if it can win tomorrow if it beats Baylor and heads into Texas assuming Texas wins out as well to that point\nThat that would be the time to get some move of western and he goes on the road again and beach Texas then maybe you start to see some movement but again we're getting into the area where the college football rankings are coming out those are more important than any polls\nBut I think it's simply this I mean I Know we sit around and we talk about rankings we're going to talk about the college football rankings\nBut at the end of the day West Virginia is in the position that wants to be in everybody else's lost in this league all you have to do all you have to do I know that's not easy\nIs continue to win games in West Virginia is in the driver's seat for this thing so the movement within the top five right now isn't critical just continue to win games when needs to get a win over Texas which would be massive and then that narrative really starts to pick up seeing\nYou know what I I Love having you on the show bread because I can talk to you about virtually anything so I get prepared for a hundred and eighty degree turn right here okay\nDid you see the story about using bolt scoring two goals ... yeah same bulldoze scored two goals last night in a professional soccer game now I Know a little bit about soccer but I don't pretend to know anything about the league that he's playing in\nBut you know I don't know if you're like me but when I see are you seeing bolt winning gold medals and he's got eight of them I always think\nCan you imagine what this guy would be like if he played football [laughter] I mean if if you've seen both can score goals in soccer multiple goals in his first game\nIt was probably a pretty good bet that he would have been a a mind bending Lee good deed threat\nKnow we just don't see that anymore that was what in the eighties when we're in although Nehemiah was the same type of thing great yeah guy in the niners take him and said just go down the field both a little bit differently right 'cause he's huge right I mean he talking about putting a receiver out there but I don't know if you can catch but I I watched I and I saw one of the highlights on Twitter so it was on the small\nBut obviously he's getting up and down the field and pretty good shape right to speed up and down the field is not a problem but I was impressed with how the velocity on his kick now I'm not sure what kind of lead the Australian league is I'm not up to soccer enough to to break that down for you but he looks really good there I mean if I'm at MLS team I look to sign him to and I\nI'm Sorry I think I'd have to watch a game that he's playing I'd have to check that out at least just a little bit hey well listen you know what kind of feeling and I got about a minute you're going to ask you a you know you're from Iowa ... you know what kind of emotions do you get on the west Virginia plays teams from Iowa\nZero zero ... I mean I've been I've been here now twenty plus years in in working in athletic departments it that gets the or the home town out of you so to speak so as soon as I left Iowa went to college out there as soon as I left\nI I could care less what the University of Iowa was doing and I grew up a Hawkeye than I could care less what they're doing I certainly don't care what Iowa states doing growing up
