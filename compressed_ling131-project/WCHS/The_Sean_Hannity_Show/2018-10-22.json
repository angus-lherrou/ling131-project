reds managerial higher David Bell we're going to talk more about that at five o'clock but you're a big rent out a living\nAnd I'll be listening you know I thought that day when David Bell is the manager of the law of older they're triple a team back in twenty twelve always kind of thought in the back of my mind that he would be their managers someday course they went Brian price because\nAfter a dusty Baker because I don't think bell was ready at that time was I mean he's forty six years old so that was five years you can be forty one\nBut since then I mean he's he's been he's been there since a coach for the cardinals the players had a player development for San Francisco he's uh Cincinnati guy some say it's a predictable higher by their rights\nBecause he's the Cincinnati guy right and that never played played in Cincinnati but his dad did a quarter I grew\nUp in Cincinnati ... dad and his grandfather ... bell who is a a a a you know was a great reds player buddy that was at the end of his career for the most part when he came to play for Pete Rose so uh I mean I I think he's a solid baseball guy and he's done everything\nBut I I was reading a column it was about you know it's it's really not much we focus on the manager but there's other things that need to be dealt with the whole story you know and so the manager and so he is calling us was saying

is that he said they just didn't have the the same energy that Iowa State had and you know when you're sitting there six in the country and undefeated\nI'm not sure how you have a lapse in energy especially when there's no sort of track a matter of fact and he had a by coming up so you know that that excuse\nDoesn't doesn't wash with me for whatever reason I now I Know that some teams that are underdogs certainly get amped up and play up above their head and that seems to be the case with our state but I'm just not sure why a West Virginia wasn't able to sort of counter that in some way but we also learned that coat and a Kibbutz did a lot of hunting over the weekend at some duck\nHunting [laughter] an F a scar on an anti brought some feathers back for Gary Jennings to step in his

know they're they're off the shirt I mean the guy is only averaging like\nForty or snaps a game of every single uh opening possession of every game this year Alabama has scored a touchdown he's

that's an interesting\nIt's um [noise] you know ... anytime a as a country indoctrinate a team is unbeatable they usually find a way to get beaten at some point or so for Alabama hasn't been threatened\nOr that eight o'clock game gets LSU and two weeks down in uh down into value is going to the I Can't imagine how that's going to be that that may put an end to that eight straight a first possession touchdown drive\nYeah maybe maybe I'll tell you what the ... and this has been discussed all season long with Alabama that virtually everybody else in the country is playing for second place in Alabama is so good that they're just kind of ah they're stuck in the air out of the college football season\nAgain we'll see I mean ... you know we thought we thought that about a lot of great teams will pass through and it didn't didn't necessarily a bear out you know what I mean you know they always\nYou know how to do one year after after looking unbeatable or you know I don't know it's um there are some vulnerable parts in a secondary filed and I'll just say that uh uh having watched him a few times this year now is that anybody good enough to to keep to it down and keep the

happening person how you doing today\nI'm great how are you listen let's talk a little bit about Halloween you know they expected the movie to open strong and it certainly did\nKinda unbelievable to I mean and I think that the big story other than the box office dollars birthday is the number of records that it broke in terms of like they get horror movie opening with a female lead biggest movie opening with a female lead over fifty five\nAnd that to me it's almost like the biggest headline second biggest ah October movie opening ever going to court for Halloween it's out if they get Halloween out of the entire franchise opening ever for that movie\nYou know Jamie Lee Curtis I really enjoyed seeing her back on the talk show circuit she did that virtually all the late night shows promoting this movie she's really entertaining\nShe's still entertaining she's were crashing he doesn't um I don't think he was like super politically correct like she just kind of speak to her mind but in a way that everyone enjoys knowing the than dead and I think that she's a great representation that\nYour career does not diet forty you know what I mean at that age old thing of like court women when they're foreign aid that the end of their career and she's the one also that day\nI'm going to age gracefully I'm not going to come to all of the plastic surgery and the boat that a lot of people feel pressure to do\nYeah that that's pretty interesting also you know she's admitted a that she doesn't even really like scary movies which which kind of funny considering her career\nI Know it's been an incredible career thanks to Halloween you know of course and other property as well but I'm similar to her I hate horror movies but I go see them because I feel like everyone's talking about them and then I feel left out and then I mean the male Lucy and I tell my husband why\nAre we still [laughter] I Know that drew All right so tell me about an exchange she had on Twitter with

more in here from the three or four seven for one day if I Want a billion dollars I Would pay off my debts\nGive to my church in a couple of ministries take care of my family members and moved to

dentures that would fit right\nAround the shots fired shots fire or from the three or four to six the parents are one of my brothers high school football team mates won a hundred thousand dollars on Powerball the match the first five but not the Powerball and uh it was pretty simple uh the question is what would you do you want a billion dollars\nFrom the three or four three eight nine anything I Want [laughter] yeah that's about a boy that's a pretty good response or what general from a red reporter joins us now to to get a little feedback on the the hiring today and the official introduction to David Bell how you doing where\nI Am good now you've got me wonder what I'd do if I Want to go down the aisle or ... million would be a well I think he tried to hire a baseball manager at my own and if I had that kind of gas\nAround when I was gonna say if you had a billion dollars you could probably buy your way into the reds in saying\nYeah yeah and if I did I I Would actually I think I Would hope that ended up with the manager tend to David Bell project will segue there um eyes seems like he was the kind of guy that that the reds had a pretty much targeted from the start of this entire process\nOr the the name of Joe Jr already get flooded out there he obviously got an interview and I think he was more of a a a person that the reds couldn't\nNot interview a given where they are there ah their life cycle to rebuild because you have a guide his profile who's out there to Salem all uh you can't just ignore him at this point or five years deepen rebuilding but ah I I think the idea that he was going to ever managed reds was probably a long shot\nOr that looks like they kind of knew that and the circle back to David Dell is the guy didn't organization for several years a few years ago and obviously has a multiple generational ties to the franchise itself and uh\nIt's a guy who seems like someone they've been comfortable all of waste throughout this entire process\nUh I'm pretty excited for multiple\nAlright a couple of points here the the word came down to ... already was taking his name out of consideration after we left the air on friday was this his job to turn down I mean once can Rosenthal got the information that we were down to the last three candidates\nBell was one in ... already was another was this journey job to turn down\nI I think you're already probably had his pick of any job available this particular last season and there are a number of them um\nI I think well he probably ultimately decided was hey uh I'm In it for a long time and they just for for a decade in New York I've won a World Series I've managed to our favors and Derek Jeter and a Mariano Rivera likes her a ride and everybody else\nI'm going to wait and take the perfect job for me he's a I think he's what he's fifty four years old ideally if you can get another job for ten years that's the one job he wants to have a totally retires for good and I think in ... he was bowled over by\nA what you need a teams out there this particular all season could offer he was going to wait a little bit and uh you know I like to think that the reds are going to be better now and going forward and they have in the last few seasons but\nI don't think that there was a way they could possibly pitch that hey you're\nGoing to walk right in here and we're going to make everything right and it's going to do is go gracefully a and he's got the ability to this point in his life to to make those decisions you know he he's a looks like he's willing to take another year off and I think he'll still be a top the list at any uh any franchise looking for a manager this time next year or two and I I think that's ultimately the decision that he made\nUm I think the reds made a pretty good pitch to him\nI think if he wanted the job odds are yeah he would have gotten it um but I think the reds kind of probably knew from the start that that was a bit of a long shot or it seems like dealt with uh the the contingency plan from day one uh and I think they're pretty happy with who they got ...\nWhat do you think the probability is that Mike Murphy need the former cardinals manager gets on bill staff\nI was actually really fun when I was covering some of the process and digging through old David Bill photos are so many of the recent ones come from his time does the did you go to the cardinals who is the third base coach the cubs so uh we're running cards and incomes pictures uh all of our our front page for the last week throughout this process but\nI Do think it's clear that he um you know he's got a lot of friends that he met and worked with throughout the ... is where I think four years uh uh with the cordless organization a missing the guy who you know obviously a as a red said I wouldn't be super enamored with him\nBeing into the Cincinnati Reds dug out um\nBut she'll have to look too far back brand prices were shaped el it was a long time Pittsburgh pirate and a a a photo of the reds was a bitch coach for several years as well um [noise] once you get past the playing days\nOr there's a lot more overlap uh uh that goes on when in coaching staff and you know I I I don't think it'd be the best PR decision for her ... from stuff\nFrom day one after getting the job of it I think you can find a lot less qualified or a candidates out there the ... so um I think it would be a little bit of a of a bitter taste of the mouth that odds are he'd probably be a pretty good asset to have\nIs this the ... that keeps the continuity of his team together is is this going to be somebody who's gonna understand all the dynamics all the working pieces of this franchise\n[noise] ... that's a good question I I think it's certainly somebody that they didn't\nUm how to describe this ah when you when you go back to Jim rhythm and obviously the interim tag a by definition made it seemed like he was a stopgap hire a but I think the decision to move away from it and move on to a guy who what age forty six I think might be the youngest manager since I don't even know she was Dave Miley back at the turn of the century\nOr they're committing to a guy that they almost hired back in twenty Thirteen um he was the guy who came up through the system managed double a or for three years and the rest is to manage the triple a little franchise for a year before leaving a and you hear from some of the guys that were on the reds throughout the last generation of rich players who talk about in when they were a\nPlane for him that double and triple a ... specifically spoke with the choir ... about it are the guys loved it\nThey absolutely loved him and and I think this was a job that he had kind of picked Clinton wanted to come back and get back to just because of the connection he's got data from Cincinnati and whatnot and uh this is kind of a big move to make a to not commit to somebody for quite a long time\nAnd now he's got three years of the fourth year option on his contract I'd be shocked if a if there were committed to getting that for a matter of time to grow with this organization and uh yeah if you talk about baseball in terms of four or five years a that's a pretty significant committed to a guy and I think that he is the one that they want to have to help take this team through the growing pains into the next level\nDavid ... is the new manager of the Cincinnati Reds or getting reaction from which are all our ribs insider where one in this down but when I got two quick things for you I was watching the presser today\nBob ... was was involved in the ... and he seemed to the ISI forthcoming with the information that he was going to spend money to make this a better team do you believe him\nYeah I that's the the ... and all of this is whether it was Delaware Gerard erode Austin is that this was the first of many moves that still need to get made this particular off season and uh you know ... pitching left and right and\nYou know it doesn't take too much a statistical digging to say yeah that's exactly what they need to find and obviously that's the most uh a rare in expensive aspect of baseball these days and so I find that they're going to have to spend the money and I think that's something he's a he's totally committed to at this point\nThe question becomes how watch you know is another ten twelve Fifteen billion does that relate to make the difference our they probably not a whole nother level yeah so that's a it's a committee that he's made publicly several times he's really going after the dollars at the back it up\nSo ... and finally with the reds trying to reshape their team I mean we're talking about seamless last Ninety plus games for years in a row or are we talking about free agent acquisitions are we talking about trades the shake up the team\nI think he's probably speaking more to free agent acquisitions you know this is a team that despite how much losing they've done there are a whole lot of obvious uh players leading obviously my heart is a\nLiving as a free agent but he might not be leading those rivers that you get a cat in the when you were very very close uh aside from that you only get scooter Jeanette during his final year to contract so you gotta lotta pieces that they put in place\nA with eyes on the being around for many years and kind of rowing together so I don't see a major trade shake that up a but I Do see them seeking out players that are either on existing large contracts that other teams that are now starting to re daughter looking to uh to get rid of or to actually finally find these flashing cash in the free market", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "22"}
