right down the middle ... little encouraging son but the way that Dr into day wasn't very impressive\nNo not at all I mean remember last week and the second half we were all wondering about the one time that Wilbur got knocked on his back I mean he's been knocked around a little bit today for ... it's been a lot\nWell the thing that bothers me the most are just rushing for guys are not bullets in their game and a little bit and um we're just not getting that done we go five Lyman the block for we should win that\nBattle is yeah well that's what I Walk out of here with guys I Know you wanted to drill them more you wanted to put on all kinds of show but I'm I'm concerned about the office of life for this not near team that's that's now second half last week and this entire game where they've been absolutely dominated up front\nYou seen the mess down in South Carolina the way the rain is coming town oh my goodness they're just getting ready to go to the fourth quarter but South Carolina's on top of Mississippi but that rain is really really coming down we had weather delays is closest pet that I heard ... or\nTrying to get through these that looks like great weather here in Morgantown with only four minutes\nRemaining in the ballgame allowed to do is going to go and improve on the season let's stay on beaten so at number nine that doesn't hurt\nA again the performance just say what you want to about it but it's college football and you get when you take it and you move on to next week and it's a late night game\nThose who said last week you have these games from time to time we've had two in a row now\nWell that's the time and it was that you have these games time and time again\nYou know you don't really care for them but it happened long as you keep winning who cares\nAbout women as as a season goes on you see things that come up with his concerns you which make them and then by the end it's possible easing goes on\nWhat what what was the score of last week's game no one remembers don't germs or when they tried that one but it wasn't good enough to\nRemember seeing one of the ... guy wasn't good at maybe ... like when she said that they are pressing wasn't good enough for the gum and the top ten right that's right I mean in a lot more spot and jump in one of the ... yes doesn't\nMean anything to end of the season any way shape or whatever\nIt is exactly right but Rashid are you going down final three minutes of this football game ... going to win the state and beaten all and all is going to be good in the locker room today\n[noise] well they wrapped up the game or they're about to wrap up the morning you talked about finishing on a low dose guys a high note for\nUh yeah but I Know what they got a lot of backups in the game all kinds of backup yeah don't they make\nIt was in the game so him earlier but now they went for two and they get that how 'bout that thirty eight twenty two is the final and the yes West Virginia wins a new one and they could use to have to\nBe happy can they ... that was that there was a fishing shake thereby Hoeber sin well out of ... but it\nWas he didn't say much to meet you I mean you can tell he's not real happy\nOr you shouldn't be I mean really let's be honest he shouldn't be real happy and uh it's a ... you get a win any wind by sixteen but you certainly in on a sour note with them scoring with less than five seconds to go on to the ballgame guns\nYeah that's true why everyone's on a down notes and that is kind of true I mean the ... West Virginia was able to get that last touchdown you thought that might look pretty good in the paper a thirty eight fourteen looks a lot better than thirty twenty two but it was a when you got to remember\nThis two guys were in this this is the entertainment business and you need to entertain your clients\nKeep them happy which is right now is probably not probably not a ... I wouldn't think that would be that happy with the the way it ended it I have to\nBe an interesting interesting in the game speech from Dana homes\nYeah I mean obviously he's not going to be happy just offensively\nYou weren't a fish and she had too many turnovers too many red zone turnovers you got a right to defend did a really good job today is that that last touchdowns unfortunate for the ... look good but it's just the auditing but overall I thought they did a great job day we talked all week about Google Williams and Tony gift as defense again when it had to stop one guy it did that\nI think of all the things coming out of this and this was surely sloppy\nNot what anybody on that mountain air staff one to see I still walk away with my biggest concern moving forward if you're projecting ad that all thanks a lot has to get better fast that's a real concern for me\nYou know as far as ... we're talking about this and the pre game in or out whether you'd have over a hundred and twenty five yards total offense today just under a roundabout were run one twenty we had that big kickoff return early in the game but\nYou know or if I'm Kansas when I'm looking at these that something could poke us going to have more touches and he's going to have more than twelve carries in a game like this\nYou know because the gag\nIf I was a fence Cornell would get him out on the slot and get him out in space 'cause that's when he was really really good yeah so in those bubbles screened and all that sort of thing I I don't know why they don't try to maybe doesn't have good hands\nBoycott six passes last week get three catches today but I agree with you if you get 'em in space that's where his really dangerous scary I mean he's not a kind of guy who's going to carry

you're just trying to make plays and you're going against the team that you know you should make plays against you have a ton of confidence because again\nOutside of that Oklahoma State last game last

mean when he was the ... the coach of Texas\nYeah boy Texas has really given Oklahoma problems over the last four and five years and that incredible Tom Herman that continues guys now twenty three and one against the spread is an authentic coordinator or head coach that's good news for West Virginia 'cause I'm guessing Texas will be favored\nAgainst WVU in that game so you don't have to pay the Herman step for Texas should've been Oklahoma should've beat Oklahoma last year\n... yeah but they didn't so Greek or they just they just place so that will against uh yep they do they have the right well this\nIs what they've been through the years they slip through the capabilities they went ...\nOr so where's this put them what kind of tractors put them on God I mean\nThey've always had players I mean look at the recruiting every year we got more stars and you can imagine in the universe\nSo this is yeah this is huge for them 'cause I'm not sure it's good for the league though because they've still got that bad last Marilyn so I'll be interested to hear the national narrative here around this league is is this good for West Virginia has it increased their chances to win the big twelve does it help them in the college football players a lot of things on packed with this one\nYeah there is I mean think about this uh this last ... drops Oklahoma behind West Virginia most likely does it drop Oklahoma completely out of the top ten will have to see but I mean Texas moves up I'm so suddenly you've got\nThree teams out of the big twelve most likely in the top Fifteen 'cause I think Texas probably moves up three or four spots\nYeah I think you're right there I I tell you what was do we got a couple of things going here will get a school board update real quick and then

of Charles\nFour point five and five eighty WC age as scoreboard update news just minutes away this is the wrath of show back to\nThe ... guys was bringing down the drain holders and had to say we'll start with Jeff they even got others just honest I mean other than his choice of pain relief so I\n[laughter] think about those ... throw eggs I wrote that was\nPretty yeah that was a pretty uh 'em up front and honest assessment of his team are then I think she obviously senses some of those same things that we do that these last two games have been wins but not impressive wins and not their best performance\nYeah and you know for the he explained to the I think just as our guys just as the did just as she did\nThe interception in the red zone and uh you said the combination of things it doesn't run again not being very good\nIt's also that things get squeezed down there and the red zone and the receivers not doing a great job and we're trying to force thing you know and uh and uh in the rankings not very good probably because obviously police officers lines not being as consistent that needs to be\nJeff I thought that was a good explanation also what's going on personnel was will be off into blonde um there's been a lot of questions about that and they did not place virtually all today\nSo I think you know as we sit here after the last two weeks of one of the one of the most difficult challenges you have is trying to look at what went wrong and decide All right was that a one off situation that was just a bad day that will just make some bad decisions but you're not going to see that the rest of the season\nYou start to say All right one off or trend developing so when I look at will careers interceptions that to me based on his past history is something that's more of a one off you're not going to see that every game moving forward when I look at the office of line though that the concern and Dana mentioned that there Dave you just said it when Joe Brown comes back\nMaybe that changes the whole look but you're probably going to get somebody ... throughout the year that\nPart to me is the one that doesn't feel like a one off we've seen that now two games in a row against two defenses that are that are below average at best and you've had some problems on the defensive line that to me moving forward if you're looking at this western the team as a big twelve champion type team that's where I have a concern for this group yeah the interception\nIs something that can be corrected he doesn't have a history of throwing ... interceptions especially multiple interceptions a in a game so I think that's something that will be addressed and and corrected from well from a just an individual player standpoint\nThat often one they have to work together as a unit I'm there can be a ton of things going on in terms of a communication up front a protection breakdown things like that uh which can be corrected as well but it's going to take five guys up front to get it done\nAnd the ones that I mean you take a look at the stats from the game today you know West Virginia won the game they almost hung forty in a conference game at home they put up over five hundred ... yards and the game but those five sex or that they stick out\nYou know there's a few things is to get will continue to talk about that would come back we'll get updated on the traffic

Calhoun County today forty six to six the park is we're Catholic improves to seven and ... on the season ah okay where where we we we went through a lot of things that we're up against a break coming up a little while but\nUh we had a few of the things we wanted to talk about\nSo here's a text message that came in at three zero for eight to five five three zero for if you'd like to weigh in as well and the texture says is the Kansas secondary better than we thought or are we concerned with the three or four plays Greer couldn't find a man when he had loads of time I'll go first or sheep and what's your answer on this\nI think Kansas secondary played extremely well today now part of that was due\nTo the pressure that they were getting up front with just four guys so they were able to drop a bunch of guys into coverage but given what I had seen them do against him other teams that were massive blown coverages and some of these other games\nI thought that Kansas defensive backs played pretty well today and and the textures right were had some unbelievable time on a few of those and still couldn't find a receiver so\nI'm tending to give credit here to the Kansas defensive backs will be a little better than they looked in the previous games\nYeah I think they play with a lot of confidence um they may employees and if you slow down these West Virginia receivers and you have four of 'em the guard actually five if you add in seven Bush\nOr behind them and so uh you make some plays against them\nYou're going to be riding pretty high and if they can get in there and make some past breakups a intercept a couple of ball they're going to play a a pretty high so right now I I I wouldn't say they're better than any other a set of defense backed out west Virginia has gone up against just played with a great deal of confidence\nThey did some scheme things that we haven't seen Steve done that talked about sending the safety over there and just showing to guide right on top of still they took away the plant down in the red zone which we were screaming early in the season why don't teams do that in force West Virginia to do something else that they did some things scheme wise that we hadn't seen this year\nI agree and and one of the big things with the cover three hold and what that is you play covered three on the back and then you take two more defensive backs and place them directly in front of the receiver so uh you almost have a cover to luck with two wrote up corners on the on the front\nBut then behind it you have another quarter behind him with a free safety in the middle ... impossible to get anything deep down the field and\nUh if you look at it Kansas just had a good plan coming in Mason play then again that confidence can do a lot for player\nAnd again you talked about the confidence but then also hurts will Greer in a couple of places to eat honestly thinks he can make that faster\nAnd that's something you learn from you you go in there you watched that fail us not to the coaches to communicate to him that face this situation where we might be better off if you just go ahead and throw it away and he'll he'll learn it\nHiller ... ... what we're

Boehner decor dinner heads\nHas schemes that dinner West Virginia they only had five sex on the season coming into this I'm In the first five games and then they get five more today obviously that\nIn West Virginia that they could attack and they did it really well and caused West Virginia problems you know West Virginia to wins relatively easily but they're not things that are the ... but had better figure out or or just undefeated record won't be much longer\nYeah ... fun Greg brings up to five ... they also had ten tackles for long\nYeah and that should that I agree with you Greg in ... there are some things that we know which one can do there's a lot of things that they can do a lot better\nAnd I just you just second half last week was you know pretty lackluster and had to work on things and then you get into today and you see some of the same thing so I think that you know he's ended their father no Dan hosted says let's take are ugly when and go home house that\nAnd uh but there are some things to work on ... the hard part of the schedule still to go here\nIn ... new in next week's can be hard but yes that isn't going to be the hardest right because those yet to come we were all thinking it was gonna be Oklahoma there'd be a trip to Austin\nIt could very well be a trip to Austin and like you say the trip teams Iowa\nNext week might not be a lot of fun All right\nUh my request a lot to do that when I was a ... [laughter] but we get now I'm only going back away Jackson fine how are we going ... I was thinking Frank Sinatra huh okay here's someone that did Texas and within that he couldn't hear the comments made good Dana ... after the game would we played that McGahn\nHere's head coach Dana holders and after today's went\n[noise]\nThat Jon talked about [noise] five an hour and we'll take it [noise]\n\nTo me often [noise] here [noise]\nYeah or just like last week I don't think we're a bat second half of whom are because we weren't good at one particular thing last week you know so uh\nWe've been pretty good in the red zone I don't do that don't really think that if the problem I'm probably made some bad decisions primates and by just doesn't play called ... and probably make some bad decisions on quarterbacks by receivers unveil not either so I'm a lot a lot of lot of things that we need to work on I'd probably be the next one that we focus on\nOf course the and the explanation\nI was not an impression that's no legal now um I've never tried any high school stuff like that before but\nUh my good friend Mike Leach didn't game one this year around that same thing in game one like ten times in a row and the very next week is instructed never do that again because of you know it'll now so you pick it up and to pause for a second we started you know where it was not that should have been called earlier because now\nWe have a pond on very caught us by surprise element of surprise kinda got us\n[noise]\n\nThey don't play like a freshman [noise] you don't act like a freshman he doesn't\nLook like a freshman so quick on the freshman gunfire why we've got um [noise] [noise]\nYeah ... a lot more of their the tenth rated Russian\nDefense and the big twelve or you know what the people around them all and they they'd they'd do a good job Clinton does a good job of mixing as friends where not enough people to stop to right\nSo you know that that's one reason why they get an are sections isn't because you're throwing the ball into a lot of coverage so you run the ball we don't get better at running the ball's gonna have a hard time winning ball games for [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah I feel position was really good\nI mean even with turnover is when something again what do we have twelve turnovers but if they were all in their red zone it's not like we're turning the ball over and giving them short field\nUh so you know we we did a really good job as a team was built in Michigan and we created a seat turnovers as well um and then they they they they they're good you know they try and get Davis gave up a couple of laws that were very happy west and the second half but other than that guys on defense keep doing a good job\nMentioned in as it came down you know that's what we do and that's what we do best and so we played and after that you know she suspect anything I don't know I don't think she actually [laughter] I Hope not [laughter]\nWhy did you decide to do it here is the the importance of the game to use these guys here\nWith a well I'm honestly she deserves the world you know and uh also I feel like it could make a statement ah one one big thing that I actually including the ring boss she has on all of us are not you'll see them fiction is a piece of about twenty five husbands love your wise as Christ's love interest in getting stuff up for it that's a big to me\nAnd I have revealed as the media but uh you know that that huge to me I mean Bible studies are our state troopers and deal with that they help us and to me I feel like this can be a good way for me to mentor to others\nAnd so by it's not for me it's not for me it's just it's for her and it's for others see because I Want to miss whatever's how long have you know ah almost three\nYears that we've been dating for almost ... what was that moment you know you're kind of suffering that I'll be honest with you I started off of what across the field to stay in touch with rows and as soon as we started I started walking and um I didn't see anybody behind me was I\nI don't know as I got over that I got her I'm Out of the stands and I came down still don't really see a whole lot of people on walk that are her once I got to the middle of the field and a trip a little Henry the ring I turned around our sorrows like\n[laughter]\nI just got stuck you know I had I had issues are taken to figure out what to say here and really I didn't ride them to people around me until after I did it and I turned around there is not true because I was so focused on her as what was her reaction to what we're all over her eyes like\nShe was crying she was so happy um I mean she knew that it was going to be an upcoming event probably within the next year so that she didn't win though and all this is the first opportunity to do it wow\nThat's the greatest thing we don't have the greatest thing we don't want to point after forever I've\nDone this for Thirty years yeah and um I never had never had a midfield proposal for but you know what interestingly a last week we had the first midfield wedding at Texas Tech to to Texas Tech alum got married at midfield adapt I'm Sorry to say\n... good luck or badly yeah [laughter] where was the ring\nOr one of the state troopers that you know is with West Virginia it kept the ring until after the game and then gave it to a gave it to receive the greatest thing at the any one of the guys did or what was your reaction is oh she said no [laughter]\nI live very ties or any other way slogan ... gave this story explained it very well\nThere how 'bout that Jeff Jenkins orange great man that's a great story yeah earlier in state the kid yeah yeah yeah a great story and uh you know in ... he he talked about how he ... concentrate on the game and everything and then uh and then even with all those people were I got a little nervous alone sometimes\n[laughter] [noise] yeah what am I supposed to say yeah hit that kept the quiet from his now fiance but she was the only one in ...
