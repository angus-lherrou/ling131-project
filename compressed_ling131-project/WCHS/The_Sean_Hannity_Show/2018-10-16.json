formed they were not stars on their own they were not stars in other bands\nAre big bands anyway so I don't think\nI'm going to have a flag on that that that same thing with with black Sabbath that's a pretty interesting question about a rainbow\nThat's you know I'm I'm I might I might allow that area where the bass line up of great band yeah ac literally went wrong I mean I I mean that's great music there's no doubt but it's not exactly when we consider a super group\nAs it's commonly known and and the and the financial or a you know that means that there's a combination of of certain

different lead guitarist you yet the Jeff Beck era yeah the Jimmy page era uh you have the Clapton era ...\nBut I still wouldn't consider the yard birds a super group from us they were like they were a launching point for a superstar no cream as a super yeah that is to create them as a super group and that that definitely belongs on this list this is interesting Herman on Twitter says uh Crosby

I got to believe that there was a very very small group of teams that have ever started the season own five and made the playoffs\nRight and mathematically they are still alive also but Canada ups are sitting in a two and five in Beckley also said he had two and five there is a way for them to get in and would involve some of the teams that are currently fourteen Fifteen sixteen to maybe losing games that they shouldn't but\nIt certainly is possible and it it gives hope you know with a team like south Charles and that's one back to back games over the last two weeks did so in double overtime against riverside last week that the that they're still something to play for three weeks ago\nArt in double a fair amount senior has been the class of that division all year here's the sixteen teams in double a that would make the playoffs if they started today pheromones senior poker Nicholas ...

Williamstown set of those and they drop their sees no parental wheeling central so since that game they passed every test and really magnolia was the only team that was able to be in state team that was able to be competitive with them they beat them twenty to eight\nA party or Catholic great story or they go from wind list a year ago and now all of a sudden they're a you know all but a short of a playoff spot I don't think there's a scenario that exist in which they could get knocked out within eight and to record or even if there were to not when one of the last two games but\nUh you know they're playing right now with the chance and if they were to be Williamstown there's certainly a locked into the top eight could even be potentially up\nInto the top four and with a chance to host to play off game so that's a great match ups that are probably will end up being our metro news class a game of the week we roll those out tomorrow night All right I'm\nTaking a look at in class a you've got a host the teams that are undefeated at this point of view wheeling central middling trail Cameron dodge county Parkersburg Catholic we just talked about them you got a bunch of undefeated teams\nYeah and we're looking forward to earn a good match up with Williamstown next week as well they'll take on joggers county those two teams are nearby rivals in a number of other sports hadn't played in football but that you're in recent years that game is now back on the schedule that will be a I Believe the last regular season game\nAt Dodgers county high school at their current field a client stands very stadium so uh yeah that that promises to be an excellent match up into great test for the yellow jackets Williams done over the next two weeks or\nSo that could be the last game of Dodgers county and their their new for him thorough facility as well they're they're\nThey're almost certain to host a playoff game if even if they lose to Williamstown they're probably safe to do so and actually let me correct myself daughters will will host tigers valley and wait till eleven okay a daughter's kind of has a new football stadium that's under construction at the school\nUm their

K.\nIt'll be why let's get into some more of these responses on the ... uh from the three or four to six six perfect circle so you what are they definitely qualified uh from the three or four to six six you to\nYouTube does not qualify because in my definition of a super group\nYou already have to be a star as an individual act or in a famous band and then leave to join another band that second band that's your super group\nYou too I mean they they basically came fully formed a it wasn't a situation we didn't know anything about bottle before you too there were all teenagers when they started the started the conversation from the three or four seven for one he did a great question\nFirst group that popped into my head was Dolly Emmy Lou and Linda ... is there one album together as a classic also in my Mount Rushmore would be ... Crosby stills and Nash and young the high women and from gospel music uh how about the Gaither vocal ban\nYou know a those are great responses those those all qualify under my definition\nMy definition sounds pretty impressive writes a book or a here's another vote for the high women this comes in from the seven seven six oh one\nFrom the three or four six nine oh Johnny Cash Allen Jackson Hank Williams junior Nelson crops those are great artists but we're really talking about a super group here are from the three or four three eight nine Molly Hatchet\nMolly Hatchet by my definition does not qualify here is this was not a that Molly Hatchet was a great southern rock band are formed back in the seventies but\nIt wasn't as if a bunch of stars ... collided in Mali hatch it or they became famous as Molly Hatchet from the seven to four three two two Crosby stills and Nash and young Derek and the dominoes and blind faith\nWell you can have foreign Mount Rushmore but this is a good response all three of those are qualified and I'm Glad you brought dared dominoes that they're going to dominance in into that a conversation blind faith as well ... are All right let's you know a deal holder or a dean of ... and the head football coach\nAt West Virginia had a media availability today to talk a little bit about what happened in the game with Iowa State and the second half of the season West Virginia's\nIdol this weekend they will host Baylor trying to get back on track a week from Thursday here's Dana ... from earlier today in Morgantown Mm you know\nYou know what's weird is\nYou know I felt I felt like we were ready to play\n'em and you know our our energy was good\nThe locker room before the game was great um you know our prep was normal a guy that into at the hotel was was on point they were engaged um the the pre game although it it it\nWould appear to me like it was a circus I mean there there is abuzz which you know they play that up because we all know we knew they're going to I had circus a quality to it as much as that was going on around there but uh\nOur guys had a good warm up and then the locker room was good and they hit the field and they're ready to play and our sideline really honestly the entire game or a sideline as good a and you look at our uh the way we play and\nWe didn't have Los we didn't have a you know we didn't have a lack of effort ... which is weird because it felt like I mean we got what there is no way around it we got we got her but the but but there wasn't any effort issues\nSo that that's a that's a positive but other than that that's it you know it comes down to good old fashioned\nBlocking and tackling and here here's where I assume responsibility for it is they blocked in tackled better than we did you know but I'm not I I've been there's been plenty of times where we get whipped and I'm just like guys you didn't play hard and play with effort you didn't you didn't you you didn't respect the game you didn't\nPrepare the right way and there's been lots of those situations I wasn't it\nWe simply couldn't sustain blocks um we couldn't get off coverage a defensive way we're stuck on blocks and we missed a lot of tackles that that's a good old fashioned but when it comes to blocking and tackling and that's that's head coach responsibility got to do a better job [noise]\n\nOkay but [laughter] or one area that set up the most of the film or is it to them all yeah pretty much just\nSaid it I mean it's just you know you you got you got a block and you got that I don't know how else to say\nThat they they get a much better job of preparing their guys uh for\nBeing able to block and\nSustained blocks and it's frustrating as encourage you when you have things locked up and guys are just getting off blocks and making tax you know and it's it's\nIt's normal for defensively I mean those guys are good off into coaches too so they're going to have things blocked up and I need right and\nAnd then we can't get off blocks you know there's going to be times where they got things fit it up right and I mean David long is awesome of a player as he is I mean he bailed us out because he's black and white and he gets off blocks and mix place [noise] so\nYou know there's always things that from a scheme perspective I Wish we could have done this for and what I've done this different we got to do a better job of of some some in game adjustments at times I think for the most part we generally do that\nYou know I think are half times are generally pretty good and we make some adjustments and we made a few\nUh about when you got things locked up and they're getting off blocks of making plays than that that poses a little bit of problems\nAren't so that's ... ... a earlier today in Morgantown or some pretty interesting things to unravel of from those statements [noise] he takes responsibility for the loss that's what the head coach does that's what the ball coaches supposed to do it was interesting to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "16"}
