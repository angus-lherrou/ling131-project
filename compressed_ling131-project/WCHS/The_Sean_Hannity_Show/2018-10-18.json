that one of your goals and pick one is to force me to go against Bob Dylan I'll do it one of these ... ... but you have been accomplished it yet not yet a geyser someone's ones but now that that's right so I mean I talk a pretty good game I'm thinking oh you know my own person I'm\nI'm not going to be influenced by a sports figure or a celebrity as to who I'm going to vote\nFade day let me tell you hit a vote that actually exactly not tell you know I Would I Would give that some fly if suddenly that came out if you want to bring it on back home or [laughter]\nOr a ... a one more quick thing about this I think this is fascinating so Nick Saban endorses a candidate in our state he doesn't live here but people recognize your he's from West Virginia do you think a guy like Nick Saban would be a great politician\nI think Nick Saban is a politician well idea there as a heroin head coach of Alabama I think that that comes with the territory not every college football coach\nHas to be as much as one some of them could use a little bit more politician and um but I'm not every position has that but there's a few select ones in this country and in our college football and the elite programs where you have to be a little bit of a politician and I think he is one and he's very good at it\nBut ... just to to kind of push back against that a little I mean let's be honest part of the game in politics is being able to spin the PR right kissing babies and all that stuff that's basically where people have always attack say but I mean I have no doubt that if he was ever elected\nHe would know with the issues he would work hard you know that kind of stuff but the kissing babies and the\nYou know the the handshakes and all that kind of I don't know how good to be at that\nYeah I guess on that aspect of maybe not as much as some of his other PR aspects that he that he takes the one with his with his team it's a it's a good question there's no doubt about that\nBut I think that at least some percentage of his role as in Alabama head coach has to be I'm considered political in a in a lot of ways not in you know our versus the type thing but just in the relationship\nAnd that's how football's really changed me and a half a century ago you know who who care to bear Bryant one the press conference yeah right I mean it was all about you know winning games and the trapped in good players hey speaking of that one more thing before we set the question of the day\nYou know you and I were going on and on the other day about what an amazing week it was in the NFL we had fabulous games the Green Bay comeback of the patriots Kansas City shoot out the way the Steelers game ended juicy you Thursday Night Football is tonight\nUh I I was halfway through reading it and fell

be with the Lakers tonight in Portland that's for things that are probably more attractive than the NFL\nGame the only thing I Will say about the NFL game tonight is the quarterback for the cardinals Josh Rosen is one of the uh up and coming quarters brings in the league I'm kind of interested in seeing how he does I might check it out just for a minute to see how he's doing because I like these

and the influence of the Beatles on pop music so anything like this is interesting to me as an artifact I mean just like okay they tried this version they tried to him and it's just it's fascinating to see what people go through before they get to that one that we all know\nWhat a what a fabulous simple song that how is that it's a wonderful\nSon decor changes everything fantastic\nIf I could just uh I was reading this Rolling Stone article where we got this art audio from two bits from it number one a\nClapping was originally invited to these sessions to settle the rest of the Beatles down a George did it to get them to behave so they can finish the White House them and the second thing is one of my favorites off cut the Beatles songs is not guilty that's another George song I was just reading an article they did a hundred\nAnd to take the ... song and it never made relief\nWhile you're going to look like wow that is a bad\nAll that stuff is it's all fascinating and I've listened to a lot of those\nUh you know before the beginning\nDemos and an unfinished tracks of how they tried things I think it's fascinating the way they tried slow tried fast sometimes they would try it like three or four times for for time and till they yeah 'cause you think these songs you hear the sacred can never be done to ... it's not the way it happened\nYeah and one other point about that article you know you'd think that we would have already gone through all of the Beatles material and you know meticulously catalogued that clip that we just heard was something that was just found yeah in the process that is probably more\nYeah usually because they kept the tapes were all they had money they could just keep rolling their whatever they did\nPay let's talk about the the next performance of mountain stage that is going to be October twenty first coming up with a million ... at the cultural center in in Charleston you have a pretty good line of\nOh it's a great line up and especially if you like blue collar roll up your sleeves kind of rock and roll gospel roots music because I'm the bottle rockets a quartet out of Missouri one of my favorites of all time\nOr they've ... they've written some of my favorite roots rock songs like a thousand dollar car welfare music and they got a new record out now Bryan hit him and usually writes their sauce but this one's a little bit more collaborative a good guitar playing in a two guitars bass drums I mean it's basic\nAnd they're fun they're ... they're witty to their their they got a sense of humor so let's hear

Y.\nYou know before I go to Steve I had one text about our question of the day I didn't want to read this one comes in from the three or four four three nine hey day while I was in college in Vermont\nMy roommate and I saw a recliner with a built in massage your along the curb one night that somebody was throwing away it had a board across the back that was broken\nSo we replaced it in the chair work like it was brand new at the end of the year we returned the chair back to the yard where we found it I Wish I could have seen the faces when they walked out and saw sitting in their yard\nThat's what I mean I mean furniture you can get some pretty decent stories that got a couple of we are going to tell here in a bit let's get the the cotton in here to talk about Marshall football this weekend how you doing Steve\nDoing well thanks so you got any memorable furniture stories these\nWell probably the best on my ... my dad and I are both kind of woodworkers and I made a lot of my furniture I Know that's why I brought it up ... so a coffee table sofa table all that kind of thing\nYeah that's why I brought it up by new you're kind of a furniture buff\nYet that's always been a good project I've kind of filled my space now I Need to build a bigger house or get a bigger\nHouse or furniture [laughter] hey let's talk about Marshall homecoming this weekend FAU you know the fact that the ALS have already lost the game in in conference usa play kind of opens things up for Marshall a little bit if they can get a win this weekend\nWell certainly so both Marshall and the FAA you have a lost middle Tennessee middle Tennessee then lost at F. I. U. now in terms of conference u._s._a. race implications\nF. I. U. is on bait and still it to an end league play\nWhoever loses among our between Marshall and FAU tomorrow has a second league Los ... plays a or as I should say Saturday ... plays Saturday Night against rice which is really struggled so probably somebody's going to be two games behind the leader after\nThe weekend and uh so that just adds a little bit to marshal and after you\nTalk a little bit about Devon single theory that the tail back for if they use the preseason player the your conference usa\nYeah and all American last year when he ran for over Nineteen hundred yards\nAnd scored thirty two rushing touchdowns for FAU those are crazy numbers in fact Monti ball start Wisconsin a few years ago and a guy named Barry Sanders are the only guys in F. B. S. football history to rush for more touchdowns in a year than he did a year ago and he's already at fourteen and counting this year\nHe's a junior and conference usa fans and defensive coordinators are hoping he goes pro after this year\nHow bad you know he's averaging over a hundred yards the game he leads the nation and rushing touchdowns was fourteen already but you know the Marshall running game should get a boost this week a key on Davis is back right\nShould be back and white collar king and Anthony Anderson have really stepped up in his absence king last week I bought\nA hundred and sixty five yards in the fourth quarter and the way to one hundred and Ninety five yards and Anthony Anderson abs Ninety One so marshals run game which had been a little bit stagnant and the first three or four weeks of the season has really look much better the last couple\nOf weeks and uh yeah kings got a one sixty five and one Ninety five last year games you add key on Davis back into the rotation and maybe that will be a strength for Marshall the rest of the season\nYou know I watched all of their herds game last week and who do you and I really liked now a offensively they put the pedal to the middle when the monarchs tried to make a run there in the second half what do you what is going on with oh do you I mean there was one in six now\nAnd the way in is over Virginia Tech right not really a close game how crazy as that they scored forty nine points against the whole keys nobody does that\nSo they can move the ball up and down the field marshals defense of effort into forty two twenty when was uh probably one of its better games defensively and some time now Old Dominion struggles on the other side of the people get a lot of points and a lot\nOf yards against them so that's where they are are going to have to tighten things up quite a bit if they want to win a few games this year\nThe what do you think it it's going to be Alex Thompson again a quarterback for Marshall this weekend\nYeah I think so I was a a green we'll be back in the mix is healthy enough to do so but Thompson\nI think probably feels a whole lot better about life after a game to than he did gave what it was a nightmare to go as your first live action in over a year because he missed most of last season with shoulder surgery at Wagner\nAnd transferred into martial\nAgainst the middle Tennessee team which lined up crazy defenses like one play they might be a normal for three the next play you have your for down Lyman and then all three linebackers might be on the line of scrimmage in all outside the right and so that's\nJust got to be on a nightmare for a quarterback to try to get up to speed again so he'd look much more comfortable I guess Old Dominion and of course when you run the ball like Marshall did especially in the second half I've got to help a quarterback feel comfortable\nThat's a that's a really good point just to go back to his struggles against middle and you know watching that game you know he he targeted Brady a lot in that game but they just didn't seem to click for whatever reason they they seemed like they got their communication together a lot better against Old Dominion\nNo doubt about it over a hundred yards receiving again for ...\nThe Brady who is virtually always bracket ... there's a it's a very rare to see only one defender trying to stop diary Brady and so uh yeah that's important and it's also important to be looking to other directions because ... you know if they could put enough guys on him he's not going to be open\nSo uh you get other guys involved and that's you know a couple of games in in live action you got to be much more confident in doing math and you were for instance I get to middle Tennessee first action in a year you\nKnow what I'm I'm a Clemson plays NC State this weekend in death valley that's going to be a big game and somebody was you know making the point about NC State they're underdogs are big underdogs and the game but if they end up winning that game and then running the table and playing the ACC Championship\nThey they've got that rescheduled game that they lost the week before they play the marshals against east Carolina and then find a week or the regular season\nYou know what was Marshall's thought about trying to add another game after they weren't able to get to Colombia\nI think my camera kid a kind of wait a lot of options but number one the game was insured so you don't have a financial emergency because you missed out on ... million point three or a million point for payday the insurance takes care of that part of it\nYou think about adding a gay man marshals by week his next week that's an ideal place for a by midway through your conference scheduled for under your belt for to go so if you're still thinking about trying to win a conference championship which is the main goal when the seasons starts\nI don't know that you're necessarily wanted to fill that and I guess it's possible that you could stick a game in at the end of the regular season if you're not near league championship game or something I don't know how practical it is even be thinking about that at this point but uh I guess that's still an option that could be out there\nThan it was on the state of Nineteen sixty seven the United states to formal possession of Alaska from Russia

according to investors business daily ... how far down percentage was do we have to go for a a real correction what qualifies as a correction\nShort a happy to do that so just a regular pullback would be like a six percent pulled back from the top\nAnd intermediate correction is what we call ten to twelve percent off the top and that that's good enough sometimes to wash things out and all that I don't believe we're quite there yet on the look at my numbers we we were close on the NASDAQ though I don't think we're quite there yet\nUh now we're getting into a beer market that is eight twenty percent or greater hold back the good news is I have a graph I Wish I maybe I'll send it to me like I'm just looking for you to see it\nIt it shows all the bull and there are markets going back to like Nineteen hundred and what's very interesting about that is if you just you know\nJust take a deep breath and calmed down we always come out of this and and it's a ... when I say this to calm me down to 'cause sometimes I'll I'll have my you know like my charts up\nAnd we'll be down three hundred thousand five hundred wait what's going on here uh so we all everybody gets a little concerned but it's not a this is not unusual behavior once in a while to get a choppy markets and I'm just just everybody should hang on\n[noise] are there any safe havens right now\nWell see that's the thing I cannot say we need to get a solid trend\nIf we with this bouncing I Can't tell you to go into utilities or into the sensitive names because if we have about steak we get a good day and money goes back into the fangs thought then you're going to be stuck in some of these you know more defensive posture names and they're not going to be doing very well so\nI Would say everyone just probably not by any fresh start don't take oh things are at the bottom line is a good time to buy I Would wait till the volatility calms down quite a bit and if we we get it through some of the things that are happening in the news out in the world some of those things calmed down um then it would be safer to go back in\nYou know what I Want to get into a couple of individual names before we wrap this up with the Amy Smith but Amy ... a lot of the wall street pros are are pointing to the fact that a lot of his stuff the the wild fluctuations that we've been having I I guess since the end of August or really generated by program trading\nIt is so let's say that I'm a big company and let's say that the stocks that I um Amazon or alphabet Google whatever\nLet's say it hits a certain price well it triggers selling because they have and they have certain numbers were there they click on them to protect themselves and that's true from almost every professional trader out there so when you hit this the computers do the same thing and then you get a lot more selling because everyone else\nHits their target price and then it goes lower and someone else to their target price\nAnd so you've got all computerized trading automatic trading it's not a human being behind that\nAnd that's what drives these wild days in the market oftentimes\nYou know what I'm ... the theory is that the mortgage trend needs to be up for for us to get a lot of my views for initial public offerings and it only makes sense that people want to dump come public into a market that it's on the way up so they can make more money\nYou know we've got a couple of really key ideals that are coming up is that you mentioned to me in lift and ... of these things may be big\nThis will be a this all this will get us all a chance to probably make some money because they you know I mean I think lifted values or something like Fifteen billion a liberal we now it's huge\nIf these companies come public\nIt should give us a lot of confidence okay because the underwriters of Morgan Stanley and taping Morgan the people that under right these are these companies to help them go public they won't do it if they don't think we're in a good market and a good economy\nSo there's times when the appeal market gets very very quiet but we're right now if everything you read everything you can look at they are not they're not planning to slow down their public offering down at the end it may not be tomorrow\nBut their lips is already talking it's Eighteen Morgan rubber plants so let's keep an eye on that and maybe in the market will get a job for the time they come back into the market and there's something else coming up we usually get some kind of a Santa Claus rally into the Christmas Holiday so we'll see if that happened\nYou know what I'm Glad you brought that up because they didn't want this whole segment segment to be doing with bloom that traditionally in the market when you enter the market at a at the store to fall in ride the wave to the end of the year normally you do well in normally you do well by double digits\nYes you do and and it's because of the balancing that everybody's trying to do that but you know I'm a professional money manager I Want to make my and I'm like aimed at the end of the year all my clients will be very excited that my books look good\nLook how much money in NATO So there's a lot of psychological thing that happened around the Christmas holidays and uh and at the retail sales are good\nAnd people are you know the economy is strong right now and that could get more confidence for this the end of the year rally\nAmy ... uh I got about a minute here but I did want to get your reaction to Walmart which is West Virginia's largest employer cutting its earnings are guidance earlier this week\nThey did now they spent a lot of money they bought advance auto parts that ticker symbol there's a pie Walmart is W. empty and they did announce it in the long run it's good news for Walmart because they're trying to be more competitive for and against the Amazon it's all up and down the line\nThis will be strong but of course you have to spend money which they did that either side of art\nIn order to kind of get the money back again so it's a it's a play it's a play that they're making let's see if it works out\nWell I'll tell you what no matter what direction the market is going I enjoy er visits Amy thanks so much for coming on the show and we'll get your back in your next week and hopefully will have a better stock market news to talk about\nYes indeed I

I think if you put those two things together there's are probably the reason that we don't see that as much this year\n... and here's a as a second yeah it's a good question and here's the second question from the same texture five seven one six to six he says Kevin\nWhy does dino allow the players to call attention to themselves when they make a play by beating their chance to cetera especially the defense they were men handled by Iowa State if they want to be tough uh tell them to set a new trend and have the players run back to their positions against that quickly that'll send the best message to the opposing team\nThat they're here to play is about the team not about them individually [noise]\nYou know I I don't know I my first reaction to that question and comment is maybe a little bit of an overreaction I I don't know if that's really a problem for West Virginia to you\nI don't think it's a problem I understand the thought\nThat the taxpayer is getting at\n... and especially when you're ... ... it or if you're getting some like worth but then there was\nAnd you you know make a play for a for your loss and I think I I I understand that certainly in contact with the old school on that on the other side you know what players to be excited I you know I don't want them showing up the other people that you're giving out at Yale or pumping the ... things like that\nI'm not against that uh you know but I agree with I see where it's coming from there's a lot that you don't want to step across on one of them is you know when the game's over you got beat or what does that uh the other team's been a ... just down the whole game idle picked up on that\nAll right you know there's been a lot of discussion this week about what happened in Iowa State you know ... and I don't have a problem talking about the game um but there's no reason to go on about the the shortcomings of what happened to West Virginia and nausea\nSo let me put it to you this way it is West Virginia getting to the off week before the second half of the season at the right time\nAnd yeah I think right in the middle like what are the important role to play with who and R B right in the middle of your plate that says that yeah I think that on a really good that we looked at the good of coming up for next year that just came out today it's a little bit earlier there's there'll be a longer threats of things\nSo you know from ... report the bumps versus I think half white is pretty good\nAnd that from the lady from the standpoint of trying to recover from this because it's not like we're gonna have to redesign the whole law sense\nIt just has to figure out the way to attack what the last two defenseless have done to it which is three or four guys on the line dropped by ... spring of ... from the second level not necessarily late all the evidence on delight bullets they're just ... different tactics of defenders of different places\nWhere we didn't have to figure out how to attack that so having a few extra days without ...\nAll right let's get into the the the story that came out earlier today that West Virginia's twenty Nineteen football schedule is out and I'm looking at this schedule in a couple of things jump out to me right away number one\nWhen you only play one MCS team this was a rough schedule okay [laughter] this is a pretty difficult schedule and number two both of the a weekday games fall as road games for West Virginia I think that's good for fans\nShore or you know that one definitely helps you got all the Saturday home games and you gotta take turns with those West Virginia have those this year has the pumpkin coming up again they learn that recount Thursday night so yeah I\nReally don't have a problem with the schedule again that you know it's pretty clear that the only factor back roads games Oklahoma and Baylor\nYou've got the ... from Saturday following for like\nA really count you know there was no reason that ... been successful with the schedule for purposes of federal with ... you know there was no ... and the broken up a little bit it doesn't have quite that murder row at the um although you know the fire with the Oklahoma altogether or\nAre they say to you in our home estate either so I'm Sorry about that my dog has a reformer somebody outside\nAnd that's all right actually you're still sounds better I think your dog\nYeah I guess for it um but yeah I I think it's a good schedule a it's a great one with that the state in Missouri I Wonder if they're gonna be a really nice and our task for West Virginia and the first Wilker\nYeah then that's that's the key phrase I think so let's just break this down a little bit as far as the the beginning of the twenty Nineteen schedule West Virginia opens against J em you know obviously that's a game West Virginia should win but for for West Virginia fans who really don't follow MCS football", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "18"}
