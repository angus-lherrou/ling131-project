York\nYou know that's the first thing he brought up was going to the guard we're not necessarily going to the garden you know that those boys it ESPN or Fox because uh I you know Fox has the rights for the Big East that they want to see West Virginia plays a beer they want to rekindle that right Xavier Cincinnati thing that hug and said going adversary\nAnd plus you know it is the game when so be it instantly be a sellout because West Virginia fans can drive down there um and it'll it won't Iraq and even both ways if if they came to ... yeah\nThink so I mean in Xavier shoot Xavier cells that every game anyway right All right but that's down the road yeah what do you think what do you think about the w._b. football game tomorrow night well\nTo tomorrow night's of bounce back I mean you have to bounce back after that\nPathetic performance so it's just call it what it was um in Ames so tomorrow night as bounce back night they got to do it convincingly if it's not convincing do not be shocked of West Virginia finishes out like two and three\nIf it's not convincing you know Baylor really has trouble running a ball\nThey they try to establish the run I was looking at some stuff today in the games they've won\nThey've rushed for over two hundred yards in the games that they have trouble running the ball the they they can't run at all and wait and see what happens I mean on West Virginia's a past first team okay so running the ball is secondary to they're often\nThe Baylor tries to run the ball I mean they're going to try to run on West Virginia well a\n... million times the new show everybody should be trying to run the ball [laughter] I mean you shouldn't tell you establish your office because if you you saw it against our state was urging you could not run the ball\nAnd then all they do is just a lot in the ... years back and come up your quarterback parties over I mean because you can't run you've not established it and they're just blitz and you and you guys can't get open\nWhat do you think the odds makers know that we don't know I mean when we take a look at the line on this game is two touchdowns I mean Baylor gave tax is a really good game they played them very well in Austin they held Texas without scoring that the long run I didn't score and the second half of the game\nIn West Virginia you know we were talking about their game and I said it was a lot more lopsided than the final score really indicated\nYet West Virginia's a heavy favorite tomorrow night I think if West Virginia had been rolling it would probably been closer to you know Seventeen points but what you get six points were being at home\nAnd she will get three three points for getting in and that's another three on top of that 'cause it's a night game now oh no that is true that is true you know it's interesting tomorrow night the NFL game is really not that attractive\nBut the ESPN game that's going up against the west Virginia's game on that first one is Georgia Tech Virginia Tech\nAnd that was taking a look at this you know Virginia Tech\nHasn't lost the game in the coastal they've got five games left for their five games or at home there one road game as Pitt um despite the fact I mean when you think about Virginia Tech they lost that game to Old Dominion that's really like an outlier they've got a really great shot to play for the ACC champion trial well\nThen there for years they when they first joined they played for all the time yeah yeah so yeah I mean tech ... got to be tough you know that there if you look at it West Virginia in Virginia Tech or a lot of like you know they're going to have some down years mediocre years but they're always decently\nTough yeah I I just wonder about the ratings I'll be interested to see how the west Virginia does a head to head tomorrow night against the Virginia tech game on ESPN I\nDon't know there's still something about if as one somebody was sending me up a tweet about this er during the Iowa State game claiming that they couldn't get fs one\nAnd I'm thinking well you know I looked at the numbers that they're updated because you have cord cutting every quarter that you've got about eighty seven million people who get ESPN but eighty four million people get F as one on there where they were I don't know I'm not sure hey so what's going on at the why what's the what's the latest on the YMCA well actually I'll go ahead and\nBreak the news here in the month of November\nAh through the through the all the YMCAs of the YMCA if ... valley which would be our downtown

I Believe that we haven't had a full complement of guys in any of those ...\nWith an update of sports I'm Joe for Cato on five eighty WC Asia\nPlus for the outdoors with performance Saturday at seven AM and Sunday at five PM resented Marlboro Harvey ... you're right on line and mom I'm not how\nFar will come back to the show twenty six minutes still the hour we'll get somebody curry the hosts the sport\nSign on with us in just one second quicker reset of our question of the day talking about college basketball\nNews right now but this is your news coming down to the light at this moment today was the big twelve ... in Kansas City conference announcing a new more years scheduling agreement just started twenty Nineteen twenty twenty that will include all ten\nTeams from both leagues ten games will be played every year at five campus sites in each conference the new agreement with the Big East will have no impact on the big twelve\nCurrent annual series with the SEC that should be like old home week for West Virginia boundaries are Big East members and hoops from Ninety five to twenty twelve however only Georgetown Seton hall Villanova St john's Providence Marquette DePaul remain\nFrom the Big East lined up that featured West Virginia during its days in the conference or question of the day is this ... West Virginia biggies basketball rivalries do you miss the most once again our question of the day ... West Virginia biggies basketball rivalries do you miss the most reach out to us\nOn the phone and let's get Tony Curtis hosts the sports on into the mix Tony how you doing today I'm well Dave how are you so we'll ... we'll take a crack at this question what what Big East basketball robberies do you miss the most [noise]\nUh I think from West Virginia perspective I like to West Virginia Villanova a lot uh I think the west Virginia Pitt kind of knew it was already you know it already been played so I kind of call that pre Big East so that was kind of a pre existing rivalry settled kind of include that in there\nI saw I think West Virginia Villanova I liked a lot and uh Syracuse and Georgetown I had some incredibly heated battles that goes all the way back to the mid eighties with Patrick Ewing are in that gangs so I think those are kind of guns ones that you'd always kind of take a look at and they were always going to be a little bit special\nYou know what ... West Virginia joined the big twelve looking at the football end of it you know getting into a conference with Oklahoma and Texas you knew the ticket sales would be good or for West Virginia fans in that realm\nBasketball as a kind of a little bit of a different animal but you know I I think West Virginia fans have kind of come around to the big twelve\nOh very much so uh last year was a record in season tickets they did Seventy eight hundred I think this year and that was with Kentucky on the scheduling home\nThis year they're right again near that number of very close to it and I do think that the fans and this'll be the seventh year in the league\nOr have started to really take a hold of it I think the you know the the fact that can kick Kansas has success in Oklahoma has had success and Baylor's had success I mean that's it's good league Oklahoma states had its times as well\nUm it's good man it's it's fun and I think the round Robin aspect of it also increases fan interest in that if you see your team go out on the road and lose and you know that they're coming back you want to come up and do your part when they do return so I I Do think that it keeps everyone more focused on the season\nKnow what a one way through this question of the day out it wasn't so much that I was pining away for all those are all those bygone days of West\nIn in the Big East but I Would say this but I think Bob Huggins success at West Virginia has kind of really ease the transition into the big twelve\nI think it's a very good point yeah I Do too I think that had West Virginia not ban one of the upper echelon teams in this league I think our fans kind of now would have been looking back on and saying you know what\nA year in for the days of the Big East uh but the fact that the west Virginia's ban in the championship Hans and West Virginia's ban in the championship game of the big twelve conference tournament three consecutive years and obviously this season starting off with a lot of\nOptimism as as a number Thirteen team going into the season and this is the third pick preseason pole you're right or if it wasn't like this I think fans kind of would have been wishing for what it could be and I think they're very content with right now what it is\nYou know Anthony Lewis was just in here and we were talking about this off the air a little bit that when you start thinking about the match up of the Big East and the big twelve that are going to start not this year but the following year you know you look at what's going on with Kansas Kansas is going to play Villanova\nI Would imagine that West Virginia is going to get a pretty attractive game for television\nFor some reason I say there was either dreaming or someone told me that I thought that it might be Georgetown but I'm not sure\nYeah I got to believe that somewhere in this series West Virginia's gonna play Xavier don't you think\nWell I think possibly yeah I think possibly and I think hugs would be good with either of those from a recruiting perspective to get into the D.C Maryland market uh that doesn't hurt West Virginia and obviously to get into Ohio whenever he can he likes to do that as well\nYou know what one more basketball question before we start talking about the football game tomorrow night\nI was watching a above Huggins a Q A with the the media today at the big twelve\nEvent in Kansas City in the first question right out of the box of from the reporters was about the FBI investigation into college basketball this is something that all coaches I think are going to have to face it it's going to be a big story at the beginning of the\nSea hawks that the story of the day is the story of the season I mean the seat this afternoon the verdict came down and it was a surprise a lot of people thought that the feds would lose\nIn this trial and it surprised everyone that all three of those that were under we're at a trial our all convicted of the charges three for a ghetto of Adidas and into each on the other ones and so that seven counts though the federal\nGovernment to go seven in ... in this\nState I think this opens up a mass of a massive story now because basically what the government just did\nWas they said that the if the schools were being defrauded because the players that had been paid ah were ineligible and so as a result of them are receiving their scholarship moneys that was it was fraudulent\nSo now those guys are going to jail and you've got to wonder about anyone else that's been implicated or potentially could be implicated\nThese guys are going in jail I mean this isn't a show cause right or any more this is for real so when Chuck person's trial comes up in February and the other assistance come up in February now they're going to look at this thing and they go like\nIf they can prove this thing I Am I going to go to jail for this\nAm I going to go to jail I Wonder if it does make it a little bit more\nUh easy for these guys to cop a play or to start talking more um next this could really open up a lot of things and obviously as you've probably mentioned as well Kansas came out today and they um put Sylvia to Sosa on the shelf\nAwaiting their investigation he's the guy that\nHas been mentioned repeatedly in this trial and they thought they came out kind of boldly a couple of weeks ago and said when they started practice so he's got to be eligible and now they're man now he's not going to be going to put them on the side they had the same deal with Billy pressed in a year ago he never got onto the floor so this is just starting to shake as a whole lot more left in this\nYou know I'm Glad you brought that up because I had not ... I had not talked about that code or ... or their schedule will be sentenced on march the fifth and they could or would it go away from between two and four years each hey what do you think about the game tomorrow night\nOh I'm excited because I Want to see what this team is going to do from West Virginia after what happened at Iowa State I mean I think that is the biggest thing for everyone I just talk with you know just a little bit ago and you know he's he too okay where are we going to go from what happened at Iowa State it's a huge huge moment it's a seminal moment in the season for the team\nYou bounce back you get the when you play well and everyone goes okay you're back on the track if you don't\nThen it's like whoa what has happened and what's going on because of what's left in the season so it's massively important game\nAll right Tony thanks for your time today I Do appreciate it thank Dave All right Tony curry check him out on sports line at the time of the Ku before we go to the break a I mentioned the Tony first question out of the box to Bob Huggins got today in Casey was about the the FBI or investigation into college basketball here's his answer\nMy ... in a bomb multiple things in his league been\nConnected to the visitation and allegations go see it with that\nUm what's your reaction to that and what if any concern as you have about a level playing field in this league and in college basketball's oh [noise]\nWell my first thought is um [noise]\nI keep hearing about the state of our game\nAnd the state of our game is really pretty good [noise] um [noise] if in fact which I don't think has been proven yet did any of those things happen they should have happened [noise] um [noise] what you're talking about what four or five schools at the most\nThere's three hundred and sixty one division one schools [noise] and I don't know how many division two schools of those three schools [noise] any any corporate ESPN or take those numbers have you had like three or four guys like stray off the reservation a little bit [noise]\nHe wouldn't say ESPN falling apart [noise] you'd say some people had some problems and I think it's that way the state or game as I don't think it's ever been any better than what it is now [noise]", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "24"}
