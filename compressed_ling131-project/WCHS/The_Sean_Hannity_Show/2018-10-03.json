three dismissed earlier today having to do with a calf Gilbert desk\nAnd so he had these three charges in connection with moving that desk to his home and federal prosecutors have backed off those charges now they voluntarily dismissed them and it was okay to by\nFederal judge John coping have her um but I think they found some evidence that it was mood basically one law for he said it was moved there was a dispute Laufer he said it had been knew before he took office in December twenty twelve\nAnd not in a not on West Virginia they twenty Thirteen as was alleged in these indictments so I think something came up that they saw that yes I he was right and so those charges have been dismissed so he now faces twenty two charges\nJeff what do you think you you know when he's lying there in bed and the middle of the night in the dark to see through the day he even thought about that stupid death so al ... but he does\nYeah I mean in his attorney said in his attorney were trying to take advantage of it today saying if he was telling the jury hey you can do that all these charges now they've already dismissed three ... you know so he's trying to poke holes in in their case\nThe federal prosecutors said that most of their case will be on kind of forensic type or\nEvidence when it comes to like finances um\nYou know a mileage reimbursement use of a of a state purchasing card or you know those type of the end they admitted told the jury is somebody's might be bored if some of these might be boring [noise] ah but hang with us because we're going to prove that law free did

iPhone for that was Ben gate with the I've been sick [laughter] there's always these gates everywhere so this is the most recent on but they're going to solve it not a problem and eventually it'll go away\nThere you go so just Google a charge gates out there and you'll be able to find out the only unfortunate details on that\nHey there will be ... article you'll be fine\nGo there you go there you go a ... ... ... one of the things I Love about seeing that is how much stuff I just learned by reading these articles when I think I Know a little bit about the subject and this is a perfect example of this\nAmazon got a great publicity earlier this week when they raised their minimum wage to Fifteen dollars\nBut the you know your story points out of ... Ruben wrote it I didn't realize this\nThat the median salary of for folks that Amazon is well below what the other big tech companies pay\nRight and it's part of the reason for that is because uh the ... the good people at Amazon have so many workers who work in the warehouses re compare that to people like for example Google most of their employees are tech workers right they're not they're not doing the kind of hard labor where\nAn apple has a little bit of a mixed because they have the retail stores right so they're not\nThey're not just paying tech companies salaries but that's what drags\nThe median down for for Amazon they have way more employees working in those warehouses and they do actually building the technology so by doing this this is a pretty big deal or there's one thing that I think a lot of people miss though when this announcement came out\nWhich is that the Amazon is also going to do away with the monthly bonuses in stock a word you know he used to have these\nCheaper stocks you can buy a lot of companies do this restricted stock units\nYou know you can buy in for a certain percentage of the actual cost of the stock\nUm I Know apple does it a couple of others do so they're getting rid of that instead of instead they're offering everyone okay we're going to just up you're paid to this amount and that'll be what you and you'll be made whole by that so for some people that could be hundreds of dollars they're missing out on a month but now they have consistent income coming\nBy the way I mentioned the the median salary at Amazon is lower than the other tech giants median salary at Amazon has of twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars which I'm reading right out of the social scene that story\nOr a couple of other things here that are pretty interesting you know I'm not a big ... guys but other people are you know\nHere's the thing is you know I I I get a lot of response from from listeners ... of my Twitter feed\nAnd you know it's pretty difficult for me to uh try to verbalize of ... you know when I get them when they get a message is like five straight a ... it's it's kind of difficult to interpret that with some people love their ... and now in Iowa was twelve point one there's going to be Seventy plus of\nThe ... ... to that software update I was talking about earlier it's going to have all these new emerging so by the way\nApple is genius at this day every year around this time they announced all the new andme oh gee coming here and the world kind of lights up over it it was at the top of Google News you know we have a story on it obviously so this year's him oh gee I'm there is some cute ones there's a bagel for example which I'm surprised we've waited so long\nUm although it doesn't have cream cheese or locks on and so I have a little bit of a problem with that\nUm they have a freezing face and Moji\nA base ball and perhaps\nMy favorite they have a cupcake which is pretty cool and they even have some odd ones is why they always there and some unusual ones that are culturally significant so there's a mango\nOne which a lot of the Indian users of a of a front products were really excited about and then there's also if you've ever been to turkey and there's this really popular thing the evil eye ... they actually have an emotion for that too which I think is is really interesting and tells how\nMuch am apple is trying to make sure that they are or being internationally\nRecognized and something that's respectful as are they even have one of those red slips that that people give way during Chinese New year as an emerging now too\nIt's funny I Can't help but look at these things and I'm looking at the the lives of the new ones and the one that I Would use would probably be the suitcase because you know it's like I'm On the way or I'm traveling this weekend or whatever\nYou know the real trick Davis eventually have to learn how to how to how to punch them up and tell an entire conversation through emerging that's the next level you know [laughter]\nI'm not going to get their All right so uh what's what's the latest with the president or in terms of how he's dealing with the tech giants he's got something was coming up with the leaders of Google\nYeah so there there's this interesting obviously it by now you probably have heard that\nThe president is not a big fan of the tech industry ready as clean that among other things that they are censoring conservative voices he's been really really hard against Google and Facebook and Twitter in particular\nSo now there seems to be a planned meeting a between him and a couple of tech CEOs including ... the CEO of Google who you may remember I'm just last month\nDid not show up at the testimony in the Senate and a lot of people were very angry at Google for that I it just makes sense you know a lot of times when the house\nIn the Senate have hearings on something the White House wants to get involved they have to run their own event so this is not a surprise but\nUh considering how contentious ... relationship has been I'm really curious to see how people respond to it and what comes out of it\nWell you know the last thing that was going to ask you about a was something that literally just happened within the last couple of hours you got your new of FEMA text alert right on the phone and we all got it\nAnd it you know this is an interesting idea I mean first off if there was a lot of weird reaction to it I thought because obviously the president right now is a somewhat of a polarizing figure but in the you know this is this thing was started in two thousand six and the idea was that you know they have already Amber Alert systems and they have\nEmergency weather related stuff right if there's a flooding coming so this is the next step this is if there's something political very important happening for example you know I'm just throwing it out there the potential vote war or something like that or an attack on the country\nThat is something that the president could use I I don't suspect that suddenly we're going to be getting a daily Twitter barrage through our phones unless you really want that\nSo uh but it's going to be you know it was interesting to see everyone's reactions to it and of course it everyone got the text messages it was a very generic you know this is a test no worries um but it shows that you know the government wants to have this way to communicate with the people and they've chosen that cell phones so the way to do it when they need to marry\nWell you know I think a part of the the uproar on social media was because this was called a quote presidential alerts unquote life you know that he's not the president is not going to be sending out messages to everybody's phone about what he thinks about Saturday Night live\nAre you in here a senior editor from San Francisco at the nets joins us on our program at

young residents nearly growing counties state of West Virginia\nAnd I think a lot of our rather than a lot of time traveling Charles these type of things and we have a\nHuge piece of real estate here

Philips yes when uh this is grant is bell this is ... in my opinion the best\nWide receiver core ever West Virginia including eighty eight including two thousand Thirteen ... here's why in my opinion because all these guys do something different\nAnd they do it really well they are all dangerous in their own right and when you have three or four guys and then with this core you know you turn my five different guys doing seven Bush\nChef throw him in there I almost forgot and he's got to go in there too you know it was ... and the hills are going to matter ending easing\nCore that is extremely dangerous and they all do something different you get down within the ten you're going to the ... if you need something deep though at the summit Janine possessed you and you go to Jennings you know if you're going to ... it's a it's it's very impressive\nThis group I'm One of my favorite receiving corps of course was a was born in ... and then um you know that group or whether they were probably closer like they were in there were Bolger so maybe like Ninety seven okay was there but up and take a look at that\nBut yeah very impressive probably in my personal opinion the best while receiving corps ever was you know it's\nIt's funny when you start talking about best ever right because\nFans have their favorite teams and football uh you know it's kind of difficult to compare a a team that's doing things now as opposed to to Thirty years ago going back de da ... football's different football's different all all these teams are throwing the ball around a lot more each team gets a lot more often so snaps than they used to\nI remember thinking at the time that that eighty eight team\nWith remembered and Philips and granted bail I mean they they were just absolutely loaded loaded they and they and\nThey had a good quarterback to get back to throw it a couple of yards a major was or was it was a very good quarterback and obviously this year's group a wide receivers for West Virginia [laughter] really benefits for from Greer I mean he's just a a tremendous passer and very accurate battery\nAccurate which makes the whole group very dangerous than God Forbid you throw in the ... the tide in who they hit Saturday ... if you throw him into the mix and they've got to go to titan and so dangerous real danger\nNow here's the thing there's probably somebody out there that's probably going off the road I'm listening to this conversation because admittedly were only a handful of games into the season you don't know what's gonna happen the rest of the season I mean look at what happened in the second half of the game at Texas Tech\nI'd like to think that's an outlier in won't be a ... we'll see going forward we shouldn't see it this week against Kansas ... this week should they should be padding stats don't you think\nWell you thought you would have thought they would have been patting sets last week but basically what happened in the second half in my opinion was simple middle breakdowns you're talking about dropping balls overthrowing the ball um and just simply not being up playing in the office of line kept them playing behind the chains\nYou know they kept you know a lot of penalties and it just got sloppy and the ugly that I think that was the the lack of concentration aspect of it\nSo I think if you're still in the game for four quarters you're not going to see that from the team I Am hoping that we don't see that again\nYeah I think that's probably right I mean when you take a look at the numbers are at the end of the day for career and you think you know how how did they stop scoring I mean look at his numbers like three Seventy and three touchdowns and no turnover is no picks no fumbled nothing\nRight yeah it was it ... that was the funny thing we the people that watched that you saw you were really disappointed in the second half but the people that just watched the stats flash across the screen didn't know any difference but\nDon't forget they did the same thing to Oklahoma State and Oklahoma State has a pretty ... as well they shut they shut them down in the second half the week before that\nOne thing I wanted to ask you about before we have to take a quick break and play in or out we were talking before we came on the air today but you took your daughter to her first game yes that was over you know what I remember when my dad took me to the my first WVU game at the old stadium and the you know just the conversations we had when it's all new\nWhat did she say to you or what really surprised you about her reaction\nWell she was a an barest or a little bit because I was just really getting into it on for her account and you know all the\nThe cheers and the dancing and all that stuff I was trying to get her involved in that and\nIt I tell you what was the coolest thing for me was being able to sit there with your with my daughter and sing country roads that is really cool and um but yeah I mean she just enjoyed the atmosphere\nAnd um she's pretty reserved anyway she so me trying to get her editor on to do like some of the cheers and stuff was was a funny thing but uh\nShe just had a blast and she wanted to go back of course the Saturday but she's got plans or with their friends but um it it was it was an experience that I'll never forget\nThat's great to experience as a day

boulevard and south ridges boulevard in South Charlton to write lanes are closed use caution in the area it's an easy got just an event in the ... valley Charleston vilified ride round and do what is happening all along ... boulevard between capital's streets and magic island now through Sunday\nSee the entire schedule other than for five days at Charleston W the car shows dot com\nTraffic ... vice city national bank with eighty seven convenient location to start your banking nice city national bank equal housing lender convenient location near you log on to the bank at city dot\nAlways had a point governments out because I Love to have the ball in Miami\nOh yes and no I think that the idea that they have in there now I'm as a football and understand what it takes to win at a high level in football and and then they made facilities um overtures to improve significantly and that plan is currently you know kind of the fundraising [noise]\nI think it can happen Dave I truly do think it can happen now is it is it a quick timetable no but yeah it could you at some point yes I think the answer is yes\nMa'am I agree with you but I don't know if we'll ever see in our lifetime I mean uh I I just don't know I mean\nA lot of good coaches a lot of good men of tried in a lot of die drawn to turn around and they um you know West Virginians playing so well right now they're undefeated there\nIn the top ten we were just talking about it in the last hour there legitimately now in the conversation to maybe go to the college football players if they keep on rolling so that gives me and guys like me an opportunity to make about some of the other stuff and that includes\nAll gold uniforms I'm Tony and don't like it I don't like it do do they deserve the athletic department know that the fans don't want is the old gold uniforms\n[noise] well hobbies Lee know since they are going to let me know through\nThe thing that it is you know this is a gold rush this coming week and so we've got and you know David the old days we just everyone just wore clothes and it didn't matter if\nI was striped or not strive to one side was white out and one side was gold and on side was all this kind of stuff so unfortunately I was too old guys\nAre just going to have to come along and play with a new era of that is that you're going to have these events during the course of the season so obviously if it's a gold rush yeah I get it or understand it okay and while it may not be as\nOur number one choice I can get it but you know I think we've talked about this in the past I\nI just like schools and I am the old guy on the lawn here now I just like schools a just war the colors and where the colors that we know them as wearing through the years but that that train has long left the station and now it's going to be every week is something different and that's just the way that it's kind of\nImagine though if you're like a three hundred and thirty five pound off into ... and you look at that that that uniform as it laid out in front of your locker and you start with nothing on I mean\nIt's not a good look some guys will look like the sun [laughter] three hundred and thirty pounds it\nThrough All right and a couple of the games in the big twelve that are kind of interesting uh where's it West Virginia's rooting interest being in Texas and Oklahoma\nOh and what do you think wins\nI think ah I think Oklahoma wins because I think often simply they just have too much power\nUm and I don't necessarily know to lie on the game is eight over under sixty one so they expect a lot of points relatively you know a good number of points\nUm to score by I think Oklahoma in this one a collar Marie I'm you know has just been I think absolutely superb ah this would however as certainly answer the question is Texas back if they could get that W I personally don't think that it happens this week\nAnd what about the other game there's a couple of games that are kind of intriguing in in the big twelve case they did Baylor um you know a healer at home uh giving case they point\n[noise] I I Know that's a tough one to your ears awhile thing coming out of that so if if Baylor wins therefore into two in one\nCase state loses their two and four oh one three and like who would have had that before the season started like no one would have had that but that very well\nCould have happened this is a real huge check game for Kansas State see where it's or it's mental a thermometer is and then the other one you're probably going to jump to here I think the same deal for\nOklahoma State in Iowa State so Oklahoma states favored by ten and a half Iowa state's one in three at all when too\nAnd we all know they've had a quarterback issue\nThey could be one in four and oh and the three when they go home next week to play West Virginia\nWhich I think is worst case scenario to be quite honest with you for West Virginia I think that Iowa State has a great mental toughness about it I think there was a really good program in a really good coach I think at some point they'll become healthy again this year\nAnd there'll be good but right now it hasn't happened for them but I don't I don't see this like as a three and nine ah or in their case since they missed a game of three and eight or Iowa State team I think they're they're gonna get wins and so you don't want to take the wounded animal on but that that could be the case when the when they come to the west Virginia next Saturday at their place say\nToni finally for let you let you go into do appreciate your time or I saw last week that West Virginia's got a basketball game now I'm a an exhibition game against Penn State that's scheduled the day that the mountaineers played Texas right to the ... okay so the what do you do that day what how does that work\n[noise] football uh football takes priority um until the season is over so um I don't you know technically day we don't know when the Texas game is going to be so I think WVU came out and said the games either going to be what like noon to her for two four six or something like that yeah\nSo I mean conceivably you don't know I'm In ... you know broadcast wise if they can do both at the same time or whatever it is so ... we'll just have to kind of wait and see and we'll we'll get that thing figure it out but yeah it's a good it's a good event I'm unfortunately we're going to miss it uh you've\nDone that before right you've done a football game in a basketball game on the same day\nOh absolutely yeah yeah yeah okay you've done All right", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "03"}
