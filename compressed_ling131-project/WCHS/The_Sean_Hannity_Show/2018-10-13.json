traveling tourists I'm Ken ... is an avid runner who's written thousands of books including his own field guide series the caffeine field guides and he's led many birds ... o seven continents\nHe's also a frequent keynote speaker at many perverted nature events and he's joining us now\nHello Ken I'm told you were frequent listener river shows so thank you and welcome to our world travel\nBoth thanks so much Ah yes I'm very interested in travel and all of you guys are the experts already so I Love your show\nWill appreciate that very much so let's we've never done a segment on this program dating back to its inception in two thousand foreign burning kind of surprised me and it's the reason why we asked our producer Valerie to coordinate your parents from your experiences and Toronto's how big do you think the burning industry is and why does it continue to grow in popularity\nWhile it's huge actually I mean there have been surveys and studies trying to quantify it probably there are more than forty five million people in the United states who are bird watchers across a lot of them you know do that in the back yard but there's also do travel element to it and according to a survey\nTo thousands of eleven almost Fifteen billion dollars spent by bird watchers during their travel for lodging and transportation\nI think that's pretty bad that you can for people\nListening I think you know there may be the sort of a misnomer I think you need to travel to exotic parts of the world to enjoy hurting but there are three areas right here in the U.S Senate outstanding destinations and I know that you've written about may know that you've been\nTo a central New Mexico the central Texas coast north eastern Florida which I'm not sure how effective they weren't with the hurricane that might be a little bit more challenging this week but can you just give us a quick factor two or three ...\nI'm sure yeah that's especially relevant right now because I'm thinking about our National Wildlife refuges and National Wildlife refuge or week starts tomorrow\nAnd October for it so it runs the fourteenth the twentieth but anyway uh I'm from New Mexico the book at the national wildlife refuge is an amazing area for wintering bird like crying and snow geese and it was a huge favorite with just amazing endless opportunities there\nAre the central Texas coast around the national wildlife refuge\nIs the best place in the world with the group and crying and they were there there was a big clock but that's the northern Canada migrate\nSouth central to spend the winter it around and on the whole area that section of the Texas\nCoast was hit by Hurricane Harvey in August of two thousand Seventeen and they're still rebuilding the some of the areas where it rough but if you go there the bird watching with great them by going there during the winter you're helping to support the economy of helper rebuilt\nAnd then over in northeastern Florida or one of my favorites bosses Merritt Island National Wildlife refuge and one thing about that is that it's a great shape if you're visiting like Disney World or some of the other tourist attractions around Orlando with family and we want to get away for bird watching Merritt Island is very close\nSo that gives you something to do there I saw some last year I went to a Muslim Mexico for the show and on the plane with me were a group of voters heading off or their annual trip and that gave me a real idea on how big this industry is\nAbout five years ago I was staying at a hotel in South central Iceland hotel ranking HeLa Iceland\nI when I woke up one morning I still on the balcony I was looking out the volcano I noticed this white creature sitting on a kind of a small town and the contrast stock to me because the whole rest of the year he was moss Iraqi with some grass in the stream it turned out to be a snow I'll\nTell you that wing span so surprised me was huge it was such a truly beautiful creatures see flying can I mean I that's my experience so what's your favorite burning experience\nWith a thousand favorite sure you're doing says but I always feel like my favorite is the next one are just so many possibilities out there I mean it's betting things\nIn my backyard and all but especially just traveling around the U.S there's so many opportunities I guess one of my favorites is you're seeing a big concentration of bald eagles are up on the edge of Lake Erie being able to see\nSome of the birds the ones that you know one bald eagle is my guess is that when you get a group\nOf that group will can listen I Am going to be real curious to see what kind of reaction we get from our audience with regards to today's discussion on burning it certainly is you know popular thing for travelers so we'll look forward to staying in touch with even having your back in the future okay so I have a nice day\nOkay fine I'll look forward to thank you can\nAlready such a nice man interest in Seventeen bald eagles to see them now I cannot and must be seen as one of the greed greed and we should let us know what you think about that\nOne of the courage to know more about the clock ticks down that's going to wrap things for this week connect with them any time on Twitter and LinkedIn Instagram and Facebook and more and world travel\nSpecial thanks to all of our

with a hammer is obviously not a good option because the screens have different type of chemicals and\nI'm ... and it's on there that are not very environmentally friendly right not to mention the fact that my slice your finger open while trying to do something like that phrase by your best bet\nYeah I mean your best bet if your phone's not operational and you know you've got data on there as you get a ticket to the one of the manufacture warranty repair type centers I get a fix for you to get at the turn on 'em and then they raise the data and then traded in or take it to a reputable certified recycle that will actually physically ill mother buys\nProperly pulled the drive out and destroy it will give you a certificate of destruction so you know it was properly destroyed and done the right fashioned\nYeah great advice thank you so going back to what you said earlier about smartphones and tablets I heard the same thing that you have and all the experts I talked to say that any phone over the last couple of years say twenty Fifteen and newer\nHas encryption built in which means you can use the factory data setting and the factory erase setting and it should be just fine to a white that data clean properly prior to twenty Fifteen or or so you would maybe opt for a third party tool that would go through you know comb through all those zeroes and ones on that drive to\nReally ensure that nobody can access it who's tech savvy\nBut if it's a computer it's a different story altogether there still tools that is recommended to download and\nScrub that hard drive ... which in some cases makes it inoperable before you you traded in er donated any thoughts on that or are there any third party tools you you want to recommend I've I've heard a couple of one's called Phoebe I'll data shredder but there's a few out there\nYeah the the industry leader in our space that Lisa the product called Blago they also bought a product called ... years ago which they both new cars a kind of an Internet free rather pretty popular to use\nOut there I remember the bottom line is don't just delete your files and thinking it's gone don't even just go to the recycling benefits a windows computer or a Mac and think it's gone there\nYou need to properly get rid of that data before you considered trading it in so good advice were chatting with ... he is the vice president of

O T a product that works with an antenna that you purchase separately but it does have a four K. DVR and of course TiVo software\nAnd for the break tad we were talking about some of the voice enabled features of this product\nGrade okay TiVo also provide support for Alexa devices as you said what elections what Amazon calls a video skill\nSo if you go into your Alexei app on your phone or your tablet and you go to a Lexus skills there's a TiVo skill that you enable\nWhich is free at no cost to Alexa users and you've been able to TiVo skill\nAnd then you pair it with a team of boxing your home and then whenever you want to make a channel changed command you can say Alexa watched NBC or Alexa bring up the channel guide\nOr a lecture to skip commercials so just using your voice and an Amazon device you can control a lot of the basic functions of the bowl do see a\nThere was a couple of ways that you are integrating voice into the ... and then finally Ted how much does it cost what do you predict people can save over the long term by leaving the cable company out of the equation and work we learn more about this product\nGrade okay so the the retail price for\nA ... a TA is two hundred and forty nine dollars and Ninety nine cents and that's for the one terabytes for tuna herbal tea I that I've been describing and then there is a subscription fee to the TiVo service and all explain in a minute where you get from the tea is served as\nThe TiVo service is an additional six dollars and Ninety nine cents a month\nOr sixty nine dollars and Ninety nine cents for a one year subscription [noise] um some people who really would rather not pay for a recurring subscription fee will choose what TiVo called the all in plan\nWhich is two hundred and forty nine dollars and Ninety nine cents as well so you can think of that as kind of a one time up front the service payment and then there's no future recurring fees\nOkay got it and the antenna is sold separately just to clarify your on your own for that but they're not too expensive\nAntenna is sold separately and we recommend that consumers go to antenna Web dot org that is a wonderful website that you can punch in your own address and it will help you determine whether you need 'em a small antenna or a large antenna\nWhether it possibly needs to be directional those kinds of things so it's a it's a really good tool to understand because not everybody needs the same type of antenna I also promised to you I Would tell you what a consumer gets with the TiVo service fee there's several things that TiVo offers as part of our service\nThat are not available from anybody else and and these unique features and services that we run\nOur part of the reason why we charges service fee so in addition to things like program guide data and software updates and the the kinds of things you would expect from any connected device on TiVo also delivers commercials skip tags\nWhich are delivered directly to the ... box um over broadband connection from the service and so when you're watching a recorded program there is a accompanying button on the table remote the just labeled skip\nAnd you press the skip button whenever you get to a commercial break and we'll jumpy right to the end of the commercial and start playing your programming again so that feature and is much more advanced than a lot of what other people do where you have to fast forward and then watch for\nThe end of the commercial break and then maybe back up a little bit um we take all the\nAll the mess out of it and just have this one button skip function we also have a teacher we called quick mode\nWhich allows you to watch a maybe a slow program that might be say a a golf match or a soccer match something where maybe the actions a little bit slower\nWe speed it up by thirty percent so that you can watch the program a little bit faster\nKind of like listening to a pod cast and you know one and a half times speed\nBut we adjust to the audio so that it's not it doesn't make everybody sound like they're all pitch shifted and they sound like raccoons so our our feature takes care of that we also offer a continuous care warranty along with our monthly an annual service\nAnd for the for the length of the time that you own your TiVo bolo TA if there's any sort of failure whether it's a hardware failure or hard drive crash\nWe will repair your TiVo box for forty\nIn dollars and that is an ongoing service think of it as a as an extended warranty then make sure that your devices continues to function\nAs we understand that these devices are investment for customers and that we want to make sure that it stays functioning for them so this continuous care warranty allows them to have access to that in forty nine dollar repair iffy\nOn so we feel like when you look at a lot of the a lot of the advance features and and services we provide people will understand why we charge six dollars and Ninety nine cents among\nHow much says TiVo estimate customers will save over a period of time\nSo for for somebody who has made the decision to cut the cord from cable and go to antenna we estimate that the average consumer would save about eight hundred dollars over a three year period by reducing their cable fees\nWhile yeah I've read that in the press release so I wanted to ask you about that that's a that's a significant number and what's the best website to learn more about ...

Campbell you have to go back a year and a half to find a game where they've lost by more than ten points and you remember those last few years under ... who was a wonderful guy but there were a clown show at times I mean there was a wide open patches of grass where people were running there at least now in the right spot they seem to know what they're doing they appear to be very well coached this isn't the Iowa State of old\nYou know it's not and and also with broad pretty and what ... what ... what rock pretty siblings or could it was a map gamble he uh was that this atmosphere young guys young coaches is not just about competing it's about winning about trying to compete for conference championships so he's really trying to ban the curb their names\nAnd I think he's making progress that way you know I I keep going back to that again in Morgantown and I think you can tell a lot about\nA program with the way they accept or don't accept losing and and that was stuck out to make I spend a lot of time with ... down in Dallas in July and obviously it might have been off or not since he might not be able to apply today but he kept going back to that gain a sort of\nUm the ones that stuck out from last season now every other human being in the world would have said hey how about that when it Oklahoma but for these guys it was what they let get away that day in Morgantown and really hurt him so I think that's going to provide an energy to their sideline ah you know on a day when the stadium's gonna already buddy\nYou know Alan's where metro new sports follow along with his blog during the game at W.

that [laughter] that's right 'cause ... through the traffic\nBig fall festivals that what did you think when you had to play a team that had a running quarterback what was your concern is a line backer\nWell you you're typically churches do agree and I have the privilege them really excited about church semi being here haven't have you ever since in the room but you do a great job practicing that all week long and I'm sure give me and his staff has done just that you're going to be prepared for the extra element\nUh anytime you can get a tax on my quarterback get your ... more jacked up mostly in tonight's environment is going to be a big game of special game tonight for a moment\nBut how specifically do you adjust to the running quarterback when you're when you're coming on obligatory or are you looking someplace different are you not as aggressive because you're watching for him to take off exactly how's that show up in a game time situation\nWell that depends on the down down and distance what are we doing especially on third and we've we've done a good job or getting athletes on the field and unfortunately towards the end of my brain to pull me also\nFilled out there [laughter] I Wonder what what what what did you do it [laughter] you run one place too long [laughter] so so that's what I asked when it's on the field allow them to\nGo chase with the big ends up front and get him out of the getting around the park and we'll go to balance ask us\nYou know exactly what's going to happen to you will see a concert down because there there are just terrible and third down there like thirty four percent yeah I mean ...\nBut some ... here's the problem with look because we love to look at the statue is the problem with just as you were about to point out to see that a hundred nineteenth are in office in the country is that I don't think they're as relevant as they normally are because that's perfect or what friends but the trend may have changed dramatically last week when they switch quarterbacks\nYeah they were in a while there's no question they had camp for the first game he gets injured that no one was in and backed down purdie yeah so they've just got guys all they will get three different guy so it's really three different officers under those quarterback\nWhich really changes the Montgomery is not the right now all of a sudden those third downs aren't third one and two now there is ... you know so so when when ... run the ball they had a whole bunch of short yard ... which makes it a lot easier to get the first to\nKeep an eye on Montgomery tonight to there'd been very tight lipped about whether he's available or not you're starting to hear some late noise that he may be ready to\nGo to these guys are good games again was ... years went on them and\nThey're kind of in a quandary right now ... camp is definitely a non runner pocket passer as opposed per day which is a complete opposite now in my feeling is if Montgomery is not playing you won't see Kim 'cause you have no any game then\nOkay so you're saying if even if camp is ready to go you stay with her to either go to Luke and runs his\nAbility to run
