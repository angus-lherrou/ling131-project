ready I have a minor addiction is is already completed\nAnd I have talked to the powers that be are snacks will be prepared you know the oh good learning bringing smacks for the game wow you know what works on week nights that the point [laughter]\nThe replay or and so what's happening in the news has gone on\nThe metro news dot com or lead story is with Governor justice he had a press or today Dave and it was is always like a one on one interview with Brad Michael handy because no other reporters\nFor some reason weren't there there was some TV photographers who in their kind of reporters that you know they ask them questions\nBut Brad was there and bread basically asked the governor every question so there were several issues that were talked about one is on this ... settlements ... kind of become a kind of a a hot potato political issue in the last couple of days where senator mansion\nAh you know saying that the governor gesture should stop any settlement uh that's going to be you know thirty five million dollars and the governor kind of said today listen I'm I Know there are talks happening we're just trying to work on a fair settlement also Patrick Morrisey\nOr the state attorney general who is recused himself from the ... who was matches opponent in the election he was on TALK line today he weighed in we've got comments from that she can read that at the website and day a week from tonight is the big debate on metro news uh between mansion and Morsi on the metro news channel that should really be fire\nI think it will be yeah yeah I think definitely it will be

the hiring of about three hundred a coal miners\nA semi McDowell county others in\nRight across the line in Virginia and a few in Kentucky and some in Kentucky\nAnd these are some surface mine project that will lessen the blow day maybe maybe some of these folks that worked at the Pentagon ... can can cross over and get some jobs there so that might help lessen the blow also we have an update on the wheel in Charleston die sees a story reported yesterday\nAbout they're going to release a list of names of these priests and other ministers\nFrom Nineteen fifty had these credible a allegations that were that were leveled against them a and a dicey said today the new information is that they hope to release the list by November thirtieth\nSo we have that story to also interesting story from that governors press comes really what the press conference call for is about this company called ... group and they are and they're kind of like I'm kind of like the backbone Internet folks people I mean it's it's\nYou know they they are are they are in a service provider they're the ones that you know put the Internet in the ground that service providers can tap into their their company that has been successful they're putting a line am from Columbus to Ashburn, Virginia and so they're going to go across West Virginia they announce today about two hundred mile project in West

court or age I'm Sorry and they're working with the state on that\nAnd so that should help it's should help Internet situation we have ... service providers will have another option where they can tap into in some\nOf these you know just as this was really a big problem for us it I mean David here's the thing I mean when you take a look at some places in the United states there are so many more people who live there it's it's so much more profitable for service providers to be in those regions\nYou know West Virginia or terrain a broadband service for everybody continues to be a real problem with our state\nI think that's I think it's one of the key to the state's future they cause you more and more see\nHow if if ... I think that our population could increase if you could get it everywhere sure because people would move to West Virginia for the beauty they would and and kind of the isolation in some for something not everybody wants to do that but some people would if they could run their businesses on line and do it anywhere in the state\nHere's the thing also how many people would relocate to West Virginia

you've got lots that are normally open for tailgating\nA much earlier in the day not going to be opening until five pm because of of of the time of the game and the fact that it's a weeknight there's

E. K. L. E. Y. let's get Kevin ... here from the blue gold news dot com to talk a little bit about tonight's game how you doing Kevin\nI'm doing great there'll be a beautiful ... pro football I think real football weather\nYeah how 'bout that where are you are you are in traffic you boarded the traffic or where are you\nOh definitely avoid the traffic and a happy for the stadium right now\nThere you go there you go well listen I read your chalkboard feature a blue gold news dot com today and you brought up a lot of really interesting points about this game\nAh the first I Want to talk a little bit about Baylor and one of the things you talked about was that Baylor will throw the ball to their running backs and that's something that West Virginia really\nHasn't seen too much of a so far this season\nYeah that's something that I think that rule brought with him some from temple and it's a little bit and then the big twelve but not a lot just because there's so many good wide receivers but they're going to swing it out there and that puts pressure you know a little bit on West Virginia's linebackers definitely on the first day that the federal part what the coverage is are\nYou know that you might just kind of forget that thing or get lost to it it's not an assignment that you have a ton of or the ... get out in the pattern a lot so interested to see how West Virginia might handle that Baylor tries to attack the agents that way you\nKnow ever since mad rule came over to Baylor from temple one of the things he also brought was the running game or at least they try to establish or when the game but that really didn't happen against Texas I mean you take away the the twenty some yards the Charlie brewer the quarterback had rush into football their backs only combined to like sixty some yards on the ground\nAnd yeah they made a good adaptation and have to give credit for that he's not trying to do the square peg round whole thing and for what he has been used to quit his history is on to Baylor he's been able to adapt that\nThey're throwing the ball around but they still it's a controlled passing game you know in some respects because\nYou know they control the oil wealth they have a pretty big advantage in combat possession\nSome of that might be due to the the it it does give up a lot of big place so opponents of scored some but they're still able to fashion drives once they get it going it's\nYou know it's kind of hard to pin him down to put a cell phone what exactly are but you know our power Russia game is definitely not want to\nYou know reading the stuff that you wrote or maybe going hunter wrote this I'm not sure but I couldn't believe this when I first saw this when you think about West Virginia's off in you know you think about romp in in stopping in lots of points in lots of yours is it really true that West Virginia's only had to Russia's over twenty six yards this year\nThat's true and I don't believe me\nYeah at seven only seven Russia's a twenty year or ... yards and now granted you don't want to try to feed the running game it's totally just because given the all the talent that exist in the past the game But West Virginia's pass ratio is right at fifty percent\nAnd they just haven't got those breakout play I think so because they had been more cautious or in a more guys deeper down the field so there's you know kind of that second level wall shield that prevents the run\nWhich it like to think that you'd pop a few here there especially gets let's face it when you just get that same right so you know that's something that I think that\nFor us where did you get a seriously challenged with big twelve title that's got to change a little bit they got to get a few breakout flights on the ground\nAll right so what do you expect who do you expect to see playing on the bench for West Virginia tonight Dylan's hungry does he come back to the ... going to be out who tell me a little bit about the ... who you expect to see their uh defensively for West Virginia tonight\nYeah concrete if the if they weren't going to wait say it could be a thing where he comes out\nWarms up or sees what do you feel like I was you know it's just a total no go I I can say if it's like half of it the fact that you would have thought you would have said at the start of the year when he was he didn't have six guys\nThat would have either been started or played really significant roles that you know either have a play this year or out in our work out last week that's just ...\nAnd to me that speaks more credit that Tony ... and what he's been able to do shuffling God's around\nBut you know I think that's the one question that the shake Campbell and the federal ... other than that in er Giovanni a longer mailed out they're going to go with three quarterbacks to get\nA you know without direct pets I moved up and it it just makes it there's just not a lot of bodies left or maybe the amount they live that gets a little bit of time at one of the safety spots that are going to turn it gives a joke about that that list of the starters or that he said you know they're to me it back up\nSo [laughter] you know it definitely got to be an argument that night\nYou know every team ... you're the every team in the big twelve in big twelve conference play has thrown for over two hundred yards against West Virginia secondary to this point what about Charlie Bird as he get over two hundred yards tonight [noise]\nYou know I Would think so I mean part of ... into the fence is not give up the big play keep things from Abbott there's gonna be a path of complete it just can restrict together seven or eight of those inner drive without making a mistake without a drop that West Virginia forest and turn it over\n... you know it really is a different game from what we grew up with where you work on some a lot about yards I mean sure you don't want to give up\nI think the let the grown up and down the field but it's all about points out things that feel go now you know the yard it's thing is just not a big thing that they are concerned with because frankly they all give up a lot\nYou know I was hoping that that will ... bounces back tonight in this looks like almost the perfect set up for him to do that a Baylor is is dead last in the big twelve in point so loud\nThey're given up over four hundred yards the game in total often sacks have been a problem for a career in the last two uh two two and a half games actually Baylor's even got no sacks last week against Texas on the road I mean the set up is there for him to play well\nIt is and I think it's important for him to get off to a good start\nAre kind of just getting the rhythm a little bit get out of its own way and now that I think that that's a huge problem for him but it's kind of get the rhythm bag or just kind of get back to doing the things that they've done well all year\nAnd it's it's one of those things I think sometimes you get on a little bit of a downward spiral down hillsides that you're almost got to hit bottom a little bit before you start clawing their way back ... it out maybe I maybe I think that that might be the situation for the\nYou know ... finally Kevin let me just ask you about about Baylor the their program I mean there's been so much controversy about the bears in recent years are browse et cetera\nI mean they roll in their foreign three and after they played a night they still play they host Oklahoma State they'll host TCU they'll host Texas Tech I mean three of the next four games there last for regular season games or at home I mean this is a team that could go to a ball game right it's a bullet worthy team\nOh sure and I think they're looking at tonight at steel and wanted to set up really well I think Texas Tech condos on that same work I think they're going back but you with the personnel office is obviously they have this week I've definitely get a bowl and Oklahoma State kind of a mystery so\nShort they they've got to be looking at it I have to give our best shot out of the earth or with their great shape but they still got a chance to get that six when\nThey finally or how do you feel about these mid week games not crazy about him [laughter] I you know I mean yeah\nYou're the only team on that I guess that counts for something and it's a night game but you're not the same atmosphere you know there's more traffic lined up going out of town that come in and right now while people are trying to get out of the way you know there's no tailgating atmosphere because the large majority locks on her foot five o'clock\nA you know it's really a computer game get in to come to the gay but go home and now that that made the atmosphere in the state you can't be great\nYou know people will have to jump into that section get fired up that they like that but as far as the whole college they call it the atmosphere it happen all the way\nGame to JD Martinez to run single to write gave the red Sox for to lead over the Dodgers last night they went on to win that game and take it to games than an series lead over LA area [noise]\nThere's a Thomas

done lab joined us along with that one day when gray color but let's take a macro up here about what this is all about this ...\nWell just like it's massive quite frankly it's massive given what this team had for its expectations in terms of making a run at the big twelve title to trip up against an Iowa State team that I think we all agree is improving their wealth coach they had a great game plan last week\nBut that's a game if you're West Virginia nearly you go on the road and you find a win win you know not only did you lose you completely self destruct at all federally again give credit to Iowa State\nBut you have one of the best quarterback in the country you have the best receiver grew up in this league you should have been able to manufacture something even if it was a loss do something off that's at least up to me that's what I'm watching tonight as one two and three does this all bench rebound and get back on track\nJust the fact that Purdue really rolled over Ohio State at Purdue mitigate what happened in West Virginia Iowa State game at all\nI think nationally it does because Dana's pitch is hey college football's chaotic it's hard to win and he's right in that regard and Purdue showed that against an elite Ohio State team or what you thought was an elite Ohio State team it was almost the same scenario wasn't it yeah on the road that highly ranked against the team that had a great\nGame plan was ready to go from an atmosphere standpoint so yeah it mitigate a little bit but that doesn't change the fact that West Virginia has to get back on its course quickly in this what\nThat Ohio State game did was put the war in a little bigger perspective as to what can happen week to week that it doesn't just happen to West Virginia that happens to other teams\nBut then you say okay it happened and now what yeah and did you fix it did you fix the problems that showed up in Maine yeah in West Virginia has so many problems all sense of where you in that game and limited possessions couldn't run the ball and I think that running the ball you know so much emphasis is on how will Greer struggled in that ball game\nBut when and we'll talk about this and the next two hours but when it's West Virginia going to get that run game going because here's a Baylor team you know what they can't stop the run\nYeah ... ... and maybe West Virginia can't read it I mean that's one of the questions you have tonight is this is all pension line ready to create some cool but they better pass on to your better gets his receiver group and will were what am I wanted to pass block\nYou wonder what you want to do it while you're in a league team do it all okay All right ...\nThanks Brett how and also what chemicals on traffic or we're going to break away

play next week how do you get back\nIt's making a play you know we have heard over and over about getting back to the basics and doing things that are are going to put you back to square one but you said all that aside as a player you want to come out and you want to make a play that's going to be the biggest sport to the office to the defense and it has to happen early because the last thing that you want\nTo get back into that same position or at your week or two weeks before and and you say here we go again the other team is starting to make a run on you you haven't found that spark so offensively defensively special teams someone needs to make a play to pick the energy up on the team and that's supposed to what's going to do it\nIf you're going to have you agree make a play early\nWell they're not good we only doesn't that limiting the biggest problem and all these options is nowadays is the fact that you have to spend the past the game to win\nYou know all the great teams in the past debate Miami teams that are ... for sure this year is balance when you're fifty fifty in certain groupings information and you don't know is going to be a runner bash the advantage goes to his office no doubt\nWe're going to spend a bunch of time here getting down in the weeds real scenarios we're going to talk about strategy where I talk about often Sandy I this this to me as a macro type of game this is a gut check time for this program this team\nThis coaching staff that was such a debacle in Ames what can this group get back together or they done where they okay and can they move on to a de facto elimination game next week against Texas so while the excellent those are big and important tonight this to me it's got check this program ready to get back on its feet\nYou can use tonight yeah there are a handful of games including the mountaineers inaction the Appalachian State mountaineer\nAround law at all I did there yeah got us on their rate for the first time since we haven't lost in about three years\nWell they're actually they lost the Penn State and over time this year but that only law or they won't bother oh since then and if you're under the sun belt\nThis is a pretty good game to the Appalachian State against Georgia southern arrival regain it sure is and both teams are three into an sunbelt conference play but again Appalachian State rights for the first time since moving to the division one level and that only last saw on the road and overtime\nTo Penn State that's not all tonight you've got an ACC game Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech both teams having disappointing seasons Virginia Tech start of the year ranked in the top Fifteen but they've struggled defensively particularly with the past the fence that shouldn't come into play than I'd be all Georgia Tech does is run the football\nCan you imagine if you're a junior tech and you're struggling you got it all started quite Georgia to shake rattle option coming at ya nightmare and you play it once a year Jordan just\nUh they're struggling just one in three an ACC place so it's been a little bit of a disappointing to see\nThe good say yellow jackets nobody's going to watch that game you think everybody's watching Baylor West Virginia yeah because they're because they're going to be some August I'm not going to happen\nWe'd gotten match and tonight as well Ball State and Ohio University out of the ... that game in Athens and Ohio with a winning record foreign three two and one in the league and also from the mid America conference you've got a western Michigan who was on beaten in Lake Placid ...\nThey wouldn't like five in a row haven't they are yes yeah as ... as I said\nYou're calling for double titans already you're broke down the ... and you broke down the sun belt rivalries you are on fire you came to play tonight\nIs only five games I can follow that when it when there's when there's thirty five forty games that's when I get I get down in the sun belt though that's impressive I Know you know I came up getting ready I didn't I didn't you know this week I got back to the basics [laughter]\nThat's good to see what you did there to [laughter]\nWe'll keep an eye on all of these games tonight is uh the evening moves along and that's the MVP back scoreboard envy back your most valuable bankers their website and it'd be backing dot com number up yeah I said\nWell I think in correctional you're gonna have to go it a little bit to counter the Appalachian State network there to give your breaks\nOut of that [laughter] yeah well that led to the state I mean they've been red hot during the top forty five ... ... ... what's that game up tonight and not the Virginia tech and\nNow we have we have room for all of it will put 'em all up there really yeah we get them all in okay [noise]\nI'm In charge of all would be a sports outcome having them be twelve companies update when they WVU medicines for its front page news\nI'm Becky separately and I'm running for reelection to Charleston city council as an at large Kansas\nAs inexperienced later I won't work to keep our city neighborhoods safe are street maintained and clean support our local and promote beautiful city we call home I Would appreciate your vote on November ... separately\nCharleston city council that large his dad paid for by the committee to elect separately Charles Blow treasure\nWe're back with another episode of typical politician starring state senator ed\nWhich is ten so the production has dropped off big time you look at those first three games and\nThey've been able to put together for games and those last three has just been\nA sort of mediocre in terms of second half play so uh one of the things that we talked about coming out trying to start fast West Virginia seems to in the last three weeks to be able to come out and put their best product out on the field in that first half so I think that's another reason to come out of really start fast and just try to get your best product out there give some points on the board\nYou know we were talking about this that and wish you had it there is that you think of West Virginia this big passing game how about this to West Virginia wide receivers have thirty four receptions and the second half was it was it thirty four perceptions of secondhand\nSurprising in that Steve I Want to ask you this because you go back to those numbers that were she'd send one of the common trends is pressure by the defense Texas Tech change there's didn't change or skiing but change their approach and the second half brought more pressure Kansas surprisingly did a pretty good job at applying pressure we know what I Wish they did\nIs they start with the offensive line for West Virginia\nPart but partly in in in the same West Virginia likes to do they have like to get five watch that all the time being they like to release the Dell back which means is five men protection all the time\nAnd and if six guys come than they have to do it ... which means they hit the quarterback has to get rid of it say an outside Russia he he sees income he has to get rid of the ball\nAnd and then then involves receivers adjusting seeing them turning the maybe a post Robyn do quick slant and so on and so it was a lot of moving parts and they didn't always on the offensive line\nBecause I think the thing about the second half an officer's divorce our ability to just you know what I mean 'cause everybody's won't come in the game doing something you haven't expected so so sometimes coaches get limited for what they can do cause inexperienced players or injured players playing\nYou know and ... they're not used to and so and so forth so you're only as good as your as your as your worst guy so lots of times you ability to just either by coaches or your players ability to adjust is critical in the second half to ... says what\nWould you ask which would you admit or would you concede or agree that West Virginia offensive was simply did not just in the second half against Iowa State\nWhy don't I don't think you can debate that I mean you can just watch the game again and there were no adjustments there were no changes as Steve mentioned receivers have to adjust their route there was no adjustment there there wasn't any attempt to try different things in the second half in particular ...\nWhen does a debacle everything goes wrong I mean receivers didn't do what they are supposed to and then all of a sudden there's a holding call but often salon or ... or officers taco gets beat or somebody missed a block of the quarterback holds the ball to long trying to make a play with three those socks uh last Saturday was totally on the quarterback\nI think you made a good point 'cause done a lot but at the same time these guys are not an experience you hear these coaches talk about uh uh the the leadership that they have the upper class men are able to pick up on what they're trying to coach and what they're trying to teach\nSo that is just it falls onto the coaching staff in terms of adjustment we've seen all year ... slots you get it out so everyone's on the same page is just a matter of getting out over to your players and have it would actually that another discussion\nDown the road I Want to talk about how maybe the size of caught up with the spread off and\nSay okay we'll talk
