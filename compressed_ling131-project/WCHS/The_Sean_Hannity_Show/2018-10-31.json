terms of early voting yes I mean do we have any trends do we know anything that we have any polling about who shows up to vote early where they tend to go\nWell you know it is what we're seeing is that the numbers for most counties are above what they usually are on an off year election\nThe general election in the off year usually doesn't get a very big turnout so there's been good now what we're trying to gauge and it may be impossible to gauge are these people just voting because\nWould this be an indication is what I'm trying to say of next Tuesday's voter turnout mhm because there's been a really good turnout or voting or is it because these are the most anxious people were the most people that want to get it done or like early voting recombination\nThat was going to be my question so that if you go early you're obviously more engaged yeah so what does that really mean yeah I mean does it mean that you're voting down the line with the president or you're not going ah

before it takes over command there Andy field ABC News Washington at the clothes on Wall street the Dow is up two hundred and forty two points NASDAQ out by a hundred and\nForty four positive finished after what had been a pretty bad month for stocks you're listening to ABC News\nHey guys can hear from the hip typecast today's growth who would win at three mile bicycle racing eleven year old girl or last year's winner the Tour de France\nIt all depends on the bicycle it depends on their vehicle both in a ten speed in the ... going to win every time but but the race run a trace Ikle and the eleven year old wins every time you see it's not the driver it's the vehicle when it comes to generating revenue it's exactly the same if you have a job or a small business you are writing a tricycle\nThere you go there you go so you know before we get into the stories how did you get to see that from Orangeburg how'd that work\nWith along secured its route I spent about nine years at National Geographic so that's a DC and that far from ...\nAnd at the time I really wanted to find something else to do after nine years\nAt that time there was a um story in life magazine remember that one yeah and it showed this photograph of things people standing on a rooftop in this place they were calling Silicon Valley those people now I now realize included Steve Jobs than others\nAnd it looked like this was the land of opportunity so I came out I took five weeks off work came out here and got a job in three found a place to live and moved out here\nYeah that that's worked out you know I was I was talking to somebody about this on the air last week that twenty five years ago if you're a writer about tax that was probably one of the most boring things doing you know oh you'd be just talking about\nComputers in in in building computers now there's virtually checking everything is probably one of the most interesting fields of journalism to being\nWell and I would actually say I was I found life pretty interesting twenty five years ago too so I Would disagree with you on that aspect okay\nBut you are always looking at different ways in which at that point it was a lot newer\nHow it with potentially going to change what we do and how we live now as you say it is everywhere so the issue is to look at everything around us and describe it in a way of of how our lives are being changed and impacted for the better and for the worst because of that tech on it\nYou know couple of stories on to talk to you about we've um obviously got the midterms less than a week away really interesting article at seeing at about ... new voting systems that are coming but paper ballots making a comeback\nTo think about that let's think back to to the way back machine of two thousand when the infamous hanging chads pretty much kept the whole election hanging as a as a way remember that was in Florida ... used to a punch card and if you didn't punch the cart all the way through\nAnd some of the paper with hanging through\nWhich we now have a team does Chad's then those votes weren't counted and this was an incredibly tight presidential election really it came down to fewer than six hundred votes in Florida determine the election and two thousand\nWell that was such that back on that five states at least decided they were going to go through purely digital and a lot of states beyond that maybe not going purely digital that relies tape it was bad lettuce swing the pendulum the other way where the problem I swing all the way to just digital is there's no audit trail\nAnd software frankly can be manipulated remotely\nIt can be a that determined hackers can be in the same room as the voting booth that's a little less likely but they're also ways in which you can remotely take control over something\nAnd sometimes software kind of goes haywire and change votes without necessarily any ill will it's just one of those things [laughter] they've got you might say\nYou know one of the things about this during their really found interesting that so there are five states Delaware Georgia Louisiana Jersey in South Carolina that rely solely on voting machines with no paper records now for those states\nHave ... ... if you vote electronically they will spit out some sort of a hard copy record of the vote all of those things do that except Georgia in Georgia wants that ability to\nWell they're getting ready to it's not going to be in time for the ... right they certainly want this are in place by the um twenty twenty elections because really what we've seen is that it is possible to manipulate result\nUm whether that's opinion or voting machines we can't get used to be that everything that we looked at what tech tech was the end a and B we trusted it simplicity and focus\nTo try that in English and that may be more than what you were saying about how tech reporting to be boring now what's different is that we have a healthy skepticism of the role of tech in our lives and that's really what's going on here with machines as well and I think it is a good thing to have that healthy skepticism\nOne more story one to talk about what to uh uh Rochelle garner of being at the end you know what I'm really glad that you guys have a story about this 'cause those kind of wondering about this crypto currency bitcoin\nThe the strain that it puts on the electronic grid I wondered about that until I read the story I had no idea how big it was\nWell in fact it is fascinating is it just as a little bit of background there in order to do any kind of kept a currency based on what we call block chain is the underlying technology you have to have thousands of computers\nThat are basically confirming that transaction is in fact correct and you do that that make sure that you can trust that transaction because it's been verified by thousands of computers\nTo think about what that does in terms of the electricity that it determines there is a um a\nConsulting group called digit communist and they estimate that one year of the coin mining it's the same as using a enough electricity to power six million US household\nFor one year that's insane it hasn't seen\nAnd what the researchers at the University of Hawaii ... found that it is\nThe demand for bitcoin rises like demand for other technologies saving it has the same same um trajectory of ah people wanted to use this\nThen by the next few years there could be so much carbon foot that from the electricity use that the earth warmed by two degrees Celsius\nThat's enough for air reversible climate change what have you scared yet\nYou got your gummy scared a little bit here and here's the thing also about crypto currency is we know that they're coming now the bitcoin a market has collapsed at least for the moment but this is definitely an area we're moving into\nIt is and the thing about when we talk about crypto currency is the underlying technology block chain is being used for a lot of different things not just crypto currency it's being used to make sure that the item that supposedly\nGot into the trailer in China made it safely without any kind of manipulation or theft by the time it reaches New Jersey every ... every step along the trans ... transaction is actually confirmed by block chain so it's not just money\nAnd it is in fact really potential way that even verify votes that's how widespread the potential use of slouching technology could be but the more that we accept it and more that we use it the more that we're going to be using the electric grid\nYou know we love to have a huge here on the show to talk about tech we do this every Wednesday in the work like our Rochelle you're more than welcome to come on anytime you want to know you got

it\nLike for example a ... where are you going to school and I told us I don't know how does it know that this is a side at school you know I I'm not into society yet\nAnd say well\nWhat a coach Joe and some say a coach also ran all the other guy Andrew said earlier is going to mess up you I was packing up getting ready to leave\n[laughter] hey you know what I was reading a story about you earlier today you know growing up you would desegregated school you went to West Virginia said a historically black institution you're quoted as saying that you really didn't have a conversation with a white man\nBetween kindergarten in your high school junior college graduation is that really true\nIt's true that is amazing it's true\nTell me a little bit about that that you had it at state when you were ... more than one thirty three you know\nReally unique out of it is it's a yeah I I'm I'm Eighteen years old and these guys are coming back from World war two I had actually actually I Want

always told me years ago his is always always show real best because you never know who's watching you\nAnd it was a scholar to me I didn't I didn't know where you're a ... scout it\nWell speaking of scouting let let's talk a little bit about the draft story the the ... program is WC Jesse in Charleston and I was reading the story about you earlier today where you do you um\nThe way you found out that you were drafted in the NBA was one of your classmates who heard the story on the radio report is that accurate\nThat's very accurate ... tell me about that well you know it it it's have you ever been to other states campus yeah absolutely\nYou cannot isolate it you know you got good you got the mountains and then you got ... river and you know who we were like what a huge family not going to say that without any confirmation man ever it's I'll walk\nAcross the capital and this little girl says no that was my nickname was school\nShe said no no I just heard some team in Washington called the Washington Capitals they're going to draft you know I said no I I'm not kidding you know I'm telling her I was I'm not kidding you I don't know anything about it\nAnd all I Know is me in a classmate Bob also great play the globetrotters invited us for a week to see how we liked it and\nThe man I mean they used to play like rivers seven games in six days that kind of stuff you know\nSo often uh but I was like oh like one on the way for not playing basketball because baseball ... really I didn't know that\nYeah and the Pittsburgh Pirates\nWith Scott up near previously as the as the

all over ... all over the country are you a ... it's coming from a A R U the state of Washington yeah ...\nThat that's awesome uh he has so much respect for you hate or one of the things that I don't think people really know about your story is that you were drafted by Washington\nBut I mean that franchise molded you were in the army for awhile did you think you'd be able to get back into the NBA game I'm Sorry go ahead\nI was gonna say you know you were in the army after that experience with Washington before you joined the Syracuse Nat I mean did you have a question on whether or not you're

playing a power five schedule whether they're in a conference or not who's undefeated and have them write I'm\nA above a team of lost my big takeaway was\nThey talked about rewarding LSU for beating a six teams with the uh five hundred or better record yeah then I Want to know why you're rewarding UCF by ranking them at twelve for not playing a single team with a five hundred record\nI don't see how you can have them ranked about some of these power five ... teams that only have one last in conference to a power five team with a winning record say WVU how they're Thirteen and right behind I I had WB what eleven in my whole ah that I made for myself so I thought Thirteen was a little bit low but you know\nThat last Iowa State was bad they didn't just lose they got beat and it was pretty pathetic\nWell as far as the nights are concerned UCF I mean you can say that last year doesn't matter but it clearly does yeah and you know literally does\nAn I ... in the weird thing about these polls is there's a human element to it and then it matters right now all that really matters is that final poll and you know we've had teams that how many years that weren't\nAnd those final four maybe even in the ... and the and the top six sneak in on that last fall because of losses here or there Alabama with not even playing in a conference title game you know getting in last year\nUm you know I think WVU as as mentioned just a little bit low I think they got the top four right though I just wonder if there's something to this you know the the team that's been number three in the initial ranking has yet to make the college football playoff\nI see LSU losing this gained Alabama not getting into their conference championship game because of that and essentially missing the play offs\nAnd their number three right now I'm Wondering if what what Scott audio\nWell okay a couple of things about this first of all you know I I\nLSU Notre Dame it really doesn't matter it's just the first week I mean I take a look at the teams that\nThat LSU has beaten ... you know you can make a very good case that they deserve to be up there and I mean you know Notre Dame\nIf Notre Dame goes undefeated\nBut until the Virginia tech last last week think about this and in southern Cal lost to the potential was there at the end of the year for Notre Dame to have wins against\nThe champions of three of the power five yeah Michigan Virginia Tech and southern Cal yeah um that's impressive ... Bradley\nTheir schedule every single year is unbelievable Notre Dame puts out one of the top of schedules every year and I just I just find it you know if I feel like they get penalized for not playing in a conference when I don't see how that should be a penalty as with the way their schedule like\nFrankly I was a little surprised at Ohio State was a little higher I mean you're talking about the human element the buckeyes definitely pass the test now they had an awful game at Purdue there's no question about that but when you look at their Taleb you're thinking I don't know if there's nine teams that are better in the country than Ohio say I agree with that\nI also was really kind of pleasantly surprised that where they put Kentucky I'm because Kentucky you take a look at the team's Kentucky has beaten I mean there's seven in one they beat in Florida they beat in Mississippi said they beat in South Carolina now we'll see what happens this week\nWell we'll see what happens this week but I I thought Kentucky deserve to be in the top ten and you know should West Virginia have been maybe one or two spots higher I guess you can sort of myth that argument you can make it if you want\nBut I mean the opportunity for West Virginia certainly there to move up I mean look at the games are going to play a people want to talk about the Texas game people are talking about the Oklahoma State game the see you up and we'll say about that\nBut I mean I'm looking at Oklahoma State and you could be talking about a situation where West Virginia could still play in factor into their their playoff formula\nTexas Oklahoma State in Oklahoma twice you won all those games you're probably going to be here where you want to be\nYeah and you know the way I look at it as if TCU doesn't you know stumbled again Wu could finish out the season with five straight games against ranked opponent yeah it's pretty good you know and if you can win those five games including you know maybe two or three wins against top Fifteen programs with access and I have a home a\nPotentially Oklahoma again or Iowa State depending on how the cards fall or it as like jelly Galloway set on the show last night WVU can score with anybody in the country if they need to put up forty points they can put a forty point they could scorpions Alabama not like they did against Baylor but they'll put up a touchdown the question is who are they going to stop\nOne thing that got brought up on the show last night that I think is really important uh\nSo if you're sitting at home Saturday Night and you're watching LSU and Alabama play in death valley and the the the the atmosphere there is insane people are making a lot of noise\nUm LS use it to touch the underdog and you're rooting for LSU to beat Alabama\nThat's probably not what the best for West Virginia or any team out of the big twelve or any team in a packed well\nBecause if Alabama suddenly get so lost suddenly the the door is open for two teams from the FCC to go to the college football player and then if you put Notre Dame in there as well there'll be a lot of screaming but of course I mean it's so early\nAnd I and we we only had what how many teams have started out and his top for actually ended up playing for the national championship or make you know yeah Alabama cleansing I I feel like we've heard this story before\nThey remember the year ... Mississippi State was number one in the first poll\nYeah ... ... you know how about the year that TCU is number three then they got to win it all of a sudden they were number six yeah\nAnd they beat Iowa State like a hundred to nothing\nLately beat our state and then they won their ballgame by like fifty points there but I like how do you get dropped three spots with a win\nYeah but you know whether you're the you're the the beautiful thing about this for those people who say wow you know we need eight teams in the college football playoff or we need six teams we need to expand if you had eight teams we wouldn't be talking about LSU Alabama the way we are but be as ... wouldn't be focusing on ending in as much on\nAverage teen Thirteen sexist WVU match up wouldn't necessarily have the implication that had always either\nFor the moment anyway force fine for is fine I Would take a break in or out his next\n[noise] did you know that had the tightest pay and be a liver infections that can be prevented by vaccination Britain pharmacy office that hepatitis stay in the vaccination along with any of the stations that protects the blue flipping calm Patton is ... ...\nAs the old saying goes announced the prevention is worth a pound care [noise] the your friend today to learn about being an honoring inundation offered in Britain pharmacy\nSure Medicare for all sounds great but this new Democrat health plan is a terrible idea especially for seniors who get hit hardest even Democrat Joe Manchin said he'd like to explore a government run health for everybody to just like the Medicare\nFor all planned President Trump says it will end Medicare as we know it and demolished promises made to seniors and the disabled Trump's right don't lecture today let's protect Medicare for seniors and stop a Democratic majority vote no on Joe mansion people by revive America pac which is responsible for the content of this advertising not authorized by any candidate or Kennedy's committee revive packed dot com\nAre you in or are you out find out next on metro news ram hotline\nHello I'm state senator it gone special interest groups have been running radio ads against me for weeks now because they don't like the fact that I'm helping move our state in a new direction the newest ad claims that I was in favor of raising taxes\nThis is false and nothing more than an act of desperation by those special interest the truth is the tax reform proposal that I supported would have eliminated state income tax for every\nHardworking West Virginia I built a reputation as a conservative fighting back against the liberals in Charleston who have repeatedly tried to raise your taxes I've\nWorked tirelessly to control government spending and to lower taxes for working families I've supported eliminating a tax on Social Security benefits so that our seniors can keep more of what they've earned if\nYou want to conservative leader that is pro life pro Second Amendment\nAnd will not raise your taxes didn't vote for me it garbage on November six\nPaid for by ed gone for state Senate ed Bailey treasure\nSon of crushing the end of\nAnti Trump resistance in West Virginia tally sergeant circuit ran Hillary Clinton's campaign in West Virginia I probably abortion extremists\nTally socket will block President Trump's agenda and weren't with Nancy Pelosi and liberals want to impeach President Trump vetted even attack West Virginians for supporting President Trump tally sergeant part of the anti Trump resistance to liberal\nAlex ... proud of West Virginia and supports President Trump Alex movie chose to raise his family in West Virginia because he shares our values in Congress conservative Alex ... works with President Trump and supports his agenda better jobs with higher wages defending our Second Amendment rights\nSupporting the sanctity of life protecting west Virginian with pre existing medical condition endorsed by president Donald Trump and West Virginians for like Alex ... like me and I\nPaid for by Mooney for Congress this is more cats\nSo and I approve this message in the west Virginia House of delegates my top priority is helping other West Virginia's filled their dreams here at home just as I've been lucky enough to do its wife helps pass to balance budgets without raising taxes and led efforts to set of eyes are entrepreneurs\nPromote innovation cultivate next generation jobs\nIn the one team I noticed since I've been here we played every year I've been here so I'm you know dinner multiple times ... ... you know as far as tradition in our league I mean you think of a U.S and and and then there's probably have more tradition and more histories and probably anybody in our leagues for for most concerned\nAnd you can check out much more on this Marshall match\nUp against southern Mississippi at W.

in the middle of the show\nWe'll go I'm told it's totally go with Paul Simon I heard that Paul Simon come in and that's good there you go\nHey I I'm not going to ask you who is on your Mount Rushmore of Halloween candy\nMaybe Ruth there you go all four slots oh rules to do a\nBaby was definitely up there I'm gotta remember I was born and raised in a grocery store with a candy counter that was twenty five feet long and about five feet high I had access\nThree hundred and sixty five days a year to every candy imaginable wow unbelievable dude\nI mean seriously it's amazing that I have teeth um but yeah I've tasted them all\nWell yeah I just want to let you know that that Brett how I think literally within nanoseconds of meat posting the question of the day on Twitter ...\nI saw that so he is or did he go with what did he go with a pretty standard pretty standard stuff Midwest guy yeah there is not going to get to cocoa no no I've\nGot so many responses to this looming over here okay reds picks for resources to licks Snickers and he's with you on baby Ruth yeah and he included the official the Twitter handles for the for resist weeks in Snickers\nJust trying to do I know going out and he's trying to hit it or see I got that I got the ice move slick [laughter]\nA couple of things here of it getting back to more serious matters if you can call sports Syria's were you surprised at\nThe announcement yesterday the DJ Dirk ... going to get to keep his job at Maryland\nYes I was surprised a bordering on shocked it's absolutely unbelievable day if I don't think the stories over yet I think the board thought they could get away with this I don't necessarily know if that's going to happen the twenty four hour plus a reaction\nTo this continues to grow and to swell and I think that in cases like this if the people in charge don't get it done what normally happens\nIs that there is such an outcry that eventually decisions are made and changed the students are getting together the student body president in Maryland is getting together for a protest I think that's scheduled for tomorrow and they're\nTrying to get football players involved as well as you probably know football players walked out\nFrom Dan dark and when he resumed control yesterday and that's a strong right there when that happened and I think ah from the media standpoint Sally Jenkins and the Washington Post this afternoon put a a commentary out a little bit afternoon which ... wonderfully states the issues\nUm there's always been something with me and the University of Maryland there's oh there's always some things there there's always\nSomething that just kind of a little bit off and the way that they roll and I think this is the absolute pinnacle\nOf of the inability for them to uh to run the ship the way that it's supposed to be run and I think that's absolutely in their DNA and this is just a absolutely just amazing that they have allowed him to keep his job\nTrying to understand their decision to allow jerk and to stay from what I could tell last night that one of the reasons is that the university president there and Maryland Wallace low felt that if he if the football coach was going to be fired and the athletic director was going to be fired he was going to be on thin ice to you\nKnow there's no question about that basically they would do the report from ESPN according sources\nIs that the board told the president that\nIf you fire the coach than your gone\nSo everyone's in there and basically and there CYA mode here everyone's trying to save face everyone's trying to save dollars everyone's trying to save their position but the fact of it is that there was a kid that's dead\nAnd I don't even think it's I mean it's not even a question as to what happened when you start to read that report and when you start to see that the way they were treating those kids and the way the\nCulture was whether they want to call it toxic or not it is absolutely mind boggling mind boggling\nThat they just don't say hey we're done or starting over we're starting fresh it's an absolute embarrassing\nYou know you've got a couple of other things that are going on around this story some of the the other things when you peel the onion back a little bit up Matt Canada's pretty good job in Maryland He was put in a a really a a terrible situation taken over this team was so much controversy this apparently pretty talented team their actual football team on the field have been better than expected\nFor you're absolutely right I thought that they would absolutely tank the entire season and they haven't I mean they've been you know they've been representative there three and two in the league they're five and three overall which is much much better than I thought they could ever be\nAll right hey a localized than it back to West Virginia what was your impression last night when you saw the first batch of official college football playoff rankings revealed\nWell you know they're doing such a good job Dave now of gassing or predicting what's gonna happen there's really isn't right everyone has said this is what it's going to be and that's what it was obviously there's always a West Virginia angle Robin ... who is the head of the college football playoff this season as far as the representative he's a university high graduate\nI'm proud WVU grab it used to be at Marilyn used to be a Kentucky and now the athletic director\nAt Oregon so it was good to see him but no real shock I think there was a stat out there that the team that was number three in the poll um has never made it to the ... to the final four the first the first poll out the number three team has never made it\nWell LSU hello uh your three and you've got Alabama this weekend so that strict probably will continue but other than that no massive shocks for me\nYou know what uh I I heard that about the number three in a position in the first college football playoff bull and it didn't go back and research that but the one thing that made me think about that that is that normally uh because of the power the SEC I Would imagine that normally isn't as they see team and they just kinda devour their young\nYeah probably so yeah probably so and there's also want I don't know what I forget what the school was but there's a team that was in the first poll once in the top four and didn't finish in the top twenty five yeah\nWe are told Jordan at the beginning of the this hour you remember the Mississippi State was number one you know and I I Do remember that in the very first bull so huge game for West Virginia this week at Texas a couple of things in your mind what are the keys for West Virginia what do they have to get done to win the game\nThink Dave that Texas is going to say you can't run the ball against us and we're going to drop people in coverage and our number you in the defense of backfield and so I think the key is\nThat the west Virginia has to show that they can run the football they weren't able to do it against Iowa State uh to me that's a very very big concern in this game if they can neutralize West Virginia's running game\nAnd then drop people in coverage and makes it very difficult for West Virginia to get going\nSecondly I'm Sam Allen gr their quarterback has the ability to hurt you with his feet he heard us with is the last year made some big runs late in the game\nOr we've got to do a great job of keeping him under control because he's just kind of a guy to go out there and might missed fire a couple of balls and all of a sudden they rip torn up the field he's running Seventeen Eighteen yard slide down first down keeps drives life so to me the biggest thing is\nHenry you run the ball West Virginia and can you slow down\nThat ... those would be my two big ones are it it'd be great if West Virginia wins this game but it but there are slight underdog if they don't short of winning a national championship or going to the college football playoff in West Virginia still accomplish its goals for the season if they don't win this game\nTaking away the college football playoff national championship yeah 'cause so mathematically you will be certainly underneath the uh the song if you lose on Saturday but it doesn't necessarily knock you out you still have three more which would include that you'd have to beat Oklahoma that would get you into the big twelve championship game\nAnd to be quite honest with you if if that at the start of the season of someone said what's really going to go to the big twelve championship game this year and take a shot I'd be good with that and and so they still would have the possibility but if they win Saturday", "year": "2018", "show_name":
