really haven't had a lot of analysis but we ever had a lot of haters a lot of haters were the Dodgers\nAnd a lot of haters were Boston that is pretty interesting All right I Want to bring my pro wrestling insider a Tom Edwards into the mix how you doing today Tom\nNot too bad it's it's a better day for me than some people that certainly\nYeah you know last night on raw Roman rains I'm a announce to the crowd that he's still dealing with leukemia and is going to give up the belt let's let's hear from him from last night's program raw and then will react to it or why\nPer month [noise] maybe even a full year I've come out here and [noise] going to Rome and raven I spend a lot of you know I've been out here every single week [noise]\nI said I'd be fighting champagne I said I was

then we dream you back I cannot tomorrow\nI Can't be fighting for you [noise]\nAnd I'm gonna have to relinquish universal [noise]\nAll right so that's Roman rains last night on our pro wrestling insider Tom Edwards a joins me and would do for a reaction time I I have to say that was a really stunning moment of television did you did you see that or did you see that coming or did any of the pro wrestling insider see that coming\nA no one saw coming really uh there there was some talk that there was a few WWE\nPeople who do something as as a late it's friday but it was it was not well known in the dressing room and there wasn't anything within say like the\nThe the backstage writers and that type of thing knowing about the secrets and that that there was almost nothing there was a rumor going around that a Roman would be off of the upcoming crown jewel show that's a\nA scheduled to take place in Saudi Arabia but the only thing that was mentioned with that was that there was some kind of injury that he was\nDealing with but there was no specifics to it so but there was concern that he would be off the show now obviously with this diagnosis he's not going to be on the show and he's not going to be a with WWE and at least yeah next few months or so as he deals with the uh\nUh battling cancer\nSo er what are you hearing about rains future I mean is a possible return to action\nOr in the cards is his career over what are the experts say\nUm I mean it's\nIt's it's all up in the air at this point I'm I'm no on colleges so I'm not going to start making predictions or anything like that um but I mean he's battled this one back in two thousand seven years initially diagnosed with leukemia and went into remission to pass an aid and\nAt you know if you think that you're clear at that time and again he was he was clear for basically ten years and coal dust came back now um so I mean\nI think from the WWE perspective enrollments perspective it's going to be a wait and see type of situation is going to go through is going to go through whether it be the chemotherapy or\nA radiation or whatever whatever he needs to go through to battle the disease and the first place and get himself healthy\nAnd uh when you're battling cancer like that it takes a toll on your body so he's not going to be in the physical shape even even once he gets\nIf he gets his back into remission he's not going to be necessarily physical shape that he would be right now\nSo it's kind of taken time to get back into physical shape to get back to Rome and rain we can go now so you're talking airing a good amount of time but I mean it it's all questionable we we have to just kind of the ... go\nYeah it's it's a huge stories also reigns is out for the moment that leaves a huge role in WWE what about the belt\n\nOr well the belt which are are going to be up for grabs at the crown jewel\nShow in a a a triple threat match with him a Bronx Jerome and add a ... so the match now it's going to be less versus strongman for the title so we're transitioning but that were based\nTaking roaming out of that freeway matchmaking at a straightforward one on one Matt okay and putting out in that situation so it doesn't disrupt it that much that so it's not like they're going to ... or anything like that they're just kind of a kind of quickly transition put the Dow found somebody more than likely\nIf I was putting five dollars on it I'd say that it's going to a strongman but just hurt consistency and having the bell week after week instead of having a part time or white or wasn't habit but yeah I think they need to put that back on somebody else so that's that's more than likely where they're going to go with\nThat here's the other story that that's going around pro wrestling that's really crazy in light of the current political a situation in Saudi Arabia at this moment the crown jewel is still on right\nCrowned jewels still on a\nBut there's a lot of questions going around with obviously WWE ... were to cancel a show that a lot of money out of their pockets 'cause the Saudi Arabian government\nPaying that'd be that'd be a lot of money to have this show done and I mean realistically anytime you cancel a show in general you're going to lose money gets tickets that have already been ... and that type of thing uh but obviously\nBecause of this controversy and things that are going on in Saudi Arabia right now there's a lot of there's a lot of the workers within WWE that are having their reservations about going over to Saudi Arabia again they they did a show earlier the greatest route rumble which was a few months back\nUm but to go back over here again or after the murder of the journal is\nA reporter John seeing that has pulled out and that was yeah obviously that's a huge name right there at the bigger names are going to be a pulling out of this show than what we're\nFrom the Saudi Arabian side Saudi Arabian government wants all these ... you know big high profile names to do this show it goes names pull out\nAmazing little device hold thousands song and it goes right in my pocket\nAnd it was on to say Nineteen forty five

year ago what about her work and therefore and five sit in a number Fifteen in all likelihood they're going to find their way in a hurricane with a victory or will all but assuredly knock themselves into the playoffs picture a there last game coming up\nI got my week this week and then there'll be taken on saying all the ins and saying all been struggling team with just one when so in all likelihood the Redskins are on their way and you know what we've\nWe talked last week a little bit about Ripley the replacement of very interesting story this year there was a seven and one this week they're going to play ruined county I mean they are just the Vikings are just marching on yeah they are ... and ...\nVery good football throughout the year Ben very consistent uh and right now sitting at number five they could still possibly catch capital but more than likely they're going to end up into five to a category\nTheir final two games hosting a one win or wrong county team that has a just two ends I should say and then they'll take on ravens what in the final weeks of those are games are Ripley probably will be heavily favored to win\nSo in all likelihood the Vikings will probably lock themselves in somewhere between number five and number eight going it as opposed\nTo you mentioned you mentioned capital they play at riverside this weekend in the ... valley so that is a game that capital should win although riverside has improved but I'm guessing a that ... that's the game that's the game in West Virginia this weekend\nYeah in terms of playoff importance absolutely and and give Muslim and a lot of credit they've played and one's sim games against\nQuality opponents over the last couple of weeks two weeks ago they beat Hedges veil twelve seven\nThat had to develop team that has six wins wheeling park they knocked off forty one to thirty five so moslem and playing very good football they still have pressed him to take on and weak eleven but if moslem and could do what no team is done in the last two and a half years and beat Martin's Berg\nThey would lock up a spot inside the top two of the playoffs now that's a it's a tall order and we know what Martin's Berg is\nUm but Muslim and with an opportunity to get into the top two certainly\nAre right now last week you and I talked a little bit about the probability that there would be some teams in class AAA that would go to the playoffs with sub five hundred records that anything happened last weekend the ginger opinion on that\nNow I think you you could still see you know George Washington as a ... or they're sitting at a number of fourteen right now at four and for\nA they'll take on Beckley this week uh which they should be heavily favored to win a take on Capitol in Waco eleven so if the favorites win over the last two games George Washington probably gets in and five and five hurricane probably get sent at five and five\nSo you may actually have just a stack of teams the last four or five spots but could all be five and five so there may not be for when team coming into the playoffs this year\nIn double a affair among seniors number one they've been number one they're undefeated most of the season Bridgeport is back up the number two in the U.S let's say see rankings\nThey're eight and one they're only losses the pheromones senior poke Nicholas county there are three and four respectively they're both undefeated Bluefield number five six through ten point pleasant or C B\nKaiser we're in men go central and these teams would make the playoffs if they started this weekend Wayne shady spring Frankfurt Lewis county and oh killer taught for fourteen and then grafted what are the biggest games and double A. this week\nIn terms of playoff important is the one at\nThe top has to be Frankfurt in Kaiser now you look at the way everything's sets up now ... too and they are the number eight team Frankfurt is seven and one but currently in thirteenth now again in case people aren't familiar with how the as to say the rankings work\nIt's a power rating formula that takes heavily strength of schedule in to play so basically you read that when it comes to Kaiser in Frankfurt Kaiser has\nPlayed a tougher schedule had some victories over some better opponents are and that's why they're currently I had to Frankfurt that's a key matchup Kaiser probably has to wait at least one more game to lock up a playoff spot Frankfurt at the same I'll probably holds true for them if they were to be Kaiser that's probably the last piece that they need to get into the playoff\nJoe this might be an unfair question but I'll go ahead and ask it I mean I'm looking at Bridgeport poker and Nicholas ... if if all of those teams win out who finished second in the rankings\n[noise] it's tight at the top with Bridgeport in Pocono Bridgeport as a by week this week they will play the Lincoln in week eleven you assume that they win that game but Lincoln I Would just three wins on the season that's not gonna give Bridgeport a lot of points of go\nWith the opportunity to play Herbert Hoover this week but then they get Wayne next week\nSo in all likelihood if poker runs the table finishes ten and no they would probably pass Bridgeport as for Nicolas county they're sitting there at nine and no right now but they're off this week but next week they play to win team in class a in Ridgewood\nSo based on strength of schedule poker would probably pass both would probably pass Bridgeport and hold off Nichols county and get into the top two\nOkay so the the point I'm making here is if that would occur pheromones senior and poker wouldn't see each other in the playoffs until we like\nGrowing up you can basically sharply and fair among seniors number one right now that that's that's guarantee that all but guaranteed to happen\nUh and yet ... would be the number two and then they'd be split up into opposite brackets now Polk has done very well played some great football did lose their ah starting running back and even paying a couple of weeks ago to a season ending injury but they're still undefeated and us do that all fence it's averaging close to forty points a game\nOr a joy appreciate it thanks for coming on the show you got it let me run down the top sixteen here before we hit the brake will give you more in a in class they will give you

C. S. but you look at a Matt Barnes you look at Ryan for his ear you look at Joe Kelly it's not that strong a group\nThe Dodgers are a little bit deeper and they've got more balance with left these like Alex would Julio riots or I think I pay for them in a short series but yeah this is not a series were either team can get a one run lead than just power the ...\nYou know look let's start with Boston because they they are the favorite here I mean they went through the Yankees uh then they were able to to overcome the upstanding pitching the Houston Astros I mean in Boston doesn't when is this is this season a failure for the red Sox\nI Would not it is something that it was really come around since we went to this three uh three tiered playoff back in Nineteen Ninety five where everything has become more about the whole season it's just an NBA mindset where you know the ring as everything and yeah I I grew up ... with George Steinbrenner feel felt the same thing but\nIt seemed like we just have a greater appreciation for great regular season teams winning or division used to mean something and if you lost in the league championship series last in the world series it was still a successful here and the fact that we can have a conversation where\nRed Sox game that when a hundred and eight fifty four in advance of the world series might be a disappointment I think that reflects more on us as as fans of media that does the team itself so now to me I think it's still a successful year and we've got to kind of stopped defining sesame seeds and only by who wins the championship\nWell you know but you know that's the way fans react I mean we hear look at the Dodgers the Dodgers have won a World Series since Nineteen eighty eight\nThere back in the world series again you've got to you they're they're set up for her show's gonna leave this thing off I mean I I Would imagine there's a lotta Dodger fans who are thinking you know this is our year too that this was the year the Dodgers breakthrough\nWell again it gets and they were talking about the nature of the baseball postseason all the time these teams are even though they were separated by a lot and they were standing in the regular season you know the advance numbers actually indicate the Dodgers are better either case\nYeah the the best of seven there's just nothing separating baseball teams you know ... and that skip all\nThe better team tends to win because you can get the ball did better player a but in baseball you can't do that and these teams are really for the for baseball they very evenly matched so\nI don't think either one of these teams I think a Red Sox are small favorite I'm On the betting lines but neither one of these teams winning the series would be an upset they are both excellent excellent baseball teams to the top three teams in baseball this year a they have a pure clear strengths that they were changing the fences typically gets right hinders\nTheir weaknesses in the bullpen the Dodgers defense or something you worry about\nBut I I don't think you can position this series as David ... this was all I think a lot\nYeah I think so too that's interesting that there are there are some metrics they give a little bit of an edge to the Dodgers over Boston as we get those ready to start the world series is it the their advantage and starting pitching is that where they get the edge\nThat a lot of it is the we look at numbers like face runs or a baseball prospect at this third order standings okay you know I was just prospectus for a lot of years and what it does it say okay\nWhen you go dig down below win loss record dig down below runs scored ones allowed look at all of the elements singles doubles double plays everything teamed it\nAnd kind of build up from there to a record you find that the Dodgers were actually played at the quality of a hundred and five when team this year even though it does reflect on their record where's the red Sox won a hundred games but they played the quality of a hundred wait and see now you can take these things with a grain of salt disorder let's say well you know the record is the record I've got no argument with that\nBut in terms of predicting what Eighteen is going to do in a given series any kind of Ford facing predict the underlying numb and those third order record so those face runs wreckage\nGet at how good a team actually is and those are more productive than say the standings or even runs scored when I was a lot\nYou know many Machado what let's talk a little bit about him of course he got ... of from the Orioles to the Dodgers in the middle of the season he knows what what Boston\nIt's all about I mean if if the Dodgers when the world series those that increases value in free agency does it make him more likely to resign whip the Dodgers what could be the impact of a big series in a wind by the Dodgers ...\nI don't see a lot of scenarios where he ends up in Los Angeles or they've got just some Turner for another year they've got Korea senior coming back from elbow surgery next year I I don't think he's a ... in LA the Dodgers of course have to see a quake Kirsch I was going to opt out her shop south is going to be there to be on the uh probably thirty five million dollars a year for him\nA I think they're greater concern would be an irritation\nWhether that means going and getting a Patrick Corbett and maybe trading for as ... I ... I don't think they're going to want to stand there at a thirty five to forty million dollar hitter as opposed to going to the rotation and they've you know we've seen the occasional Carlos Deltron where\nA player goes nuts in October and racist ... market value but I think that shot is going to get paid no matter what happens Dodgers when Dodgers lose charter goes crazy Machado as goes over the series\nOr the way from offices are run now\nThey don't have that sharp reaction to you know one week or a one month a great play they're going to evaluate the child of based on how many wins they expect them to produce um and how that's going to fit into it to their uh their chance budget their teams equation we just aren't going to see the postseason have an impact and the game just not one like that and they\n... want to get what Joe she in one of our baseball insiders are on the uh on the eve really tonight of the world series game one between the Dodgers and the red Sox\nYou know Joe ... in this postseason we've really only had one elimination game game seven of the national league championship series that the Dodgers one in Milwaukee\nI mean can we've got two fabulous teams will be Boston's out an amazing near the Dodgers have to you look at what Boston is done on their way to the world series the teams they eliminated the Yankees and the ...\nThe series have to go six or seven games to be considered great I mean what are the elements of a great world series\nYou can have a great sweet I'm In my class like let my examples over the two thousand five World Series where the White Sox swept the Astros but it was four games decided by six runs worry man I Want to say fourteen innings they started taking need this game six seven I think the postseason as a whole could use that because\nYou mentioned we only had the one game seven um the division serious was decided then yeah two games over the minimum I think ... if we're going to look back at this postseason historically we would like to see a classic World Series\nBut you know there are scenarios where they play five really close games or one of them just have to wait you know I'm getting a lot of feedback safe Red Sox fan and they said Dodgers and six on line\nAnd oh you know the Dodgers steam roll the red Sox theme Robie's to al teams well they did\nThey did go seven too but five of the games were out in the night that\nSteam rolling steam early as what a bunch of game six to ... ah I think you have a series here where it's the same thing where one team wins four to five but all of the games are for three with Craig Kimber loading the bases and then I", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "23"}
