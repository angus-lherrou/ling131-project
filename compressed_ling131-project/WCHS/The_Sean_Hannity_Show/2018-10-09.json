state fuel card and he had said this entire time that he would go to these places and\nHe would do business while you know maybe in ... county visiting family or if he went to Morgantown you'd also do some say business but there are also some other things that went on there for example when he was in Tucker county eat solid family\nWhen he was in other parts of the state he would maybe speak to people who had read his book maybe do just appearances at parades\n... stuff that would not be you know in terms of visual business it's on shaky ground ... so he answered questions about that this

touring the nation trying to convince evangelical Christians to vote Democrat which is typically a block of about twenty five million voters eighty percent of whom generally vote Republican\nSo seems like kind of a lost cause if you if you think about I guess what it is they're trying to rally votes they called themselves vote common good wow and I went to their that went to their stomp in Morgantown on Sunday\nAnd started reading up the story wanted to get a response from melody Potter who's the chairwoman of the west Virginia GOP who also happens to be an evangelical Christian herself

Fleetwood Mac absolutely fantastic so I'll be written for ah for Stevie Nicks to get in on the go ahead\nI was just going to say this is why I like this question of the day everybody's got an opinion on this so yeah there's been a lot of love receiving it 'cause I think she's going to get in there hey you know what I was I've I finally got some sleep on Sunday night and uh that was that was needed after what the Steelers did to the falcons\nBut certainly was there was a good way to look at you know I don't think we're at a point where we're we're talking about must win games but that certainly was again that that you felt that\nThey probably wanted to win a most definitely before going out there next three games now are all against division AMC north opponent starting Sunday against the Cincinnati Bengals and\nA look this is a game that I thought the Steelers matched up fairly well against talking about the Atlanta Falcons however we've set a couple of times this year so we thought you know they matched up pretty good against some of the other teams that they played already this this season\nBut uh uh you know they ran the football really well in this game James Carter hotter ten yards on Twenty one carries in two touchdowns you kind of felt that was comedy because it's falcons defense really beat up they enter the game\nAre already missing three starters uh you're from previous injuries during the year that of course ah ah their defensive tackle was held out this game as well too so you had a good sense that if the theater's were able to\nJust stick with a game plan earlier on the football they were going to be able to do just that and they did and not only that\nCarter chipped in what form receptions for another Seventy five yards the all fits really got off to a good start in this game scoring a touchdowns on her first two possessions that's kind of a flip a coin flip the script if you will because how many times have we seen the Steelers\nGet down a couple a touchdown than some games this year then you know the defense had a kind of a a rough a yard sale rough rough is kind of first half there\nBut they settled down and they got some key stops and then the second half are they really did a good job of getting some pressure on on falcons quarterback Matt Ryan and you know you throw in the ... bought by Roosevelt next uh later on in the game and and the and the fence capitalizing on on that\nIt really kinda snowballed into Steelers direction and ultimately ended in a forty one Seventeen home when\nYou know what I'm Glad you brought that pump blood by Nixon door conversation love seeing that a couple of things about the often you know we've seen James Caan or run hard before but in terms of games he's played as a Steeler in and and not for the Panthers you know he was just breaking tackles like a Mad Men in that game came really\nThen you get you go back to his college tape and that's that's nothing new with him you know if you get him moving north and south or what just a little bit of Greece or you know he he can break some of those tackled and I think a good early on that first drive on that thirty yard to run that he had\nA off of a power scheme of the Castro pulling from right guard too is right\nUh you know there was a little bit of a ... set up a one on one situation with Connor and I think the safety a either a safety or quarter on that side and it looks like if you look at the twenty two on that\nUh the the end zone view of that play on the old twenty to take it looks like that that you know the fence aback hasn't left right but Carter makes demand mess\nAnd that turns into a thirty yard gained down the right side so you know it's not just blocking that got the job done uh in the run again for the state is against the falcons a Connor was responsible for making quite a few of those yards on his own and that was certainly refreshing to see\nYeah no doubt about it in a ... Berger was on the radio in Pittsburgh this morning saying no matter what happens in the future would levy on bill they got to find a rule for James caught her and I totally agree with that\nKind of it it's got to set up an interesting situation you're going to set up like a situation with that uh Spiderman animated gift that we see on Twitter where they're kind of look at each other in the mirror
