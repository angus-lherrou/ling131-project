jump Jenkins joins me here\nFrom our flagship affiliate WC adjusting Charleston Alex readers feel will have some more news headlines from Morgantown and job or Cato will give us a sports update in just a moment let's get Jeff in here how you doing today as Dave how're you doing you don't look like a guy who would road rage\nMuch not much not much not much every but every once in a while [laughter] yeah you get aggravated ... it'd be as funny though you'd think the the\nBrits are a little more calm than we are so if they're swearing every other mile what are we doing\nThat must be because they drive in the wrong side of the room that we write something to do and that's probably right man it's a busy Newsday Liz they view it hit\nRefresh on your or a cause of a newly stories just been posted Brad and Brad's updated story of WB metro news dot com on the acquittal\nOf of a justice that Walker on the impeachment charges course she was impeached along with three other current and former members of the Supreme Court by the house of delegates several weeks ago\nShe had a two day trial the trial is wrapped up the vote was taken today by the state Senate thirty two to one against removal from office\nSo they voted they basically found her not guilty of the impeachment if the impeachment was that piece of it was a charge they basically found not guilty of the impeachment instead they voted to censor her publicly reprimanded censor her\nFor wasting taxpayers' money but after work both Democrats and Republicans senators that we talked to and you see this from Brad stories you read through it\nThere's just been posted a couple of minutes ago they all agree there's there's agreement that what she did all the wrong and she was a sorry for it as she testified yesterday it did not rise to the level of removing her from office\nAnd that was their final conclusion Steven ball one being the only senator from greenbrier county voted to remover\nI thought that was interesting I I got two questions for your first of all this did not go down party lines\nIt did not know thirty two to one yeah so it was it was bipartisan obviously very overwhelmingly bipartisan or to not removed from office\nAnd the the other question or the other question I have after reading the story is are we looking at this as kind of a preview of what's going to happen in the other impeachment last\nQuestion days but you got to remember that Walker only faced one article of impeachment and that was kind of a catchall article of being kind of negligent in putting policies in place in doing was used as do other justices including chief justice Margaret workman\nAs it's been a justice Allen offering former justice Robin Davis folks face several uh impeachment uh ... including the one that Walker was named anti so the one that Walker was named and they may not be impeached on that but there's other there's other things that they were they they've already been a ... but the other things they might be convicted\nOn uh as far as the state Senate goes and removed from office\nIn light of the way the voting went down to that I could walk or make the case that may be impeachment proceedings against or should not have been\nInto at yeah well that's what she she's basically testify to that they didn't think she didn't think the house should've impeached her\nBut she she has vowed to continue to work to make sure there are certain policies on the court that deal with finances\nSo and and she has just issued a statement to as a breath adding that to our story there would be the metro news dot com now a kind of in connection with that and very much connection is the federal criminal trial they started today for out of law free\nOr they suspended justice jury system in jury selection holiday day it's really you know and uh they're they've taken\nA larger poor jurors and they usually take because this case is well known\nSo they brought Seventy jurors to the court potential jurors to the courthouse today to federal courthouse in downtown Charleston and so they're trying to come up with the proper number\nOf jurors to hear this case and the proper number of alternate I so just takes a while to work through that just junk coup a neighbor longtime\nA federal judges is leading the efforts there and working through this you might take most of the day maybe into tomorrow to see if they can even get a jury pool or get a jury seated in when they do then they will begin Seventy yeah they brought say law yet it yeah they usually bring thirty yeah so they ... they more than doubled\nThat potential jurors the potential juror pool um and so ah we're having up day coming up there's really just been\nJust this process of choosing a jury a and are asking individual questions and those type of things also a major\nAnnouncement today as being viewed in different ways by governor justice he announced this morning that he was pledging when ... the state revenues are doing so well that he's pledging one hundred million dollars\nToward the permanent fix of the state public employees insurance agency toward toward a public employees health insurance PI he's placing one hundred million dollars\nToward it he said now this is that won't be the total fix this is just another kind of piece of the puzzle that the ... task force can use when it's coming up with a proposal and he said I'm kind of working on a proposal to but this is a hundred million dollars that we can use\nThat that can help us moving forward he didn't promise he didn't say that that was the fact that this would just be part of the fix\nA and then along with that same news conference surrounded by Republicans he announced that they would be supporting a now there are five percent pay raise for teachers and the upcoming legislative session so if that would be approved that'd be ten percent in two years for teachers\nThe unions have responded calling it basically a political stunt one month before the election saying they've heard promises before maybe from other governors ah quite honestly I mean if you look at it and not from justice but uh but they are they been quick to criticize him a for this announcement today\nUm and so I talked to one of the union reps or this afternoon and say what would you take the five percent he says Shorty oh yeah sure we take the opposite but we don't know about these numbers a lot of things can change which is all true\nBut it's it's very political you can see you know there are criticizing justice for making the announcement for weeks before the election uh and and so he's saying hey the money's here I'm pledging five percent pay raise for teachers and Republicans are\nThis train he said is gone or riding a great wave of you know they may some obviously a lot of political comment so we'll see how it comes out\nBut uh but that was the proposal today\nYou do good impression you're going to go there but ... let's get Alex readers feeling here for some news headlines from Oregon son Alex how you do it\nThey'll do we have Alex Yuri on me I got you a big guy when he got what's going on man\nAnd we got a couple of things it was a really busy day yesterday so I'm Sorry I missed the program and everyone wants to go back there's plenty of mine county in Morgantown and even pressing Kenny related stories up at the website but uh focusing on today a couple of things to go into one a story\nI'm really very very a rough story out of a Morgan down here mine county that a man a who's on\nThe lake and this incident last February he pleaded not guilty in ... county circuit court after an incident where he threatened to kill himself and his seven year old daughter by throwing the two of them into cheat lake\nThere in February when it was forty five degrees air temperature outside so he was actually in court that story is up at the website or the little girl was okay please rebel to get to her and\nTime uh back back then but ah you\nKnow we're gonna follow his case because obviously that was an odd\nAnd frightening story or elsewhere W these crime numbers are out some interesting things to note a lot of different individual categories down\nWhich is a good thing and and the police chief is pleased with but\nAh one place that's up sexual assaults increase slightly a couple of other is increased including a marijuana arrests and then on the downside a and I mean this positively speaking ah alcohol arrests actually went down as did referrals those

from the three or four eighty six zero day\nOut of state slow drivers in the left or the fast lane or just ridiculous and let's get a couple of areas responses in\nFrom my Twitter feed a here's Jim on Twitter who says Dave\nSitting out alight when it turns green the person in front of you sit there because they are texting\nThat's kind of a threat that the is working its way through my Twitter feeds Matthew on Twitter says\nSlow drivers drive me crazy I don't mind you pulling out in front of me because uh but dopey slow when you do it Steve on Twitter in all caps says talking on their phone it's against the law enforced this law\nCarry on Twitter says not going the speed limit or going slow in the fast lane ah Jennings onto it are they being distracted while driving\nNext door in front of me when that happens they either swerve or slam on their brakes which causes the rest of us to do the same I see this all the time on our sixty four in the ... valley er ...\nRobert says on Twitter he goes Dave when you see an emergency vehicle ahead the police with their lives on on the right shoulder and the idiots behind you speed up and pass you so they you can't merge ended up passing linked to assist the public servants\nThat's a really good one Robert I appreciate that uh shows says hey Dave my neighbor is a retired New York city cop I guarantee he tops that by least tenfold when it comes to the swearing\nThe thing that drives me up the wall is a slow driver and the left lane especially when his or her car is traveling the same speed as the car right beside it in the right lane\nAnd dug it says on Twitter he goes talking on their phone while driving I think we should be able to execute capital punishment on anybody holding a phone to their ear while they are driving by Steve responded ... says well\nYou know a since we're talking about this what's your response here talking about are the generally not understanding the rules of the road yeah I have\nIssues like ah you know when you're at a a complicated intersection and you're making like a left turn and people tend to like\nTurn wide and we'll turn from the left a far left lane over into the right wing and then there's traffic emerging from the other direction that are supposed to have the right wing to themselves and so it was always causes thirty ... thirty uh the the six street in the city has a great example\nOf that every time I'm trying to merge onto the bridge you have to look for the ... idiot that's coming from the other direction 'cause they think just because they're turning left they can take her shoes choice of many of the three lane of the bridge that there are ... that they want to turn into used was to stay in the left lane soccer\nThat happens on Virginia street as well you you get off the Virginia street exit and get into downtown and the person that gets in the far right hand lane who wants to turn right suddenly you know they're all ... you know a sweeping turned into the middle a man that happens almost every day\n... things like that or people that just sit at a uh I'm at a white that you could turn right on bread where there's no you know it's not posted that you can't turn right on ... you're just sitting there wasting time behind them because they're not turning right on bread that annoys me to no end on man no the rules of the road turn right\nHow about this how about people who seem to think that turn signals are optional\nI turn signals and stop signs be an option when you're in ... city there's stop where I live there stop signs everywhere and almost nobody ever stop it in with a young child now it's something that I've become even more aware of I Can't believe that people that just blindly\nLike I like the stop signs or even though they just blow through the neighborhood turn signals are saying wait how about holding on to turn signal before you swim on the brakes\nThat may not not after because then it doesn't even make any sense because you're not giving me warning to you're going to be putting on your brakes\nTurn signal then break not break in terms of\nHow many times do you think you've been on I Seventy nine I Seventy seven thirty five in Ohio and you'll roll up you'll be going the speed limit\nAnd you know there's practically nobody else on the road and you'll see the car in front of you that's just kind a starting and stopping in terms of the speed and they're kind of worried about it every time I hit a hit up behind one of those people I guarantee you they're texting yeah\nAnother another thing a tax thing is is something that's very dangerous the other thing that kinda bothers me is when you see somebody celebrating in their break lights on at the same time that's right you know that there are two for the driver and and I just don't trust people to drop it through the you know what I'm Sorry so I Try to usually pass that person get very far away from them\nI don't know sometimes scoop on with this question of the day ah we hit on one that everybody can relate to I think this pulled the scab\nEverybody thinks they're a great driver and everybody else is there so that's very sort of\nA well I can guarantee you that that keeps more ... more houses are pretty good driver he's a pretty good driver and he will join us next we'll get back into the sports like but lifted a if you've got

H. E. K.\nEli why one word of three E. W. H. E. K. L. E. Y. men we have so many responses to this question of the day who let's dig into the text messages first uh from the real more ... the five four or five day people who refused to merge until the last minute\nAnd people who don't use their blink or as a from the three or four eighty three a day maybe I'm the juror jerk but when I see a sign that says lane closed I immediately get to the other side and wait my turn\nIn ... but I hate those people who blow by me and then try to dive in right before the lane is closed a from a thrill forests six nine five Dave I hate seeing details on windshields\nThat were put on backwards you know they put it on inside inside instead of outside the vehicles they're not competent enough to put a sticker on yet they're still driving a car\nOh my goodness that coup that will save valid that that is pretty funny or from the thrill forest six five seven\nSomeone who passes me is I'm attempting to merge onto the on ramp on ice Seventy nine three oh four six one zero\nDrivers passing me and like celery it into a red traffic light I never failed to point a to the lights are one more before we move on from the three or four six to six day\nI hate sitting through a green light because the person has to finish texting or on Facebook or tailgating me while I'm already five miles over the speed limit\nMan I tell you what this question has got a lot of people going down here are two very calm individuals' let me get Steve Weddington and Jeremy style from select a carts and collectibles you guys don't have any problems with anybody driving right\nAh\n... yeah yeah that's I don't like a little drive in ... the side I mean when I speed up they beat up by slow down they slow down I just I get claustrophobic that were\nJeremy when you guys travel together who drives\nA steam drove the Cleveland normally most like I go I like to drive\nOkay All right hey we've got a lot of stuff to talk about and I want to get into it you and I were talking I was in his shop about ten days ago a about you want to get good young people involved in the hobby and they need to be good students you've got a pretty interesting program about that what's happening\nYou know we you know Steven I talked about it and my wife actually came up\nWith it I'll go ahead and give her the credit but um you know we were\nTalking about the hobby and how the biggest part of the collectors our people our age there's not really kids involved in it any more um basically because of the combinations of price kids out I mean box prices are just too high um well we're we're we're wanting to do is run a program where if kids throughout the month of October\nUm if kids you know bring a paper in with an a or something like that we want to give them a free pack of cards\nUm and just tried to get them involved in collecting them\nI think that's a great idea so you your location is over there in South Charleston so exactly what does a a parent or student have to do to the qualifiers this\nJust stop in bring a paper\nUm you know during the month of October will give up something small they bring in a paper with an eye on it\nUm I Do want to stay though October the thirteenth Saturday from two to four we're going to have a kids' trade day I'm trade days are very popular\nThing that we have in our store but it's mostly adults come in and try to hire dollar cards and I mean there can be Fifteen or twenty thousand dollars worth of cards trades hands on a Saturday afternoon and our store or a but we're wanting to do for kids where they can come in sit down um\nHas some snacks or something trade cards each other so we're going to that October the thirteenth from two to four\nAnd then the clothes at the end of the month is kids bringing their report cards with a three point out of them were going to give them something else like a box of our little box of cards or something like that but mainly just to get kids involved in the hobby\nI think that's a good idea Steve Jeremy makes a really good point there I remember when I was a kid and I would go into the location where you could buy cards there would be a bunch of kids there as well we did as kids absolutely but when I come into your store is mostly adult to any kids wandering there very often\nI'm there and we didn't have our select group of kids that come in there I think probably the problem is that they were just readily available when you were a child you know that's a rare everywhere and nowadays there in select markets and um you know it it makes a little bit more difficult for the kid to go down to the corner gas station and get back to baseball cards you know it's safe like he said they have price it out of the\nMarket for the kids but for the most parts availability\nAnd one of the things that I sent you a note about that I wanted to talk about is the guys who come in with odd requests does that happen very often were somebody will come in and they'll make a request for a player that they're related to or that they just remember from when they were a kid that's a little odd\nYou know yeah I mean everybody ... everybody has their own little\nNuances and their hobby where they're going after guys we've never even heard of and Jeremy and are having to look through boxes trying to find a relative or just somebody follow we have a lot of guys who follow teams and it's odd oh we have a guy who thought a\nMichigan drew who collects every rookie card of every Michigan football player ever and that's pretty big list so wow yeah it's it's a he's a he's a go getter\nBut another\nThing Jersey card you know that we've talked about the Jersey ... people come in and ask for cards with dirt mud blood whatever they got on the car you know where it's game warning and that's kind of bought for ... to like take the box and found some cards that are already but that's what they want so what\nAbout that Jeremy what about hockey I mean NHL starts this week 'cause you guys deal much in hockey\nUh we don't own a whole lot but only because the demand isn't there around here hockey's a huge seller\nAround the country but in\nIn this area it's just not there's not much of a martyr for we do have a couple of people that come in and buy supplies for their hockey cards and I think we're talking about maybe starting to stock a little bit of packs and boxes of hockey um just to see how it goes but they're just not much of a market for really\nKnow last time you guys are in here about a month ago and you're here every Tuesday at four thirty the first Tuesday of every month we were talking about the will Greer collectibles and has what's what's going on with that as that\nIncreased leveled off what's going on with ... um it's picking up speed actually really yeah it's whether ... or ... or the prices of the cards that we talked about a month ago had the the values of those cards increased yes they had\nTo have and you know we talked about the limited quantities or there was only two or three real products being offered out there with his autograph on it and that markets drought up so quick that the the price you know as he picks up steam two or three weeks from now that those carts of\nDoubled tripled in value you know it's worth seeing the same thing and the hobby with homes which we had talked about earlier his stuff as went from forty to fifty dollars for you know a an autograph card to seven eight hundred dollars\nAnd it it probably won't be able to stay in that market but you know when you throw sixteen touchdowns or fourteen and zero interceptions your first three games or whatever it is it's you know he's just everybody would address\nCampaign touchdowns in three games and interceptions\nSo Jeremy let me ask you a question about ... homes for example leaves the hottest thing right now will his markets or if he levels off decrease or increase because he's going to be it's beginning to look like he's the real deal\nOr it's going to leveled off and then eventually it's going to fall down and he's not going to keep these numbers up forever um card collecting was basically like the stock market people get hot\nAt least they said we bought a rookie card is for sixty bucks what three months ago picked up a couple of rookies um spent Fifteen twenty bucks to get 'em graded and\nLast week there were ... for seven hundred and fifty dollars I look to dial in Seoul just wait for nine hundred we have about Seventy five dollars in so it'll be sold this week when we get it back from grading but\nYou know and that's the way it is if he comes out in two weeks and has a bad game then you're going to say the price job people were was sitting at home watching the game homes those five touchdowns will see what is ... yards are they ... they see what they're going for they started didn't drive the market\nHey uh before I let you go man I we could do a whole hour whether you guys I always say that every time you come in here but the grading process say for example you find a box of cards you inherit a box of course you've got some cards that you think are valuable what do you do what's the grading process how do you start\nWatch those are perfume and and don't let anyone in without the password ... has a password to understand okay I got a well one is a National Guard they started playing right the ... they are so much goes on in that room for the fact that you ...\n...\nI'm fine thanks how are you I'm fine too but you can't come in unless you give the best way I wanted

I don't know if that's going to be a resurgence in in CDs or be mass produced\nBut I think you're right uh that some of the CDs around today you're probably going to be valuable in the future\nYou never know so you know you don't want to be a quarter but you don't want to ... days if you keep them keep them in good shape\nOh yeah that's exactly right ah and then the ones that have been manufactured most recently really do sound a lot better than the first batch that came out in the eighties [laughter] I used to tell me oh let's talk about the Halloween top ten most viable records what are you guys were\nOutlets to our number ten working to number one number tend to give it to Bobby Boris picket the monster mensch everybody knows that won the album is where the value is up to one hundred dollars right now the original ... packs record\nCollectors want these on the original late ... or in the bond passed away not too long ago but he had a big hit where rules of London the evangelist for the picture disc with a picture of aware will right on the vital itself also up to a hundred dollars a remembers soupy sales\nSuit me sales as from our state he's from Huntington\nOkay well soupy sales at a forty five called I got a crush on Frankenstein it is worth up to one hundred dollars [noise]\nUh the Addams family soundtrack from the TV show the Addams family currently up to one hundred fifty dollars that Cassidy who played the lurch on the Addams family without a forty five called the lurch\nNuts and it was a big hit\nIt was a great record at with its pictures leave up to a hundred and fifty dollars I think my favorite is this only because of the title guy's name is dawn Hinton on Capitol Records rival flavor flavored non carbonated Polly an saturated blood\nWithin ... up to a hundred and fifty dollars that's great\nA great screaming Jay hawk and I put a spell on you at forty five up to two hundred bucks\n... fat when reality was poet rotten McEwen he recorded under the name bottom McFadden at a forty five called the regular touch with pick to lead up to two hundred and fifty dollars\nKelly about the monsters soundtrack album ah in stereo it's up to three hundred dollars at number one less ... Halloween record it is Michael\nJackson it is thriller the value for the picture disc version Michael Jackson's picture right on the vital itself currently up to four hundred\nYou know I I Want to ask you about that Michael Jackson picture disc I mean we knew when when Michael Jackson was such a major star that a lot of this stuff was going to be valuable uh did they just not manufacture them any picture discs or or why is that record so valuable\nWell there are certainly lots of them the regular standard black vinyl copy sure or are they can fill up to thirty to forty dollars now and there was over thirty million votes sold so Michael Jackson is getting to be extremely collectible and that's one of the reasons for it\nNow they get quite a few picture disc thriller but certainly in comparison to the number of standard black bile copies or maybe you know five percent so uh it's wherever that is more valuable\nHey let me ask you John also about the album jackets I mean sometimes it's not just the records but it's the the album jackets and I mean should you try and now I'm not collect vinyl and occasionally\nI'll come across a record that I Know hey if it was in great shape that it would be viable uh but the jacket all habits hair in it or somebody wrote their name on the outside of it I mean how\nWould you do you just try to put those in plastic and not do the repairs yourself or how do you feel about people who use scotch tape and that kind of stuff to put stuff together what are your thoughts on that\nNever ever tried to do a repair to an album scotch tape is lord of the big enemies are a record buyer would rather see the tear the scotch tape over their chair\nSo a lot of times you know they might have the uh the jacket in may condition but the record is in bad condition so they'll take the record this in good condition and put it in the jacket this good condition so they could still be quite collectible because of that but the store the bedrooms aperture and do not try to repair them\nAll right and for people who are interested in getting your opinion about the records they may have or other questions they have about vinyl in general how did they get in touch with you\nWell go to money music dot com money is a got gotten it right now we have a special if you email us off our website and tell us what radio show or what radio station you

this just simply please is real\n\n\nLove it\n\n\n\nUh\nOne more time to read so twenty five minutes Silvio our job or condos going to join me in just a moment but first our last resort of our question today\nWhat drives you crazy about other drivers when you are behind the wheel and I know a lot of you are right now trying to work your way home after another day at work here the w._b. what drives you crazy about other drivers when you are behind the wheel a couple\nOf responses year from the three or four or five five zero\nDay when somebody sees my blink or to change lane change lays in the speed up to block me makes me want to throw a punch them will do that that that technically is really driver a rage ... sixty one to two zero\nOr what drives you crazy drivers and the left lane we've heard a lot of that today well here's something interesting uh from uh we we were talking to my knowledge on the record guy\nAbout Halloween records from the three or four six eight five Ted Cassidy who was lurch and the Addams family is from Philip ...\nYou know I wanted to interrupt John but he was on a roll there that is exactly right I actually did know that All right let's here's a guy who knows a lot about high school football and other stuff to Joe ... are you doing Joe I'm doing very well day thanks well let's talk a little bit about week seven of the high school football season in West Virginia first of all\nUm I ... would you deal with a day to day so it's probably not a surprise that we're up to week seven but me and it just seems like this whole season is just fly by very fast\nYeah of all the sports seasons that there are out there high school football has to go the quickest because really you think about it I mean you have\nEleven weeks to get ten games in and that's all you're guaranteed I mean a lot of the other sports um you know maybe ... some of the springs sports kind of flight whether in that short season a little bit but it seems like once a season get started in high school football at the end of August\nNovember first gets ear amazingly quickly\nAll right let's talk a little bit about the key games in AAA this week\nA couple of good ones are well I I Know we keep waiting for\nAnd it's hard to really be challenging the game and I've talked to a couple of times about teams that could potentially do that the the team they played two weeks ago out of Philadelphia but sure random Virginia\nAnnually is one of Martin sparks toughest opponents on their schedule so that should be a good test for the bulldogs is friday night they will play hosts to them Orangeburg six to know they're rolling along but there's another match up in eastern panhandle that could be more important to the overall cost AAA picture\nHedges villas five and one visiting undefeated Muslim and both of these teams came over to the north central part of the state last week Hedges villas five and one they're only losses to south Hagerstown Muslim and is perfect they had a heck of a defensive stand against Morgantown at pony Lewis feel last\nWeek to get a Thirteen to seven victory\nCouple other good games hurricanes in Huntington Huntington still undefeated at five and ... and certainly one of the top challenges for the triple a championship in Morgantown wheeling park willing park or just south of their first laws of the season and a a\nA dramatic fashion hooking ladder a by Parkersburg forty seven yards with six seconds left that gave wheeling party there first laws taking on a Morgantown team that's played a very very difficult scheduled for three and a free and they're going to need to get a couple of more wins are coming in to ensure a playoff spot\nYou know what Joey just got a text for you are you ready for it ... already there we go from the three or four six seven one day not that I'm a Martin's bird fan but live in Berkeley can I ask\nJoe how ... can be ranked regionally yet not number one in West Virginia they can beat any school in the state by at least forty five if they want to do thanks that's an interesting question I mean they are number one in Tripoli in the power rankings but in the U.S as they see rankings not not their\n... and the power rankings they ban I Believe these unanimous number one for all seven weeks so the the the writers and the broadcasters and the teams that\nSeem Orangeburg on a regular basis they know what they are uh thirty four game win streak until somebody is able to knock them off they are the number one team of the state of West Virginia that that with all due respect to spring valley and Huntington in Muslim and other teams that the way the as I say the rankings work and the reason that they're number three\nIs because right now spring valley\nIn Huntington have more bonus points than they do bonus points meaning you get points for the number of victories that your opponents have\nAnd it's just it's a it's a strength of schedule issue now mourns burst face a couple of teams are that haven't had strong scheduled to date but a lot of that becomes it's very difficult for Martin's or to get teams\nTo come and play them or to play them anywhere so at the end of the day once we're through the first week in November and the regular season is complete it's all going to work out you know ... as long as they're within the top two really there's not much of a difference between number one and number two if Martin's Burke wins out they'll certainly be top two at the at the end the regular\nJoe a couple of the other games that you looked at that are previewed at the website George Washington in Parkersburg Morgantown at wheeling park when you take a look ... up and the big reds and the Mohicans all three of those teams are three and three they're kind of up against it a ... in terms of trying to get into position for the\nPlayoffs yeah and as we talked about a couple of hours ago the teams from twelve to Nineteen all have three losses right now it's a blender of a lot of teams that\nYou have good tradition and are you know strong year to year but if you're sitting at three and three right now ... you know ... it's a very difficult mix to be and we're talking about Parkersburg hurricane university capital meddling GW in Morgantown and there's also Woodrow Wilson envy you that are have two and three records\nYou know at the end of the day you just like we saw last year we're probably going to see at least one AAA team with losing record certainly a couple with five and five records that are going to find their way into the playoffs\nSo while they may be a little bit uncomfortable right now sitting on the playoff bubble was sixteen teams in the playoffs and just twenty nine teams in class AAA\nYou know at the end of the day of five and five team or maybe even uh for one team is probably going to find their way and\nAll right so for example team like sell Charleston that's oh and five if they win out they would likely still make the playoffs right\nYou can make that case now certainly it it it's not the path you would choose who are alive but uh you know the least give some reason for hope that teams that are on the bottom end of the standings right now could still find a way in All right a\nDouble A. you found a couple of games that you previewed in fact you put those up today but I don't want to ask you about pheromones senior I mean they've just been a juggernaut this year they're killing people what kind of shot this we're have against them this week we're spotted one\nThere are five and want to and a very strong team um they're only last came where they blew a huge lead against Kaiser Kaiser's of foreign one team but ah you know we're fighting through some injuries lately telecom rescue their quarterback has missed a couple of games\nUh you know speaking about pheromones senior we keep waiting for somebody to challenge them we're could potentially do that but a fair amount of feet and a lot of good teams and handle a a throughout the season every single opponent that they've had when they played them\nHas been five hundred or better they beat in Bridgeport handily they beat Robert C bird handily both those teams are very good university high by forty three points to most lopsided victory or in the series between those two teams so you know I I Know it sounds like we're on a collision course for repeat a fair amount senior in Bluefield\nThere's a lot of other teams that can probably stake a claim a you know Nicholas counties undefeated pocus undefeated point pleasant still undefeated but pheromones senior I'd I'd say deservedly the number one team right now\nAll right so you'll do your preview with three class a games tomorrow so I don't want to tip your hand on this thing but is there anybody in that field that can give wheeling central a game\nOr a good question [laughter]\nI mean to be honest ah Lindley did for about three quarters last week a played very competitively but then wheeling central pulls away late and they get a Seventeen point victory um you know it it's going to be very very difficult based on the margin of victory that wheeling central put up against a lot of teams you know the the season opener against Williamstown", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Charleston", "day":
