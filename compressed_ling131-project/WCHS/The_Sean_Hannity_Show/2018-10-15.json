conviction a late in the day I'm of an outlaw free\nAnd the Supreme Court justice and now he's awaiting sentencing today was supposed to ban the start of the trial for a Margaret work when the chief justice her impeachment trial there was a ruling that came down by I call them that kind of an acting Supreme Court or a fill in Supreme Court last week that said what the house dad was\nUnconstitutional because he didn't follow their own rules\nAnd so that really put a a you know really stopped it stop the workman and peacefully trough from happening today so what is the Senate going to do\nThe Senate said today basically that the Senate leadership there they're going to ask that court to reconsider\nAnd I would look for the house of delegates to jump in here to see because they were not really named in the lawsuit against the Senate to try to stop the Senate from the impeachment trial it's really the house it was named all through this ruling\nDisorder that came down so look for the house also to get involved in this and house speaker Roger hand show not at all happy with the ruling because he said that you can't tell the house what to do it's a separate you know to separate that body of the government\nA point in the ruling disagrees with that because they say you you know there are several things in the ruling that disagree with that so we'll see where it goes\nBottom line is that workman's impeachment trial did not start today and uh it's you know very much if this court order sticks uh it's very much up in the air to breath has that story also from the court today Robin Davis remember her\nRetired impeach justice of the court um who is still scheduled to go on trial on impeachment she now has to be part of the ruling that favored work met\nHer attorney said filed a motion to say hey you know working in the house took similar steps against me a Davis says so I shouldn't have to go through an impeachment trial either\nSo they filed and now the new Supreme Court today has two new members are ... that ah they along with them a justice a Walker a\nPuff pharaoh who's on the court now and workman today had a judicial conference and they came out in support of the ... we don't know what the vote was but the majority of the court come out and support the amendment that would that we're going to be voting on in three weeks that would give the legislature control of the court's budget uh\nYou know more control of the court's budget than they currently have good grief ... so it's all you know and then tonight Dave the wishes you bar

for [laughter] I don't know what the answer is as far as what a an appropriate post game a decorum is\nMay ... you know ... this issue of storming the field after the game by the way the networks love it when this happens you know that\n... you know the I Love they were probably forty USA Today photos from that [laughter] exact from all different angles\nAll right so let me ask you ... you know here's the elephant in the room what is going on with West Virginia is often what does the problem\nWould ... it was it the competition they were playing at the beginning of the year and maybe we should have seen this when they had to play a a team that was a little better but why is once would you use often so ineffective right now what what's happening what's changed\nYou know I feel like we saw this last year where the more tape\nOr they put they put out there for people to scout or by the second half of the year the more things get figure it out or\nI feel like the thumb is less Dennis parts you know that I go back to gave last year where they moved the ball up and down the field of K state and wound up with twenty points or they had a ton of scoring early against Baylor that did nothing in the fourth quarter so\nI don't feel like this often over the last year and a half has risen to the situation you know whatever whatever at the moment demanded haven't always seen it rise to that you know there's somebody ... we've got to give up thirty or forty well then you've got to go get forty five or fifty there's other\nNights like a Saturday names were really for for three quarters you just needed\nTo nickel and dime your way down the field get a touchdown get a couple of field goal is to mitigate things and they couldn't even do that um I think they all want a serious problem I think we'll Greer has been in a two game font unlike anything we've seen\nI don't know if if if he's trying to make plays without being able to trust\nHis off into blind or or if he's just you know in a mindset of of not being disciplined and and really really\nAre getting antsy to hit a big play it because as you know\nI'm the only real thrill of any of any magnitude the other night was that there are down touchdown pass to David cells and then after that they took to deep shots and\nOne was sort of open but it had no chance of working cause the receiver went one way that throw went the other end of the other wound up being an interception that just didn't come out of hand very well and it was in the devil covered that I think he just got impatient\nAnd and that can happen when you're used to running Seventy Seventy five snap and you're sitting there in the third or fourth quarter and you've got you know in the mid thirties yeah like they were playing army or something I mean they just they just totally uh mitigated but but the reason that got mitigated if they didn't extend drive\nTo get those extra snap so\nUm there's a lot to say I'm not sure they can do at a hearing the by week but uh you know there's a lot of wonderful games on the schedule and that's what we saw the other night several lose ... wants to ...\n... that's exactly right so in your opinion do you think the by week is come with their rights bumper West Virginia they they are they are Nick ups I I'd like to get your take on that\nAnd do we have any insight into a ... the injury situation of guys like ... brown and Dylan ... do I will any or all of those guys be out for an extended period of time\nWe'll have to see a lettuce injury did not look bad last week and he was on the

I'm going to stick with my over five hundred prediction I had I'm losing to in the state in our state at this point\nSecond half of the season meltdowns usually happened under Dana because we start playing quality opposition Dana should've been gone three years ago he's kept out um he's mediocre we can't beat teams with winning records\nThat aren't a junior college level if you don't believe me I'll send you the stats are but the one we got a couple of angry textures here are from the three or four or five or six Dave I think a West Virginia goes seven and three\nAh wins\nOver Baylor in Oklahoma State law says to Texas and Oklahoma\nA book about three or four for for for hey Dave no one without the west Virginia was a playoff team either or doesn't know football where they've been listening to the metro news WB Homer say way too much [laughter]\nKeep playing Kansas at home and there'll be eight in three that's labor either shots fired shots fired a one more from the three or four four one zero day be ... has been lethargic for three games I'm a diehard fan\nBut mid season collapses or Dana's calling card bus borrow yeah uh this season looks pretty damn\nAlright alright I kinda thought we might get a little bit more positivity there but ah they it is what it is All right\nLet's go ahead and get Christian burst into the mix it comes to us from the entertainment capital of the world Los Angeles California we missed you Kristin last week thanks for coming on the show\nThat was in Philadelphia hoping to get a little properly edging in\nThat it was hot air yeah do you uh you know what I like Philadelphia did you get a chance to do anything where you were there\nI did I Would never work but I was able you are in my mind like I I did the rocky scares of course an independent\nOf course I did the liberty bell whenever I could do a great day\nThere you go there you go hey you know the Alec Baldwin talk show a I looked at some of the numbers are premier last night on ABC hey I forgot it was even on and it it drew like zero for rating and only pulled in two and a half million viewers what's the problem\nI think it's Alec Baldwin honestly and you know and it was just thinking about this and you know we talked about that that's where she clinical\nI don't think I Want him as a talk show her and it got me honestly doesn't matter whether you're on Alec Baldwin died clinically or not I mean I thought the guy I think all of us are getting a lot of the ... when it comes in the news cycle to them and it carries over into ... me I Want to escape and honestly I\nAm watching more movies and watch all the things that make me feel good and I think having a talk show and that we were sure where it's going to have a little bit of the political ... it's just a lot\nYeah I you know I agree with the a lot of that you think we also could be going through a maybe a little over exposure for Alec Baldwin now I mean he's hosting game shows on ABC or we see him virtually every other week now on Saturday Night live maybe maybe we're just not ready for a talk show from the guy\nIt's entirely possible\nAt the Knight is a little weird too because you have America's funniest videos it leads to dance and it starts juniors and then they take the laughing ... the shark tank and then it takes her writing because the alcohol and I'm not sure that their strongest light up either\nWhat do you think you know um he had to narrow on last night now a Robert De Niro is a fabulous actor there's no doubt about that but what if it had been you know or maybe a celebrity\nOr who knows like a Taylor Swift or are you on a ... day or something like that a lot of a lot of times these shows are driven by who's on another host\nAbsolutely uh next week we'll be attachment to whether that is the truth because came crashing ... is his dad and his only get that entire hour\nThat I couldn't tell you I'm someone that I crashing the heat I won't even tuna and if there's a couple of like highlights the next day I'll check it out and honestly nothing\nAll right All right a lot of chatter today about first man of the movie about going to the moon\nI'm never really got off the pad or this weekend venom and the stars sports that much much better at the box office that that is kind of surprising um I thought it would do better but then again you know maybe I'm kind of a target audience that I didn't go see it\n[laughter] you're like well there you go I mean and that's the thing I mean there's so much going on at the time of year you you had\nReally wrong it really is right now than I Am sorry weren't are performing their initial expectation doing universal scheduled first man they didn't think that they were going to have any of the head to head competition\nI think first man does have legs nobody is going to continue in the world show he then Ryan Gosling as one of the front runners to be nominated for best\nFor this film so I have a feeling that the particular movie is a long game of eighth animal eventually drop off a stark one will probably have some award show potential so I think that the first man might have a second went\nYou know it's funny a when you take a look at the box office at the bar for box office numbers this weekend the reviews for first men have all been generally very positive uh but that has not been the case for venom most of the critics hated this film but people were were storm and to the theater to see it\nThat is right there are certain movies that are absolutely correct group and I always say like an Adam Sandler movie from time to Kevin Hart where they can be easily credit for that than just show up\n[noise] All right let's talk a little bit about Mary Lou Retton of him you know what I'm surprised you and I have not had a discussion about her on dancing with the stars you know what are you seeing eye because you're kind of my expert when it comes to these types of shows\nMary was really interesting 'cause normally gymnast you very very well and they make it into the finale struggling a little bit but I don't think she's struggling with the dance I have to be honest about this I think she's doing a beautiful job she's in great shape she looks good her spirits are up\nThere is an and I think the article this weird little thing that lingering in the background and it really hasn't been addressed in the shows not going to address it but\nUm you know obviously Mary Lou Retton they're involved the gymnastics the Larry Nassar thing is I think Dana on you know the entire community for gymnastics\nShe didn't go about a year and a half ago to Congress I'm waiting USA Gymnastics to lobby and tents the athlete\nProtection do when it comes to sex and the thing that every thing at USA Gymnastics was okay and they didn't mean to fail so there are many gymnastics than which does cross over to the dance community were very upset and they're not voting for her\nYou know that's that's really interesting uh I really had lost touch with Mary Lou Retton and when I saw that she was announced for dancing with the stars I Googled her and I saw this story and it was really surprised by it ah it it really is a kind of a very different view of that situation not very popular\nRight in your ... for um daughters who are in gymnastics into a lot of people don't understand the position she does say she was told by Larry Nassar and everything that he represented however she really had to discuss why she went to Congress that day and talked with a\nLot of our legislators about this particular bill um and I don't know if she ever well he's not going to do it on dancing with the start but I Would love for someone who has\nOr on their talk show or something and get her in a non confrontational way 'cause I think that there's probably an interesting answer behind all that of\nCourse in one more thing for you do a lot of talk about what we were talking about Alec Baldwin and maybe people having Alec Baldwin fatigue I got to tell you I I think I have royal baby fatigue but I get a better uh forget about that if it's going to ramp up again\nYeah I was just like

can play physical that's not going to be be WB football\nYou know we we talk so much about the off in a West Virginia is often says wasn't on the field enough and the money they ... they only had forty plus all kinds of snaps and they converted their first third down conversion attempt in Ames and then they were over the rest of the game I'm\nIn a ... you make an interesting point about the Iowa State showed the blueprint on how to show West Virginia down off instantly 'cause I I I think you're exactly right obviously the the rest of the teams West Virginia is going to play they're taking a look at this well\nAnd and think about it from this this prospect asked yourself\nWill those front force\nWill vary blitz things schemes be better than what our state has flavor mouth or do you think Oklahoma Oklahoma City Oklahoma Oklahoma State do you think they're defensive lines are going to be better than I Will say\nWell you know that that that's debatable that's that's debatable because when you take a look at what here's the thing every time and we do this as fans yeah and I think we do this was the media to half way don't want to give the opposition any credit at all it's all about you know they are that they didn't beat us we lost the game that that sort of thing I\nI Would say the week before they played yes Virginia yes I mean they had I Want to say sixteen taco for losses on the road\nAt Oklahoma State they had seven ... seven different defensive players in that game they just sort of continue the trend against West Virginia their defense pretty good but the other point I was going to make is you know\nOklahoma's defense is kind of a hot mess right now I mean they just fired their defensive coordinator they've been given up a ton of points that Iowa State show opponents West Virginia's ... the planned to shut down there often maybe they did but I I I'm just given a lot of credit die with state they played a great\nGame well and then you could make the case to can Eighteen or will Eighteen actually come in and run the football like that um they have that guy that kid that's a bruising back that defensive backs just don't want to tackle\nCricket you know what I'm Glad you brought that up\nYou know I was watching the game last night I'm not a patriots guys a Steelers fan I don't like the pay tired of at All right but I'm just laying that out there but I have to tell you one ... gets the football when they throw it to him people do not want to engage them I mean he rarely gets tackled what happens is\nHe punishes a defensive backs are linebackers we tried to cover him and he basically a gets knocked out of bounds he rarely goes down who's the toughest guy you were headed to tackle\nProbably Walter Payton what I mean you know I I played Earl Campbell Pete Johnson you know I I faced all of those kind of back\nI'm grateful backs but Walter Payton was just so aggressive in wanting to create contact even the big guys they you know and even big tide ends you you just knew they were going to try to run you over so you you typically just kind of cut them down and whatever\nAnd you kind of survivor I hate 'em you know you got a guy like Eric Dickerson who's going to be six for two twenty five that's you know just an amazing athlete but Walter Payton man he you know by the time he did to me he's he's like thinking oh I can win this\nThe time he's going to school and he's going to store he just feels like he's going to end you know in your mind you're thinking to yourself like oh my goodness this is not the contract I Want\nSo you're trying to find a space to hit him and he's trying to find a space to hit you he's not running out of bounds he's throwing a format you it's almost like it's there for almost like a punch [laughter] you know and so\nI Would say he by far to me was the worst\nGuy because like I said a big a big guy can't protect himself down low but Payton was short stout big fat\nSo where to hit them you know what a we've done a lot of shows together and I've ... I've never asked you this what I'm watching the game last night the patriots and the cheese and it's a fabulous game mhm forty three to forty lots of our fence seems going back and forth\nAs a former defensive back what do you think would you watch a game like that would you rather watch a game that like fourteen seven or would you rather watch a game looked like forty three to forty ...\nI'd much rather see a deep it's a game I Would I Can't I Can't do is I Can't watch\nForty three forty one game and all these long passes and you know you're you're talking about fifty passes and and guys just catching a ball of like a nightmare to me like I mean it's like watching a scary movie and then it's hard to critique these guys because they're good I mean they're great\nWhat they're getting there so many balls being thrown at him you just can't make plays on that many balls you're going to get beat if the team throws the ball fifty five sixty times we I mean there's no way you can witness\nYeah Jim cities a lot of fun to watch yeah a lot of fun to where I saw that now we talked about just briefly the three o'clock hour that bell jak with the with the patch is thirty nine to know when they score Fortier bore let's say what Casey gave them a pretty good run last night\nThat's a good football team is a good football too you know who knows I don't want to admit this as a Steeler fan but that game last night patch she just might be a preview of the AFC Championship game very well body could be yeah we'll take could break in or out his next they doing\nA retirement plan demise for your name wrong larvae the wealth management no matter what stage of letting your in\nR B the wealth management will work with you to organize your finances and utilize\nThe right strategy so you can retire the way you want to they'll they'll help create an income during that covers your lifestyle and unforeseen expenses to ensure you don't outlive your retirement savings\nGet delivery complication and R B the wealth management dot com Charleston are being the bumps management division of ... the capital markets number and why in the ...\nAre you looking for a new pharmacy or you tired of being just another number in line and this is Lynn for it I'm inviting you to consider making Britain pharmacy the home from all your pharmacy me\nTransferring is as easy as making a call downloading an ad for dropping your prescription bottles ... a man\nThree local delivering we can even date you travel through your hometown family farmers\nAre you in or are you out wind up next on them\nIt was a national outrage mine when cart jacking up the price of life saving medicine by\nFive hundred percent the same company that was forced to pay off four hundred and sixty five million dollar settlement for ripping off taxpayers parents and children were suddenly unable to afford critical health care but one senator defended mind when Joe mansion mansion said this about\nMine when those are companies and we're proud of in West Virginia and it's a company that I Know\nYou weren't too Joe Manchin has received nearly three hundred thousand dollars in campaign cash from Ireland and that's just the start mansions donor is Milan CEO she makes Thirteen million dollars no wonder mentioned defended\nViolin profits not struggling West Virginia patients it's time for a phony\nShow to go Senate leadership on people responsible for the content of this advertising not authorized by any candidate or candidates committee WWW dot Senate leadership ... dot org\n... for instance tallies are just to point abortion right up to the very moment of American it's shocking shameless and\nTallies are just supports abortion on demand with no restrictions inform under each girl\nAbortion extremism tally sergeants views on abortion\nThat's why she's wrong for West Virginia it's official West Virginians for life have endorsed conservative Alex ... for Congress a pro life champion and family man Alex ... is a leader in the fight to protect the lives of unborn baby in Congress conservative Alex ... co sponsored legislation\nFunding for abortion the lead sponsor of the life of conception Alex looney believe all\nThat is why he defends the sanctity\nOf life congressman Alex ... working for West Virginia\nI'm Alex Rudy and I approve this message\nPaid for by Mooney for Congress\nFive eighty WC a jazz loves to make our listeners winters but to do that we all have to follow some rules\nLike winters have to be at least they tend to take on their prize can only went once the thirty days must pay applicable taxes and only one winter per household per contest is permitted it'd be a love to win\nThis year to read all the contest roll toasted at five eighty W C.

Charlie toil oh who am I thinking of a racquetball Delhi just got interviewed for this job who's the smart money on\nYeah you pretty much the the binder to keep track of all the candidates that they'd be going after which at least tells me they're being pretty thorough about this process which is something they've insisted they were going to\nBe from the start ah and I applaud them for that regardless of how I helping shake out because it does seem like they've been very broad in their search uh they've they've been going after you obviously as a shortage on sale of one world series titles before a half years of managing big time games under their belt\nUh they've also been going out for guys who were the up and Congress and I think it's also interesting if you look up at a\nUh the teams that are now making waves in the playoffs this year uh where are those managers came from a pretty mixed bag as well I look at the guys like credit counseling Dave Roberts a manager of the ... version the Dodgers\nAre those guys didn't have extensive managerial experience at all when they got those jobs are same was caught up in Boston too um I I I ... cautiously\nThinking that the reds are probably going to do with a guy like John Sarah or Joe Jr already if they can convince them that they're the best opening a this particular uh uh all season because there are a lot of other teams that are out there looking for managers um they've mentioned that they want to face it the franchise and that's the one catchphrase that\nHas kind of jumped off the page at me I especially in the wake of um you know the ... where they were with a guy who'd never been a manager before either and we all saw how that worked out but ah I I still think there's a lot of dark horse candidates I'm a Knicks decided as anybody to see which they drew direction they go 'cause you can certainly make an argument about four different ways\nAll right um the the the fact that the reds have interviewed a dozen candidates are so when they may interview more the although they are saying that they want to have a a new manager on line by the end of the month the fact that they interviewed so many candidates doesn't that basically say the gym riggleman is not going to get the job\nI think it probably does a ... I'm pretty open about a acknowledging that throughout the process as well I eat and then she said something about a week or so ago that he was willing to stay on with your organization or in some capacity even if he doesn't get the manager job in a you know he's he's always been a couple of the guy from the\nUh the fiasco and Washington he's always been a well respected guy within a within a lot of organizations and a bit of life or in baseball and I think he's spent you know obviously he was\nThird base coach before he was bench coach for several years before taking over some of our mentioned this year so he's been around for a lot of this ... ... and I think he's the kind of person that I think at age sixty five I kinda watch to see how it turns out\nObviously I think if you asked me would love to say he'd want to be the manager because who wouldn't want to be um but I Do think he's kind of committed just sticking around in some a form and fashion if\nDoesn't get this job but I agree with you I think all the signs point to then go on with a different candidate\nHey wick is currently how are you I'm good thanks [noise] hey is there any connection of like what Cincinnati what the team is like and getting a manager that is that can\nCoach that team or does it matter in baseball I Know football you typically bringing a different style do they have the players and make that change how does that role how does that play into how they pick up our coach\nYeah that's a really good question I you know Mitch Brian price and his uh his a multi year tenure I came on is pitching coach and so much about this rebuild was trading away guys like Mike leak and Johnny quite out what Matt wages are bringing in a fleet of what should have been the next great uh Cincinnati Reds rotation or\nYou know like the guy's a brand new sitting and John Lam a Cody read uh even the young guys in the system like Robert Stevens and they had a lot of quote unquote you know top one hundred prospect guys\nThat should have been able to take that next step a and having a pitching coach like brand price raw\nRunning the ship you kind of thought hey that's the perfect way to go about this rebuild he should be able to have an impact\nTheir ah that that worked out obviously and the reds pitching this year even after price last ah didn't suddenly get better so I think what they have to do is look up and say hey\nDo we go out and get a guy who's got a great education work with pictures a former pitching coach\nOr John Farrell is are pitching coach of before we get a job in Toronto in Boston or Joe Jr already longtime catcher obviously worked extensively with pictures over the years\nOr is that something they try to factor in and say hey can we get somebody to help more we've already got or did they bring in a guy with a new philosophy and say hey we made a mistake we didn't get to a good enough players\nWere bringing in this guy let them make decisions and we're going to go out and get the kind of players that said his bottle and uh yeah I think they could go either way this particular winter that's part of what I'm interested in seeing as\nTheir time might have happened a guy by the end of October suggests to me that they are going to go manager first and then go hit the free agent and trade markets to get something to fit that\nAh and the credit to see which way they go\nTo tell you what the ... whoever they hire they got a lot of work to do coming off in the last season when you know you you write for red reporter and and you're following this very closely I mean if I'm Joe Jr already let's let's role play here I'm Joe Jr already\nTried to convince me that Cincinnati is a good landing spot for me remember I've been the manager of the Yankees I got a World Series championship in two thousand nine why would I Want to come to a team that some in another rebuild\n[noise] well that's a very good question I mean he he obviously that equate extensively with uh in Chicago so we spent time in the division in his career he wins the Miami Marlins before it took over the Yankees jobs ... is is guys\nFans managing at least a slightly smaller a smaller payroll team to um I think it's got you got to look up at the at the options here or there are only thirty of these jobs\nAre in the world and there's only so many of them open ... given time are you already set this season out and you look up at some of the other openings out there are a lot of age was angels I think are the big wildcard and all this because they're the only team out there that can pitch\nA a major market like that and my ... on the roster already\nAre but aside from that the options aren't exactly uh you know draw or these so to speak you got the Baltimore Orioles who are completely dismantling things or the Minnesota Twins who just fire to form a hall of famer and team legend and Paul ... author or their seemingly in a little bit of ... well I think if you look\nAt what the reds have aside from the pitching they've got a lot of really good players right now obviously it hasn't translated into wins because they've had a terrible pitching staff ah but if you've got the commitment from the from\nAn office to say hey we're going to ramp a payroll significantly which they cross my fingers they said ah maybe they can go out and get enough pitching to pair with the position players they've got\nAnd you can see that a year or two years down the road this is the club that could make some ways\nYeah ah by the way we're talking about George Romney ... interviewed with the Texas Rangers as well before we move off this topic\nBut the very lurking situation I mean a lot of people are when they looked at the the reds job opening up\nThought it will be a natural you're talking about you know guys like Cora in Aaron Boone and a AJ Hinch in them and those guys who really didn't have a lot of managerial experience but were former players and then stepped up and and as big league managers\nYou know a very Larkin basically says he he's not interested in managing the reds right now but if the reds hire a manager that successful this it could be years before this job opens up again\nYeah that's a it's a tricky is very very tricky scenario I you know I grew up in in that election they Kentucky just down the road from Cincinnati Reds fan from the moment I could see that no one sided with pretty\nMuch the best and very large in and he was by far and away my favorite player growing up ah from Cincinnati or or one team guy plan for the reds his entire career\nOr he really is as much of an embodiment of the\nModern Cincinnati Reds era is there is and\nUh it's a big commitment to tide seeing this last Ninety plus games for years in a row to a guy that that uh you know a legendary with the team that really is a legend with a team um so I I think it it was a pretty mutual dollars meant that the concept seems okay in a vacuum but given word this franchise is right now\nUh if anything doesn't work out other than awesomely ... as suddenly you're you're dragging very dark and into this mix of a downward spiral with the organization and I'm just not sure it was the best time for all parties involved ah but yeah it's the idea that I think ... down the road at some point\nOr could ask them to liberty and I did read through better I think I did a little bit more of a fan of the idea is that but what\nAre we finally I mean it's game three of the national league championship series tonight ... swinging back to LA the brewers and the Dodgers\nTied at one in his best to seven doesn't what Milwaukee did this year uh give hope to the other teams in the central division like the reds and the pirates but you know you can turn this thing around and make a deep run into the playoffs if you make some decent moves and you get some good pitching", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Charleston", "day":
