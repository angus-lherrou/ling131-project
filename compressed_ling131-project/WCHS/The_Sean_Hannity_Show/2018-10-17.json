now at eight hundred to nine five ten forty six eight hundred to nine five ten forty six\nGetting up to date\nOr the question is whether or not it's going to happen with this Porto and it's worth noting by the way there are people inside the tech industry especially in the commentators and whomever\nWho have said you know they have Amazon echoes and a Google Home devices\nIn their homes already those things explicitly designed to sell you stuff right so it's not like this is ... super new and I think part of the problem is we're living in an age where Facebook\nIs it has screwed up so many different ways in so many different times Cambridge Analytica they're the largest heck they ever had and then the announcers ... like a week and a half later and don't even mention it all these types of things are happening\nAnd where suddenly supposed to trust them that's very tough whereas Amazon there isn't really a trust issue going on right like I Know they want to sell me stuff they're going to sell me a little device that makes my life a little easier and then return I'm going to help them sell me stuff so it it's about what is the agreement here and Facebook has not\nBeen a very good at making sure it's clear what that agreement is when you buy it\nAll right I'm going to make up a just a a deal with you that we won't discuss the portal next week I Can't talk about this every single week films\nThat are there and there's another thing cop and he I don't know and it's supposed to come out and a couple of weeks so eventually will ever have you and then we're going to talk about that\nYou know what I Love the story you send me though about pom pom crazy come back I mean ... ... virtually anybody who has a high end smartphone at some point how to palm right\nWell yeah I said that's what I Love about this is that you know for those of us who remember like the early days of the hand\nHeld stuff right there was obviously that apple Newton which is you know forever enshrined in and there's a special device and then there was palm which was really the first company to offer somewhat affordable handheld devices by the way those of you who were super nerds might remember hands praying that was I was in campaign spring way back when [laughter] so now\nYou've got a they're coming back they have these new phones that they're announcing it's very weird though we've video and photo and seeing that you should take a look 'cause it's a mini phone it's actually very very very tiny smaller than even the original life on which today looks like a little ... next year big phone\nBut it's supposed to be the idea is that it's not a replacement phones it's one that you would put your like massive phone away during you know when you want to go out to a club with friends or whatever and you carry this with you and it's designed to do less stuff so that you're able to be more in your life\nI don't know if it's going to sell very well but it's an interesting idea and it's certainly a commentary on today\nI think the the interesting part about this story is the price point I mean if you don't want to spend a thousand dollars on the phone this palm device and you're you're right it's small it's only three and a half inches long um it costs three hundred and fifty dollars which is a pretty good price point\nWell yeah but I have to jump in and remind you you still have to have another phone this is not the\nRight side of the ... you are going to send you a thousand dollars on their phone and then you're adding three hundred and fifty on top which is why this is a little weird\nYou know it's it's not a it's not a ... phone it's a it's a companion device one of my favorite tweets that went out is that someone was kind of doing the forehead slapping they said great we've reached a point now where your phone needs a phone [laughter]\nThat that's a that's pretty funny [laughter] you know you were talking about are taking your kid out for Halloween and you wrote this article about your kids hate your smartphone addiction and I don't know what that is a ... that that's a really good topic\nI Know what the reason I wanted to write this or I I have a two and a half year old and very open about my struggles with technology around him and one of the things that I really wanted to talk about my wife and I have had a lot of conversations and you know conversation is a euphemism for many\nI'm with you know how to pay\nWhen our health insurance renewal notice arrive last fall my wife and I made the decision to drop our plan with the monthly premiums and deductibles we'd have to pay thirty thousand dollars just to use it\nSo we did our homework and switch to ... share the cost savings are incredible over five hundred dollars a month and we don't have to pay for services we don't need or don't agree with [noise]\nThen out of the blue she had to have emergency surgery scary stuff a hundred fifty thousand dollars in hospital bills and met a share members took care of everything all we paid was our small portion\nI'm a doctor who's been in health care for Twenty years and this is one of the most impressive programs I've ever seen\nThank God she's fully recovered and now we're telling everyone about measure\nCalled eight five five Bible eleven to find out how much you can save on your healthcare met his

is known for this and they found a\nA dance color who are now his Jewish dance and so if this is traditional Jewish music\nFrom Eastern Europe and we will learn some dances and now you don't have to

and if it's free it's for me and that's tomorrow night seven to ten at the temple Israel on ... east\nHere in Charleston is part of a festival fall you know let's let's just talk a little bit about plus more music and it basically comes from Eastern Europe but the people who migrated to the United states\nThis music or gotten heavily involved in jazz American jazz too that's that's where it originated right\nWell it originates in Eastern Europe okay it was originated as the traditional I'm Jewish I I like to say every uh every culture is their version of polka music or you could say blue grass music the music that you would have an any festival and so this was the kind of music you would have a Jewish wedding\nUm you would bring out the news you know every you have to have your musicians to dance to\nAnd this was a tradition of Eastern Europe various places I'm I'm I'm not the expert so I Can't tell you exactly\nBut it was the Ashkenazi Jews um there are two different segments of choose the U.S can I see in the ... and this is the Ashkenazi Jews who are ... speaking Jews from Eastern Europe\nNow what you said it's absolutely true when you have this wave of migration into the U.S in the late Eighteen eighties and early Nineteen hundreds you had this means that kind of moving in and then in the twenties and the teens meeting American jazz\nAnd then it started taking on some different flavors too and it has continued and now I I people now of course write their own classroom music in that vein\nSo this group is for a million or wherever and are looking at the picture and I was listening to some of his music up in the office before we started the show I see an accordion I see a clarinet a violin I'm actually drums there\nWill be addressed at guitar player or it's going to be five pieces actually I have to admit the accordion player will not be there oh [laughter] that's our it's false advertising but the clarinet and the violin are sort of the lead voices of the ... band\nYou know what a coup play a little bit more this what's that a little bit more clothes more music and if you close your eyes you can almost hear this music is kind of a soundtrack to some of those old Woody Allen pictures here here's another example of it [noise]\nI got to admit I like this\nAre generally tell me more about the dance of there'll be dance instructor\nAnd that yes there will be in usually with foot mad there if they call them a dance caller okay I'm although I'm not sure how this will work with this kind of music um it's part of her ... her own personal tradition was dancing at many Jewish weddings herself\nAnd so I'm curious to see what it's going to be I Know but the most well known probably Jewish dance has to ... which is I Believe a dance you dance in a circle and probably similar to like the Greek dancing that you might have seen\n'em so I'm guessing there might be a little bit of that but I'm kind of excited to see what this is myself\nWas saying what Julia appreciate your coming in Julie Adams telling us about close my phonic that is going to be here in Charleston tomorrow night it's free seven to ten at the

the system of the fan base is\nGoing into the season all the questions are really on the defensive side of the football there was nobody out there thinking that West Virginia wouldn't be able to move the ball when you've got Greer and you've got that ... and we talked about this a couple of weeks ago you know statistically this could be the best ... West Virginia has ever had\nHad a computer in the defense play great I mean if you think about it they kept it within six for how long and it was just kept three in out three and now I think Brad house said the longest drive the they had was five play you know it's crazy didn't get on the other side of the body and your down how many linebackers\nYou can't ask the defense to do that you've got to do something special team stepped up that you're back in the ballgame offense\nNothing you know it's funny we're on game day talking during the game last week and I I was just sitting there watching the game thinking you know I don't care what the score is it's a one score game early in the fourth quarter you know that big eighty yard touchdown is coming\nRight but it never did on the road you know just get it done get the when get out just like\nHow many weeks in a row have we said you just need to score one one touched down in the game Kansas yeah in the state they just needed one more touchdown\nAnd they couldn't get it All right well what's your take on the off week coming at the right time it's a perfect time and the next opponents the perfect opponent because Baylor it's not that strong hopefully you can just right the ship because\nYou're comes murders road we've talked about it all year and now the the bad thing is your your plate your performance is going down ... you're not trending up turning down so it makes you wonder what's going to happen in November\nAnd that was one of the things that we were talking about over the weekend that when you have a team that you think can be a special team once the season begins you gather momentum you can see guys playing better every week that really hasn't been happening with these guys\nKnow and it's unfortunate and especially the expectations and and yeah fans are losing their minds and I get that and you have every right you've been sold a bill of goods this year that this is going to be the best teams and you know who knows when and then you watch them play\nAnthony I got a ton of text messages when we had a question of the day similar to this about what a realistic expectations fence and things like top ten finish anything less than a championship would be a disappointment you know the the fan base uh bought in there and they're still in I think this will look crazy\nWhen you start a ... campaign when you when the school puts it out\nYou know they've been putting that out all summer long in the in the talk has been there the expectations are high and and I think if you don't win nine ten doubled you know somewhere in there people are going to be upset you know there's some people that are OK with seven wins but this year is not the\nYeah I that's why you know it's interesting you mentioned the Heisman campaigns when the Internet was still relatively new the fact that a school would have a website that dedicated to or a player's Heisman chances that was kind of unique Joey ... yeah exactly but now\nI'm it's almost expected I think it is I mean virtually every player who has a hint of of being under consideration has a website I think if people are who have criticized West Virginia for having a website\nFor a will Greer in the ... I think the criticism would be a lot worse if they didn't write hey they decided not to do you\nHave to do it and and what that does is it keeps you relevant I mean it keeps your name out there that's West Virginia didn't drop that far and the rate rankings\nNo I'm not really he's still going to be talked about is the highest one candidate it's because the pre season it's he's in he's in the forefront of using the on the top you know top of people's minds so you know the only thing at this point for ...\nOr to get to New York he has to perform he's going to win or lose the husband in November oh no doubt you're right about the game the other night\nDidn't cost him anything is looking Baker may feel\nWe did a segment or a couple of weeks ago even before the Iowa State game on Heisman winners who had bad games and you'd be surprised there's some pretty interesting ones in there there was a game I Want to say with the year Ricky Williams Ricky Williams from Texas\nHe won the Heisman he had a game in his Heisman season which I think it was Ninety eight\nWhere they got beat by case dates like forty five to three and he did absolutely nothing in the game\nStill won the eyes man so what happens in ... when it in eighty four of flu to eat well yeah flew the one of a yes eighty four he wants but if you remember he played well against West Virginia well he yeah he threw for almost three hundred yards in that game\nThrough a couple of touchdown and had a touchdown called back by penalty now well\nYou know it but sometimes that lost people think because you lose you perform bad you know if he comes out and he lights up Oklahoma if he goes to Texas it performs well he's ... he's had in the New York yeah I think so too All right we'll take a quick break in or out his next\n[noise]\nYou didn't get to where you are today by running with her you blazed your own trail so why approach planning or financial future any differently at our BC wealth management our experience financial advisors help you accomplished your unique goals with an approach tailored to you\nThis is Jim goals be your branch director in Charleston is at my website Jim goals be dot com\nR.
