stuff came after post Beatles that's for sure like you know you're just cross examining no doubt no doubt I mean isn't this what's great about music though and and I answered your question that adult take rock music is dead I don't think any genre is dead um I think you just have to know where to look you know I think if you like any kind of music\nAnd you know sadly a lot of new music doesn't make it on commercial radio that's for sure I mean it's not the same as it used to be\nWell I I that's that's one of my other points about the American Music Awards us then listen I only checked in and out or on the show I didn't watch the whole show not appointment viewing for most people but if you take a look at what the American music awards used to be like ... um\nVirtually every act on the on the program would be from some guitar base to form of music are gay or yeah and that is just not happening now and I just wonder\nUm his rock marginalized ... this I mean if you're not seeing a these performers hockey to decide whether you like them\nOr that that's a great point that's a great point and I you know who knows how they figure out these that the award shows these days I used to

the thing when you take a look at your list it's all British [laughter]\nYeah I Know them and then we could always go to the American route but yeah that oh that would be a whole different subject but

years old that there are white and the cop and stack up I think again anybody\nAnd ah unfortunately\nThey're kind of like the biggest thing going right now as far as new in rock\nYeah there's a lot of

I mean that's that's that's what makes music too yeah her said I\nI mean I think I think they would just come because of the similarities and the vocal but if you look at the lyrics and again if you look at the rain and and just a musician show uh these guys they're not copying anything in terms of with\nA in terms of the earth in terms of of the I mean there are white and their own stuff they do

Do Ari what CDs in their [noise] probably um oh oh okay oh no I like the local music\nYeah there you go that's a good call we we played them on this show they're they're pretty good band and we know where they're from um [laughter] they make it hard and it doesn't make it harder to own a All right ah check what am I supposed to think about this we gave her Marshall\nYou know it'll be awfully telling a you know Old Dominion obviously or have they had all your season one in five or lowest probability team or in the ESPN FBI air uh to pull off the when I guess number thirty of Jay attack that lose the other five\nUm they've allowed at least twenty eight points that every game bail out over five hundred yards are total off at eight point some yard for play I mean so if if Marshall's office can't find footing here\nYou know the I think there's a lot of questions [noise] um you know there there were three struggles against middle Tennessee obviously are getting a new quarterback acclimated and and yeah missing some other pieces you are right guard out flat out for the season key on David started running back to the game and that can't be under state of the uh in terms of ... protection he's very good at that\nSo when you had a first time starter and you're seeing your best a past protecting the backfield or that's a problem but Old Dominion offers up a chance to really have the author of click a so you know if it doesn't do that then you know I think than there are lots of questions\nYeah I think so too you know just as a sidebar I really liked the fact that Old Dominion as in conference you as a I mean they got they got a nice basketball arena they got a lot of great history in basketball\nFootball I mean all they have to do is basically open the door and three guys from the seven five seven fall in there I mean they're in such a great area for recruiting you know I think it really benefits all of the conference usa\nYeah and that's the only people don't understand that's the only reason Virginia Tech was playing there began with no yeah that I you know that that's you know they go down there to get players\nOr you can say the same thing about you could say the same thing about other schools that are playing games at Old Dominion North Carolina I think we wake is coming in there next year everybody wants to players\nYep and then yeah we we've got a lot of kids out of that area a ... uh for one is that it was a big name that it's coming out of that area so a fertile recruiting veterans shore um you know and and you know that that's a obviously a plus for for Bobby watered idea\nHey listen you wrote about Alex Thompson and heard zone dot com earlier this week you know I I don't think it's unfair to say he showed a lot of rust a against middle last friday night he hadn't played into why what's he like what what's that what's Thompson all about\nIt is an interesting guy he is a you know he's come from a Chad Pennington mold\nI'm certainly the first time I met him um when you came in for his visit I got you get that impression of commands of room a six foot six to thirty or you know I wrote about the bronco scout coming in and and go on your which one is that ... years old the guy who looked the part you know\nLooks like a quarterback it looks like an NFL caliber quarterback it was a tough assignment last week because you're right I didn't nearly four hundred days since the last ticket ... he never taken an FBI snapped a sort of gave speak different\nAnd then you have a team you're playing a team middle Tennessee the blitz Seventy Seventy five percent of the time uh and and that really it it became tough sledding gay when\nA Marshall fell behind and middle Tennessee could put its ears back knowing the asked was coming\nAnd that's when things kinda kinda really uh went sideways or but it'll be interesting again is obviously an easier time it would be a district you but you know the numbers don't lie it's it's a it's an easier assignment for for him and he had a game under it's about a ... see what you can do on the road\nIt just noticed but I just noticed just watching the game last friday night that he uh Tom Brady we're just not on the same page Brady had a lot of targets a lot of those passes came in hot I mean there's no doubt you got a huge army\nHe's got a big argument you know we we didn't see it for so long and camp because he was recovering from his his shoulder injury that side of the matter to games Wagner last year or the ... remember that you know I agree and all through

awful lot of money on the bond market recently and and the bond market has had a flight to safety at ... by the treasury for ten years or the twenty year and that's definitely what we call the from the stocks are the more speculative kind of\nA nerve although I Can't say too much secular nation because a lot of fun will try to look for stuff that has really strong earnings\nWe have seen a big seller in a lot of the leaders say thought\nThat there is another thing going on here for killing managers may also be trying to protect the games that they've already made earlier this year from January until now I think probably done pretty well so they're locking in some games\nThey're going to have to report report this the course and and talk to their customers the investors that are either in the fall of the hedge funds or whatever they're in a because this was so computer generated I mean there was a lot of panic to a lot of panic by money managers\nI Will be anxious to see what happens tomorrow if we can find some support with begin to get the financials reporting tomorrow we had a ... enemy at Citibank\nThat is going to set the trend we had Netflix next Tuesday and now they only get into the big big name earnings season is that's going to be the whole deal they see how this goes expectations are high will it be enough to turn on the market around\nWell I mean the Dow is still north of twenty five thousand so I mean it ... when you hear a phrase like the Dow is down\nOver Thirteen hundred points in the last two days this is not the the the same kind of news that would be if this had happened Twenty years ago when the Dow was so much lower I mean what percentage is a proper correction\nSo what we we normally say ten to twelve percent is what we call intermediate correction\nThose are very normal they're very healthy they shake the market out a little bit we get news stock names that come on board and the new and in a new trend\nDon't know how long the correctional left off we get into all their markets that level is actually twenty percent or greater so we're right now we we have corrected definitely off the top it doesn't mean if you actually take a look though I 'cause I I Want to go back to put this in perspective so I'm looking at the NASDAQ right now and we had a whole back\nIn February it seems kind of scary it took more days to get down there than it did the last two big drop that we had but we but we still call that\nWe had another call back if I'm looking at my church here in April a again that one didn't feel it's hard because we sold off a little bit more slowly\nSo just again to keep it to respect that we get pulled back to the market for sometime this one did go pretty harshly in two days that the panic button was hit a but it doesn't mean you know that people should be worried about their four one K. is or anything else\nYeah nobody ever made any money by panicking a bit of a threat that the ... that's one thing though and I got to wrap it up here in New but the one thing that concerned me about yesterday's action\nIs that no there is an old Wall Street adage that you have reached their ... sent a Christian do all the correction when you have a ten to one ratio of people selling as opposed to buy in the daily volume we had that yesterday but today we still went down on almost five hundred and fifty more points\nYes we did um and as I say I think what everyone did after yesterday I think a lot of money I think there was a lot of hush hush meetings I think people were looking at their portfolios they were figuring how much they're up for the year and then I think they decided to yell at today\nWe're going to sell we're going to lock in some games and then you know selling the get selling began selling it gets more selling selling selling and so we need it to kind of stop we need things to calm down a little bit and then we'll see if we can bounce from here as I\nSay everyone needs to keep their eye on the earning the them which is a starting up and we're really going to get in the heat of it so when we talk next week we will have some names to see how they did a earning\nAll right they

spending a lot more time with your website lately and uh you guys are cranking out the original content will played well plates or\nThanks very much you know making taking advantage of all the opportunities we have to talk to players definitely more basketball coming up shortly is a practice or you know really starting to head into intense mode it's a season you know getting pretty close we've got the\nIntroductory scrimmage go blue debut next friday and pretty soon after that can be played some games\nYeah that's true hey listen you're the guy to ask this I was watching some of the coverage of the Big Ten basketball media today on the Big Ten network and I know the ... media day for ... days well when the big twelve media day for ...\nA big told me that they think of like next week that's one thing about going to be able to get out to it's just too close in the middle of football with all these other things you know it's\nIt's kinda tough come from far away I always get to the football when it's in July ... nicely time but you don't come in here at this point in football season all the travel going already it's just really too tough to squeeze in small\nRight so are you going to Ames oh absolute\nOkay so I did you know you probably already know this that he'll magic for Iowa State basketball is tomorrow night\nYeah and they have a volleyball game I think on Saturday morning Saturday afternoon issue so a big sports weekend a roll went out on campus for ISU\nYeah he uh he we talk a little bit about marshals first or a public basketball practice that's a week from tomorrow windows West Virginia's again\nWest Virginia's next Saturday okay I went to our next friday I'm Sorry to which is an off weekend 'cause there'll be viewed as the Thursday football game the following week against Baylor gotcha in or you don't have a pound into that so that will be our first you know kind of like the public will look at them out there\nNow right so what are your thoughts are you know what's your feeling telling you about West Virginia's game and I was date\nYou know there are just so much hoopla about their freshman quarterback right now and I\nDon't want to say that he can't do it again but you know or are they just so starved for you know a more successful there I felt like they've certainly been on an up or dark you know ... been comparison that they have all the going all the way back to a cynical ...\nUm you know it's got to be a lot of pressure on him and it's going to be a different kind of the things you've got to look at now I'm not going to say what's for dinner is going to come out and shut it down because he certainly looks like he has palette\nThat he's going to see things he has never seen before you know on the field this week it gets West Virginia as compared to what he saw last week against Oklahoma State\nSo abrupt pretty well first of all I'm ... there's a possibility that West Virginia might see multiple quarterbacks in the game right\nEh you know yeah\nMaybe but I think that's only of perjury struggle okay nothing that can't both really just playing that close with the ... cafe there might be a a riot if ... comes out stark on Saturday after\nThe game party had last week I'm just not sure how you can do that and you know I I don't know what the justification would be here's the guy who is played the best most recently how does he not start\nYou know the only way I Would see it as if he just has a total disaster you know falls on and maybe put somebody else on I think we're going to see a lot of rock party on Saturday\nYou know uh from what I can read this week his parents really didn't expect him to even play last week I guess the plan was for him to get in there and run they're often substantially but um you know suddenly the futures now for him\nIt was kind of odd you know he got out they just three or four snaps he had one carry from minus one yard in their ... widow over Akron now that was the only gave me a plate previously\nThere had apparently been some whispers around there that I get is really looking good and practice or those kinds of things that you know once the season starts\nHow many snap says you're thirteenth quarterback get it because they got two other guys that are going they kept goes down then sure he's the number two guy but you've gotten another guy that that looked real solid against Oklahoma at least so\nYou know it's just been really strange year across the board at college for quarterbacks that they can you remember another year where we've had so many number two guys and number three guys coming in and out being starkly\nThis pretty crazy I mean ... ... ... this was really an odd year from the aspect that there were so many new quarterbacks around the big twelve with the exception of West Virginia and let me ask you about West Virginia's often you know uh I think it's fair to say that last week\nA West Virginia one uh but they were not as impressive as maybe a lot of people thought a ... West Virginia gave up some sex last week\nI was state I mean when you take a look at what they did against Oklahoma State that seven ... sixteen tackles her last\nYou know I can West Virginia protect a pass or this week what makes you think that was what do you use often supply might be played better this week\nWell I Know that they are working a turn on red zone running the ball shortly already situations running the ball so that's one thing you know it's not going to be for lack of attention\nIt passed protection West Virginia gave up five facts last week I think one of them for sure maybe two of them are on will career or for not getting rid of the ball in a timely manner\nCouple of more breakdowns obviously like you said\nI think if that's the problem West Virginia leaves ... west go in the game a little bit more maybe goes to lead the brown has been a surprising like good blocker running back\nMark pettaway has been pretty good up past protection some maybe do a couple of those things put an extra body back there give him a little bit more time or hopefully pick up some of those breakdown\nAnd what do you think about the the atmosphere at Iowa State I mean this is a really big game for Iowa State in the fact that you know they went on the road they beat Oklahoma State they're coming back home it's under the lights West Virginia's undefeated in the top ten she'll be pretty crazy atmosphere\nIt's great it was great when they were three and nine in West Virginia without their their their fans get into it and a lot of ways it reminds of West Virginia fan but thank you know sort of a rural campus where you know the entire states where the mother obviously they have to compete with Iowa but in that area\nYou know it's all Iowa State and they get into it they support their team it's a really great environment and it's going to be difficult I I don't have any doubt West Virginia played in the evening once before out there and I was taken him out and there's all they can handle you know when the talent level definitely weren't comfortable so yeah that's a big plus for I ask you\nYou know what I was at your site and I was reading a little bit about march help that away and you know it's kind of interesting when you think about his first taste of it two years ago against our state the guy basically ran wild I mean a hundred and eighty one on thirty carries in West Virginia won that game by thirty\nYou know do you think maybe being back in Ames is going to give him a spark in this game Saturday\nKnow the thing that made him so good they're to me with West Virginia how to play the running it if I were pulling all a block around come through in our state just couldn't handle they couldn't do anything\nAnd I remember you know in warm up for watching the one guy go I Can't remember which direction it was which got was the one guy was addressed what all we're going that guy goes down on the first series I'll look up there is a big hole in here comes out to the line and I'm sure factors in play and hey wait a minute\nOh hey that's more they'll cut away what's going on so it really did come out of the blue now well that'd be ... you look to try to attack again in that manner sure ... you'll see if our state has figured out how to cover that and you know hey you know maybe the stars aligned to get a little bit\nAnd we had totally agree on the show yesterday and I asked him a about David Montgomery who didn't play last week for Iowa State or in their when at Oklahoma State and whether or not Montgomery might be the best running back that West Virginia could potentially faced this year or at least in conference play\nYou know Tony said he's not sure Montgomery is going to play what do you think\nI I think if if they've been kind of Korea about this as well but he had a big upper arm bruise apparently involved on the shoulder some to a you know they're not given total details on what the problem is that that's a big thing for running you know your ballot you're taking contact I'll let all the time you're shrug it off it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "11"}
