really really small uh my dad would end up we lived in Bridgeport my dad lived and worked in downtown Hartford so\nI knew that he would leave for work at seven thirty five in the morning so if I wanted to see him in the morning that's when I had to go up and need to keep my breakfast or go out and eat breakfast\nSo cheerios for years\nOr for at least when I was really really young had all of the president's on the back of the box and so when I was really really young that was what I read on while I was sitting there reading material so I learned the president's order when I was really really young too\nUh I don't know if I could recite him today probably come pretty close map you on a Twitter says Dave I think history is very important\nIf you don't know what happened before you're

thought it was more exciting than a Senate Judiciary committee [laughter] about it\nIt was it was exciting actually I I watch that I loved it I thought it was really really good\nIt was something different I think the NASCAR fans like\nThe regime was not bad I mean actually racing was pretty good you had a lot of drama built in\nAnd out of the day when I watched it I'm sitting there looking at it and they Marcus Smith and hats off to the folks at the Charlotte motor speedway that that made this call a couple of years ago realizing that October race wasn't on the way they wanted it to you know they weren't getting crowded on us it was kind of boring\nAnd the U.S you know people are coming out and do it but it's out of the maker changed put this and they brought in guys a company that pain for formula one and I say paint paint the the line on the track it may have early making ... book and it did it look like a formula one type facility\nOr you would see like it at a coda down in Austin, Texas that the only one part of what out later this year it looked really\nFestive in what way to look good on television and I thought I was pretty good racing to\nYou know I had a couple of a a regular listeners send me social media uh uh last week before the racing this is really stupid nobody knows what's gonna happen nobody's ever run on this track before and you know to my point was I think that was one of the most attractive things about the whole thing that nobody really knew what was going to happen\nEven playing field I mean everybody was in the same boat they didn't know what was going to happen that was the great thing about it you know we saw a great extent of these series race they learned some things from\nPractice you know they had the just the track of all of that ad on the on on the backs again on the back stretch that was causing issues and destroy the race card because the cars would get airborne uh they they adjusted that you know even NASCAR was having to learn some things as well\nOr once they rolled in races but I thought once they started raising it stops are good I thought the way the track laid out was great I I was real impressed with it now does that mean that every tracked needs to go around and create\nA role like this now because I think you need to be selective and the fact that you don't need to have every right to it's going to be like this but how cool would it be some point\nFor Daytona to utilize the road course with a cup series you know they run the only four hours of Daytona there are the Rolex twenty four there but the but the cop cars on there I thought that'd be kinda cool some point maybe who knows maybe down the road you might say\nWell you know what there's so many angles to the story I totally agree with that you have fans that are used to coming to these facilities and the idea that they can make the track look different and have a road course onto these are a big facilities where they've seen one style of racing for all these years\nYou know I think that's going to bring a sick as season and not season ticket sales with ticket sales for these events up you want to be there for that\nYeah oh yeah you want to and that will they'll packages to what they're saying Congress acts and not be that you got two races that you can buy a ticket packets works like you know college football college basketball teams will do and you know any other sports that it gives them another uh another marketing deal they can work with for that track you know the great thing about it and make it personal\nIs you know the race the role on Sunday\nMonday they converted things back over Tuesday they had a session there for a fish tank speedway so we're able to switch it right back to speedway racing with really no problem so it's really kind of makes it a universal track for them to be able to do different things that you know somebody said afterwards why not do any of this ... well\nI mean any card to me maybe a little bit you know it didn't work there because they run Texas but but breaking will be so much harder for them there I think to be able to slow it down to get a foreigners especially coming out of high speed of the speedway but you know you I wouldn't be surprised to see sports car racing there Charlotte because that's a neat little or\nNo but I think it's a good idea they will

of the most popular things we do on the show and we look forward to it so much because we enjoy pet straighter on the program\nPlus a wouldn't had comes on we know that five o'clock is less than a half an hour away and the weekend is about to begin how you doing today that what's happening man\nI'm doing great Dave happy beer friday happy\nBeer friday to you as well you know what um we were talking a little bit about beer earlier this week I'm In fact somebody reached out to us on social media and said\nHey don't forget about the the big Putnam county craft beer festival that's going to be happening in early November and uh we spoke a little ... about that that's going to be a sleepy hollow country club but men pat\nAh these beer festivals round our state or are just multiply\nThey are and ah yeah this one is we get a little bit of time to plan on it but I Would get your tickets now it's um November third one that the ... county craft beer festival ... and and I tell you what what I saw that you sent over to me um looks like they're going to have a really great beer selection there\nYeah they they are so let's talk about what's going on today tell me a little bit about the Duncan coffee why why is this related to the beer [noise]\nWell [noise] so actually you know what my wife is the one that that solve this she's like oh what do you think about this in a really interesting combination it's not necessarily unique but ah to add coffee to here\nUm the cartoon brewery which is based out of Boston which I Believe that's where Duncan is actually headquarters well\nUm they are teaming up on a a collaboration beer that's the heart to Duncan coffee quarter and um there's a really interesting aspect of adding coffee to beer I think the number of years ago\nUm if you said that some people that you were going to put coffee into a beer probably would have got some really strange looks but it's become very common facts and uh we've got ... here in the state that are doing a fantastic job\nAh with coffee beers as well but I saw this thought it would be something that probably is going to be pretty readily available here soon um just because of the distribution footprint harpoon and um I don't know looks interesting\nYeah it does get a look interesting and I took a look at the map you know I Love this on a website where you can go to a product\nAnd it'll tell you immediately where you can go to get this near you and I put a fifty mile radius to Charleston in the year and the the map just exploded I mean basically almost anywhere you go for craft beer or in your usual outlets in the ... valley is going to have this stuff\nYeah they may not have it just yet\nYeah I did the same thing days and I was like wow it's everywhere but I looked a little closer and if you go to the heart tune website it'll tell you which beers um or in the location but that going to tell you if you're interested in trying to that but I tell you where to go for sure\nAll right so what's happening with green verb a valley what's the latest on that\nWell I'll tell you what there is a lot of stuff going on with Greenberg valley Brewing Company right now and I know that we had talked a while back about having new ownership there and man they are coming in guns blazing they're ready to get it done over there um I mean they've got\nSome of the new new kegs coming in um which is going to help them with their distribution and\nUh you know with just meeting the demand frankly with their supply chain 'em but one of the things that that I saw that they posted and I really appreciate this that they have a new canning line first of all which is a great sign of expansion um but they are starting to put 'em a brutal and they\nAre on the bottom other can now that may seem like\nWow that's not important but um you know for their hobby beers any hobby beer\nKnowing when that beer was brewed em is going to give you a very clear idea about whether or not you're going to get 'em that beer at the best possible prime hoppy beers are intended to be drink\nA fresh um you know step outs and things like that can can sit on the show a bit longer but those hobby beers that fresher they are the better they're going to be and so look on the bottom of those Greenberg valley Brewing Company cans moving forward and or you're going to know exactly when that beer was brewed\nBut I tell you that I'm really glad you brought this up I Want to do a little bit more of a deep dive on this because you know we talked about uh the freshness of beer in this segment before but I think this is worth it getting into again you know Budweiser had their whole campaign I mean they spend millions of dollars on their their fresh on a dating thing\nFor example uh how how long can you keep beer and again in ... I'm not talking about the hobby beer I'm just talking about that stuff that you buy the regular market I mean if you buy beer that's over a year older or or or older is it still good to drink and you still get into that stuff\nYes it can be in and to be honest and this is not a this is not intended to be any kind of a jab at a Budweiser at all but you know light longer is not\nIt's not going to make a huge difference okay I mean it it can go don't get me wrong and the fact that they are putting those born on dates is fantastic and I applaud them for it um but the biggest things that are you know going to factor into a beer are starting to become stale is white\nOr which can prevent um and just exposure to air during the process of putting it in the container starts to oxidized a little bit\nUm but if you here's one of the other thing that says it is a reason to go to a brewery is\nGo to a brewery and try to beer\nThat you enjoy drinking out of a bottle or can and you're going to notice that is quite different and so drinking their beer as fresh no matter what they are late loggers or anything\nIs going to to have an impact on the flavor profile of those fears but more importantly it's going to have an impact on happier beers\nThe fact the greenbrier valley also is putting their beer in cans I mean the here's another topic that we discussed before on the program that where you know he wasn't that long ago that people discriminated in terms of crap you're against the beer that was in cans in favored stuff that was in bottles\nYou know that's kind of going by the wayside\nYou yeah you're and you're exactly right on both counts in that you know used to be in the craft beer world that it was like it was only good if it came in the short stubby\nBrown bottle right [laughter] um and and\nI give a couple of breweries a mosque or blues in particular a tremendous amount of credit for this they were like that doesn't make any sense light is one of the biggest factors in a beer beginning to deteriorate you know how to light penetrated can it doesn't\nUm and they really kind of stuff that standard and now\nEverybody's on board with canning and you know Greenberg valley we're seeing more canning I'm coming on line here in West Virginia bad shepherd here in Charleston had a limited release stumped town just had a limited release in Cannes um bridge grew works is canning as well so\nUm I think that it's great to see it really is\nFinally before we wrap this up tell me what's going on with big ... their tap room was opened\nYet well so here we are talking about cans right and they've got a limited release um they put in tall boys which I got to tell you Dave I'm a sucker for all boy I Am\nToo um but ah this it's in honor of um an honor I don't know if that's the right word but it ought to commemorate the forest festival that's happened in up in Elkins which if you've never been you need to go on but they have this fear it's called overcast hazy ita what's that have the ... style is\nFrankly it's a little trendy but people are loving the things and it's an unfiltered beer super happy with really kinda tropical fruit any kind of flavors to it um but they've got a limited release of this here in Kansas available only in the tap room um and it's going to go quick\nAlright gonna leave with their ... great stuff as always I Love this segment I don't know if it like I said when we started I don't know if it's because I like the beer or because I Know that to your segment comes so close to five o'clock on friday but in any case I

year this is can West Virginia get over the sixty one and a half and can they cover the twenty eight point spread and can Wilbur and those receivers put up numbers this is not a winner last type of game for western\nWhat do you think about the over tomorrow on this\n'cause see I like it I Do too I feel like you said to me as if I mean you go back and look what the average score in this game has been over the series and it's over the number that's out there you look at well West Virginia has done offensively\nJust in the last three years against Kansas putting up fifty six forty eight and forty nine points and I don't know much has changed about the team's other than West Virginia might be a little better offensively than the past three years so\nTo me this is a name your score game I think the worst thing that happened to Kansas was West Virginia having a little bit of um a lays there and the second half last week because I think they come out this week and they lay would early and they keep it going this week so I to me I I look at that over number it's sixty one and think\nWest Virginia could almost get home to that number by itself\nWell I I don't know about that I don't know if they they get\nTo the back into a fifty fifty one fifty to well I was I mean you kind of fifty to your your within eight points you're within a score of that number well I think they're going to get all the way to sixty one but it won't shocked me if this western Eighteen puts up fifty some tomorrow would that would that surprise you\nKnow wouldn't know what to bet this I was thinking about it this way that I I think West Virginia gets forty plus in this game the weather is good uh ... ... ... and all the reasons that you just pointed out about the second half Malaysia in in love it next week so I'm thinking West Virginia gets forty plus in this game\nA data holders and seems like he's bought in on the on the Heisman thing with will Greer so he'll he would keep him in the you know unless the the wheels fall off completely on the wagon for Kansas Greer plays at least three quarters tomorrow and I think Kansas probably find their way to to scores\nSo you know you put your get West Virginia in their ah forty plus you get two touchdowns from Kansas\nHow you're going to be close to that sixty number\n... ... that's what I think I mean I guess you could if I if I Want to make the argument against the other side of it\nCould Kansas drop guys in coverage enforce West Virginia to run the ball which is going to limit some of the possessions and may end up at\nAt forty five to ten Tony defense till he gets his defense plays real could it be a forty five to ten and it's still a laugh or but you don't get to that yeah I could see that I just have a feeling West Virginia offensively tomorrow\nAnd again watching this Kansas team in some of their previous games there's going to be some big place out there day there's going to be a chance for a lot of points and West Virginia is executing and if they come out with effort and our focus which again I think given what happened in the second half last week\nI think that's almost assuredly going to happen this week and I think this is a a name or score type of game\nYou know looking at some of the other games and the big twelve and I I don't make it a secret uh I Love these new games I I prefer the new games I Want to you know want to get the game in and out and get the game on ... the rest of my life going later in the day\nBut I'm really sorry that was Virginia's planet exactly the same time the Texas and Oklahoma is 'cause that's such an intriguing game\nAgree with you I I think that's an exciting intriguing game even if you don't follow the big twelve I think that's just a fun\nCollege football game between two giant brands and from the selfish West Virginia standpoint I was hoping that game I I Know it's not it it's been at this Nunes lot a lot over the last few years I Wish it was in the evening 'cause I'd like to sit down and watched it in real time live\nTo kind of scout both of these teams because I think this is a really interesting game I like your pick your pick of Texas following that are unbelievable Tom Herman that did you give that earlier oh yeah oh yeah that's incredible what twenty two and one\nAgainst the spread as an office of coordinator head coach so I get why you ride that number but I Want to see okay if this Texas defense is for real than bottle up Tyler Murray and make it really difficult on him so I I'm with you at fascinating\nAnd I think that's a great game here's the other point about Herman a eleven and one of the dogs and twenty Fifteen\nBut think about this when Herman is an underdog or favored by touched down to less he's Fifteen in three or more of this guy like a GIANT KILLER so what we don't need to talk too much more about this game but the thing about Herman is\nHe's great has a dog but as a favorite not so much agree and various of your Watchmen you want to go in there with with that Texas favorite here the other thing I wanted to ask you about the thought was kind of curious did you ever think you know when when the conferences started shifting and suddenly Miami went to the ACC\nPeople were so concerned than Miami in Florida State we're going to meet in the ACC Championship every year\nTomorrow you got a really interesting situation here where\nIt if you remember there was a ... there was a time not that long ago that time basically stopped when Florida they played played Miami it was such a big game now tomorrow ABC and ESPN and the and the ACC have basically pushed Florida State in Miami\nTo the three thirty window so all lives can be on Notre Dame at Virginia Tech tomorrow night prime time\nIn that I don't mean mazer yet and quite frankly I'm more interested in Notre Dame Virginia Tech I Am too it's I'm done when you say that how little we have talked Miami, Florida state this week on sports line I don't even know if it came up earlier today and talking to some of our guys in preparation for tomorrow I don't think it came up so he had that game is completely off on my radar\nYeah just just that is just crazy I mean it wasn't that many years ago that that game was on multiple ESPN channels at the same time it was so big I agree with what now got pushed back to the after\nYou know real quick to Dave I can tell I don't know fans are feeling this too but we talked to in West Virginia first joined the big twelve how it was going to take some time to get back with all these rivalries 'cause he gave up all your longtime rival\nI find myself in a in some of its work related I get it but I find myself being more and more intrigued by big twelve match ups an interest in these games like I said Oklahoma State is interesting to me I was state's getting a bunch of points western has them on deck next week\nI think ... Campbell done a really good job I'm not I'm not a big believer in Taylor Cornelius the Oklahoma State quarterback so that when you add some intrigued between two teams that really aren't going anywhere but I'm interested to see that one as well\nAll right we'll talk more about this tomorrow on game day let's take a quick break and arouse coming next\nAre they said well management they were ... to plan for your natural need to really run around and now as well planned helps you prioritize your goals and identify ways to maximize their resources an RV\nIt's MORNING news weekday morning starting at five on the voice of Charleston five eighty WC H.
