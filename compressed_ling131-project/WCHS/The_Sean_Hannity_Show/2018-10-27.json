street speak out the technology columnist and author and TV personality Microsoft\nWelcome back to check it out we have a lot of cool tack on this show some practical some more working but I really do like when a product could make life easier and that goes for students and travelers to who may need to carry a lot of things on their back like a laptop some books charging cables and so on\nSo I caught wind of a new product on Kickstarter called Hubbard glide dubbed the world's first floating backpack\nJoining us to explain what that means is Larry robe he is from power glide welcome to the show Larry\n... a great great great that thanks to says it so much mark the first thing to explain is that do go swimming with the backpack actually doesn't blow it in in terms of keeping your head\nAbove water ... whether it does do is you walk your ah your body moves up and down your torso move up and down right and if you have a normal pack\nA on words attached to show shoulders and hip the the the load RIMPAC moves up and down a ... where we're with you um and and and that's a sort of non optimal because\nEvery every step you take you have to lift the load and put put put put it back down and if you've ever ... run with a backpack on\nThe forces are very high and everything that goes flying\nSo what's the ... however glide does is a match and you're you're you're running with a backpack and said if the backpack going up and I'm with you it stays constant height above the ground\nAnd and that cuts down the forces on uh on your body for tremendously I'm you know for for instance if you were to run with a fifty pound backpack\nUm the peak for a ... where where where where we have hit the ground is three times higher hungry and fifty pounds that we're we're we're with the ... states that constant height above the ground\nSo you don't have to do the salary that in ... celebrate it and just put the concept for about ... the er sixty pounds on on a on your back and\nThe the the the ... therefore it's much easier to either walk or or or ... with a ... a heavy load or run to catch a train or or or to a class you know you don't want to miss\nGot it okay so it's been said that good technology solves the problem so with existing backpacks\nNo wait a fluctuates on your back but with proper glide as the name suggests that kind of harbors in one spot and that reduces the stress and wait load on your back and your neck and your knees and your ankles while you're running around the city that's basically the idea of correct\nRight right right and and and the mad and American if if you ran downstairs for you know for for for for instance the ... it's a subway we we we have those ... in Philadelphia\nAnd ... if you go downstairs every every step you take with a normal backpack repeat stop that then you have to stop the load in in the end that that puts even more force\nOn you with the ... you can just go down stairs your feet stop but the load never stops that just moved to glide down then the very easily\nNow does this reduce the impact of force on users by a little bit or buy a lot I mean can you quantify it with let's say a percentage of how much your technology can reduce strain on somewhat\nRight I'm I'm a scientist that per yeah professor at University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia So we actually made those are ... measurements in my lab and we publish them\nAnd and ... ... ... basically you can actually measure the for the load is exerting a on a on the person and what we found is there during a walking\nUm it produces the forces on on the person by eighty two percent\nAnd and ... and and running where the forces are even higher reduces those by eight eighty six percent said\nYou separate yeah that's it that's a huge difference indeed and this is a much to do with this patented technology that you use called suspended load technology or ... tea in plain English can you explain how this works I mean there's this like hydraulics does it I\nYour system how does harbor glide work all these special backpacks\nThe way that the however glide a work that is by ... spent a lot of technology and and the basic difference is ah we used to phrase there's ... there's a frame that\nA cake can act as a person and that has the shirt show or ... or innocent had felt\nAnd and and there's a second frame to to to to which they ah we're we're told the bag and and and the load we suspend the second frame from the first frame through in the last ...\nVery cool we are chatting with Larry aroma from Hubbard slide this was a new Kickstarter project it's a it's a high tech backpack if you will that is designed to reduce strain on your back and other parts of your body as you're carrying\nA big load whether you're a student maybe you are a traveler or you're a hiker and I know that you would that in mind Larry you have different models different frame sizes to choose from\nCan you give us an idea of how much the backpack start at and what the size options are\nWe have a a large that backpack ... call call their track or a and and ... that's ... fit fit fifty five really leave leaders and right now that that's going\nFor four hundred and Ninety nine dollars on Kickstarter\nAnd we have um three small pack where ... which have their short frame that but the individual bags can be a ... ... ... exchange so we have three bags one's\nCalled the tactical and others call the hiker and it it and and one one is called the commuter\nOkay so the product is one word Hubbard glide and congratulations Larry I understand that your campaign has already raised twice the amount that your minimum funding goal was so\nA kudos to you and uh if I encourage our listeners also as we wrap up to check out videos of hover glide online it's very impressive to look at and as a frequent traveler myself this is something that I'm anxious to give a give and go so thanks again for your time Larry\nOkay ... thanks so

existing alarm system but the point where do you connect it to eight panels you can actually cancel your monthly monitoring service\nAnd leverage your community your neighbors your friends your family and so on what would you say that if I said hey I wouldn't want to put\nMy neighbors at risk or my you know my my my siblings whereby they should come to the house in heaven forbid there is like a real burglar here I wouldn't want to put them at risk what would you say to that\n[noise] so I Would say that the vast majority of intrusions are miserable from the front right so even a like a ... let's take a major risks being fire for a break and\nI'm In in either case with fire the way that most people would assess the risk of fire is due I see the flames or smoke\nRight and you can either see it immediately or you can see it at some point in time\nAnd that's the way that I'm most fire departments would I think function as well\nI rarely a I don't think that they would necessarily break down the door unless there was something are happening in in in that case that your friends and family are making a similar judgment call which is using their senses to determine risk\nI Want to bring up something row which we haven't yet disgusted that's the app so this is an app based interface which I like because\nUm my wife and I ran out of the house was and we weren't going to be home for a while and I forgot to set my alarm I don't have the ability with our existing of alarm system to remotely\nEnable it but because I have the say five or six system installed again to piggyback on your existing alarm system I was able to open up the up and remotely enable it so that's another cool feature of this product\nYou're absolutely right to not only do you get alerts transmitted to your phone when someone or depending on your have your system set up when someone opens your door if there's a break if there's a fire if the alarm has been activated or the activated\nYou're absolutely right you can activate all of that function uh functionality remotely\nYou can also see if there is is though that triggered like a window or door sensor for a motion sensor you can in fact see it on the app as well it'll tell you which is known that you pre program when you set up the ap was activated\nThat's absolutely right All right let's talk about that monitoring service that you do offer should you wanted maybe you're going out of the country for a while or tell us a bit about that how it works and how it's different than in a regular alarm system\nAbsolutely with a regular alarm system you're generally locked in for a three year contract\nAnd it's really a if they're asking you to monitor your home even when you're there are we safe by ... not only do we believe you don't necessarily need that but if you do feel more protected knowing that you're home is being professionally monitored you can pay nine Ninety nine\nOne and have your home covered a in a professional monitoring way for up to thirty days and it doesn't automatically bringing it so you can decide whether you want it to me for one month or two months or whether you know whenever you want it to happen we're there to support you with active\nProfessional monitoring with no contracts and as I said it's nine Ninety nine for up to thirty days\nIt doesn't matter what city or state or province you're in\nIt does not were available in the vast majority of us states and all the Canadian provinces there are a couple of nuances here and there but but it's really it's generally available everywhere\nAll right right well as we wrap up please remind us to get the price of the safe by six product in the U.S and Canada where we can learn more about it\nBeautiful it's two hundred and forty nine dollars in the U.S two hundred Ninety nine dollars in Canada um they're available on safe by ... dot com and shipping is a is free and it's done in a really\nA quick way um and the other component that I didn't mention earlier is that it's a self installation you don't require assistance to do it it can generally be done by most people in under thirty minutes\nThere's instructional

choosing whether you're going to build yourself or hire a pro but what do you decide to be a white or not there are several basic questions need to ask you something before you start shopping\nYeah first of all do you need a permit I think a lot of people forget and think oh it's my house and I can do whatever I Want and I'm going to do this thing or I'm going to put up a fan\nYou can't always just go and do that you have to check your local building codes first to determine if you need a permit to build a shed on your property now you don't want to find out after\nYou finished the project that it's got to come down because it violated some building code orange zoning code I mean that's the last thing you want to do is invest a bunch of money and then have to take it all down and then do it again\nNow the other big thing you've got to think about is what size does your shed needs to be and what do you want it to be you know do you need something simple and you know primarily for jets business needs putting things in there and not making a cute or any other functions or do you want something decorative\nAnd it costs money [noise]\nMaking good homes better this is the money did

you're tired of that plastic water bottle going out with your uh cycling or worse in the trash every week how smart don't there might be a better option for you\nThat's right a whole house you'd filters the water at the main just as it comes into the house bringing you Chris clean water from every tax in your home\nTo learn more we turn now to this old house plumbing and heating expert Richard ... through we welcome Richard pay them now American sure having a version the tap water\nBut filtering it has to be better and less expensive than buying bottles or they difficult to install these shelters where\nIt really depends I mean you have to think about attacking water filtration in steps if it's a whole house you need a large unit that's going to handle all the water's coming through and in that case you're going to be going after\nThe really visible impurities dirt and rust okay um when you think about the level of water you're going to consume you have to think local you have to think about a filter this kind of sitting underneath the kitchen sink to give you clean beautiful water for both cooking and for your ice make\nLess true 'cause if you put it at the main mean not only are your filtering your drinking water but ... yeah exactly yeah\nYeah so it's a really have to do it in steps you know we're a there's a whole industry it's an industry that's growing because people are more and more worried about the quality of the water what happens if the bad guys touched the water you know just they want to have some level of security in in their house\nSo how do you go about choosing one and then getting a job\nWell I think it's a a dirt and rush filters what you think about it the least case of the water coming in I think that's going to be a function of local water quality I mean there's so many parts of this country the water is beautiful I mean we take for granted in this country writers as good as it is\nSo you may not need that but if you had an old rusty Maine that's in your old town you know or you had a a galvanized a water main coming in and that was going to give you a lot of rushed you know you're not and you can't change that new Maine to new Maine you might want to have it during\nRush filtered out what about a filter that goes actually at the top I've seen a wide variety of these types of filters sometimes you see the ones that screw onto where the air raid or we'd go yet other times you see them to be large and fit inside the cabinet what's the best way to approach that\nWell I think this to all the ones that you spoke about you know the ones that go on to the end of a ... kitchen ... they will usually includes something called ... she graduated activated carbon\nAnd water goes through this carbon and it cleans it up as it comes through and so that's the least case which you would put on the kitchen sink the either the little ones you see above the sink or the these could be wants to sit down in the canister underneath on your cold water feed\nThe other thing that people will put in is a thing called an R. O. reverse osmosis now that is a unit which will bring water through a membrane with high pressure it'll push\nThrough this membrane so only the clean water gets through the membrane and the rest of the water\nYou know push through this membrane the clean water and the rest of the water will discharge to a drain so it's a lot more elaborate to install on that you not only have a supply but you have a drain and people will complain that either wasting some water okay but the water level is clean and pure it's almost it's still\nYou know when it comes to changing filters 'cause the amount of time between Celtic changes really very big type of cleaning can you happen to where it's located\nIn well it's a function of water quality again I mean you know ... years ago we we had this filter that was so good that it would clog up all the time and people hate of it that the water was perfectly clean because it was taken every bit out of it\nSo it's this is this balance point between taking out the important stuff but not having to be that you have to change it every month or every every two weeks you know what it is important\nTo change it one needs to be changed because I remember in the Twenty years it's been as a home inspector I'd seen filters that folks put in with great intentions and then never touched it again for two years and in fact if you do that I guess it could become unsafe I think it also becomes\nAlmost something you put on the list of when you're gonna change the batteries and smoke detectors right and it's an annual thing it should be the change of season we're doing everything we're going to do as we hunkered down for the winter let's get our smoke detectors and how much change the water filled\nGood advice Richard or through the plumbing and heating

noticed sheets of water falling from the get her on one side at my home\nThat that made it clear they're considering the difficulty of reaching my gutters what caught [laughter]\nCalled a ladder that's how you get up there I mean look I get that you've been able to avoid gutter cleaning because you don't have so many trees and they're not the kind that maybe drop all wanted to breed but your time has come ... you have to join the rest of us now with doing a good job cleaning these gutters now\nThankfully because uh you know you've never had to do this before you know you may not be aware of the fact there are pros that can help you do this and they're pretty affordable um I've used them from time to time around my house and they do like going to stores and yet the gutters\nSo you do need to clean them you need to make sure that all the parts are attached knows best or extended because by the way you let those gutters go and you get a lot of war than overflow them many bad things can happen for example in addition to the water falling all over your\nLandscape that work and saturate into the foundation in cost a basement you can also destabilize the soil and leave the foundation cracks or if the water gets in the soil for the first three or four feet and stays there and then do freeze like in the winter you can expand and crack the foundation Walsh who just a couple of things\nAre the main things can happen if you don't maintain\nProper gunners in if you're listening to this and are kind of tired of cleaning gutters you might want to think about putting larger gutters next time we did this project on our house we replaced the orange gutters with six inch governors their moral commercials size gutters\nDeeper wider off the house\nIt's both wider off the house in a slightly deeper hold more water but the key is that the down spouse are much wider\nAnd so they don't obstruct you don't get caught like the forge Garner's used to some really happy with these governors I've never really had to clean them out 'cause they got blocked they really never got blocks and putting them on a clean them out because it gets a breach six in the bottom but I've never had one that actually overflowed since I did this up to ... put it in the larger gutters and leader so\nJust a couple of chips and make sure you're aware of how important is to keep those

project\nStrict wallpaper and our kitchen and ... found to sheet rock and we'd like to uh put texture and it\nUh but I'd like to do it as simply as possible so she can texture and bank and I watch more information about that or what you recommend\nThat is possible right Leslie to use an additive in pay but frankly usually get the opposite question most people calls willing to take the texture away so [laughter] so I Would say send your your really sure you want to do this because once it gets on there it's hard to make it to make it go away\nWhy yes I mean our other walls have some texture I mean and it's not a heavy texture it's just a little bit to make it and just not the flat sheet rock\nAnd it's a texture and the painter is an actual texture within the trial itself almost like a ...\nWhile I'd rather not go that route as the the the ... um I'd like to add texture the paint just to give the wall something other than the drywall\nWell there's a couple of different techniques that you can use 'em first there's something called the linen technique that's done with almost like a wallpaper brash sort of a very short\nStiff bristle that's you know maybe twelve inches to Eighteen Inches wide and you put the paint on and then you sort of dragged that brush through and that gives you a linear texture to it and that can kind of looked like wallpaper and you can do it with one color or do a base color and a lot that dry and then\nPut a coat on top and then dragged outlined through um you could do something that's almost called the I guess it is actually called of the nation plaster\nBut that involves you know sort of marveling the texture on and and furnishing at and rubbing it it really is a heavier coat of paint and plaster but that gives a really interesting sort of\nCloudy textural look that sometimes has a high shine to it um there's a swayed texture I think Ralph Lauren is one of the pain that makes that\nAnd that has um it really does look like sway that has that sort of like rub softer not looking texture to it there's a standard finished with there's actual stand in the pain sometimes I can feel a little rough almost like a sand paper\nBut I'm back into the nice texture to they all have different application technique so if I were looking at a paint that has a specific texture and homo center I'd make sure that I really read the directions and looked at what that manufacture was recommending for the application process and get those correct tools and do the proper prep work for it\nBecause some of those textures or you know kind of labor intensive for the wire and you want to make sure you get it right\nAbsolutely [laughter] okay well I'll look into a a\nThings you suggested here and make a decision that I Hope that helps you out it does say something much\nWell now we are entering the heating season and maybe a lot of your actually already using the heat in full swing this time of year you really want to try and

Chrysler and I'm like what are you working on this fine weekend day if it's your house is your home your in exactly the right place because we're here to help you every step of the way I got a question got a tip give us a call right now with one ... money that\nCounty in Tennessee is on the line or came home to a military flight tell us about it and hopefully that wasn't too much damage\nI'd been gone for about a week I turn the master water ... off the water supply to my house go for about a week came back in time it's a split for your pretty fire size house or so came into the garage came into straight through in the man's Bannon I hear the sound of drinking water\nA which is obviously never a good thing\nSo I go back to the far end of the house away from the garage and the whole day off stairs has substantial amount of water in it and I look up and it stripping down from the ceiling and really directly onto amount of\nBig screen TV that point that I got to know not good that was set up the stairs\nSo it's all very far in the house a is our washroom the washing machine tub is full of water and overflowing and that was the source of all\nWhen you say washing you mean like the ... was that taking the discharge the washer was the washer itself over and all of along the washer itself\nSo you're basically saying that you were away and when you came back you found this water had collected into in the laundry area because the washer was filled up with water and that was overflowing leaking down through the house right on your flat screen TVs and correct we've got it right that's correct but the but the main water was turned off\nYes and when I when I looked at all that stuff out I'm I'm not sure I ... I went to the nearest faucet turned it on nothing no water pressure everything there was there was no water pressure and the lines of my house\nWell that is a mysteries not\nMali theory is that when you come in the garage downstairs\nThere was a bathroom there and that's where the washing the correction that's where the hot water heater is so which basically middle a mid mid range of the house on the on the bottom ... level right the washing machine is on the upper level far end of the house and this is about a ... square foot house are pretty good stuff house\nThe only thing I can ever have come up with ... created somehow some type of the socks on right now had siphoned water from the hot water heater all the plumbers everybody I talked to said no way no thing possible us will give me your alternative and nobody ever so slowly\n[laughter] that is the way the ministry where friend quite a mystery there would be water in the pipes but doesn't seem like it's enough to do what you you would your thing and did the other thing I was thinking about is whether or not that was waste water and backed up from the street because that's not controlled by a bell\nThere was no odor to it\nYeah well I mean it it depends on how on how the plumbing system is designed this is only one waste pipe you would be like even if you had a great point would not be stinky um but I don't have any other ideas not than that I mean I I was kinda thinking then siphon idea but it's still an extraordinary circumstances never happened again is that right\nIt has not but again I've always now since ... off so that yeah no water to get to the washing machine right and\nThat's ... that's the way you normally would do it yeah because I was going to say is that I I Know that sometimes even when he turned faucets off you get you can still get water that leads through because I've seen this happen\nIn fact my mom lives in Florida half the year and one year she got a letter from the ... from the work of these things should use ten thousand gallons of water problem was she wasn't there for that month and I'm like where do the ten thousand gallons of water go\nAnd I knew that we are turned off valves well it turned out that one of the valves\nWas not completely off and it was leaking through the toilet so thankfully it went down the drain but you know even sometimes when you think the waters off it's not and I do wonder if some is that could have played part of the scenario that you've experienced\nBut thank you for sharing it with us I don't have an a ha moment but I think I can speculate as good as the next guy and and that's kind of what I'm thinking at this point good luck with that project thanks so much for calling us in a city money pit\nBut when it comes to maintaining your home painting or even standing with San Fran says it's really important to keep your signing an trend in good shape well painting as a ... that's really among them or they can do it yourself projects it's also one where a simple mistake can lead to a really big headache\nYeah and the key is it comes down to the preparation weathered surfaces need to be clean and then he lose paint needs to be removed\nBefore even think about open a can of paint them if not here's what's going to happen that new pay is not going to stick to that old paint and your efforts will be totally wasted or it might take the pain but at the paintings to the would guess what it's all going to peel off including the new paint so ... is really key\nNext it's all smart to apply a code of primary\nFirst a lot of people get the ... the primaries formulated differently than paint that's meant to be that top ... it's got better and he said it's going to stick to the old surfaces and then preventing new paint

his that's is that is that sticking to that foundation is breaking off in any way or is it still so\nThere are no good shape but I wanted I really wanted to paint it some of the neighbors painted and they looked like it would it would it be OK\nOkay so what what you need to do is you need the prime it first you use the masonry primer that's really important\nThat you had the hand that you know as

first with the primary dry really really well and then you can put on the top quarter poster quality pain\nOn top of that and it should be fine but just remember you after paying can repaint so what
