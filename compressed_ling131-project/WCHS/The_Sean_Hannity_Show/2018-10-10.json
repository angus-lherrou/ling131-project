a time that is they're under a lot of scrutiny\nSo a lot of people in the tech world there are kind of struggling their soldiers and saying who's going to pass this thing\nYeah but well here's my question I mean the the the thing that took me aback about this launch of the Facebook Portal is\nYou know a ... it's their first really ... hardware product and you see what's happened with a lot of the other players and the space I mean take a look at what the Amazon has done in terms of their tablets and their phones\nThere's a whole litany of devices that they've created and some of them don't work so well and uh but some of them work well and nobody wants to buy them I mean it's been a process\nYou know this is a really expensive business hardware\nYes yes hardware as hard as the joke in Silicon valley but the the the thing is that Facebook does make some headway you may remember those Oculus the R O reality headset well that's right that's ... that's right and and those have been very well received\nAnd look I mean not to put too fine a point on it if Facebook has all the money in the world I mean it's like monopoly money stashed right they they got more money than anyone can imagine so they can throw this money at\nIssues and ideas and kind of cute ideas and see where it sticks\nAnd right now I think that's what they're doing they came up with this thing\nThey thought it was pretty cool look I totally said that if Facebook was not in the middle\nOf its biggest privacy scandals ever then maybe a couple of people who are like grandparents or whomever might be really interested in this thing because I Know that my son and I are video chatting with grandma and grandpa all the time no can I Do I get it\nBut this is not you know the trouble here is Facebook is up against a huge PR crisis and to have this thing come out in the middle of it just feels weird\nI just want to ask you also one more question about this because of kind of fascinated by this product that there's a lot of brand loyalty here too I mean when you take a look at a product or were Google and Amazon and apple or are you in that space I mean for somebody like me who's got an iPhone in a ... a laptop\nI mean I'm ... I'm going to tend to lean toward apple seem ... with Google\nFacebook really doesn't have that advantage in terms of hardware\nWhile they argue that you don't need to be in one certain place or another for this to work you know it works with Facebook and\nA pretty much everyone in the United states is going to have a Facebook account now has one and uh so for them it doesn't really matter right they think that they don't ... their above that whole ... you know you could have an iPhone and converse with someone who is using Facebook Portal you know you don't have\nTo choose the thing that's interesting is that everyone else is trying to walk you in my face time only works if you have an apple device run has an Android device you're out of luck\nRight so that's that's the interesting thing here is that Facebook has always acted like they are playing that game but of course by getting you to use this thing instead of face time or Skype or whatever they are playing a game right there will be interesting\nYou know a one more point about this\nYou know and once you're into the egos sphere of apple you're basically using all of apple devices and you've got to use I tuned civic cetera this thing is pretty interesting where his his partner as you point out in the story was modifying pin doren I or radio\nSo if you're chatting suddenly I can play you know a song for most modify playlist than everybody I'm chatting with we'll hear it\nRight and that's that's part of the interesting thing is well is that we've seen this now with at Amazon and with a Google just yesterday when they announced their competing advice\nIs that everyone is offering this idea of oh let's show you all your photos oh let's play music right it's no longer just about having this voice assistant that not everyone seems to really like but rather or find useful anyway maybe they like them but they don't use them a lot\nBut instead make these things ultra useful right basically like almost a tablet but you know sitting stationary and you're home\nAll right do you remember with Google Plus used to be a thing\nAnd everything well I I you know for a while they\nLooked like he was going to be a thing got a ... story here about the fact that the Google basically had to shut Google Plus down because of exposed David what's what almost a half a million former users\nWell for current ... write the challenge\nHere is that Google Plus has always been somewhat of a struggle right they came out with it um it really was a kind of an issue that they couldn't get people to really use it and they tried hard I mean Google put Google Plus on at home page which is like one of the most valuable real estate in the world\nAnd they couldn't get people to use it the same way that they were using Facebook and Twitter and in between Google Plus coming out Facebook has become the world's largest social network\nSo you know they were moving along they were\nIts really nothing to lose a few times this year so the only time we didn't do was in Texas Tech and it came back to bite us for that one out so well we'll continue this and keyboard and do what we do and you know get our guys\nWith his update of sports on job work out on five eighty WC H.

I made this one last week when you're wearing all gold if you're three hundred and thirty pounds it's not a swimming look\nNo if they're going to wear those go to go I Would rather see 'em where the blue helmet okay when they where they go home and it drives me insane for some reason it just reminds me of a banana\nParis here's the other problem with the bringing the mosque gets back\nIf you brought the mosque gets back you'd have to put the must gets on every helmet right\nAnd that that's probably more than a job for one guy yeah although there's probably and equipment manager right now saying he'd be happy [laughter]\nIt'd be quite the jobs who could you imagine doing that for a hundred hundred plus man All right and I could when we're talking about this before or the the show today don't you think West Virginians playing Iowa State this week don't you think that West Virginia's fan base is almost a mirror image of Iowa State space yeah I mean\nThe the stadiums are kind of similar of both rural states\nUh you know both perpetual underdogs I see a lot of West Virginia's fan base in Iowa State I just wish we were\nTo home yeah very razor you know 'cause it's kind of reminds me of the Virginia tech West Virginia thing they were kind of mirror images of each other or you know in them in the eighties wouldn't wouldn't be McCain but um I I tell you what it placed will probably be Iraq\nOh no doubt under the lights yeah absolutely it's gonna be rocket when West Virginia moved to the big twelve I was trying to figure out okay which one of these teams is going to be West Virginia's natural rival\nWhere ... ... let's build a robbery where none existed before\nAnd I thought that Iowa State might be it\nBut the way things have managed a you know\nOklahoma has just dominated the conferences West Virginia got in at\nWest Virginia has been beaten Oklahoma in conference play yet I'm somebody just went off the road and reminding you know saying well the previous double but ever since West Virginia has been in the big tall they have no wins against them right so I think for West Virginia's perspective they're kind of looking at Oklahoma's their big rival well All right well of course you're always going to the big dog\nBut naturally I think if you're if there's anybody that they've been competitive with and there's been a little bit of heat it's been TCU well that's true too you know go on for two remembering to beat him in Morgantown and it's been close every time you've lost and drop some home games to them so if anybody I think it would be tc yeah\nAnd once you get a ... a rivalry gets going once one team beats another team on its own feeling conference play that right there kind of like when have you made about the ball you know fight

right hey listen I got a lot of stuff to talk to you about Tony thanks for coming on the show I Would be remiss though if I didn't start with the reaction to the really sad news today about jewel written passing it eighty seven\nYeah wonderful man I had the occasion and a couple times to spend a little bit of time with him and obviously he was done coaching when I got to West Virginia but\nWhen you look at the body of his work and you look at the impact that he had on so many people so many lives and then you see you know his son David doing so well and the coach in business you know I talk with Chris Wallace earlier today who's the general manager\nOf the Memphis Grizzlies and he said you know I remember I was twelve years old going in my first any I tournament in Kansas City he said I've had some great stuff he said Joe written was like John Wayne on the sideline and he said at that time Fairmont state basketball you can remember this day\nYou know things weren't going as well West Virginia and Marshall he said there were years where pheromone state was as much of a brand and much of a name and basketball and the state of West Virginia as the two you know major universities so he had an amazing impact and there's every one probably heard day when he ended his career he had the highest percentage and the history\nOf of any head coach so just an amazing amazing\nLife you know I I didn't tell this story about an hour ago when we were talking about Joe reading but I remember when Archie tally was a junior at Salem beep Fairmont at Salem\nAnd that was like the biggest upset in the history of the planet back in those days ... just didn't lose games\nOr they didn't lose games and you know Joe reading was just a just a huge huge figure in West Virginia coaching going at the age of eighty seven you know what here's the other thing I Want to ask you about Joe is you think he he stopped coaching too early\nThat's a great question you know the other the other part of that question there Dave is what would have happened if he had coached at West Virginia yeah and I talked to people and they say on a couple of occasions I mean it was there and do leave you did not pull the trigger it's not that he wouldn't do it if they didn't pull the trigger\nAnd who knows why back in those days whatever it was but it would that's always going to be the great unknown question uh what would he have done because I think he would have been incredibly successful\nDue to a I think he he would have done a great job there are ... college football West Virginia's six than the country this week undefeated they go to Iowa State uh David Montgomery\nThe tail back for the psych loans has been banged up a little bit it didn't play last week in your mind do you think he ... the Montgomery might be the best tail back West Virginia will face this year\nOh he's got a chance I think definitely in the conversation I mean statistically when you take a look at what he's done got there was that status up there and the off season that he gets more yards after contact them a running back in the country he's had a shoulder\nThey're off next week like West Virginia there's some speculation they may hold him and\nNot go within this week I'm not exactly sure a there seems to be some thought that if Kyle camped plays this weekend which is a possibility that\nThe government needs to be out there because Kevin doesn't around it and they need Montgomery out there with him at the same time so I don't know if either of those guys place that's that's one of the big questions but there's no question that I think Montgomery is certainly one of the best day very well could be the best sense a Anderson's out at Oklahoma it could be the best of West Virginia Steve the rest of the seasons\nAre eight and West Virginia is undefeated but there are five undefeated teams ahead of them [noise] Alabama Georgia Ohio State Clemson to Notre Dame who loses first who loses the game first\nBut I'm Glad you're asking who loses first because I was just looking at those schedules and I'm going there's going to be losses because at this time every year it's like a guarantee that everyone goes like well no one's going to lose I mean look at it and yeah they're going to be it absolutely is going to happen they're going to be surprise us we're gonna have Saturdays were were sitting there shaking her head\nYour question was who loses first well next up for Notre Dame pit no navy no then northwestern at Northwestern maybe\nI'm Florida State immediately say no and you're probably right uh Syracuse and us see a lot of people are saying the next time I have a chance to lose at USC I don't necessarily buy into that and then uh you know with Clemson\nSame kind of a deal a I'm going to say the team that will lose first\nWill be Notre Dame to northwestern\nOkay me [noise] I mean here's a I I think that Georgia it might be in trouble this week I I think they're in trouble at LSU um\nGeorgia's defense is great but it's not as good as it was last year I think that\nThe ... you're right I mean they're not all gonna win out some of these teams are going to lose and I tell you that Clemson game against ... stayed in a couple of weeks is another place where Clemson a could get tripped up but I I think George might be the team that might lose a game for\nNow you know that uh that NC State game for with Clemson um a lot of interesting things there because now we look at that game and go yeah West Virginia plenty of West Virginia would have played had they gone down there and got a W right now wow right yeah um but anyway the way that it's going to play it will say\nAll right as far as the other games and the big twelve or going this weekend you know some of these matchups Texas Tech do they have a shot at TCU can they went in Fort Worth\nI don't know you know TCU had last weekend off of their their their arrested there ready um I don't know what the quarterback situation is going to be there from both sides are from Bowman or for Robinson from both sides of the line on at seven I'd be shocked if\nIf Texas Tech goes on there one way or the other and finds a way to win it's a really difficult um to do that I don't see that happening um the other games this week you know Kansas State potentially could be old and four in the league by the time the weekends over can Oklahoma State rebound\nThey're not wanting to after getting a pistol whipped um and that wild one last week against Iowa State that's a good one Baylor Texas nothing and go in there I think Texas now feels emboldened or they'll go to six and one and foreign on a lake\nOr ... to go back to their case state Oklahoma's they gave you mentioned the the Wildcats\nI kinda look at this game from the cowboys perspective as this is again they really have to win I mean if they don't they're going to be one in three in the league and we'll have lost consecutive games to Iowa State and Kansas they that's not what their fan base expects\nAnd if their athletic director going into the year is complaining about my gun these level of recruiting this kind of plays into this narrative I think it's kind of a huge game for Oklahoma State\nI don't disagree with you I don't disagree I think what kind of like last week we had a game what was that there was Baylor and at the death or who the heck that Baylor have on and we looked at it and we said Kansas State we said this game as I got to have\nAnything to do with the who wins the league but it does have a lot to do with what the pecking order is going to be in the league and I agree with you you know if Kansas State goes to own four and a conference\nWe've been talking about is this the last go around for Bill Snyder yeah that probably emphatically like says yeah it's it's it's done it's done so I think there's a lot on the line in that game I'd be surprised if Kansas State beats them I think Oklahoma State rallies\nBut you're dealing with Taylor Cornelius their quarterback he's been up and down he needs to be up otherwise um you know they could they could conceivably drop it\nAnd finally Tony I'm from uh West Virginia perspective my students getting fired this week is that good for West Virginia or bad [noise]\nOh I think it would be better if you were there [laughter] yeah that's the way I feel too [laughter] I think that rough and McNeely I think those guys will be re energized by rough and McNeil taking over the defense\nUm guys that have played for him um they think he's absolutely wonderful he'll probably get the attention of everyone if that was the issue that they weren't paying attention and I think they'll probably be better\nSorry hey thanks donate
