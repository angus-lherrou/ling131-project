that's eight seven seven to six be I'd be\nThe e commerce you\nUh yeah I just did not see that happening whatsoever I understand too because look out there I think eagles ended up having to give up a third round draft pick for that\nThat's reasonable I think Alex laid out the fact that maybe a fourth round or at the time was the uh what's that going price there and a lot of that role balls around the fact right now that the Steelers just start having a hard time\nFinding a number three wide receiver right now you know they uh they they sat James Washington rookie down\nThis past week against the Cleveland Browns are made him inactive for the first time this season adjusted hotter dressed and let's let me let's face it adjusted dollar\nA year is best days you know there weren't many of 'em are are behind him and he said it didn't do too much\nIn that game against around and in fact right now a ... year old the claim to fame the season for just a hunter is running that legal pick if you will on the on the lake touchdown pass to why Antonio Brown against the Cincinnati Bengals there so\nI understand the reasoning for it I was a little bit surprised that James Washington was sat down\nThis past week but you can only dressed so many players yo ... seven and activists on on that list there so I understand why it was I Would not expect James Washington to be an act of\nMuch moving forward and look I mean you've got a second round draft pick got invested within him this year so you need to start trying to move forward with him but uh uh I like I said I understand why Alex wrote that I just you know I I just really wasn't on board with it\nAll right so the Steelers go to Baltimore this week to play the ravens the ravens already beat the Steelers and Heinz Field so this

E. K. L. E. Y. All right let's get rod piling you're for some space in science headlines rod thanks for coming on the show man who's been too long\nIt has been hobby Ben\nI'm fine I'm fine and you know one since uh the last time you been on the show we got a lot of stuff to talk about what I got to get your reaction to this breaking news from this afternoon that the Kepler space\nIs apparently did it is no more it's run out of fuel how big of a story is this\nWell you know if it's big and that it's the end of an era for for searching for exoplanets it's not that big in the capital than on death watch for years\nIf it it's just shy about five months shy of having been up there for a decade supposed to have a three year mission got extended there were times but as you know they kept losing gyroscope\nAnd as the gyros went down when after the other it kept hobbling the mission by\nHook or by crook they come up with this idea of pointing at such a way that\nThe solar wind passing by it would keep it pointed in that direction which is mind boggling they think about it\nAnd so they're able to continue to what they called the K to mission so they're up to depending on how you park the numbers twenty five hundred and three thousand potential exoplanets or many of which are like are still looking at that data to figure out exactly what it means but\nIt was a success you know for a white the opportunity rover\nWhich went on for even longer for like fourteen years you know we're sad when these things go away but there are way past the worthy expiration so it's it's just good that they work as well as they do\nThey get to ask you about the movie the first man the the build up to the movie was was pretty big the box office was less than what was anticipated what'd you think of the movie\nYou know it struck me in a way like the right stuff not the content of the movie because of the movies kind of dark a little melancholy but in\nThat I liked it when I saw it and then the further away I got from the prime ways I thought well hold on a sec at some of the case the first man I think the the way I could summarize it is\nIt's a nice mythology of Neil Armstrong but to me it wasn't really Neil Armstrong with a part of his personality they made about to be almost an emotional cripple\nAnd if you listen to the down link from the missions that he was on and he talked people knew him he was a very convincing the old guy he joked around he was easy going he was fun yes he was quiet but he wasn't quite as representing the film and as you probably know there are a couple of fabricated moments are there that were\nA gas is the best liked the ending scene with the bracelet than the crater so I I liked it but there are a lot of little problems like that that kind of drove me nuts\nI also uh I got to know from you that you weren't a exactly pleased with the way the buzz Aldrin was it was portrayed in the film also a that it really was not his personality what we saw in the movie first man\nWell that's that's my impression and talking to people who knew him at the time and I've known him for about Fifteen Years pretty well and you know ... is an intensely intelligent guy and very a direct very focused\nAnd he probably wasn't the biggest party animal the crowd because test pilot for a pretty rowdy budge but he wasn't my understanding was what I Know of the day he wasn't the kind of person that would come up the negative\nPurpose he may come up and say look I've got a better idea on how to do this litter Rhonda I think you guys are going about it the wrong way and he did help reinvent their plans for for how they're going to do the Apollo missions because he had a doctorate orbital dynamics and MIT\nBut it was nothing deliberate so I think the the interpretation of them in the Tom Hanks miniseries near to the moon by Bryan Cranston who I didn't realize who Bryan Cranston was the time was much closer we got to remember this is the guy who when the Gemini twelve compute rendezvous computer went down he manually guided them\nTo their bond with the uh Gina stage with affects them on a slide rule\nSo you got to give the guy some kudos for brilliance\nHey I also wanted to ask you about the international space station for a couple of points here first of all when that's all use mission or had to abort suddenly it came back to us but hey you know not everything works in space you know ... we've been kind of\nLow into this a false sense of security that all these rockets were correctly up first of all that didn't work and what are the implications for the I assess\nThe ... has been going to space since the Nineteen sixties it was the Russian answer to the Apollo program and did not make it to the moon but has been flying reliably ever since very few emergencies so this is really kind of surprised everybody\nA there have been some troubles with the Russian program lately is you know they found a whole drilled and the orbital module one that's often the space station now so the the impact of this on the station is that that crude didn't make it up so we have three up there now or wait and come home\nThey got us all used capsule up there that's perfectly serviceable but the certification on it the assurance that it'll be completely safe expires in mid December they can probably extend that deadline\nAnd writing things as the new chief of NASA says he thinks they'll be flying again by the end of December but if for some reason they had another problem we're able to get another corrupt there on the one that is there now have to come home and December January\nIt could be sitting empty for a few months that's probably not a big problem that has a certain amount of ground control but ever since that day too long it can begin to crumble out a position and then you can't talk with it and then you've got a real problem\nYou you also mentioned I mean when you take a ...\nTo get at space sex and in bowling people looked at ... mission and ... and thought well you know you can just basically a get one of their rocket supply of it is not that simple it's going to be a long time before they could run a mission like that right\nIn what finance it goes a whole lot of betting either certified ready for flight and we don't really have any other option the only other option and this is science fiction thing\nWould be that the Chinese to give us a flight in theory they could they could link up a dock with the space station with the arm and the theory they can deliver astronauts but that's not going to happen\nUm but it's a fun fantasy to run out so yet face acts and Boeing I'd say at least six months or less there's a lot of rules that they just haven't done enough that thing\nYou know what I I Wish I had so much more time I got a couple of things I Do want to get to talk to you about yesterday on the show we just briefly mentioned that it was the anniversary of the flight in Nineteen Ninety eight when John Glen got on the space shuttle\nAnd that was thirty eight years from when he was the first American to circle the Europe I mean realistically ... and those are in those events were thirty eight years apart I mean what is a a realistic once we started going into space\nOn a regular basis I mean can guys fly for fruit for decades I mean\nHow old can you beat you to be an effective astronaut well\nLet me just start by saying I just wrote a very long chapter for a new book I'm working on about John Glen and\nI felt like a micro by the because this guy with a heightened citizen I mean besides being a true patriot and a good America all that he was just an exceptional physical specimen metal specimen so I think he was probably on the outside at\nThe main thing is what is the stresses of launch what are your reactions to confinement and how we respond to being is zero G over the long term off your approach to this is an issue which is why he wanted to go 'cause if I'd want to go back to the face you want to study the effects of space flight center gee\nThat they say it but they weren't in the fighting\nAnd I'm the best strategy man in boxes and uh well I'm fighting\nOr do a lot of things that people don't understand and that's why I'm here today that's why we have this I don't see no scratches almost face this is where I'm where I'm at\nIs it cause I plan the strategy I realized how much they love and herbal Mohammed and all the people who love man and woman a window like the the real world and they looked referred to them than it is but I knew what I was doing\nAnd I proved to do the right thing and I appreciate them worry but I'm Sorry I came by the way people are willing to fight ... fight the way I feel it because I'm the best in Boston and I go out a plan my fight\nKnow we don't have time to play this little clip but this is a really really interesting conversation we're all lead goes into detail on why his rope a dope tactics worked against Mormons a year but they did not work against Joe Frazier in the first\nABC News was coming from the Pentagon has two thousand more forces it couldn't join the more than fifty two hundred already on the way with the U.S southern border if the U.S uses all seven thousand blow us troops there would be a combined member larger than those male serving\nIn Iraq and Syria ABC's anti field is just one

citizenship which is enshrined in the fourteenth amendment to the constitution giving all babies born here US citizenship regardless of their parents' immigration status the department of justice has said the only way to undo that would be by amending the constitution and executive order would not be enough\nThe death today of notorious gangster Whitey Bolger in prison is now being investigated as a murder\nAfter Whitey Bolger was found unresponsive and later pronounced dead at the federal prison in hazel in West Virginia where he had just been transferred the U.S attorney's office in Boston in issued this brief statement we received word this morning about the death of James Whitey Bolger us attorney Andrew loving said our thoughts are with his victims and their families\nBolger was convicted in Boston and serving a life sentence for eleven murders\nABC's Aaron ... the Dow gained four hundred and thirty one points today you're listening to ABC News\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier from medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills to the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars not to share members shared all our bills\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you through the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without measure\nIt's so worth looking into there is the reason is is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you eight seven seven twenty six Bible that's eight seven seven to six B. I. B. L. E.\nAs capital\nEssentially AAA is probably more cut and dry then the other brackets okay you've basically got there's Nineteen teams that are still technically alive and if anybody is looking at the list right now basically everybody a vote for McCain and I'm sure up on the list are still alive but in all likelihood\nThe sixteen that are currently in right now or the sixteen that will be in the playoffs George Washington does actually control their own destiny right now they're Seventeen\nBut since they're playing capital which would be a game which net they made a huge amount of bonus points they could jump into the top sixty in fact they would jump in at the top sixteen if they were to pull the upset but the way that both teams are playing capital probably heavily favored in that in that match up so it all likelihood that\nI'm sixty and right now will be sixteen in some order when we get to a to the weekend\nAll right so it's schools like spring mills in book can in Beckley and south Charleston Woodrow in ... and ... and we were both three and six spring mills and ... and they're both foreign five can they get to the playoffs will help\nGet mathematically and I should say Woodrow Wilson is mathematically alive that would have to be Bluefield obviously that's a very tall order and have a whole lot of other bonus points to break their way but can't and I'm sure is don't mathematically alive spring males are still mathematically alive\nBut you're asking a team like hurricane to hold down the sixteen spot right now to lose ... team and if that doesn't happen then all those teams on the outside are likely going to stay on the outs\nAre so to quote dumb and dumber what you're saying is there's a ...\nWhat you're saying as mathematically there is a shame [laughter] realistically\nThat's a different issue All right how 'bout how 'bout in double a where you've got in the top five or you've got three undefeated teams Fairmont senior Nicholas county and poke a ... a fair amount senior if they win they'll finished number one what about the number to spot\nIt's real interesting because as you mentioned fair among senior you can sharply them in as the number one seed they will be heavily favored E. E. B. E. B. is fair amount and be number one two three five in any combination is very interesting because Bridgeport\nIs right now the to Nicholas counties three Bluefield as the foreign poke at is the five all those teams can win and still vote passed each other based on bonus points now\nBluefield probably has the best chance to secure the number two seed they're taking on Beckley team or a AAA team with three wins so of all those teams\nThey have the opportunity probably of all the highest now poker who's undefeated at nine and now they're taking on a wing team that's one seven consecutive games\nSo they could potentially evolved over a bridge for to Nicholas ... at the bottom line for Bluefield and poker they will probably pass Bridgeport and Nicholas county if they get victories because of the teams that they're playing are stronger than what Bridgeport a nickel's county will be playing already\nIn double a will there be any teams were winning records that won't make the play off more than likely\nYes um you know you're looking at liberty Harrison they'd probably get into the clubhouse at six and four but they will not be ah unfortunately ah for a job or the mountaineers will not be able to make it this year a graft and if they lose they will be on the outside they would be five and four so there's probably going to be\nA multiple teams right now James Monroe is Eighteen they're six and three they've got to go to a point pleasant and get a victory to extend their season so unless they're able to do that the mavericks will be on the outside looking in double a pretty competitive this year and you're looking at basically every team that's going to be in the playoffs seven victories or at a minimum six\nMen in high school football the regular season it's a marathon not a sprint I mean take a look at it seemed like system ville they're sitting at twenty right now there are five and four of they want to have a losing record no matter what happens this weekend I mean they got off the such quick starting out doesn't look like they're gonna make the playoffs\nThey did it and the huge game that could have swung things in their favorite was when they played bingo central backing week for they led the miners in the final minute of that game I Believe by four points\nMango central scores late touchdown inside the final minutes if they had that victory with that as well as mango central is play the rest of the way\nThan the Indians would certainly be a in the mix right now they are still mathematically alive obviously have to be practicing county have to have a lot of other things break their way and the big thing that they would need is open hill to somehow lose or one when west side team\nUh put mathematically system ville still has a chance\nYou know in in a single layer of wrapping up with ... you take a look at the top of the latest us these standings where you've got four undefeated teams in the top five\nI mean when you look at Dodgers county and Cameron it seems hard to believe that you could go undefeated in class single a and not the one of the top three seats [noise]\nVery true um but as of right now it looks like that that's probably going to be the case daughters county they defeat targets valley probably ends up as the number of force eating camera probably stays right where they are a number five now they could be pat camera and could be passed by Williamstown\nIn which case we could potentially have a semi final rematch between Williamstown and dodge county that is very possible um but yeah I mean strength of schedule from Mountain View and right now my view has the number three spot is or is tied for second excuse me with middle and trail\nSome of those schools um you know that Mountain View played a very difficult games and they're getting a lot of bonus points so the Golden Knights in pretty good position to possibly get the number two seed\nAnd of course being number two means you don't have to travel for single playoff game until you get the wheeling\nOr you know what I Know I'm supposed to love all teams the same but I'm only human being Joe what about my boys from Tyler they're five and four they're sitting at Seventeen went in there in\n... and they're likely and it's very possible um and actually ran ran the numbers you know if you figure\nEvery game goes as you know the favorite should win I think you know or I'm going with that yeah yeah right now Tyler would potentially be the number sixteen said if they can beat St Mary's and finish at six them for a they've got a couple of victory that are given them a decent amount of bonus points\nSo the silver nights with a chance and of course that would mean a trip to wheeling central but Tyler still with a chance to get in yet\nUh Joe hey good stuff man thanks for coming on the show you bet job or Cato breaking it down you can read all this at the website WB Metra news dot com a quick break in or out

burned to the ground tonight or an arm to ground laying are going to have one of the rights have I got the I got the keys that\nFreed you from the five eighty WC just news dungeon to come over here and just give me the latest on what's going on with his Whitey Bolger story I mean this was the biggest prison story to hit West Virginia in a long time\nYes sir so Alex who you're still isn't carrying this a fair amount in this afternoon as well and so I've been following up on his reporting and this is what we have so far first and foremost a lot of people like myself very young I don't know who ... so the brief clip notes version is\nHe was a mob boss the gangster and the Boston area he was on the run for eleven or sixteen years rather before being captured in two thousand eleven he was sentenced to life in two thousand Thirteen\nFor multiple crimes including eleven murders\nSo he was recently transferred from a prison in Florida to transfer but Saudi in Oklahoma and he came to have written on Monday so he was here for around twenty four hours and they found him this morning around eight twenty unresponsive\nSo before a thirty they pronounce that he had died the DEA Jake confirming that he was killed in that prison and have gotten in some interesting things about where he was killed in that area is actually under staffed\nAnd this has been an issue that politicians have raised awareness about that a our prisons systems need a workforce otherwise people are going to get hurt and obviously this is a next sampled I think a lot of people could use even despite that the person who was involved you don't want to see people get killed at the prison\nSo what do we know about his demise we\nDon't know a lot on the FBI is investigating but they're still unknown reasons about what exactly happened we know that the area was under staffed but we don't know who is responsible we don't know who was involved\nWe don't know really a lot and again the FBI still looking at this whole situation right now but there's still a lot of unknowns because you know it just happened just earlier earlier this morning so\nWell say looking at a couple of things if you're not familiar with Whitey Bolger you may be familiar with the movie black mass or Johnny Depp plays Bolger in the movie right and if if you're not familiar with that movie you might be familiar with the movie the departed the Martin Scorsese picture\nOr Jack Nicholson's character is based on Whitey Bolger so he's a bad ... bad ... bad dude and when he was taken into custody\nIn Santa Monica he was living the good life out there\nLiving the good life out they're paying a everything with cash\nWhen he was apprehended there's a great sixty minutes profile of him and how he was arrested\nThis is a big story I mean a lot of the major news outlets are all over this and it's happening right here in our state right right and have built in writing pressing county man that is so crazy such a crazy story Rolling Stone is is on this so this might be the final chapter in one of the most notorious gangsters old school gangster\nYou know so many things that happened in the seventies in the eighties and you mentioned\nThat he is a you know he's associated with almost a dozen murders\nExactly I mean this is this is now the epilogue too is Dorrie\nHow did he die and what do we do to prevent people from dying in prison again because again there's another threat to this as well that West Virginia politicians have made that hey our prisons are not staffed adequately and people are going to get hurt and as much as people don't like the people who are in prison necessarily\nYou don't want people to go to prison and get killed that's not what the justice system is designed to do is designed to reform and all that stuff\nIs going to be real interesting to find out I'm Out Bolger I mean did he expect when he went into prison that you know he he figured he was going to probably die naturally and frightened but he didn't expect it probably did expect that somebody was coming for I\nMean he was at eighty nine year old gentleman so he definitely was not a spring chicken by any means but at the same time I don't know if he expected that he was going to die in a in West Virginia and be in this kind of manner\nAlright so very crazy story end a WB Metra news dot com as your

in terms of\nGreat Georgia moments just Kirby Smart losing it back\nTo the news dungeon with you if they're All right let's go ahead group and to hear a little bit from a Dana holders and meeting the media today had a media veil and Morgantown West Virginia of course huge game a game you know we talked about the college football playoff rankings coming out tonight here's a game that could impact of the rankings next week West Virginia\nAt Texas in Austin Saturday three thirty started here's Dana orders and today\nOn a one and we've been looking forward to for a while a than a\nQuiet and the way we wanted it to last year and wherever\nAbout that so I'm\nLooking forward to going to Austin here on friday and playing this game on Saturday So I got to prepare for some heat and it's going to be going to be hot down there we well aware of that although I don't think it is going to be as hot as some of the games that we've already played this year I don't think so\nUh but we'll be prepared for that and I'm not a lot of guys in our locker room have been to Austin then you know on that field um\nDo you think will be a surprise by any of the excitement that they have surrounding their program at this point in time so\nUh but it'd it'd be the next one guy get ready to play every week for you learned anything from the last two games we play and you're not ready to play you're going to get beat 'em you know it's no different than any of the other night and\nA big twelve uh teams in our legs are ready to play then you've got a chance to weigh and you're not ready to play a then you're going to get beat at the college football for you so happened that this happened to them you know they've been in some type games and\nAnd and one uh obviously the wand against Oklahoma three weeks ago stands out is Oklahoma's playing pretty good at this point in time\nUm you know want to close one against Baylor um you know probably more has had something to do with their quarterback problem at the at the time uh then lost a close one at Oklahoma State last week so it's it's not surprising any of that\nAny anything that I've said it's not surprising in the big twelve not surprising because the college football um so uh you know think third or with their quarterback or\nYou know Alan jurors are are coming into his own\nI was really a fantastic football player you know I thought he was good last year just\nYou know it's hard for your freshman to play at a high level so but he he got a lot of valuable experience last year um they run 'em a lot a you know he's heavily involved in their running game\nUm you know as as scored eight touchdowns with his feet so ah they rely on that they built their officers around it I'm no different than what\nYou know coach Herman dead at ... or even his days at at Ohio State they've always around the quarterback um and he's he's he's pretty he's good at it you know he's six three and to do twenty five and\nA he looks every bit of it it looks to me like he's much more comfortable in the pocket now I'm throwing the ball well made a lot of plays\nA extending plays a last week against Oklahoma State and um you know looks comfortable doing so I think they're they're they're good at ... you know a line wise I think they do a great job\nOf her hand is the name that everybody remembers I was there at one point and got a lot of respect for him so they're playing well up front I'm and I'm you know the quarterbacks doing a good job got three different running backs all\nFive star guys that that are are capable of of of being the main guy when you've got that many of them use all of them it's no different than\nThan what we do with our running backs and then obviously what stands out at receiver or the the basketball players that they got that they got out there that six five and six six guys they're both the same they're both talented they're both tall big", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018",
