B. uh WC just news dungeon sent me this goes uh Dale Earnhardt moment that does not get enough attention him leaning out of his race car\nAnd driving with is needed clean his windshield I forgot about that by the way ... got a new book got a brand new book and another moment after literally flipped in the Nineteen Ninety seven Daytona five hundred he gets back into the car and returns to the race was there a couple of really good moments\nOh here's a Twitter account called a burning couch in the wind and he says one of my favorite athletes moments Phil castles game seven round two versus the caps in the twenties sixteen NHL playoffs two goals in and I'll always remember him slide\nDown the ice to celebrate his second goal that's that's a really good one that is a good one a couple of more here uh Carey says the day the first one that comes to my mind is the run by the major\nUh okay that refers to major Harris was wrong way quote unquote wrong way run against Penn State uh back in eighty eight I was working a channel five then no I'm Sorry I was still that was a I was at eight by then\nI was standing under the goal post I was literally under the goalpost when major made the run that was amazing Zach says\nJordan's flu game and that's a really really interesting call if you remember the flu game\nUh they're not sure it was a combination of flu and food poisoning for Jordan that was game five of the Nineteen Ninety seven finals and it was a pivotal gay because at that point the bulls and the jazz were boat tied\nJordan didn't really seem to be with it at all he didn't score I don't think he scored the first quarter then had like Seventeen points in the second quarter and had a bunch of uh points late including a big three late\nThey won the game and this just in the ... going to win the championship that is a really good call Zach very good uh Jennings says\nA Super Bowl or the super bowl fifty fifty three Big Bend moves the Steelers down the field and then throws the winning touchdown to San Antonio homes with the total drag in the back of the end zone yeah that was an amazing amazing drive up and it looked like Arizona was going to win that game\nThe Steelers lead that gay most of the way\nAnd in San Antonio homes gets loose in the far right back corner of the end of that was a super clutch play a map you Larry David as a herd guy I'll never forget Randy mosses last game\nMotor City bull in Detroit against Mississippi first play from scrimmage eighty yard touchdown that's exactly right it was a bomb down the right side line at the silver dome that goes for eighty yards\nHere's another um where is it\nThere was another uh Randy Moss memory in here I'll find it to the memory that this person brought up well with the game in Ninety seven were mosque caught the touchdown against Ohio in late November and then threw the ball the McDonald's in the old days\nBefore they enclosed in that end of the stadium you could literally see McDonalds from inside the stadium and Randy scored a touchdown in the right end zone and whip the ball over the stands right to McDonald's\n... that's a good call that is a very good cult alright I'm\nLet's go ahead and start the music coup because it's time now\nMy non guaranteed five star platinum club worth exactly what you pay for college football picks we went for a no last week were Eighteen and twelve on the air so here we go with our for picks for this week [noise]\nI like temple at home giving it three and a half to undefeated Cincinnati now since he's had a great season to this point there six to know they're coming up all by week but this game feels different use these micro Warren has rush for a hundred plus your odds in three straight games but temples got a lot to play for\nThe owls are at home with the link they beat navy last week Anthony Russo through for three hundred yards the hours are coming on they've won four or five and their type of the top spot in the eight eight east\nWon some trends here you go\nTemples Twenty one five and one against the line and their last twenty seven conference games\nGimme temple [noise] All right I liked the over in the UCF east Carolina game over sixty five\nGolden Knights remained golden this season they're off to a six to know start perfect in conference play they come into Greenville with a number of ten ranking it was a close call last week as they rally late to Memphis and they're going to be looking for points and score a lot of them in this game\nUCF beat east Carolina by forty two points last year McKenzie Milton is elites he's the real deal he's thrown for all almost Eighteen hundred yards sixteen touchdowns in for interceptions this season [noise]\nEast Carolina last uh Houston last week it's been another rough\nYear at ECU I think central Florida gets up\nEarly and there'll be looking to score style points in the second half and go over the number here's your trends the over as five into and the Golden Knights last seven conference games\nAnd while the pirates part three nine one one against the spread in their last Thirteen I like this game over I almost put a east Carolina I almost took a central Florida the points and the over\nBut we're just taken the over over sixty five All right I like Purdue getting twelve and a half at home against Ohio State Ohio State hits the road this week buckeyes or up to number two in the country they're seven and oh they beat Minnesota at the shoe last week [noise]\nDwayne has been through three touchdowns in that game he's got twenty eight touchdowns this year with just pour picks but I'm jumping on the other side here Ohio state's defense has been less than dominating lately producers riding the three game winning streak heading into their biggest game of the season\nBoilers or two in one in conference games five in one against the spread against a team with a winning record other trends here Jeff promised seven to two as a home dog at Purdue buckeyes or one in four and their last five after a straight up when Scarlett in great when the game but twelve and a half points is too much\nWell that's just one of the things about Malcolm his whole career really\nI mean he is in the crowd is the best player in a row during the era maybe Ovechkin number two or at least has an off into score but mountains right there and there's a debate between him and Ovechkin really eat the Scotty Pippin across these Jordan is getting he got a bit overshadowed through his career because he's laying within ... for so long\nBut now can they be he is one of the best players the game has ever seen in over a talented but unlike ... who's a bit more disciplined now can can sometimes be ahead Kate he can sometimes lead here the motions get the best in the middle east on the ice\nIs can sometimes get into the mosque of stupid penalties and not let things go and almost like immature but then his talent is just so X. financial than everybody else that if he has a bad pounding the next shift how come out there and score on his own just running up and down the ice and overpowering everybody\nSo he is not unique players just kind of how we've been his whole career and that's kinda why you so entertaining why people love him so much that he has he's not perfect\nAnd he'll get letters emotions get the best and like you are right but he's just so so so good and we got to see one of his better game last night as well what\nI Believe it was his twenty first mall tie a motorcycle game and fixed in Canada and hadn't done that in Canada for a while so\nHe he played well he's always going to produce something I've never really concerned about now in the ... getting it done for all\nI got about a minute here but I did want to mention you know when the penguins played so well it's one of those nights where you think wow I Wish they had a game tonight or wish they were playing a more oh so they could keep the momentum going they you know they say on this the candidates or if they don't play again until Tuesday in Edmonton\nYeah and the schedule is a bit odd because that's the second time the payment to that for ... states in between game yeah just really bizarre because we've only play three we couldn't see it and so you can't do anything about it they're not going to make excuses they can't make the schedule\nPlay a little bit odd I mean marketing wise if I'm the NHL kind of messes up marketing why sometime\nI wouldn't want Crosby to take a week off between games though it's often I'd like to get him on national TV more in play more games and get him in the limelight more but it does matter methods continuity but I think now it was their confidence so high and it's such a veteran team\nThat it won't be a problem and this was a young inexperienced the maybe but they're paying what team knows how good they are they feel like they can beat anybody and now they got their horses all altogether again\nI I I expect them to be able to beat everybody but you never know so it'll be an interesting the the garden list but it's just kind of annoying for fans that kinda sucks for fans of more than a theme it seems\nThey might appreciate the the the hockey talk man I have a good weekend absolutely you to an All right Mike ... the Pittsburgh sports lots of great last night blank the believes in Toronto three nothing back in a minute\nWhen our health insurance renewal notice arrive last fall my wife and I made the decision to drop our plan with the monthly premiums and deductibles we'd have

Charleston South Charleston at her guinea is the game we have on our flagship ... who knows I mean uh the that that game at the end of the season cattle ... and could be a playoff elimination game\nFor for by their team yeah really honestly could I mean that's a big thing and you know that's why it's more important than of a hurt somebody talk today on TALK about Marshall and their game against Florida Atlantic the much a must win for this weekend and this is truly is for for a team like capital middle and it's a must win against Huntington but it's going to be a tough the tough tail\nYeah in the weather looks pretty good tonight I'm ... yeah I was running around this morning in probably ... some parts of the state had frost last night but I think you're All right\nWell they're saying about a lot of it is like second half\nYou know I may see a little bit of rain starting from you know the western part of the state so you know Huntington up the river towards one was in that area might start to see it for everybody else will the upside for cattle middle and they're one of the few teams in the state that actually takes off at seven o'clock instead of seven thirty we might get pretty much ahead of it\nHey man you know we have we been talking for so many minutes we haven't even talked about NASCAR I'm Talking about ... so what's your take on the play offs\nI you know it's doing what it's doing it's built drama you know you got for drivers got named drivers that are below the cut off line going into this week in Kansas and they got to get there and you've got several name drivers that are right there at that lie\nI mean so you could have your defending champion not make it in for you have you on this round you already have your you know you're Seventy time champion that make it I mean you you got several young didn't make it to this round so I mean there's a lot of big names ... in fact there as well so what to see how it shakes out you know Kansas has attracted\nAnother mile and a half but it's a very fast track gets a little bit different than a lot of why\nAre you carry a lot of speed on this track breaking is actually a pretty big deal when you're going to turn wanted that Kansas and a man you got to be able to have the perfect set up 'cause you'll be able to do a little bit of drafting especially on the back stretch because it's so much speed that Gary at this track that could be a factor in it to\nSay what are you here and now you're connected to the NASCAR seem pretty tight but what are you hearing about Dale juniors new book\nOr you know I have not picked it up yet I'm I have had it been staring at me but I haven't read it yet okay\nAnd I've had a lot of people that say its excellence fantastic um he's doing it the right way you know we had a a writer with them that that did it and\nAlso to it's all of his memories and his thoughts and he really shed a lot of light on on concussions yeah injuries and it's you know it's kind of opening the door and opening the conversation even more than what it was I think not only in motor sport but even beyond and other sports as well and\nThat that's also a great thing to follow it too I don't know if you have HBO or not a real sports they had a great interview integrate sit down with Dale talking about\nThe concussions and the realization of one that concussions are starting to have an effect on him and his day to day life ah and that's what a lot of this is is the fact that he was you know after hit cities had there were several times that next day he had his eyes were kind of focused\nThan when you have a profound effect on what kind of what they're going to do later in life\nYou know I'm a ... apparently one of the ... I haven't read the book but I Do want to read it but apparently one of the big news eat things that comes out of this book is that you know we were kind of led to believe that the decision to retire was something that they came upon it pretty quickly in\nThe book he says he knew he wasn't right at Daytona in July of two years ago um that that's kind of a revelation they're\nYeah it is and I think he stuck it out because\nIn a lot of that could have been the name you know of Earnhardt ... raised drivers used to race with their eyes\nTake openly rain Rickey arrived at that after wrecking Daytona there and speed week to be a black and blue swollen eyes he\nBasically held taped to keep 'em open for the race I mean it it any other sport besides football you think or beside racing football you look at a football players how many concussions debate they've had over the years and kept on playing and you know broken fingers and other things like that that was sideline up later today\nAnd granted I it's a good thing that they're doing that\nEnjoy talking to you and it goes all the way a great question yeah\nWe've got a lot of great answers and the thing that surprised me is the variety of sports I mean we've had some hockey some NASCAR some football we got a couple of baseball thinks coup weighed in with some boxing we're getting going to get into that later it's been pretty varied\nHeart is I'm I've been sitting here pondered it since you said that question and I'm like I don't know there's like so many I mean you you watch your heroes growing up and to be able to achieve certain goals or cheat levels of of their sport or there are there are trade and there's just you know there's so many other really kind of stand out\nBut tell you what do you I don't know if you've heard this or not but we'd have one great or a tweet from a guy who said his favorite moment was when Randy Moss through the football at McDonald's and Ninety seven\nAbout that's a great answer it's a really\nFantastic one and of course Byron getting down the field that was a great moment yeah I think that we're all in the graduation them I Hope you can do some good thing I noticed that a lot of work but there's also a lot of people that think that Byron what which has a great career at coordinator but maybe don't\nLove to see that too Thanks Jason say about it All right we'll take a break talking to be in more than ...\nDid you know that twelve to Fifteen thousand people die each year from flu related illnesses [noise] some people recover from the blue within a week or two\nThat children seniors and those with serious medical conditions are at a higher risk for complications [noise] I'm Lynn for dumping your fruit pharmacy today and ask about your flu shot the flu and other immunizations help protect you your loved ones and the community route your hometown family\nHe's was dedicated guys\nWho knows everything goes next to this bill tries to do\nWith this update of sports on job are caught on five eighty double UC Asia\n\nPoverty line weekday morning that non is presented in parts are Russian plumbing and heating ... visit the new state of the location and free west Washington street just pass as well you\n\n\n\nKnow that's why we drink when we're\n\n\n\nYou've been waiting for it and here it is clear friday with straighter [noise]\nThe segment of that we\nYou get paid for it to talk about beer pat Dave [laughter]\nIt's kinda like stealing a little bit isn't it just the two guys having a conversation about beer in the middle of the afternoon it's a pretty good deal actually it is happy ...\nHappy beer friday to you as well I mean here we are it's the middle of October the weather is perfect outside you know what is on your beer mind today I mean what we're related things have you been\nThinking about today\nMan I got to be honest with you getting ready for bridge day I'm just I'm I'm looking forward to a to a nice relaxing beer tomorrow\nAnd then I Would imagine that it you know you're coming to us from Fayetteville so it's pretty crazy down there this weekend\nIt is it Fayetteville is off right now and um everybody's getting ready for tomorrow\nYeah that's exactly right and the weather's look dude tomorrow right\nUm I think it depends on who you ask oh really you know okay\nBut you know what it's a it's one of those things that that event happens rain or shine so I'm I've been out there and just about everything so or if you're coming it doesn't matter what the weather has is still going to have\nOur iPad just between you and me we I mean would you\nWhere are you know what I was I was going to do one of the tandem jumps\nIn areas like it at about got me divorced Dave [laughter]\nSo I I made the decision not to [laughter]\nWell I tell you what have you ever went off the bridge you deserve your next beer there's no question about that hey you know what you sent me some interesting stuff this week and let's get into it ...

over rated top so some coming back to the field would do for the fact that I [laughter] and and I'm anxious to see this group this year because I think this is one of the more fascinating teams that Bob Huggins has had just because there's so many on notes\nYou know in the story right now at least as we sit here in mid October\nIs that the team is going to play twelve or Thirteen different guys\nLike consistently not just in the early season but consistently throughout the year and really get back to the roots of press Virginia where you're just rolling in waves of guys which which is great but that also means there's a lot of newcomers that are going to have to step forward to have good seasons and that's always a dangerous\nSpot to be in when you need six or seven newcomers\nTo all hit at once so I I'm really interested to watch this looking forward to this basketball season I I Love basketball and I'm ready for it to begin\nYou know what let's talk to a football when you and I are on game day last week and the events unfolded in Iowa State I could tell you're getting a little upset how long did it take you to cool\nDown I I'm I'm Still not I'm just incredulous about that performance I really am Dave I\nI've said it a million times over the last week and I'll I'll continue to say it it wasn't even just the last ... I mean the chance of western going undefeated were extremely swim there's not many teams across the country that will do that in a given year agreed so it wasn't that I just did not foresee this particular group this particular offensive group\nI did not think they had it and um to stink up the place like they did the other night now again lots of credit to Iowa State Matt Campbell not staffing those players for the scheme they had the system they put in place and then how they executed they were just flat out the better team\nThey executed better and it was better coached on that side of the ball that particular night so\nCredit to them I Know it sounds like I'm not crediting them when I say at the other way but\nMy gosh it was a complete disaster from every angle from West Virginia and the office of side\nThe office of line that had struggled and the two previous games\nWas really bad receivers weren't able to get open will gr had no time to throw in the made some\nSome on will Greer like decisions at times the play calling didn't seem to change or adjusting some of that I Know is because when you're not blocking the guys up front there's only so much you can do but routes never appeared to change I just thought it was it was a total collapse in every area offensively and I just did not foresee that from this particular often\nAll right the the schedule for twenty Nineteen came out yesterday and I don't know if you were just discussing this or not but\nYou know it's it's tough to try to handicap what that's going to be like next year because every years the new season but let me ask you this what do you think the probability is that bill Snyder\nLincoln Riley Matt Campbell and might gundy all\nReturn next year say are given the Oregon Snyder\nRiley Campbell and gundy all back\nNext year what's the percentage I Would think three of those four locks I think the question centers around bill Snyder and they have they have turned it around a little bit typical bill Snyder right they had a really good performance last week because for a while it was looking like I don't think there's any way bill Snyder can return next year so I Would still say uh\nI I'm going to default to this okay tell bill Snyder announces of retirement I assume he's coming back I'm just going to put it that way I Am not going to speculate on that guy being gone because he just continues to come back he continues to get that team to play better at the end of the season so I'm just I'm going to say they're all back next year\nYou know there's a little chatter about Riley Campbell in the NFL\nNo you don't think no no not yet not yet All right so I'll take the no on both of those\nYou know what I'm I had blocked out like a five minute period where you and I could handicapped all of the big twelve games tomorrow but unfortunately there's only two I Know there's not many there's only two so Oklahoma's TCU and the sooner or a nine point favorite on the road Kansas at Texas Tech\nAnd uh the red writers in Lubbock or Eighteen point favorites\nI guess that Oklahoma TCU is kinda must see TV right\nYeah I'm I'm gonna watch that and I'm fascinated by this because we are talking about this little bit of sports on last night this would appear to be a spot where you do with Gary Patterson and TCU just overall theory wise\nAs good at coach's he has their backed into a corner they need to win some games Oklahoma outside of FAU hasn't had a lot of great moments but at the same time uh TCU that they they just don't inspiring confidence so I think I'm going to ride with Oklahoma on this until I see it differently TCU maybe about to be done if they lose another one though\nYou know finally before we have to hit the brake here and see state goes to ... um both teams are undefeated it's in the valley a clumps of big favorite but I tell you what it would have been a lot of fun to see West Virginia play in the state that would have been a lot of fun\nIt really would have and I and and now heck given how it looked against Iowa State maybe West Virginia what had lost sooner idle mountain air fans were beside themselves that game got cancelled thinking it would be a good strength of schedule when after seeing that performs I always said I'm not so sure that's a lot to give a wind but I'm with you that would have been a fun game to watch given both quarterback\nYeah that would have been a lot of fun are we need a quick break we're back interrupts coming up stay tuned\nIn this day and age hunting drugs do more than ... to the field
