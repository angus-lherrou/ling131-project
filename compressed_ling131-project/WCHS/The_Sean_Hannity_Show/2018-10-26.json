five o'clock here in the w._b. and you know what that means that it's time for us\nBeer friday time for ... to talk about beer everything related to the wonderful stuff how do you do in that\nI'm doing great Dave happy beer friday\nHappy beer friday to you know this has been a busy day for you right meetings and stuff and\nIt's been a busy day yep yep went to the game in Morgantown last night and then meetings in Huntington all day so I've been a Criss crossing the state in the rain\nI gotta tell ya I um sometimes with the game on a Thursday night I had a tough time dragging myself out of bed and coming to work today\nWell yeah it was a but it was worth it though right yeah I think I think we just scored again actually [laughter] I Know\nI've been talking about this ... hour that you know when West Virginia's got up to forty one the nothing at the happy kind of looking at your watch you know I could maybe get a good hours of sleep and when I left and right now and I think a lot of people did\nYeah gotta stick around the same country roads\nThough mayor you go that's a good point All right you know what you brought up something to me today that I've been dying to talk to you about and I'm Glad you brought this up\nAbout these corporate crossovers for craft beer I mean I wanted to ask you when I saw I hop had their own beer to go along with their pain pigs and the other fear that they sell\nYou know first of all where this is a new trend correct\nI yeah I think so that to this extent I should say I mean I think that there have been some a kind of under the radar one off here and there but nothing quite like what what we're seeing um yeah we talked about just a couple of weeks ago the the Dunkin' Donuts\nA beer and you know I hop now has one and I'm actually a brewery noon whistle brewing in Chicago relate released Mr IP a nuts and it's yeah the of beer um the collaboration with planters peanuts which I think is interesting to say\nAll right well first of all who makes the stuff I mean obviously planters as in the the the peanut business they're not in the craft beer business so they're obviously going to a third party to create this ... who's making it\nSo it just freaked out to these breweries and so Noone whistle and made the the IT a nut\n[laughter] yeah I don't know why and and there's actually\nA picture that can that that in there and it's like this or Mr peanut on on a can it's just it's kind of crazy but yeah I think it's it's\nI'm frankly a marketing ploy ah so you know what's popular craft beer um what people want to associate with things that are popular so\nUh I think that it's just some of these brands that are trying to connect them selves and left to say that it's all marketing that you know I think that the breweries\nThe breweries don't want to be associated with something that's not good so you know that the breweries are going to put on a great effort into making it a good beer and you and you know you can't\nUh can't fault them for for turning you know for not turning away those paychecks you know that that goes a long way to help them some of these breweries in a I don't know it's just really interesting to one with the ionosphere\nUm talks about roasted flavors of pumpkin vanilla in I hopped iconic pancake batter I don't know about you Dave but\nI'm not sure that I liked pancake batter in my\nEar see I'm Glad you would there because I I'm not going near any of this stuff until you say it's okay but at\nThe uh the the Mr act yeah you know what I'm fascinated with the ... just absolutely fascinated and the the description it's hilarious uh I don't think intentionally either but a hint of plenty roasted peanuts followed by lightly salty finish\nUm I don't know I just never imagined reading that description for beer folk here we are\nAll right well I I Want to just go down this rabbit hole on this topic just they're moving farther I mean could this be good for West Virginia a up for example I mean couldn't some of the craft brewers in West Virginia to take a look at some of these corporate ties and say\nHey we could make product why for company excess if they wanted us do\nYeah absolutely and I mean in fact um my company has a collaboration of beer that we did with British ... works ... ... email is ... is one that that we did so it's not a foreign concept but you know when you're starting to see the food related things that's where I think it's a really interesting mix\nYeah I think so too no tell me a little bit more about this other story that you sent me about the brewers that built a crappy here in San Diego\nRight so uh you know I've got a great friend of mine that now lives in San Diego and you know he's always kinda hey look what I'm drinking because there's all that I mean San Diego is is probably the craft beer capital of the country\nI'm just amazing things that are going on out there but he sent me the link to the story which I really find fascinating and frankly I think that if you're interested in the history of craft beer or this article that was in Sandy go reader mhm um\nIs a great\nExample of of the history of craft beers a whole but it but the the old um to San Diego which again you go to San Diego there's like a brewery out every quarter out there and and not just any old brewery I mean they are making crazy good stuff um but some of these breweries that are talked about in this article\n... that I found really interesting was how they introduced hops um San Diego is certainly known for their ... and but this article discusses how they kind of eased people in shoe I'm super happy beers\nThat would've never ... you know that people were just ready for hobby beers and in the eighties and early nineties and they use\nUm the Irish red and things like that to introduce these\nUm different levels of hopping in the beers and the bitterness and it's just a really interesting story I encourage anybody that's interested in the history of
