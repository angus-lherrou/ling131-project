building to vote early yeah you think we're going to see a lot of people doing it this way\nYeah I think so yeah sure I think so especially on Saturdays or what's going to be it's going to see David if if the\nSome of the voter enthusiasm we've had with early voting actually correspond to election day because the history of early voting is a high turnout on early voting doesn't necessarily mean you get a high turnout election days right so we'll see what happens with that but that's yeah that's something or\nSomething will follow in an early voting just as a reminder continues through this week and also you have next Saturday to to early vote\nSo that so it ends coming up on Saturday ah in Charleston they've they've they've charged a juvenile in connection with that murder last Thursday

talking about opening a restaurant is really a good idea we'd get some cooking tips to that will be from JPL that's coming up around three forty five but let's go ahead and reset our question today\nAnd get some of your early responses to the browns have fired head coach Hugh Jackson today along with former Steelers ... taught Hayley the new interim coach of the Cleveland Browns is defensive coordinator Gregg\nWilliams in the running backs coach Freddie Kitchens will now serves as the browns off into coordinator and you probably are familiar with these guys\nFrom hard knocks on HBO Gregg Williams quite a character so a Williams is the interim head coach and pretty kitchens is below sea to Jackson won three games in two and a half years and of course\nTodd Haley was the Steelers offensive coordinator\nFor a long long time and so he barely last a half a season with the Cleveland Browns and he's looking for a new job so here's our question today what current or former college head coach would be a good candidate to take over the Cleveland Browns what current\nOr former college head coach would be a good candidate to take over the Cleveland Browns and you know I obviously realize there are a lot of guys\nWho have had coaching experienced in the NFL who might be looking to get back in Bruce areas name comes up and I just wanted to create a little bit of a list\nOf college guys who might be interested in getting into the NFL with the Cleveland Browns and obviously the first person you think of as Lincoln Riley of Oklahoma because he coached Baker Mayfield and bigger Mayfield is the the rookie quarterback for the the Cleveland Browns\nDavid Shaw from Stanford Bob stoop sued does begin Oklahoma just retired a of a prior to last season after a long run as they head coach of the the the Oklahoma sooner\nMad Campbell's name has come up from Iowa State fair ins how about a row the boat how 'bout PJ flick anyway those are some names that are

Rich wrought alert a they don't see that happening a rich Rodriguez is not ...\nRight now after being fired or by the Arizona Wildcats and Bob here's Dr Wu\nSays Dave this is Bob Stoops written all over it which means that won't happen remember what Bob stoop stepped away he said he was done he said he was done with college he was done with the NFL see how uh how that goes a Steve on Twitter says bill ...\nOf course bill bell jak was the head coach of the browns who was fired before you had a lot of success with the New England patriots I think the parents will be his last job ...\n... that's pretty interesting call on that\nBoat Fellini right now is the head coach of Youngstown State [noise] a\nCouple of more responses to your question of the day you bring this up here uh here's heroin cross lanes I think he wants to weigh in on a question of the day hey Harold what's happened and who what college what college coach current or former would be a good candidate to be the head coach of Cleveland Browns\nZero I think anybody that takes the Cleveland coaching job forget a lot of political math and bell free because it's just a circus fiasco they can't squander more\nGood they make bad draft choices are there's a lot of things and you know I think it's sort of like taking a job my image for that red\nYou're going to get fired if if you three years you're going to get ...\nAll right Aaron thanks for calling in and I do appreciate and thanks for listening thank you\nAll right well you know in the pros and the college to you're hired to be fired I mean I'm very rarely is your exit the the way you want it to go a couple of more responses to our question of the day here's Jennings says uh Dave\nHow 'bout former Oklahoma coach Bob stoop sees from Youngstown and he knows Baker may feel hey you know what he is an Ohio guy that is true and that is a that is part of this question pope sports weekly that airs on Wednesday on ESPN Charleston their Twitter feed

quarterback what if they go to the college football playoffs um when the Big Ten a lot of people think Michigan is going to be in the college football playoff\nIt'd be the perfect time for her but to go back to the league if that's what he wants a let's go mountaineers on Twitter says hey Dave being a bingo spin I I'd say Bobby poetry no [laughter]\nHe's having a terrible year at Louisville though he continues if I were a browns fan I Would say they would Shaw very very interesting that's a good call I think David shot is going to make it to the league at some point [noise] All right a quick or just a quick update on our college football picks over the weekend\nHad a pretty good week in the picks we went for a no with our college football pigs\nAnd believe it or not we are now twenty four in fourteen on the year and for no this week and we've hit on ten of our last twelve the picks we had this week\nWe had Iowa State [noise] they were a winter in the big twelve minus five and a half middle Tennessee stay modest war they won by human is three and a half and a man Washington state came through force plus two and a half Washington state was done a couple of touchdowns early on the farm at Stanford where they came back\nAnd won that game a with a field goal so we go for no for the week twenty four and fourteen for the year ten out of the last twelve will try to keep it going by the way if you care about this kind of stuff we will make our college football picks that will be friday either at three thirty three year three forty five and a lot of fun with that All right I'm

chemistry they add\nAnd um you know they they welcomed with open arms in in you know from day one and they made very easy for me to um to play a game of baseball and and that can be ...\nAll right that is the steep here so I'm One of the world series we'll be back in just a moment shut Paul Smith joins me in Studio so stay tuned\nOr two other two quick things about food I I saw a conversation on line or the other night about heavy cream okay in when you see when you open a container and remind you see that\nThat date yeah to date on it what does that necessarily mean guide you it is a guide right I mean in ... necessarily go bad ...\nNoticed test okay smell it yeah and and sometimes um and it's weird to sometimes heavy cream will be a little chunky you know it'll ... it'll form they'll separate just a little bit so it will get a little sticker [noise]\nUm and and kind of loopy at the top and I mean it's you know thirty six to forty percent butter fat so it's it's gonna naturally be sick or you know obviously heavy cream but it's it can you know the top can be a little bit more heavy\nOr the other thing I wanted to ask you about was freezing food\nUh I saw something that said when you freeze meat it's better off if it's flat rather than in a in a ... around package because it had something to do with the the moisture crystal that get frozen inside you don't want big for it you don't want big water crystals right\nYou don't want water crystals are big water crystals definitely I think you know it's more important to get all the air out first you know cry of acting now vacuum ceiling that's a huge thing get a food saver\nI'm also flat layer I think it's just easier to fall and easier to deal with you don't want to have ten chicken breasts all kinda crammed together and the ... in a big wad and throw them in your Ziploc bag and freeze them that way it's always nice to have him laid flat\nIt number one it's easier to store it's easier to find and it's easier to you know to to manipulate 'em and it's also easier to thaw out\nAll right man I Love this segment when he feel famous ... have you got anything you want to promote going and going\nOn a now in my last cooking class was that the capital markets this past Saturday was an awesome season again so thanks to a A R P and the market for having me back so we'll do another one again next year starting in may so uh come out in the U.S and that's about it\nAnd it sounds good uh we we will do this again next Monday three forty five and I look forward to it shut Paul Smith from ... couple of quick break were back in just a moment\nBefore running for attorney general Patrick Morrisey got reaches a Washington lobbyist for pharmaceutical distributors including cardinal hell\nMorsi admit when we did do some lobbying work while Morsi was lobbying for cardinal company shipped over six and a half million opioid pills to a single pharmacy in Mount\nGay shamrock West Virginia then when Morsi ran for attorney general cardinal contributed to his campaign here sixty minutes\nRecords show he also took more than a thousand dollars in political contributions from cardinal out\nMorsi's being sued because he refuses to turn over documents about his connections to the opioid industry he doesn't want West Virginians to know that he settled for pennies on the dollar with opium\nIn NFL the top third of coaches make anywhere from six to ... making it sound reports over twelve years so he would he would get a rage and he will be all football all the time you know not having to recruit not having to\nShake the hand the boosters now that I'm so it's attractive I'm sure on some level but we'll just have to see if he's at that point where he's ready to make that jump\nWell you know in in the case of Lincoln Riley you know you're kind of buying a clean slate here I mean he's only been a head coach for a very short period of time in college football what guarantee is there that he'd be successful in the NFL\nYeah because guys with a lot more experience and ah you know with with the career that might feel like it was more vetted\nHaven't succeeded um you know Nick Saban didn't have access from Miami who knows what would have been like had he stayed in three or four years and\nAnd sort of done that a player developmental side of things um you know that the other part of it in college coach can basically tells assistance recruit this kind of guy don't recruit that kind of guy and depending on how much flexibility and NFL owner gives his head coach you may or may not\nHave that sort of final stamp of approval versus working with your personnel department so\nUm you know I I don't know if that he go driven or if that's just how much control like I have to have to feel like it it's his team but that's another factor to consider\nAri Lincoln Riley is one thing but Matt Campbell is another I mean there's a lot of chatter out there that Matt Campbell from Iowa as they\nCould be another guy that could be definitely interested in the Cleveland Browns we're interested in him and Lincoln Riley has the option to say something like no I'm going to stay at Oklahoma I'm going to make five million dollars a year Oklahoma's for me\nThere is no way mad Campbell can say no I'm turning down the national football league because I Want to stay the coaches are with the correct\nYeah and I think a lot of chatter that he's the guy in waiting at Ohio State you know um there was some speculation that if things had really gone south and the LSU brass hadn't back\nUh back to their staff you know back in August that it might have been Campbell in the short list and now you know who knows if how long urban Meyer will stick around a given that so yeah he's in a different

A. L. K.\nText us at three or four talk real for that three or four eight to five five three or four tweeted weekly W E Kay Bailey White All right let's go ahead and get into some of these text messages from the three of four two seven six years of texture who thinks urban Meyer at Ohio State might be a good\nCandidate for the ... maybe\nMaybe urban Meyer is an Ohio guy but he's got as an Ohio guy he has got the job in the state of Ohio as they head football coach at the Ohio State buckeyes um and I I don't know I don't know how much interest the browns without\nIn urban Meyer in light of some of the controversy that's surrounded him before the season began but that's an interesting idea a up oh who did you see this here's somebody who sent us a theme\nWalk up theme for ... Paul is pretty interesting from the three or four or five four to ... Smith Priebus foods comes in those little cooking segment force every week at three forty five this texture so chef ... should be weird ... eat it uh that's actually not a bad bet suggestion I kinda like that before yeah oh yeah I Try to go a\nLittle bit off the beaten path a little bit but maybe sometimes simpler is the best way to\nGo [laughter] I think so too I liked what you played the day was that was good that was good a couple of more response was here from the three or four or five nine one\nCurrent or former college football head coaches who would be good choices take over the browns or here's a texture who says less miles of LSU or urban Meyer this another vote for urban are from Ohio State of the matter a blessed miles is pretty interesting idea\nAlthough you know\nHe's one of the national championship\nIs a very popular coach or when he's on the sidelines very animated\nIt seems like he doesn't have that often subsist ... you know what I mean people really want that guy who comes to the league to really have that uh you know really the fancy ... I don't know if less miles really fits that uh this is interesting for the three or four six civil and they'd have skipped the college coaches the brown should hire day Walker from Orangeburg\nAnother bed go after what they've been doing the last not just this your last couple of years that's Mike from Orangeburg thanks my regime that are from the three or four nine six for David coup lip woody Hayes coach the browns from the grave uh who says he isn't doing that already\nAh ah from the three or four six seven to love these Smith\nWow well you know a things didn't really work out for ... with the bears didn't really work out with the la vie for the bucks and things really are working out the great with the finding a lot I but I appreciate you send them and and and finally here from the three or four or five or to here's one more vote for less miles\nI didn't expect to see him but that's why we run these questions up we'll keep this going on\nBut right now it's time for Christmas bird in Hollywood dirt\nPerson comes to us from the entertainment capital of the world Los Angeles California and there's a lot of stuff going on in the world of entertainment and beyond Kristin how you doing today\nGreat how are you guys for coming on the show\nYou know I'm not sure where should we start there's all kinds of stuff going on and you know why do we start with television what is NBC going to do with that extra hour of the today show that Megan Kelly used to fill\nIt it's so interesting because they feel like they're almost going back to one on that because remember performing Kelly came aboard it with cameras hall and al ... co hosted the nine an hour it looks like outlook or will be taking over that our at least for a\nShort term but I have a feeling it probably will be the long term and today on the show they did have a copy came and Craig Melvin came and even at savannah Guthrie made a um a remote parents on the show she was obviously in Pittsburgh after that\nTragedy but I I think that it's going to be our workers our that they're going to reestablish for him but they really have to figure out what direction they want for the today show because I feel like this has been an ongoing disaster going back to encourage\nAny you know if you're listening to our program and you're saying well who really cares about the today show if you look at the history of NBC I mean the today show goes back seven decades and it is a monster moneymaker for NBC for you this is so big it really can't afford to fail\nThat's correct and I think that the big deal it you know holding it probably is probably not going to get a Ninety an hour because she wants to refocus or energy any an hour\nWe Kathie Lee and if you remember seeing how can you give her a headache for many ... an hour at the ratings have suffered with nagging Kelly ... till today she really wants to reestablish themselves\nThat for our block at noon and you want to watch every single morning and I think that they need it started raining tablets ah their talent and find people that America overall truck\nAll right well obviously making Kelly to NBC was a disaster last week\nThey were in repeats on Thursday and Friday after the the the blackface controversy what's next for Megan Kelly and well she get all the money she claims she's due from NBC\nShe's asking specifically or fifty million dollars which is a nice tidy sum of course um I think she's going to get probably somewhere in that neighborhood because remember we saw big exit packages\nFor Matt Lauer we thought they asked the packages for Billy Bush this is not something new they want her to go away and they will pay her opt to go away I I think she's probably going to have to take some time off um but I bet there's a book deal in her future\nOh yeah I'm sure you're right about that yeah I think she's going to have to sit on the sidelines for awhile here's the thing Comcast is so big that when the story came out on friday that Megan Kelly was gonna get possibly all the money she feels she's ... she's deserve like sixty nine million and now you're talking about fifty million that didn't even move the sock\nIt to be the gossip didn't even move so they could just ride or a big check into it you can go way they are the the queen movie bohemian Rhapsody is coming out this week uh what are you hearing about it because I'm not here in very good things I\nWeek okay yeah so here here's the thing and I think that is where\nAre you know people who are hardcore clean fans are going to have to make a decision on there and in some ways I feel like you should go in the ... and then make your own judgment call because the performance by running now like\nA who allowed me no friend Mr robot that TV

I. B. L. E.\nFor the New York\nAll that the pros are going to be different I mean it's just different because now\nYou know if you're not a head coach and maybe a coordinator\nYou know ... they're grown men and so these grown men when you're yell at them they'll yell at you back [laughter] and you know and so it's just a whole different thing and if I'm successful in college\nI'm staying in the college I'm not I don't it's not like the dream job to go to the pros I think if you're if you're an excitement that you can stay where you are life is great don't even test those waters again\nYou know what a couple of years ago I really felt like Nick Saban was going to go back to the NFL at some point because he had already accomplished their ... and then you could possibly do in college football I mean stacking national titles like cordwood in that that that with the dolphins is the one part of his career that wasn't necessary as well\nSo I thought there would be something inside his personality to go back and check that box I don't feel that way now\nNo I don't I don't either I I I don't see why he would do it I mean as the great where you are you know just be great where you are don't worry about going anywhere else have been trying to be great here there and all that just be great where you are\nSo Carl ... as a former professional player how are those players reacting to the news today that their coaches out\nI think the guys who'd been been there for a while probably you know are uncertain now because they're you know they don't know well you know that that the interim coach you don't know what that's really going to be like um typically if it's an outside coach coming in it's really an uncomfortable thing for the guys that are coming in\nThere like great 'cause we we've seen what we kind of feel like we already know what this was going to be um because the history has shown that so for them they can be a little bit excited and then or I should say a lot excited but then there's that middle group\nThat four or five year guy back on the move getting ready\nAll of a sudden for him it's like it could be good or could be back ... and I fit I think the ... if I'm Baker Mayfield I'm I'm I'm great at this the best thing happened to for me really oh coordinators gone head coach is gone\nThe idea now in my head when you get rid of the ... coordinator of the first thing you want to do is find somebody who can match what they think he can do\nAnd get him into a system that he can work so everybody that you're going to get a Q and a is going to be around trying to figure out how to get Baker may field to be able to play in a sense the system that works for him\nOr two quick things here on this Gregg Williams of the interim head coach of the brown he was the defensive coordinator so I'm guessing\nThat gives a level of comfort with the guys are on the defense yes I mean they won system and now suddenly the guy that was giving them their marching orders now he's just moving over in in being more of a CEO and trying to run the office to\nYes and a lotta times defensive coaches can be okay can be OK being ... you know calling the place because what they know is what beat them\nSo they want to put something in head that you kinda know you know how the offenses work\nSo you can flip that and say okay let's run this type of office based on our conference in the types of teams that will face and types of events that we'll see let's look at something like that who's that guy out there who knows the most about that system and let's get that guy and\nYou know I just look at the ... the timing of this and I I'm just scratching my head a little bit I mean\nHere you take a look at Jackson he was one and Fifteen his first year last year they went oh and sixteen\nThis year there to five and one you got a rookie quarterback but you've committed to your number one draft pick I mean what are they really expect I mean if you watch the browns and I do watch the browns because they're in the Steelers division they are better\nI mean yeah better yeah but but there may only be better because of Baker Mayfield and and my concern with bacon Mayfield ... wasn't about him really being good the question was if if this team tainted early\nWho ... who would we see in him what what would be his personality how he handled that and I don't think the browns want to see that I Want I think the browns won the show to him that hey we're committed to getting better so we're not going to go down this road and go or you know now\nToo and whatever right we're not going to do that we're going to make a change right away\nI guess one of the other questions about the situation as it is framed in our question of the day what's\nCurrent and former college football head coaches could fix the browns\nThere's only a handful of guys who would ever turn down a job as a head coach in the NFL right I Would I Would I Would I Would go along with that okay so Nick Saban obvious right he's going to turn this thing down urban Meyer probably at Ohio's a probably a mentally Kirby Smart and Georgia probably not going to have that ... Georgia\nThe other thing is these guys at the high end of college football or just make it so much more money now and that's got to be a consideration absolutely\nAnd and it took and and they got a comfort level they've got ... they're getting the best athletes coming in in the college football now so they they have the ability to stay in that space\nFor a long time I just wonder a ... a month ... amongst the list of college coaches who might get a little consideration I think of David shot Stanford gets offered the opportunity to go to the Cleveland\nBrowns he's got to take that he's got to take that in many Campbell from Iowa State you know I just don't see a sentence coming out of his mouth like\nI Do not want to coach the Cleveland Browns I Would rather be the head coach at Iowa State I can I ask a sentence that would never\nMissed that an hour's academe wanting to leave our state they may be even stand for 'cause I played for a really show you know so you know he he's got history and the pros his dad has got\nHistory and the pros really show a great coach one of the best coaches I think I had [noise] so if he decided to go he's got he's got some potential ways of connecting with some stab with some really major experience\nBut I Am not sure if it's really worth his time at this point I you know see I can see staying at Stanford over our state and going to the ... if you're in our state\nYou're an hour if you are at some of those kind of places I think he got to go but I think Stafford stays into that category of him being successful at Stanford\nI think you you you almost have to stay well David job might be looking at the situation saying hey my agent is telling me the browns are open now with this ... this spot the spot and this is going to open up at the the will to lift weights ... that was a great point because that that there's got to be other jobs that are open up at the end of the seats are to be good to have a lot more to talk about\nAh regarding the situation on the Hugh Jackson fired today is the coaches brown when we need to take a break in or out snacks they don't\nThe metro news radio network for once again provide comprehensive wall to wall coverage of the ... general election voters are deciding between Joe mansion and Patrick Marcy for US Senate three congressional seats the makeup of the state Senate and house of delegates as well as the lead up to constitutional amendments and we'll follow critical national races as well\nIt's the most up to the second results plus analysis elaborate boards for mansion and Morsi headquarters on the metro news radio network and on our website at W.

I feel this is not just like your typical college player relationship you guys are very very close and ah\nSo yeah I'm sure that's a factor you know I I think that these countries that had a chance to coach picker Mayfield just absolutely love him and and love what kind of competitor is so yeah I'm sure that if we can Riley\nYou know if if Lincoln rally wanted to put his name out there that fear is Asian or whoever felt hey let's go look at it fell job I think there'd be a lot of folks given them a call wouldn't be surprised at the Dallas Cowboys even would give that guy call like I think he is that well regarded right now as an office of mine I'm ... and ... what we're seeing right now with the chiefs and the rams are doing\nI'm sure there's going to be a lot of folks looking for officer geniuses or you know that that do things differently like McVeigh does um or or like that she used to being able to do right now and so I'm sure there'll be a lot of people lined up for like an\n... before we get into a West Virginia in Texas I just wanted to mention one thing from your column on Saturdays takeaways at the athletic around ... regarding college football this weekend\nHow surprised were you are with Kansas when against TCU and what is the status account of Kansas football right now\nYeah you know I think honestly you have to kind of be happy for day to day in his players because those guys have fought so hard every week or you know obviously\nThey've gone through a lot of losses over the past few years but that's a that's a team that still like ... those kids don't put on that coaching staff and and you have to commend them because they lost a lot of games and\nThey have a lot of reasons you know they they have some good players there that\nHave plenty of reason to to grab transfer leave that program and they've stuck with it because they believe in David ... and I think that when I was finally you know good things finally happened to those guys and and obviously these you made a lot of mistakes in that game um but Kansas took advantage and they got good quarterback play from painting bender\nOr ... Williams the freshman running back ah he's just a you know I'm the guy that they stole out of a New Orleans I'm very talented player and you know the the males get some better players there and\nUm I I think there's also just reflection of the big twelve that if you if you have a bad game than you could lose to the most anybody at this point but obviously these you've got a lot of problems right now in in in Kansas was able to capitalize\nIs there any way that David baby seizes job\nYeah I think so I mean like I haven't talked with Jeff long their new idea about his perspective on it I Know that he's kind of I'm sitting back and kind of watching how that plays out really kind of taking stock of of where they are and so I honestly can't tell you you know what the standard is I think that\nBefore the season folks I talked to felt that you know if they could find a way to win like four games this year and then you can make a pretty decent case that that they're making progress in this\nYou know he should be given another year and and you know they've now won three and and uh you know we'll have a chance in November to try and get divorced so I'm you know I think he's he's done he's he's certainly helped his chances and uh you know honestly if you're Kansas I guess the curiosity it'd be well who would you go line up to\nReplace them because I think that the you know there are big problems run their roster and and trying to get back to eighty five scholarship players I think David big he's done a good job of trying to solve that\nAnd if if you make a coaching change and a bunch of players leave\nThat next coaches is going to be dealing with that same debt that David ... has spent years trying to solve\nOr a West Virginia at Texas this ... this coming weekend I Would imagine that this was an elimination game for these dreams e in terms of the college football playoffs obviously but the winner would you agree has the inside track to at least one of those spots in the big tall championship in\nYeah I think so I think it's a huge are playing a game for the ... called ... and now we're it's interesting the way things have played out here that there's actually a a little bit of a possibility that you can see I always said make a bit of around here um and and obviously they've having already beaten um you know already be West Virginia I think they have a chance to be in this\nThey come down to Austin in a few weeks um but but there's no there's no question these two teams I think are are clearly the the two best teams for for one of those spots at Oklahoma is going to take the other and I think they probably are and so uh it's it's a massive game and a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "29"}
