our flagship affiliate ... just in Charleston\nBut look who's here Alex Thomas because they're not just on vacation right yes he is he's actually and I could you not after what he was going to do on a friday and he said he\nIs painting the sweet yeah I Know I I looked him and I was like you mean you're hiring somebody to pay and he's like no no no we're painting and I'm like well good luck with

you're going to be here with me all week I Will be sweet All right so what's up in the news was going on\nYeah over WB metro news dot com we have an update in the Allen Law pre trial on I Will give a brief crash course on that for anyone who is\nNot in that story so Alan law for you not only faces impeachment from the state Supreme Court and followed the legislature he also is on trial for I'm pretty much the majority of those trials are for using state vehicles that for cases he wasn't supposed to use them\nSo the government has rested its case literally early this afternoon\nAnd the witness to be counted to stay in this morning there were two big key one the first one was a neighbor of law freeze who lived across the street and saw the vehicles according to her sheets all state vehicles in front of his house on multiple occasions like it was a regular thing for these you know close to be there\nAnd the other person who was caught up was an FBI agent now that seems very weird world you just call an FBI agent by the FBI agent in this case uses a lot of cellphone data to point out more calls in tax or made\nAnd one location that the agent pointed out was the town a person's now what's big about Parsons in this case persons isn't Tucker county is also where Alan law freeze from its his home town so this brings another case of like well why is he making these calls here when was the making these calls the purpose of these calls\nSo the government again has rested its case for the day the defense will call up it's for the first witness at some point in that first witness will be Alan lottery\nAlthough our army hitting the ground running with the defense um brown ... covering that they actually did have court today in Charleston even though it's Columbus Day um which I joke with Sean Sean Johnson who was earlier this afternoon I was like is it really a real holiday like I Know everything's closed but\nLike no one really is like oh I got to go buy my granddaughter Columbus Day card yeah anything like that kind of do go\nOn well you know my wife and our our uh wondering we live in such also we didn't know if the garbage was gonna get picked up this morning we didn't know if you know if it's a holiday there's there's no garbage garbage pickup but there was garbage pick up this morning so\nI Know realized I dropped my credit card bill in the mailbox today that [laughter] early this week it's not getting so many ... uh Minneapolis\nOr not it might get there it might get there\nYeah I don't think [laughter] they may get there are a little bit of ... people at Wells Fargo are going to be like man or woman West Virginia\nCustomer Williams during the spill I see okay if you need somebody down there ... do I need to make a call on that flight guy we didn't get your balance on where you can like yeah yeah yeah so the Laurie a trial a bright [noise] how much longer think this is going to go on I mean the defenses are this is day for\nThe defense is they're not done got its witness so we're we're halfway per se now the defenses up so you know it may they may wrap up this week they may wrap up you know early next week for moral just have to see it all depends on what the jury to to okay could they could go to the jury and the jury may take you know a considerable amount of time to handle all this\nYou know what we were talking I was talking to Jeff late last week about Lauer his trial and there were rumors of tapes where any of these tapes\nEver used a we ever hear in the audio recordings or any of that kind of stuff so it's funny you\nSay that because the brand macaroni who has been covering this has been doing a fantastic you close to the job\nAnd that's a new ... for the kids um she has been getting the stuff that the jury is seen as well\nSo last week for instance we got a tape of\nKimberly Alice used to work on the court recording call around a call rather but demeaning involving law free regarding\nThe cost or innovations in the office the law free soldier on an asteroid and prodded her multiple times about like are you sure that these costs are right are you sure like there were the need to be there not over everybody else is and we had this conversation before\nAnd she was like well I don't I don't remember having this conversation at all so we do get those kinds of things that the that the jury dusty and will you know over a lot of our Metra newscast it's hard to explain that and put in a tax for our website and butter of our metro news casts at the top and the bottom of the hours also with ... ... cast that\nEither you know can we do put those in there so people can get an understanding of what's going on with these trials so we want information we receive we try to we try to shower the people with it okay I got time for one more thing what are you got to remember fall fall with\nEverybody's all was fully remember ...\nYou know the leaf start falling people during their pumpkin spiced latte you know getting their sweater back in the day instead it's eighty degrees athlete it's like eighty eight degrees here in Charles so\nIt brings up a lot of questions of okay if fall ever going to come and the answer is yes next week it will come this will be coming on Thursday up because of hurricane Michael so hurricane Michael which is still in the Gulf of Mexico right now\nIs moving its way on up toward next towards Florida\nAnd wants it and makes landfall it'll go up to the United states and all that jazz they'll bring a bunch of rain and temperatures

through the loss of Texas so um\nYou know I think he thought that he he set a new voice in the room or from Rock Hill a was reading into it and then see these things always kinda kept me off guard because I think if you know after five games why didn't you know it and the offseason when you could have tried to build some continuity with the new guys but um\nBut they the clearly linked Riley thinks that they're making that change now is is the only chance they've got to to stay in the race\nWell Lincoln wrongly most feel pretty comfortable in that seat as the head coach [laughter] to get rid of Bob's tubes brother I mean but that's got to be a consideration right\nIt does but I also think he's got about Ninety percent of the fan base behind him yeah so right even if they move backfires I think the fan base with think well what have been any better with Mike states there I mean we saw Tehran Austin run\nEssentially two different run and play for about three hundred and fifty six years ago and ah Oklahoma never adjusted and that was sort of the first one to I had into the fact that\nYou know this guy may be a pretty good recruited and may have some some upside to them but he also stubborn and are not in a way that necessarily benefits that defense\nI mean there was an article at WB mature news dot com about West Virginia situation all along the off into line at at right guard was that a factor a ... with ... brewer getting sex so many times in the Kansas game\nUh yeah there was that there were bad snaps which uh if you talk to some of the line and might have been attributed to\nKansas yelling out some snapped camps that were later you know a analyzed um you know I don't know about that but uh the revolving door right guard now has featured for faces including the backup center and he sort of allowed\nA sack and ended up pressure on I think only three snaps so\nThat you know Jacob ... crossing moving up from center is used to latch on to one guy will that God you have to you know past guys off punch a guy out and move on to a second guy and he was still in the center mindset of I got this guy I'm In Salt Lake guys run free\nYou know they said Joe Brown is the guy they they told me that after a week one when he started against Tennessee but then he wasn't a backup role of the next week against John ... state he was injured or the past two games um so they they think physically he is the guy\nBut he has conditioning su he had not played football and I believe Eighteen plus months he didn't get here until June and so they they're not

time two weeks ago at Texas Tech one time and I remember he was on his back for one play in Lubbock\nA it was a shock to the system of minutes and ... and four times a Kansas or you know people really I think we've kinda been lulled into this false sense of security through the first half of the season\nWhere you know the he's been basically just sitting back they're writing a book yeah and uh maybe hold the ball just a little bit too long if you know I can you know give them a little bit of criticism and is world got rocked a little bit this week\nAs well and and and what will have to see and then there are still things out there that we haven't seen but I I\nHim Kenny get hit how could how did you see how does he\nBe affected when when teams are hitting if ... if they get to him does that change him is he the guy that can hang in the pocket\nOf those are the kinds of things that we may not know but I'll say this most quarterbacks if not all quarterbacks when they get hit may become average quarterback yeah they don't ... yeah they don't like it so I don't even take that I don't even know that it's going to be something that you can take from them because no quarterback likes to get hit\nBut I think what he's standing up and he's throwing the football he's thrown in as well as anybody in the country\nYou know what I'm you played for the Vikings you got a chance to watch the Vikings the ... do you watch every Vikings game\nNow I I don't I don't stay steady on him I don't you know I'm a supporter but I wouldn't in kind of a supporting than kind of I guess you don't say\nI'm I don't live and die and it just because you know I got so much football around me I'm doing [laughter] I don't have a chance to focus on one specific place um\nBut it is nice when all of your games locally televise\nYes because you because you don't get to see him that often um and I wasn't sure they were going to win that Philadelphia game\nYeah it's funny a couple of weeks ago we were going to talk about pickers and we got sidetracked or really didn't get into it\nAnd last night or yesterday afternoon and the Vikings game on a day when there were so many missed kicks all over the league and the Vikings kicker missed a couple of key at an escape he stepped up and he made he when he made the the the kick when you need to make it as a player as a former player\nUm you know I saw that that one a clip yesterday of green base kicker you'd miss so many kicks and Aaron Rodgers came over at the end of the game of put his arm around them and and you know tried to console him [noise]\nHe can console him but he probably can't save him [laughter] well yeah that that's what I mean I mean a kicking is just a ... it is it's odd in almost any level of football but I Would imagine in the NFL suffered is even crazier\nIt it is because gas is ... and it is I could see why Rogers could do it because the teams had\nThe quarterback and the kicker has had this unique responsibility hey throw the ball complete the path that's all we need you to do great kicker all we need you do is kick the ball and while that is not as we all know it's not as simple as just kicking it you know the weather you got all these kind of\nOther obstacles in that but players get frustrated like when you as a kicker if you're missing in order ... quarterback and you're overthrowing under throwing his like man what's wrong with you\nI have it's a tough and we've I don't know if there's ever been a year they that we've seen this many miss kicks and I'm not even sure how we even where the where does the blame I mean\nOne thing that I really like is the fact that in professional football they move the extra point line back yes I Love that because it used to be so automatic it was just like this was just a waste of time to even watch this and I know there was some purists you didn't like it but you know what it keeps your attention\nIt does now especially because kittens are missing yeah so it doesn't it go away from the idea of what we say that the NFL like looks to do is that create points\nWell they're creating tons of point yes they are I mean we were talking about this last week we could be going through a renaissance in terms of a young quarterbacks coming up I mean all the rookie quarterback who started yesterday one games I didn't take a look at the the bathroom yesterday\nBut we set a record last week for the number of quarterbacks withdrew for over four hundred yards\nIn a single game I think there were five of them and none of them were named Brady or Rogers and their or rock plus burger and those are good guy\nA it also has to do with the changing of the rules on their hands you know ... you want points you got 'em\nYou know but but wouldn't you wouldn't you want to add on to those points with it like to me moving them back and making it even more challenging just they worked against the kicker and against the idea of more point\nI see what you're saying but it's a lot more exciting to watch an extra point now than it used to it yes I'll give you that has a ...

Y. one word three ... ... e K L E y couple of responses here by the the text line\nFrom the three or four seven for one day but I Love to watch Johnny Carson when he hosted the Tonight Show but none of the hosts today or even remotely funny only watch the eleven o'clock news then hit the sec\nFive AM rolls around really quickly dude yes it does up from the three or four five nine zero day to political I still turn to antenna t._v. and watch Johnny Carson I spend a late night with mostly a dead people although I really enjoy it\nLove your show and your broadcast thanks a lot hey listen I Do appreciate that All right let's get back into the college football thing and bring Allen Kenny into the conversation Ellen how you doing today man thanks for coming on the show\nOh happy beyond that that's where my ...\nNo problem no problem so what's your take on the on the ... of dismissal\nYeah you know I watched that game on Saturday there in the ... uh Oklahoma and Texas are you know I mean I had a feeling that a that was going to be the ah the nail in my soups coughing\nOr you know I mean looking at it just ... Oklahoma has an open date on Saturday So you know two weeks you know kind of made it a um\n[noise] you know I think an opportune time to make that kind of move if they're going to do it now when I say the nail on the cough and I asked we thought that that might with finish out the rest of the year there and then be moving on ah I think that there are a lot of people frankly who were surprised that uh he was back to the season and the first place\nUm but you know uh it's it just sounds like a you know the hours that you really make a Riley thought it was time to ah make a change\nAll right and I guess you have to ask this I mean was this is difficult to this decision for Lincoln Riley to make in light of the fact that obviously Mike is Bob's brother\nUm yeah I mean I think it's got to be right you know I mean I'm not there with the team every day but I don't\nUnderstand how you know how it couldn't be I mean you know a ... ... you know Bob Stoops gifted Lincoln Riley is very\nA very kind of promising situation there and that you know my you know for all of the uh slings and arrows suffer you know the second ride oh you did a time to help build the sooner back into a a national our house\nAh that one Bob Stoops took over you know back in Nineteen Ninety nine so I yeah I mean I think there's just a lot there that had a tough decision for Riley\nAllen this is ... how are you I'm doing well man\nWhen these kinds of decisions are made you know it it almost becomes pointed at it as an example\nThis is how does this I Am actually impact\nThe whole coaching staff when you see a guy like that being removed and is he at fault for what the defense is or isn't doing\nWow that's a great question I mean I think that yeah he I mean\nYou have to put it on and in terms of how they're deep and so as a horse performing I mean you know might spend their now seven years he had all different kinds of all ... all kinds of time to get everything in the right in the right price now\nCorrect his um you know the other assistance there are going they're white that's a great question um and it's hard to tell 'em I think that uh\nYou know when it comes to stuff like tackling you know when you know at the expense of back in his head turned around and timing stuff like that sure yet the ah the assistance also after death some possibility for that\nUm but you know I I I think though that it was also kind of getting to a point to where uh it sounds as though you know whatever was when I was just going to break in the locker room to\nCan you just bring another guy up or do you bring another guy in and force that guy mailed to some what you're going to have to somewhat to stay in that same\nOh and I'm thinking even with two weeks I don't think you can redo the entire deep means I don't think\nOh yeah no that that the plant here it's not too are just so everything up I mean I think the clan here is or or interests or faking that you know kind of getting everybody uh on on the same page you know what they're going to do is they're going to make rocker and make Neal\nYet offensive the interim defensive coordinator\nUm based on what I've heard that dusty or check a former Oklahoma cuts to live without now ESPN throughout this morning or that or you know it's going to be a matter where\nWhile a myth Neal is a heavy things up for both ... and what not quite going there's going to be done by ... was a\nFormer defensive coordinator for African also was a head coach at the University of Connecticut for a little while and that box than I thought the Oculus been on the staff\nOr out of this year as a you know as a quality control kind of consulting analysts guy so I mean they couldn't do it or not or that health hell you know take over those duties I think\nWe're talking with Alan Kenny from uh the the sooner blood bleeding to ... you may know him a little bit better from some of the articles he writes for Apple on sports we're talking about\nThe situation at Oklahoma were Mike's new was officially dismissed today as the defensive coordinator and the rough and McNeil takes over you know a Alan ... you mentioned the Bob the ...\nThe the it's not as if Oklahoma doesn't have some really a terrific defensive minds with with Robin McNeil in the ... both of those guys have been successful in a lot of different locations on deepens\nOh yeah yeah you know a ... and it didn't matter you know I mean ... ... you know ironically enough was actually kind of\nKind of you know came to the fore back in two thousand seven in a similar situation when Texas Tech coach Mike Leach decided to make a change on his defensive staff I forgot about ... than yeah an elevated elevated wrapped into uh\nThe ... coordinator and he ended up making that a permanent position so you know it it there it's not without precedent\nYeah you know one of the dismissal of tubes I\nMean if you know the fact that Oklahoma lost the game I mean occasionally teams do lose games but did things come to a boil because it was Texas\nOh I think that that you know you can't you can't ignore that and just the idea that you know Oklahoma with book so kind of a disorganized in a big game like that\nOr you know and ... you know it's it comes to a certain\nDegree you you just reach a point in time after a while when like you can only paying your head against the wall for so long you know Mike had been there for seven years I Believe in ... in it\nFor a defensive coordinator that they twelve as an eternity and you know I mean I think that that just in general from everyone from the players the than you know it just wasn't working and you know they said it was time to to make a move\nAnd then finally we do appreciate your time I mean now that Oklahoma has lost a game I mean the margin of error for the sooner is to get to the playoffs really really huge is very slim now", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city":
