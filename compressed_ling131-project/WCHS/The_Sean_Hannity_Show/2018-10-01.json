uh watching the game and so I'm trying to you know move away because if there was a key base head and that once you've always\nSaid oh and here's the other thing Jeff I'm you know we don't have this quite set up the way it's supposed to be set up right now so I'm mature I I'm I Am negotiating three different remote right now but I got I got the game on this ... thing I got the yeah yeah and I've I've talked about how much I Love these day games ban I but I just love major league baseball games or I\nWould argue in coop talking I mean you would much rather right when the division oh be in that one game you know that one game do or die thing tomorrow\nRight you can't be you can't if you're a manager you can't be looking at the situation and saying I'm going to wait and start my starter ex if I win this particular game you've got to be thinking this is it okay never once you can do is and this has not happened where one one and the gate\nBut for example what if one of these sea content and had come out for the cubs and just given up a bunch of runs early you could have gotten him out of the game 'cause you could have looked at the situation and said okay we're not going to win this game we are going to save our pitching because you might need him or you might need it but that's not what's happened now so container\nYou know he's cooked for a while just seen the same thing for the birds you know it's fascinating it's really I I Love playoff baseball All right what do we got news why\nWell our lead story day is the impeachment trial that Walker taking place today in front of the state Senate first witness to the stand Beth Walker she was on ah she was on the witness stand for\nA couple of hours a call by the house managers so basic call by the prosecution and in a in the defense said that that she will be their only witness I guess they could call her back on the defense but she basically testify today that she regretted yes or a\nSigning off on that one hundred thousand plus dollar renovation of her office after she came on board and for the um\nThe working lunch is about to participate in and give or take fifty of those lunches and as was pointed out today they didn't have Burger King order it in a it was so ... it was a south hills market it was I mean it was kind of the high the you know it was a high a\nA a more of the high end a good restaurants ...\nOh yeah\nThat was the high end they didn't go over to the Capitol cafeteria and you know get a couple of blocks lunches and bring it back to the court\nBut she wrote a check for those for her part she wrote a check but the question was when was your check written after reporter starting snooping around a little bit [noise] uh and so she admitted that well she said yeah that's yeah I I wrote that's when I wrote mine so you know it'll be up\nIt was sent it to the side is it enough to remove her from office do know is it that much to enough to censor her at one point during their testimony today day she was asked\nUm [noise]\nDo you think when you think of the impeachment what do you think and she said I think of\nYou know I'm you know\nBeing bought all four of 'em out you know I mean the more serious things and she's done basically she was trying to lay the groundwork\nFor we'll see what they do and we'll see you know if it's going to stretch into the more they caught a couple of other witnesses to this day and now I just kind of laying the house is kind of the prosecution here see if they're kind of laying the groundwork\nYou know what the job I mean\nHere's the thing I I understand there's a sense of entitlement and you've reached the top of your profession when you reach the state Supreme Court okay what if a lot of the things that occurred in their admittedly it have occurred here in almost any other business you'll be fired ...\nWrites wouldn't you oh you'd be under disciplines yeah yeah he fired a so ...\n... and these are the Supreme Court judges and the rest of the politicians they all worked for us\nAs the ah you know we are collectively their bosses around so I you know I think we have a right to to to put their feet to the fire here\nDo well yeah I mean that's what that's what the hue and cry is out there Dave ... is a you know I think that's what lawmakers here yeah you know out there so we'll see Brad gotta play by play as you followed it there Dave he's got a nice blog going [laughter] he's he's writing it off and he's in it that the at the lead story on our website WB\nMetro news dot com now as that's taking place walk across cast Gilbert wonderful building they hear the capital to the state Supreme Court and they're having Jenkins getting sworn into the court today to seat he was appointed by the governor he left Congress yesterday\nHe was appointed by the governor and he was sworn in today now the question will be will he ever hear a case before the before the November general election I mean all the cases have been pushed back\nWe'll see but now we do have those to spot the menace catch him see filled by Tim arms that the Robin Davis seat filled by Evan Jenkins Jenkins sworn in today\nJeff what do you think do you think of it because of what's going on nationally the Kavanaugh situation it's cetera that that a ... ... that if that was an existing there'll be more national coverage of what's going on with their state Supreme Court controversy I think\nSo there's been there's been a little bit of coverage but not I I think it would be yes my answer is it would be I think it would be on the national radar they're doing so much more also they've given you you kind of go with the Kavanaugh\nSituation we understand we have a reporter over there right now are Jake flatly I'm five women have kind of\nBeen at the senator's office here in Charleston senator a mansion refusing to leave until they get some answer on the Kavanaugh situate wow\nSo um so we're over there were trying to get to the bottom of that in his Charleston offices\nAlso today a former wheeling human resources director pleaded guilty\nTo stealing from the stage play guilty to federal charge of wire fraud we've got that story at the website National Weather service has the national weather service has won office in West Virginia that's here in Charleston\nThey had to close that up a couple of weeks ago cause a mold and they were shipped out the Pittsburgh then actually over to Sterling Virginia for a few days and now they're back here but in trailers until they get the mold cleaned up\nTo an update their and then back to the Supreme Court Allen Law for eight to suspend the justice goes on trial tomorrow\nHey I wanted to ask you one day I don't think about sports before we go to a job Ricardo you're on the sidelines for that spring valley cattle game the other night yes a spring valley pretty good restive\nImpressive not only are they humongous\nUm they're fast and that's I think was the most surprising thing to me or not just quickness but downright fast chasing down capital players which is difficult to do for most teams\nThey they couldn't get the perimeter on that couldn't get the corners on him for the most part couldn't get behind them deep I mean really impressive showing by spring valley\nSprings valley I'm In the class where they could give Martin's burger game isn't\nEverything Martin's Berg there obviously there are so talented um but so spring valley and uh so we'll we'll see if the if if it gets that far that was such a key game the other night day because you know depends on how the rest of the season plays out but that like to lose your that can be forced him to go into road play more as we are gonna semis\nAlready damage so thank you Joe ... here in Charleston sc a job or Cato on the line from Morgantown for some sports how you doing Joe ... thanks so what's your take on spring valley you think they could give Martin's bringing a game\nI'm interested to see because I'm likely hit it over the Orangeburg on Friday nights check out their game against Iran do Virginia which is a team that year to year usually gives Martin's burger pretty good game so you could probably answer that question a little bit better on a on friday night after seeing them but\nYou know certainly spring valley passes the test with the line with three division one prospects that they can run at you and some great skill players to match so I Would not be surprised if we see those two teams as the last two standing and ...\n... power rankings for

good will never know what would have happened in Raleigh North Carolina had had they've\nFaced off which is a shame because in these days off so for now and sitting down there at twenty three but you know now you got you got a great quarterback got some really good skilled player and you've got a couple of planning that goes on defense so you know as of now yeah I think they belong in the top that\nLet me ask you this ah our question of the day is recalibrate your predictions for the college football playoffs right now you know I really didn't give you a chance to think about this but what's your gut reaction to that who are your four playoff team now\n[noise] I think Ohio State than I think there's still a away for the SEC because there's so many good teams in the top ten from the SPCA to get to and again which might cause upheaval in every other geographic region\nUm I mean someone's got to go from the ACC right ah [noise] I guess as Clemson although\nIt's just not a scary looking lake right now and I don't know what the quarterback situation as going forward\nSo um [noise] I Would say to se the\nUh Ohio State and then either Clinton the Notre Dame or Oklahoma for that fought on ...\nOklahoma [noise] I don't think they have a scary scary team left on their schedule the road trip to West Virginia's tear it less but if you lose it and then the next week in Arlington then I think Oklahoma's right back in so oh it's Oklahoma can can split those two games and the undefeated going in and they're probably okay\nThey don't want to ask you about Notre Dame because a Stanford was a big test and Notre Dame past\nThat they one thirty eight Seventeen now you take a look at the rest of Notre Dame schedule I only bring this up because the Notre Dame is also a contender

Tech this weekend hosting pit hosting navy at Northwestern ah hosting Florida State hosting Syracuse at southern cow\nUndefeated season for Notre Dame is doable\nIt is and then they're going to test

I remember I because it was a Sunday night I was still awake I happened to be on Twitter and all of these videos in real time started popping up on my feet so I I Will never forget it as\nSomeone who was sitting in Los Angeles for people that were there\nThis is an incredibly impactful moment and I think what people need to realize is that for a lot of the country singer isn't performers who read there are a lot of ways for them to deal with it came to their music they created song on the cover Jason ... went on Saturday Night live and did a cold open not\nLike us I was just beautiful I mean\nDifferent ways of handling it but in creative ways but I\nThink the biggest thing that they had seen in a in terms of security a lot of the artists were there saying ... at the charity is now a daily conversation when they are performing at and then you not only do they want to make sure that they're safe on the day that they want to make sure that the fans are in the audience our state and everybody knows where the exits are and know where\nTo go in case of another tragic event\nYeah that's all exactly right and the the other thing country music stations all across the country or recognize the the the moment that this attack\nTook place or a year ago that was just an awful event or a you know Saturday Night live debuted for the new season on Saturday and I think about this you know they had all this time to prepare their show and I guess they just basically had to a call ... with the Brits cabinet thing and totally reworked or open\nCompletely because remember all of this happened at the end of the week and they wound up doing an almost eight minute catch as part of the cold up there which is pretty long for a cold open and you have to make sure you get someone who can portray bright carbon out which of course with Matt Damon and I think you have to also take a step back\nAnd look and go what parts of this were funny because there are plenty of aspects\nOf the testimony that we're not funny shouldn't be joked about and so they clearly you know stayed away from any testimony that Dr Ford gay because sexual assault will never be funny um but they really kind of like she'll get in there and made fun of like the calendar that he had\nBecause I don't know how many people hate calendars from Nineteen eighty to write a film of the water drinking that happened\nObviously within a tense moment for Brett Kavanaugh but they turned it into a pretty funny sketch and I thought that they did a really good job even upbringing and some of the funny cameos as well\nSo you know I I really be interested in in in knowing how this works I mean were they watching the coverage there in New York at thirty rock and somebody said you know somebody call Matt Damon but where is Matt Damon ... Matt Damon good here on Saturday\nDo we send him the script I mean a lot of things really had to come together very quickly same thing with Rachel dredge I mean\nA ... okay let's try to see which of the senators match up with celebrities we can get a hold of it was pretty interesting process\nFascinating process you know as far Michael is on the phone and your available you know that you're going to be rushing on a plane to New York city um\nAs soon as you can of course but it really is amazing what they're able to pull together and such a short amount of time and oftentimes people don't know the process on Saturday\nThey do a show called Saturday Night dead before they actually do Saturday Night live for the country and they pull sketches out and they change sketches that things are done even just an hour before they go live\nYou know that it's just a a really really interesting situation what do you think do you think they reached out to Melissa mulatto to be part of that sketches she just couldn't come in and they decided a worker in any way or with a cardboard cutout\nI actually think the cardboard cutout was funnier than I Do a lot in there and get them trade all of a sudden you know she ... she has a little cameo\nJust to let them a lot of faith on a stick\nOr look let's talk a little bit about last man standing moving from ABC to Fox and Murphy Brown coming back after Twenty years you know I really didn't anticipate that I Would watch either one of those shows but I watched him both uh what was your take on Murphy Brown\nI thought that Murphy Brown you know I I was a big Murphy brand than when it first came around and big Candice Bergen than I did think hit on the Trump jokes a little too heavy and I personally think that this cat\nUh and these writers are more talented than just relying on a trunk joke I'm going to be honest about that um\nI realize that they're representing a very skewed perspective because that's where she came from from the original show but I\nLike we talked about last week like when I was at the Emmys and like I don't want to hear a bunch of Trump jokes because we're being hit with it outside of our entertainment were being hit with it on social media and everything out though sometimes I feel like we need to relax a little bit on that and what I think\nTim Allen he and his crew did really well last man standing he's representing a conservative point of view but it's not necessarily a Trump point of view\nYeah but the other or the gear right on both of those cases the one thing about the Murphy Brown show that I thought was interesting was part of the story line was that Murphy actually went on a date with Donald Trump or didn't realize that that actually did happen the Candice Bergen did go on a day with Donald Trump when she was a student at Penn did you know that\nI didn't know that in fact anyone wants to go back and watch the clip she talked about the story and watch what happens live with Andy Kohut okay after it happened earlier this year that she talked about it and you can find that clip on YouTube and it's a funny story\nAlright and Kevin Hart a Kevin hearts movie night school with a funny hat

broken leg in three years of for the Seattle Seahawks\nHe reported late was on the field they're playing the Arizona Cardinals you know he's coming off the field on a stretcher\nAnd he gives his own bench the finger\nI mean uh I understand that he's got a problem with this contract situation I don't think I've ever seen that have you ever seen that\nNot me personally no and I'll be interested to hear what Carl has to say about about it because as a fan and as a Seattle fan and as an Earl Thomas fan I Know you've got your leg broke but you make ten million dollars a year I Know you're holding out on a contract to use on the biggest difference about contract in two thousand fourteen forty million over four years\nUh Eric Barry Malcolm Jenkins both have bigger contracts nowadays\nLater on um I mean you paid a contract to play for years right I I don't know why you would give your teammates to finger the ... being carted off the field I don't know\nYeah and you were talking about Pete Carroll and he made some comments today Karl where he's defending Earl Thomas\nAnd and if there's ever been a player's coach Pete Carroll is that guy he is the epitome of\nA player coach you can you can judge that however you want she's not going to thrashing guy\nI'm back on his football team he's not going to crash the guy who is a a great football player for a football team that he coaches he's just not going to do that that's not his mentality\nUm the problem that I have with this is from the teammates 'cause teammates are going to take that now to me I'm not sure if this is career ending at this point\nWith ... with the history of broken legs I'm not sure if he's looking at this and doing making that gesture by saying this is it\nYou know that's how I kind of see it all he\nDid almost retire last year yeah he he was thinking about retirement so this might be what pushes him over the edge to them\nAnd I think that's the only thing that motivates you to do that because it wasn't Pete fault that you're you're you got your leg broken when your team's fault that you got your leg broke now\nThat you got to separate and this was the hardest piece for I think players to separate management coaches and and ... those are all different entities altogether management's up there they're they're managing money [laughter] you know what I'm saying they're looking at OK well days getting is how do we make this fit in\nMen who were your teammate hey we were in it with you you know we've got to fight that same thing don't get made of anger added if I had to give you whatever you want it so that's\nI think that's where it's going to be a challenge for him is to try to justify to teammates why did you did that\nYeah you know we've talked about a salary disputes in the NFL before he'd just his reaction after the injury there makes this situation unique I mean in Earl Thomas was an outstanding player I mean these are elite defender\nBut there are other teams that are looking at the situation too I mean there are an awful lot of people who thought\nThat Earl Thomas was going to force a trade or before the season began a lot of people still thought that before the trading deadline he would be dealt with the Dallas Cowboys the cowboys situation\nYou know uh apparently Seattle wanted a second round pick for him they only wanted to offer a third but you know they thought the farther to the situation was going to go down the line in the season they were going to acquire now nobody's going to a quarter of these out for the year and will be a free agent at the end of the year\n... but I mean when you see somebody I as a as a former professional football player do will teams take this incident into consideration before they invest you know tens of millions of dollars in rural Thomas I especially after an injury a second broken leg in the last three years\nI think when that agent goes in to have to start having these conversations if you're an owner you're going to want to know like hey what really went on behind all of that because you you got it got it seems to me injury prone\nAnd you got a guy who flip this whole team off I'm not sure I Need to know what I'm bringing in and I'm and I'm and I and I think it also scares me as an owner\nHow much money I'm going to pay you because I'm not sure what I can get back from you and and he's gonna have to work out for teams right because you know there's there's no way I'm taking it I'm going to pay him without him\nShowing me that he's one hundred percent healed and even at that I'm not sure how long he can stay healthy but let me ask you this\n... what would you what would that have happened if if that happened in let's say the eighties or seventies with some of the coaches the bud grant and all that what there'd be no question what would happen in those days you're ... you're ... you're gone\nThe coup let me ask you a question as West Virginia's most visible Seahawks bad effect on me that what if we get into a scenario next year where a rural Thomas wants to come back ah but no other team wants to offer him the kind of money that he wants\nAnd Seattle offers them a one year deal as a member of the twelfth man would you take him back\nI Know I'm not sure the problem I have with it and understand the business aspect of things and I understand the players perspective to a degree a URL Thomas feels like this is perfectly illustrative of his point he was in the last year of his contract he got hurt before you get cash in on his next payday that's what led me on bills scared of right\nSo you're asking me if he came back when one year contract at what point during the season enders he quit this time around\nOr does it does it start complaining about his contract this number and if it's a one year deal with two games in a I Can't play anymore because I Can't practice on Wednesday is because I'm going to get hurt and I made a cash out at the end of this year\nI mean where where where do you START I mean going forward and you're and you're sounding five year contract after your three are you saying okay well we know he's not going to play anymore after a year three because he's afraid of getting hurt going into his free agency and then so\nReally this is a three year contract I mean where does it stop and what is it where where did the contracts actually stop losing or start losing meaning 'cause it seems like they don't mean four years any more\nThan that is a really great question Karl let me ask you this and we got to take a break here in the sex of as a former for her first ... professional athlete if you were a member of the Seahawks this incident takes place and they sign him to a one year deal so he can continue to maybe bring his value back up with the players ...\n[noise] yeah I think because he he is a good player so I'm thinking yes but I think there's going to be ... there'll be some animosity there um and especially for the guy who steps in and place for him now\nOh man that's going to say hey we need a quick break in or out his next\nRetirement plan denies for your knee and you run by being the wealth management no matter

in game one sixty three four Milwaukee but he fell a home run and an RBI short of winning the triple crown wow\nHe will lead he'll end the regular season\nAs the leader in home in in hitting he's got the highest batting average three twenty six or so he beats scooter Jeanette in that particular category we knew that was going to happen he finished second to hobby by as\nIn R B eyes he has a hundred and ten by as has a hundred and eleven\nAnd Nolan are an auto other Iraqis\nWill win the home run championship he has thirty seven yellow chest thirty six still an amazing year but it's just mind bending that the the stats for this game do call it the play offs it's a tie breaker a hundred and sixty three games a just misses the triple crown\nThey they would have counted one thing that I Am glad and that little a summary that you gave is a hobby or by as did not win the RBI ground because I made a prediction of her own protection racket are all star game show that we did that a hobby by as\nHe's only he's not going to lead the league in order to be out at a time the season rolls around\nYou know he didn't need even second it with a so yell at each was aiming to be the first triple crown winner since I'm I'm a ... did it for the tigers\nBack in twenty twelve before that no one had won the triple crown since ... did it in the in the the miracle season for the the Boston Red Sox back in Nineteen sixty so\nSee Carl we baseball fans we get into the weeds\nI hired a go go go of your eyes when really they they're I guess what the brewers are yelling\nFor this season his his salary the season ah not much seven million\nDollar it's pretty amazing yeah I think about seven million dollars to the to the normal person that's like money beyond your wildest dreams but then based on money that's ... you know I saw one of the road after him yeah that's the you know go to to go to jail and do not pass go get right to jail and that\nAll right uh Carl high school football I wanted to ask you did you see a high school game last week\nNo I did not [noise] I'm I'm I Can't I got to get up so early so I'm In bed on um friday night but I I Know what I Do know is\nThat South Charleston is really in trouble oh man they're windowless yes they are when all is a great games though\nUm and then they're in their defense I mean they played a brutal schedule that might be the most difficult schedule I may have seen in high school to start out\nWe uh our our flagship affiliate for this program is WC a jazz\nAnd we had the the spring valley capital game on friday night where you know the classic match up where you had\nThe the massive often so blind yeah spring valley of going against the the speed on both sides of the line for capital in spring valley won the game so makes you wonder what's gonna happen when we get to the playoffs\nYeah because he used to I mean these teams will some kind of way they've got to see each other again\nYeah oh I think that's going to happen I think that's definitely going to happen so ... are both West Virginia and Marshall were on the road this week in West Virginia went to Texas Tech they built a big lead in the first half\nUm Texas Tech made things definitely interesting in the second half before a pick six uh uh put that game on ice for West Virginia marshals game was really crazy uh they went to the western Kentucky\nOr they looked as if they were going to uh to win the game when they had an interception near the end of the game instead a as a a green through a pick\nAnd it it looked like Marshall was going to lose the game and then suddenly they forced the turnover forced to fumble inside the tent yard lined with less than a minute to go when all western Kentucky needed was a field goal to tie a pretty crazy yeah pretty crazy weekend\nYou know and ... and ... ... Greer is he's I mean and again I'm I'm a I'm a Marshall guy but Greer is is an amazing football player and great quarterback\nAnd I I really I Can't I Can't wait to start to hear his name if it happened because I feel like being a view they may not want to make him a truce top pick\nThat I just keep I just feel like this guy is a top pick in the NFL Draft I think he's better than some of the top quarterbacks that are playing it quote top program\nMan can you imagine what kind of shoot out we would have had if a West Virginia's game at North Carolina state hadn't been washed away by the hurricane lane Finley and in Greer that would've been a a ... game in terms of a quarterback who could go really are\nEarly in the first round it's interesting ah we were talking about this a little bit in the three o'clock hour wherever you take a look at careers numbers against Texas Tech three hundred and Seventy yards passing three touchdowns no interceptions no turnovers for West Virginia the ... he took every snap\nA But West Virginia didn't score after half time so there was a lot of chatter about it was really the first time this season that anybody had really stopped West Virginia's often and for a lot of West Virginia fan so it was really a shock to the system\nWell and and and ... and here's here's the only fear to that is is that someone's going to that that's on tape right that don't feel ... and somebody's going to look at this might be what we need to do they so what ever happened they will see that again at the other thing is\nI don't know this but so I'm a present as as a question\nWas Texas Tech able to throw the ball late in the game\nTo hurt the secondary of WB you well\nIt's funny cause was for a West Virginia had to face a running quarterback in the second half\nBecause the ... the first string quarterback for the freshman Bowman\nWas injured we didn't know whether he was going to come back in the second ... found out he had a partially collapsed long over he had to go to the hospital and so that it was a very very serious injury oh wow so the the quarterback who came in for him you know was running all over the field and there was a different look of the west Virginia's defense\nApparently wasn't prepared for\nBut I mean listen here's the thing\nI don't really think anybody should really go into panic mode I mean when you take a look at what happened in the final analysis Greer through three touchdowns West Virginia won the game uh they beat a nationally ranked opponent on the road was a conference when\nYou know I I just think that there is a segment of the people out there that are now expect in West Virginia to win\nForty five fifty nothing by just rolling their helmets out there and that's\nNow that's not that's not going to happen and again you know people are watching films fill each week and they're looking at what they do and of course and it gets more challenging as the year goes on just because\nTeams teams seeing where you can be vulnerable see because I was concerned about the ... I I wanted I thought Texas textbook would would throw the football on him and that might expose them but if the second half was that way with a running quarterback maybe it's not exposed yet or maybe it happens at all\nBut one thing that we're talking about just briefly in the three o'clock hour just want to reset it here is that say for example Greer goes on and he wins the Heisman\nHave there been that many instances where Heisman Trophy winner as were shut out or play bad games and ah we research that a little bit and they actually have", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "01"}
