joins million\nKyle nice winds and I for university I\nExpected this to be a little bit of a mismatch because pressed and really really decimated by injuries or their way down deep on their\nQuarterback a chart in fact they use the ... all of a players who are primarily wide receivers that quarterback that I mean that's just how banged up they are and uh the ox knew they had that advantage and university really went out\nAnd took care of business early it wasn't a completely smooth that for it I mean there were some issues ... university off that sport that you know you see the score fifty that up and you think\nThat it was a it was complete combination but still a university has to pitch is ostensibly but they made enough big ways to uh keep the crowd in the game and I'm\nHaving Gro was the real standout senior receiver had five ... down reception that I Want to sixty seven yards the dot the scoring going yet at twenty seven yard reception that set up a short touchdown yet a thirty three yard touchdown reception of great\nDiving catch over the middle of so he managed with pot touchdowns tonight and the Logan older than the second week back after a banging up that ankle and a ... a night of Eighteen passing like one of ... two hundred yards\nAnd a parole against seven catches one hundred Ninety or yards five touchdown grabs\nSo you know the ... the first shot out of the year\nAgain it was a cross the team that just was younger to begin with and what the injuries that they had to deal with they were just a way deep on the chart quarterback and running back and really had no chance than I but it does set up an interesting well our goal because\nThe hawks the out a broken out off that's legal last two weeks against bought cannon and trust and and then of course what Morgantown did John Marshall than I caught everybody by surprise so look like they're back on track and uh we look to have a pretty solid game and the ... are all next

in the past couple of weeks you know you've got to run the table to get in and they were forced tonight here ... bank started out with a bang ration out early in the game Haiti are touched down around the ... a little bit later on in a quarter\n... at an eighty three are touchdown run twelve nothing we\nWent up twenty six but nothing at the half time in in the second half it was kind of back and forth Notre Dame comeback\nCredit for twenty four sixteen to that end up forty to twenty two just a few stance for your for your we had three outstanding performance shares in our lives on trade really Wilson I\nI'm ... end of the game twenty two ... two hundred and three orange juice touchdowns ... it's the second time\nHe's won over two hundred this year he's over twelve hundred for the season or ... or ... hundred and sixty one year orange into touchdown one was receiving touchdown and Lou cartridge in little bike that\nI asked a few weeks I broke loose tonight he at Eighteen cherries a hundred and Ninety charge and he scored a touchdown happy Eighteen we ended up with fifty four carries\nA hundred and Ninety three aren't rushing for the game and we had over five hundred yards audience for the games and all this she's really clicked in the ... blonde played well and five and four we good among Tom next week we need to win that one and I think we're going to slide into the playoffs\nIt obviously did not go in there in their favor and also you know with the the rent a game that that was shut down for much of it they tried to do a little bit of passing or they were actually intercepted four times tonight which is something that we haven't really had to talk about much because they don't really\nNormally throw the ball or they were just trying to for a new little wrinkle and and like I said many things and then not go in their favor taking on the tent a very very good Williamstown team next week we go to Hannah and and ah and then hopefully in a in two weeks we'll find out\nWhat the destination is where the playoff game is is a good bunch of kids a good team\nUh they they will they will learn from this moment and they will get better from his home\nIn the gym Mike we look forward to talking with you next week buddy thank you say they're appreciate it there you go my camera the voice of\nParkersburg capital IQ Greg Gary joins me now Greg made the trip down to ... stadium tonight and Bluefield back on track but\nThey are they were you know someone off their first lost after having a a twenty game win streak snap last week in\nBeavers look like an angry bunch or you know unfortunately parochial they were the ones that had to take it out on tonight but uh\nIt was it wasn't it wasn't all that competitive of a game you know so the first eight or nine minutes\nOh kill hung tops and then they showed it to go forward on a fourth in six play at the Bluefield twenty five they ended up missing it by less than a yard and from that point on it was just kind of a snowball effect a juice Edwards with a couple of long runs straight Mullen's at a formal recovery for a touchdown Blue Shield blocked upon that\nSet up their first or and and you can't give that often so short field and you know any defensive points because they're big playoff and so when they get other contributions from those special teams in defense of units you know kind of leads to what you saw the night to forty nine to ... when\nYou go in a blue sealed two more games remain either and James Monroe and then they welcome Beckley Woodrow Wilson the last week the season so it seemed like Freddie Simon's ball club do really is back on track after only scoring ... points last week against lord by the time\nYeah they only ran Saudi one ... scrimmage in that game so you know they just really had a difficult time sustaining anything and and putting it drives together and obviously that makes\nIt incredibly tough to you know do anything that you're aspiring to do and then you add it up and that's kind of how they lost Seventeen to three but uh\nI Will say that you know I've seen some senior play this year I've not seen Blue Shield and I think you know if those are the two teams there's obviously a long way to go but if those are the two genes that end up getting back to wheeling I Would consider a toss up game I Would\nCaution anybody that you know ... just roll to a state championship that Bluefield is very legitimate they are very big up front and they got a lot of speed and a lotta sides\nGregory she had a buddy safe travels okay no problem ... has a

they can finish the year at nine and one and certainly host a couple of playoff games\nYeah the uh and we talked about you know the potential for five match up with a British board and Bluefield that still could potentially exist yet and\nJust real quick here before we are led joke go he's got stories to write and stuff like that but I Want to talk about this Bridgeport road defense because\nYou go back to the Fairmont senior road game they gave up forty five the only other road game before tonight was at but cannon up to her and they won that one twenty nine twenty eight so to go on the road to Kaiser in hold the golden tornado to Nineteen and when I may be some better things coming out of that bridge for defense here late in the season\nAnd a lot of those runs like I said a lot of those yards caused was able to put up they did so in the fourth quarter the first thing that John Cole said when he came over to speak with a squad after the game was complementing the defense said the up and said okay\nBut uh was particularly complimentary that the the defensive job particularly that did in the first half of an air force a fumble in the first half put that into points just before I have time to put them up to score is that the break that ultimately proved to be the difference\nAlright Joe get outta here you got your work to do baggage that once you get a good pictures\nAh got lots of good highlights and we'll get everything uploaded pretty soon\nThat will be metro news dot com check it out thank you Joe appreciate it buddy All right let's go to the phones real quick ... salmon joins me now mango central and Herbert Hoover another nice winter night for the miners buddy\nYeah for the central there in the kind of role in this ... year you know the reason I called and not you know the individual stats and the game or impressive but there were a couple of uh of cumulative season stats that I Want to address and a little bit a middle central as you guys are\nYou know record so far to not won the game fifty to Twenty one over Herbert Hoover a quarterback sophomore quarterback Dale and go to\nFinish the night twenty to thirty for four hundred and eighty eight yards any three for eight scores and when I talk to my brother Josh after the game he thought that that they could have even played better and I don't know really understand where he could have but ah his favorite receiver tonight was junior\nA wide receiver drew Hatfield yet nine catches for a hundred and eighty five yards\nAnd three touchdowns his younger brother Devon Hatfield the freshman yet seven catches for a hundred and fifty two yards and to scores another sophomore receiver Isaac more had three cats is\nDo it I was with her for a touchdown he finished the night with a hundred and one yards and senior barely mentioned one thirty four yard a touchdown reception but what I really wanted to call and talk to you guys about tonight which I'm proud of him credit or with because I'm a little shocked and surprised\nA is key moments of numbers tonight with sophomore quarterback Dale and go and wide receiver drew Hatfield bail and go we were we were talking during the broadcast a you know making some comparisons to to the former mayor of central quarterback Jeremy deal on one of the Kennedy Award\nOr in two thousand and sixteen when when we won the state championship there are three of the season so far eight games they wouldn't go to one thirty five a completion for one hundred eighty five attempts he's thrown for two thousand four hundred and eighty four yards and thirty four touchdowns\nThrough Hatfield has sixty one catches he's thrown he's he's caught the ball I'm Sorry uh for one thousand in forty two yards and fourteen touchdowns this season through gangs\nSo we were looking at the two thousand and sixteenth stats I've gotten pulled up your right now Jeremy dealing when he won the candy award as a junior he he was one eighty nine for two Ninety nine\nHe finished his even with two thousand eight hundred and fifty two yards and thirty seven touchdown so we we knew when when Jeremy left to the program there's gone on to play basketball Marshall\nThat the quarterback coming in and was going to have some big shoes to fill a and sneak ally a sophomore quarterback bailing go to a has kind of done that and he's right on pace to have a Jeremy dealing like season\nAnd the question I ate the miners are they go home now for a couple of weeks a minor mountain they got Chapman bill coming in next week they close out the season was Winfield uh minor mountains so a it looks like a you know you just got to play ball and let it take care of itself\nYeah that's the one thing that that Josh and I were talking about before the game you know you can get on on different you know Web sites and do some prognosticators in there to kind of see where you think you might end up um but you know if maybe the central is hoping for a home playoff game to finish in the top eight or it looks like they're going to need some help with some bonus points there's still a lot can happen in these last\nA few weeks of this even as as we're well aware of but that's kind of what the hope is for this thing goes central football teams at least one on playoff game start the playoffs\nJohn appreciate a buddy thank you sir thank you huh All right let's go to coach Williams now runs county and ravens would love main coach\nNegotiate with me to do was\nGo through this way then Joel enrolled joins me Joe welcome embody a ... hawks tonight\nWell the polka dots continue to roll yeah they do they know\nAfter a big game and Madison night uh I'll tell you what are\nThey got they got some athletes on this poker team\nYou know they've kind of struggle to last for years but are they really put it altogether in church or\nA Ramsey is doing a great job or they started off with a sixty two yard touchdown run by schemes Bronson schemes but there was three touchdowns I Want to or three scores I Want to call a particular poke at night or right before the halftime sophomore quarterback are\nConnected with gains on a\nFifty five yard pass play class kitchen run but it was just I mean it was on strike and it was nice ... nice kitchen though of course a political one at twenty eight six at the half\nThen right after the apple actually about midway through the third quarter cook connected with blood spraying link on almost the same pass play Stratfor stride right his hands a split\nThe probably the most impressive score tonight was Joseph starch or kicked the forty one yard field goal with for twenty nine to go in a ball game tonight and I think he could have moved back a probably a few yards and still made it so uh anyway final scored scout Phil Knight a poke at a forty five six over stop a couple of quick stats um\nFort Polk a total off the ants three hundred and twenty three yards on thirty five plays average of non point to\nStand for that is Scott Scott hawks the hundred and Ninety One yards fifty four plays average a three point five yards provides\nA I guess a positive note for the scouts tonight they only had one turnover and that was an interception bucks on her white or no ... and the game which uh they've not been accustomed to the last few games a couple of quick stats for poke a cook was six were fourteen hundred and fifty yards passing two touchdowns one interception and uh\nOh and my plan of hand had seven carries for Ninety seven yards and that touched down so not a big night for poke at as the eight no dots host or one in seven Herbert Hoover next friday night the scouts go one and said when they travel to three and five a wind field\nRight job good job is always better we'll talk with you next week okay

cases broke and sometimes families were disrupted\nBecause of this so I'm just curious what would you do one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six\nWith mega millions now up to about ... billion dollar range which would translate in to a one time cash payment of five hundred and sixty five million dollars trying to imagine what that would be like by the way if there isn't a winter tonight and we may find out in the course of this hour\nOr the price for Tuesday nights drawing would be one point six billion dollars that would tie the largest us lottery prize ever and then we could be talking about ah something really worth and investing a couple of bucks in what\nEight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six\nAnd a lot of things you could do with that kinda money what would it be go ahead indulge yourself looking back and talk some more in just a moment the national debt is now over twenty trained on what ...\nA billion that that's that's quite a rate of return they're\nTwenty percent down on a sore point five billion or the properties\nOkay well you've given this a lot of uh do you do play a mega millions were Powerball\nOr only occasionally\nOnly occasionally well obviously years of man is ready for it gee whiz Andrew okay that that guy's gotta gotta planned out already Lewis in Mitchell South Dakota welcome to the boy had a job\nYeah Hi Jim how you doing fine thank you are\nI'm not as planned Donald ... but uh uh I can tell you that ah from a divorce or five years old uh I was supposed to be removed from ah\nMy\nMortgage that I had a lady and I haven't been done so the first thing I Would do is call that mortgage company and a pay that off first\nAh and then uh always had a dream car I owned it for about seven years and then I had to sell it uh which was the addicts has generally so it's going to cost me about eighty thousand to get mother\n... I'm curious how how big is your mortgage\nA I Am only guessing gym because sharp and now for five years you're\nI'm guessing that that's probably about a hundred and ten thousand\nOkay so figure if you're you just to committed there between the mortgage and a and get your version of the general easy to dodge she'd already or you're talking about two hundred grand there so that would leave you about a five hundred sixty four point eight million dollars [laughter] what do you go to the rest of\nBut the biggest portion of it it's I Would uh set up a major scholarship signs\nWell that's very gender and\nRight and I I Know I Would say I will probably get Seventy three\nI think I Would say I would see maybe twenty five million I wouldn't have a big home either to our lives you know ... you know I wouldn't have though a because I'm having an issue with my eyes I think I Would hire myself a driver\nOr but as far as a way to set up the scholarships on and the money I kept up with it nicely I wouldn't say I would go like bananas [laughter] yeah but\nYeah me either you know I I wouldn't go in for for gold bath tub fixtures or anything like that oh no\nNo I have no interest in any large singer local like that uh um\nBut I was there a scholarship fund a would be what I said but that's about the serious yet I'm kinda like you know has to be careful with that\nYeah I mean for example if you if you were to give let's say a oh a a Rotary Club so you're a big Ro terrier did you give so you gave a ... year Rotary Club or\nOh\nCouple of thousand dollars that'd be real nice for them they can do all kinds of projects let's say you give you wrote arena and\nA half a million dollars what would they do with it I mean it would just be a corrupting influence it would be probably do more harm than good and ... that's when I was talking about exactly said All right the Sandra scholarship fund that kind of like that thank you for sharing that to uh Chester insane albums West Virginia hello gesture\nCan thank you create your own ... days a week and a third is for a long time can um [noise] yeah it's really sad\nWhen a lot of people in this kind of money they don't really know how to do it you know what I Would do can get a badger act Christian well you know a person that's been in business for many many years\nShow me out and make the money go and help others that I ... that really needed in a lot of people watch but it would in a way that in money will share or ... for every one that really need it\nYou know you show ... organizations\nThat you got to be careful of
