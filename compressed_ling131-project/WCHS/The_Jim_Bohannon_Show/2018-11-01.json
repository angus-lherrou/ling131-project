without a Seinfeld eight six six fifty jumbo get you to me talking about a couple of things one President Trump\nAnd this idea of the border troops may reach Fifteen thousand he hasn't done it yet he's holding adapted to say you are not going to get through this is gonna be a human wave facing you that's exactly what's going to happen and I'm looking at a poll out there tonight it gives you an idea of what Trump is all about\nIt's a Harris Poll which is a reputable pole and it's about who is responsible\nAs we head toward the midterms for this current booming economy\nOkay\nForty seven percent believe Trump is responsible Twenty one percent say Obama is responsible\nNow\nYou might say my God well come on Trump's that President Trump could these reforms that Trump has put in and these two years\nThat's the way I see it thought given to media\nGiven the stubbornness of all kinds of things\nTrump or not such a brand new there's a lesson for Republicans ear always be closing always be brand\nHe's the one that did it tax\nCuts knocking down regulation optimism that's the reason for it it's still want to get some to forty seven percent in what universe is president over bomber responsible well you know he said the pillars emotion this was all going to happen Trump's just lucky came along oh stop it\nBut still forty seven percent said Trump if this were another Republican I bet they wouldn't get anywhere near forty seven percent it takes constant branding\nConstantly showing your keeping these promises as hard as it is to believe Twenty one percent still said President Obama is responsible for this booming economy when his policies are diametrically opposed to the Trump policies\nIf the economy goes south or they're going to say Obama's now than Trump will be responsible I\nMean there's a lot of areas of baggage for Trump I get that but the economy is not one isn't it amazing in this election cycle the economy tax cuts knocking down regulations\nAll races I fall on what I can tell nationally do not a big deal people don't care about this for some reason\nOn one side or another it's only two things\nIssues like immigration immigration and what it means to American citizens American security American workers\nAnd on the Democrats' side we can hardly wait we're going to get Trump and we're going to get a big time six days

guy who owns like a newspaper chain called the Brandywine new media in a place called west Chester Pennsylvania well at least he's the publisher and the editor\nHe wrote a opinion piece and again these are in Republican precincts out there in some cases\nSaying that in this election cycle do not vote for a single Republican not just the congressional and Senate races he means you know all those Rowan state representative is all that knock them all out because they all have the fever that Trump fever and we have to cure them up a fever\nI just think about that don't vote for a single Republican in the area is newspapers cover we're dealing with literally hundred races are more or various offices you know smart every single one of the vote him out and we as advertisers that must be Trump's supporters\nI'll give you a little bit more of the flavor that's what it's about it's about Trump not about anything else\nAnd Republicans are not making it about Trump enough on their side

bit of how it's evolved how we got to this point one of the things is justice Brennan\nWho was very very liberal very much progress of a driving force I guess in the Warren Court in his notes in uh Nineteen fifty two cases that I've seen here he he apparently wrote something along these lines but it wasn't the holding of the court and it was with one and it was it\nWas an infamous case Nineteen eighty two is called ... versus do and that's where it right\nUp justice Brennan for the court\nHeld that a Texas had to provide free public education to illegal immigrants or and then he dropped a foot noted says the fact that they're illegal doesn't make them any different than the people who are born here to those illegal immigrants and they're clearly citizen well I mean that that was not an issue in that case it's just a\nThrowaway footnote it's not a holding and yet somehow people say oh that was ratified the\nBroad reading of the old one Kmart and it's\nAmazing how you told us something the other day that I've written I've told several people about how did we get to the point though we're in actuality we allow this with this kind of ... what do you think happened\nWell you know I mean I've been debating this with people for Fifteen Years and I said look if one can mark means which you say it does then we would have expected to see uh the children of illegal immigrants were others being treated as citizens are fairly shortly after that case came down and Eighteen Ninety\nEight and yet and yet in\nThe Nineteen twenties a Congress passes a law\nThat give citizenship to Native Americans um that wouldn't have been necessary if they already had citizenship under the constitution we have a whole guest worker program in the Nineteen twenties that ends with the great depression\nAnd those those guest workers from foreign countries are repatriated back to their home countries sometimes forcibly which is a\nWhich is a you know dark chapter and all that\nBut but they had kids while they were here and not nobody raised a claim that their children were citizen certainly somebody would have raised that claim if if if this notion had been in place the same was true Thirty years later with a ... program in the Nineteen fifties early sixties\nNobody raised the claim of child citizenship when those folks are when the program ended in those folks were sent back home so what what I've been able to discover is that there was a change in the regulations for applications for passport that occurred in Nineteen sixty seven\nPrior to that if you were born in the United states you filled out a one form\nFor an application for a passport if you were born abroad you feel about a different form on the on the forum for people who were born in the United states you had to say where you were born and if that was what\n... stood for that that was enough to make you a citizen the passport form wouldnt have needed any additional information and yet it goes on at length and asks about your parents status wherever they Thomas filed wherever they born all of which to show whether you were truly fully subject to the jurors right action\nOr that none of that was was necessary at one K. Mart stands for what the ... the\nBirthright citizenship crowd thinks that does\nThat change the Nineteen sixty seven when they when they deleted that part of the former head I there's there's no explanation I've been able to come up with on why there's no change in the law Congress there is no executive order there's no court decision\nThey just change the regulation and I'm I'm convinced that was well maybe we want to get rid of all that extraneous stuff so we can fit the form on one page or something I don't know I\nMake tremendous sense I think we've cracked the case and you know that's the way human nature is and that's how these things happen I'm so glad that you have such expertise on this or do people find you on the waiter or a website where did they find you\nThe best places Claremont dot org and in fact we've got a whole page up there ah on the whole citizenship\nA debate in you know including of several prominent opponents of all of our view a and then we show you know we were about their argument so it's you know it's a good resource for getting the whole measure of both sides of the debate by by some pretty intellectual heavyweights\nGood stuff well Dr ... thank you it's a pleasure to know you and have you on the boy and a jumble talk again soon avoid that thank you very much take care\nI there's Dr John Eastman the best that I can bring in you heard what he said this may have been a clerk I ate too much work what's a streamlined that's how it started to evolve to this stuff here's how you get in\nEight six six fifty jumbo eight six six five zero five forty six twenty six you game with ... for Jim Boeheim and\nNow you can get raped me apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with age loose male Macs a patent pending formula in agreement that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases in muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage than exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide which can be handy in the gym and in the bedroom\nTo your men who to the max by drawing your first thirty day bottle free shipping and handling not ten days not Fifteen days full thirty days supply free when you text the word fast to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy nine\nFinally a formula that boost total testosterone if you'll results with ageless male Macs are too intense please decrease use for your free bottle checks fast to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy nine text S.

of the I think that the media doing a good job of deflecting what Trump is saying and this\nI'm not an amber with an executive order around it but it would get it before the Supreme Court based upon my read on this I think the Supreme Court would reject the idea that this amendment protects people coming here legally having a child and then automatically making\nThem citizens I mean just think of how obnoxious this America mama program\nIs it what you would have ours should we be allowing something like that isn't the revolting do we need a film to talk about the fourteenth amendment in the proper way like the film that captured the thirteenth man eight\nSix six fifty gender or I'd done is in Albany, Oregon joining us Hey Don welcome to the show\nAre you doing good doing good myself I was just going to say it it is my understanding that this whole anchor baby thing I just called has been a controversy for quite a long time now\nYeah did you hear what our guest said too though he ... he traced it to them shortening the form and then that started to move it along with social machinations of wanting this to happen that's where it came from because up until then there's no history of arguing this are doing is\nThey're ensure there's been some amount of abuse along the way al\n... well how about America mama\nYeah yeah I'd I'd say the I'd say so yeah\nYeah exactly right well thank you thanks very much done yeah it is abusive to think about it is the first time this week that I picked\nUp when I knew about this a ... a tourism but I didn't know this one ...\nCome on we shouldn't allow that even if the other is going on and we have trouble controlling it I have some\nStatistics here are around the country in your area these are just came out from the Census Bureau and put together by the um uh exact a Center for Immigration Studies or a conservative group here's what they say based upon the census data this is worth twenty fourteen\nVerse to legal immigrants amounted to twelve point four percent of the entire birds that you're a foreigner Ninety four thousand illegal immigrants\nAbout two hundred Ninety seven thousand\nNearly three hundred thousand people born two illegals probably more in twenty Seventeen\nThat's a population the size of the city of Cincinnati here a few more the estimated twenty eight thousand birds to illegal immigrants just in the Los Angeles metro area is larger than the total number of ... fourteen states in the district of Columbia\nThe states with the highest number of birds to legal immigrants California what sixty five thousand Texas fifty one a New Jersey in North Carolina a weapon thousand each\nIllegal immigrants amount for more than one in seven ... and the Los Angeles Las Vegas or San jose Dallas and Houston metro areas typically between two thirds and three quarters of these are likely paid for by taxpayers\nThe state with the highest share a burst to illegal immigrants as Nevada nearly one in six one in six in Nevada\nLet's go to Joe and new are Delaware we dump your dental hey Joel welcome him\nDown on that guy you dog Joe I'm yeah I'm I think there's an hour ... nobody wants to talk about I think that ultimately a crop actually know was an avid birther\nUltimately he wants to vote broccoli Obama's citizenship and it's possible expel them ...\nOr all of that on the way in a way that on a ...\n[laughter] conspiracy theories you really think that's where he's going or does he see this as an issue that Americans care about\nWell he had been so it's an hour birth or I might have given a little more\n... but um it sounds to me like a that's OK well up at the CIA low\nI deeply opposed the birther movement and for a lot of reasons one of them strategic Obama played them very well with this to his advantage so yeah I'm not a birth or I don't think that's where Trump's going with this though but thank you Joe wow\nThat is a pretty amazing stuff no I think this is election fodder it ties in to illegal immigration it ties into the outrage and I wish Trump would talk about things like ah America mama\nMore than just the fourteenth amendment 'cause the fourteenth amendment provides we're All right I Want to put one thing on your radar or one of the things that's happened and um you know we've kind of moved on because of the midterms now\nBut the ... massacre of eleven people in the synagogue in Pittsburgh Steelers out there there's still a lot of back and forth so the governor of Pennsylvania who's in a race for his second term governor wolf\nIt's been all over that and essentially talking about in civility the tone and all that so he's on Katie KIA I Know these guys in the morning they're very good their new staff\nAnd they're asking him what should the penalty for this guy powers now I have to say a legit because it's still a legit joy has this day in court but we have\nAll kinds of evidence but ours firing back at the police we have weapons we have the forensics we have all the witnesses and we have is hate filled comment we have it all so this is in a case where we could make a mistake can get the wrong person right well a great if he after he gets to stay in court after that\nAnd that's the I Am pro death penalty except a couple of provide those that if you're on trial for your wife death penalty you get the very top lawyer that we can find think of the Johnny Cochrane of lawyers\nBut I Do for your life we should pay for it is is that series too with DNA and experts research and all that we were going to pay for that we're going to do our best as we want to make sure we get the right person will ... hours is allegedly it\nHasn't been adjudicated so they'll say it that way wolf is asked hear what you're talking about how to respect this is just back our or ... hours does he deserve\nThe death penalty is that what should happen here now wolf has I think is opposed to the death penalty doesn't want to say it with a four year moratorium in studying the death penalty remember governors are the ones that sign debts Marts he's right in the trail of and he hasn't signed anything is not going to\nListen to how this weasel caught in this about how horrific this is he ought to get the full was penalty\nHow he tries to dodge the question was should he get the death penalty here's how it sounded\nOn her [laughter]\n\n[noise]\n[laughter] point one [laughter]\n[laughter] oh [laughter]\nI Know what I like about this is too many problems on both sides both sides we never get clearly where one says I'm going this and the other says I went that I'm good with that then people can decide this little weasel going back and forth I mean they I guess they should've bludgeoned him a few more times\nHe clearly doesn't believe this guy should get the death penalty so he's prominent off the defense\nBut what about in Pennsylvania what about under Pennsylvania law you want to tell us our risk this is as governor protecting citizens do you want the death penalty yes or no he clearly doesn't just be a man and say it what citizens decide do they want a governor that's going to sign that war it yes or no\nNo I Will always be in favor the death penalty with those ... that I told you they think the only thing that stops me is I Want to be absolutely certain as we possibly can that's why this is such a good case because I don't see how there's any doubt here although he deserves his day in court\nIs rights and the whole let's just do it quickly let's get his lawyers let's give him the full benefit and if you're even this guy if you're on trial for your life you get the very best that's what we ought to do because it's that serious that being said\nThere's no mistaken identity everything is here wealth should he get the death penalty yes or no you know if you're opposed to the death penalty demand step up and say no you shouldn't I'm never going to be in favor the death penalty\nFine I just would like to know why does the obfuscate like this could it be thinks people in Pennsylvania really are in favor the death penalty or you want a proud on about our risk things are but then even this case doesn't get the death penalty\nEight six six fifty Jim ... I'll be clear about this too it doesn't take in a recent case like this my standard is is you take a life in cold blood for filling the requirements of first degree murder you get the death penalty whether it's a big mouth like me whether it's an innocent baby mother ... it doesn't matter\nAll life is precious if you take it you're getting the death penalty\nUnder law under those guidelines that I get why it's so difficult to say if you don't agree with that fine then I don't want you as governor of ... you need to sign up for it's eight six six fifty ... that'll get you on board down to your data sending in for Jim Boeheim", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "01"}
