policy for tax purposes the the in other words what you paid into it it is everything you paid into it throughout the entire time the policy has been open so if you add up all the premiums that you've ever paid you don't even get that much\nOut and so you really end up with a law she can't ride the law but you end up with having put more into it then you get out so there's no game now you have um and it happens about five percent of the time with an old with a very very old whole life policy\nThere it is possible that the cash value is greater than was paid in which you would only pay taxes on the difference and so you know you use the figure eleven thousand so if you if you found out that the all the premiums added up to only ten thousand than you'd pay taxes on the one thousand dollar difference will be still do it\nRight\nIn Ninety five percent of the time then he eight percent of the time they lose money 'cause they suck you don't make money you know and so you end up losing money on the transaction and of course that's not a taxable event when you lose money no question about that Catherine is with us in Danbury, Connecticut Hi Katherine how are you\nHi Dave I'm doing good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nA number and then I just got married last August and we're combining our finances and everything else [noise] um\nAnd we're working on paying off all I think that we get paid off his car like three days ago had re on yeah mine should be paid off by the end of this year which is great\nAnd the next thing we're going to tackle as um I made for crappy on 'em and then after that was good until the\nMarkets that that we live and so why planning on saving up to three to six months of Americans say fine but we're not sure how much we can save ...\nWhere it to income family obviously we have no kids on but if they thought that my talents me and my rental property it fat out require like really different amount that if I have to sell we're trying to figure out how much is it fair make hats\nWell given that you have two properties that can have stuff breakdown on them um you could set up in your rental accounts some savings just to cover the rental issues a vacancy or repair I assume you keep a separate account free rentals do you know\nI Wish I Wish that\nOkay I Would I Would open up a separate checking account just for the rentals and put pay all the bills associate with rentals out of that account only and then um and of course by the payments out of there put the rents in there and then you can tell if you're making money on the rental cars what's left in the account as your profit right\nRight that's a taxable a that's a portion is going to be taxable each year\nBecause everything else is going to be deducted while all the expenses associate with it and you can keep some money in that account\nTo cover vacancies a or to cover repairs and I might keep that to do it that way as separate from my emergency fund and then 'cause that's like a business over on the side it's like a small business right on okay and then over but then at home I Would have three to six months of expenses there not counting the rentals\nUm because if you got the rentals covered in the rental account than you're okay over there um and you know if you've got two incomes and you're pretty stable it sounds like you're doing really well and you're paying attention you might be okay with the three months out of the three to six months of household expenses as your\nYou know as your game plan and so forth some good question thanks for

I Hope you've had an audience when whenever you whisper in his ear the brief scandal in these other what's your take on Pope Francis\nAlthough I haven't had an argument that fact that they're not looking at that at that time no\nLess than ... is ... is pretty open to eat\nThe you know some of the games were running late may up on on a regular basis and in the newspapers and in in Rome and as far as about this scandal what was the archbishop put forward that memo and says he should resign I said listen\nWe we can't do in the business you know this the church is what to do or two thousand years old we can't be in the business or just flipping guys in and out you know he is the vicar of Christ on her so everything regarding you know the dog by the church\nAnd ... algae attraction and and the spiritual side of the church once she is the vicar crisis part of apple stocks of session of your topic that's what you buy into how ever on these other things particular in a policy\nNow I was there a couple of weeks ago dumb they actually had a conference at the Vatican was caused by sponsoring on populism in nationalism and they essentially set in stone root of all evil\nAnd now with the last year\nHe went to let him Mr where you say it\nPopulism actually wants to the cause of all these crisis so no in that regard I just say Pope Francis is dead wrong and if that's what he thinks I'm going to oppose it on a doubt about church dog white shirts y'all it's in all this other stuff you know he he's the man in but I think that when he comes to the other thing is highly political\nAnd politicize so much in look I've gone after the the cardinals bishops here and a lot of stuff on immigration at this not the Catholic Church is wrong and this has nothing to do with the core beliefs are tenets of the church or if it was a Catholic or you as a Catholic or the sacrament split it has to deal with how they've politicized certain issues particularly immigration\nAbsolutely you've been very generous with your time so I wanted to give listeners it by hand and show them my own and filled obviously one more hit and we'd dearly would like to get you to ah Philadelphia area the film and I was ...

eight six six fifty gym but I don't know if you've heard him before it's a rare interview eight six six five zero five forty six twenty six get you to me now\nI didn't get into it because I Know we get into it and I I Want you to hear other parts of Steve Bannon\nAnd Democrats in the media are saying boy this is an October surprise\nThis will serve as well because the American people will see Trump overreact and the military and all that stuff and there'll be a revolt will you will you say no this is exactly what I Want stopped just the sheer temerity of this whole thing\nAnd this is going on more subtly every day for the last twenty twenty five years not on mass like this but unbelievable numbers\nWhat's the number if you think it's appropriate as the one guy played you just let people in how many how many millions how many tens of millions I what's good escape in Burlington, Vermont to start off the jumbo hand and show callers have skipped welcome to the show\nThings or listen you know what the real numbers are\nTheir financial their financial\nWell sketch skip I don't want to get off on any of those tangents and the I Want to just ask you what should be done with the caravan\nOkay very simple or miles before they hit to the U.S border\n... or ...\n... out the boom box the supersonic boom box the sounds the supersonic sales ...\nThe military has and that's the only way you're going to stop one line before they hit the\nBall it's interesting I don't know if that's violets if of un or whatever thank you skip I'm not sure about that sort of technique I get what he's saying but you would be roundly I mean if you gave a hearing issue to somebody did something like that wall of noise\nNow I think Trump's going to call the military the problem is how much in the military do you need if you have ten thousand people I've seen police action split fencing around the people and hold them in detain them that way until they can take them out one of the time but that was only a few hundred people\nYou have twenty thousand people I don't think you can do that and it's a military gets into a situation where they might have to fire or be overrun\nThat's going to be problematic let's go to Charlie in Cedar Rapids Iowa hey Charlie good evening\nAre you doing I'm good Charlie yeah I'm just saying no a library dogs are American shows I oh gosh what is the fate gr right\nOkay so ... you're charger border and walk across illegally and they go to a sauce\nAnd then they disappear if I break while I got to go a three ... job sharing I or go to jail for a couple of days I as opposed to ... and I are going to be monitored before\nI go to trial okay so you would stop the ...\nMakes what makes use paypal so much better than the average burgers as\nWell because the Democrat Party has put them ahead of the average American citizen the way that I see\nIt so Charlie you would sanction the military stopping him right\nOh yeah I mean I made sure style the bay and that is well it's an or on the wall street and you care goes there's water\nI agree the problem is going to be Charlie I'm told it's going to take a massive amount of military to do that thanks Charlie said I'm completely on board with that but I'm looking at the reality of\nIt and I think\nGiven what went on in Mexico and all that forming seat they'll just keep at it until they penetrate it somehow or another vast numbers go around one way or another you dealing with a lot of stuff there but certainly I agree with and we're not talking about bayonets or the military firing on maybe tear gas and the like\nYeah you could do that\nBut this is a difficult thing if they reach a massive twenty thousand people which they might or more\nYou are going to need a human wall\nTo prevent that and to move with it and to push back and I think to make arrest you try to curtail some of it and cut down on it\nIs the way to go but that's the issue in Trump is uniquely positioned to do something about this I let's go to bill in del to California hate bill where's delta how close to the border as\nA not California Colorado\nOh Colorado okay bill go right ahead in their claim is that they're leaving their native country because of the gangs and crime and Noel enforcement mhm\nOr experience or experiences that crime rates are lowest in areas where the people on the most guns right so\nLet's give them weapons and little training and then since they know where the gangs are on the criminals are send them back to clean up their country\nWell I hear you built they don't want to do that do in fact a lot of them are burning American flags there's all kinds of stuff like that going on and they don't want to do that they want to penetrate here so what do we do to stop\nThat being the case it just proves they're clean they're like\nYeah it does thank you it it does without a doubt I agree with you at least some of them are now the media will try to portray this but you've seen this I told you a guy in bed it for Univision tonight on Univision said\nHe's noticing people from places like Bangladesh that are in there I'm not saying that this is the lion's share of people but you know what happens when there's chaos that's what's being provoked here organized chaos\nAnything can happen then\nSo if they make it toward the border which I think they will the dilemma is what level of force do you use in order to stop this Democrats are hoping\nThat somehow or another you'll use that level of force in America will be a revolt it I think America will not particularly if the military can push back on this\nWithout anyone losing their life or anything like that\nBut this is going to be an ongoing problem this is going to continue and continue and continue until\nWe put up enough of a barrier ha a wall\nTo stop this but this is why Trump was elected Democrats in a meeting or not they think this is the October surprise that this is going to cut in their favor\nI don't see it in that way at all or let's go to Dan in Trenton New Jersey hey Dan good evening\nHey in a similar to be a Catholic I said on human trafficking Daniel ... on Google caption says call your track

a bill speaking a ups\nGive them weapons let the women and children come this far will take you to women and children while they go back and fight and take the neighborhoods that the Democrats up behind this one hundred percent and the thing is\nCollection day they're going to get surprised 'cause we're gonna make sure that it served as Republicans go out and vote I think that it's going to be a mass turn out for the Republican and we've done our own what we supposed to have\nThis is insane to let these people companies country and they're going to run over the border and and getting to the bottom of it\nIf we have to do all means necessary if Donald Trump got the call the army out on the air force of the Marines to stop them being all means necessary it must be done\nBecause I I hear you I hear you the logic of that Steve I mean mark but I don't think that's exactly what the Democrats in the media are hoping for you know would that would be like\nIn the short term as people are emotional if it happened right before the election in the long term you're absolutely right we cannot have people think they're just going to storm the border\n\nWe you know behind Donald Trump one hundred percent he's doing a great job he's a great guy and if it gets to it I mean it always ends at war if it has to we got to make sure we when and if that's what it's going to take the stop them

have the injections and and everything that we have in this\nCountry than they are going to bring all kind of diseases which I had a major problem in Florida a with a tuberculosis mhm they keep it kind of under wraps but it is a big problem here\nWell to the point you and you're actually under ground zero what we're seeing is diseases that we've eradicated or in pockets around the country and I guess Florida is one of them John you're right because that's what the suspicion is that\n... that that isn't you know these people haven't been to not elated against anything and I don't know I I can see why we can't like that man fed a mile a mile a border there and put it up\nYou say supporter at your own risk\nI have a problem you know polling doesn't allow anybody\nInto their country I'm Down in Haiti\nHaiti which is progressive people on their water the military's on their border crossing the border they shut down\nAll right well no and I don't think we're going to do that and I'm I'm not recommending that are that we thank you jump simply because as we near the ah this this is exactly what the media and the Democrats would want\nYou start seeing that as much as you could argue there just storming the military position you know how that's going to play All right let me try one more John in Sebring, Florida Hi John\nWhere you are good Amish Guy bring most of your callers are one thing that makes me feel about you know I mean if we try to help them they don't want our help\nBut it's not right when we're trying to end up the state of head out west they're scared that we would try to take over their country but come into our culture eight Democrats use it against us which is rich nature socialist party they talk about and go to an egg to them and they'll give 'em a golden age\nRight and that's why John my point is that we we just respect it goes really tried to tell them about the goose to go and we take the back seat\nWell that's why we had to be careful in how we stop this and I think the military so professions I can do it thank you John but if we have where a situation outbreaks and you have them being overrun\nAnd they opened fire or something I'm telling you that would be something triggering God Knows what kind of reaction\nBut if these people get near the border say four days five days out of the election and are trying to make this move toward it Trump calls up the military the American people in my view we're going to support this\nAnd those that don't are already in the Democratic column the open border column\nThe column like some of those people I played at the top that seemingly think any number can come in and do they want to pay for all this they want to endure this as the people do like Joan and at the border states\nAnd even further in Elizabeth Warren wants to get rid of ice in the debate last night and said what good are they they just stopped faint and all the border patrol did buy that would've killed up words the five million Americans\nSo this idea of open borders get rid of ice let the other side continue to play that it's not going to work it's not effective\nAnd it certainly isn't going to protect America

medical community lines like that brings that we have a Google here we go for a loop or hear 'em out to me as progressive but somehow along the way after the twenty sixteen election uh there was a group a leftover from I Would say the Bernie Sanders camp that became the standard bearers of\nProgressive democratic politics in Pittsburgh and somehow along the way it's also starting to melt into the Democratic socialist of America and they have started to gain sort of a foothold here in Pittsburgh and\nGain a voice that um unfortunately people are listening to and they're rushing to judgment and a lot of cases are they're not stopping to think that maybe we're doing ourselves more harm than we are good\nSo you've been approached by that by that movement of the name of it of people that are Democrats that feel the party has left them that movement is the what movement mark\nIt it was the hash tag walk away\nWalk away which is not a lot of people to be successful and I don't say that cavalierly because I could tell how dear it is to you again there are still elements in the Democratic party but there are being weeded out of people like you who\nMight see it a little bit differently than I on some issues here and there but are credibly patriotic Americans and humanitarian Americans you and your wife in this situation\nAnd essentially it's getting tighter and tighter you really have to walk on the line if you're that person if you speak up on those Democrat Party values those are now so they're what the Republican Party used to be I guess to people\nAnd he hears socialist in places like Pittsburgh and it's not the people that used to call me\nNow and I've gotten a lot of phone calls from people who um have said to me that they agree with my stance lay uh they applaud the fact that I'm taking a stance on just being patriotic um and I was upset so look I put my life on the line in the Gulf War I served my country\nI think I have the right to stand for the flag as much as anyone else has the the rights of taking me um and and I don't have a problem with that if they want to go ahead and do that they can go right ahead and do it and I won't criticize you\nJust don't criticize me for not wanting to participate in that type of activity because of what I've been through 'em and I think if we stop and we just say to each other let's take a look at what our core values are and what we believe in\nThen maybe we wouldn't be so quick to rush to judgment and condemn us for being patriotic or supporting a family friend or even in many cases supporting police officers\nWhich I think unfortunately has just gotten out of control in this country right now\nExactly right a mark thank you so much I really enjoyed talking with you twice a day where do people find you if they want to catch up with you and\nWe want to see where you come out to the other side independent you change parties you try to fight to it's going to be a real uphill fight I mean if in Pittsburgh you're saying you're seeing significant gains by the socialist and all that it's only going to ratchet up after these midterms\nSo that's a tough avenue\nTo face and I would say where I Am in the Philadelphia area we have a similar situation toward yours were Democrats could have run a woman who was a veteran a military veteran instead they're running a guy who was a socialist Scott Wallace who's up with a couple of hundred million dollars\nAnd they are making those type of choices\nVersus people against people who\nAre not only patriots but winners I Would think for the Democrat Party guys like you I Would be a much different opponent if I'm running the Republican Party so strategically I'm Glad of what they're doing but as an American I resented deeply we need guys like even the political process\nWell I appreciate it and there are some people out here such as a congressman Conor Lamb who I'm sure you've heard of on a special election is running again I'm again military guy marine\nI'm somewhat conservative or moderate I Would\nSay goodbye very articulate and he is what I Would like to see more of the Democrats are\nNot going to the table now

[noise]\n[noise] well [noise] but now that [noise]\nI like that I've ever heard of before my musical knowledge increases each time I sit in here in the gym bow hadn't program my name is Tom junior dental at eight six six fifty Jim ... is just heard from a great guy you know there's plenty of room for him and the Republican Party or independent if Democrats don't want them imagine being kicked out around that\nBut we're seeing tonight a couple of things I wanted to ask you were seeing in Texas and I'm hoping that we can you hear from somebody maybe in the Houston area they're traveling back that listed on the radio that behind and show eight six six fifty jumbo that was that the Trump rally cruise rally the tailgate\nThat the guesstimate is it could be eighty to a hundred thousand people at some point today were on those grounds are around them this truly was athletic just amazing even for taxes eight six six fifty jumbo\nAnd if you've been to a Trump rally what is the magic\nOf it when you're inside the entertainment of that the I mean these people in Montana last week we're waiting hours out there in freezing temperatures not just you know I I don't know who I Would wait for for that number of hours or ever have waited for four or five hours or more\nEight six six fifty jumbo get you on board\nNow I didn't have a chance I wasn't on the gym I did it on my own shown Philadelphia though\nThe opposition to this is just enraged tonight on several levels Kevin McCarthy he's the house majority leader you see this guy prematurely grey nice looking guy California\nWell his office was vandalized a Boulder is the report ... a large Boulder these guys picked up a Boulder not just a brick and threw it through the window and took off they have it up with his Instagram account\nThrowing a Boulder holding a Boulder up between the two of them and throwing it through a window of Boulder attack\nAnd here's the thing who are the most divisive celebrities in America or a focus group last week did this morning consulates call and they took celebrities entertainers people like me talk show host and alike and the criteria was\nAnd then you know all about getting built this you make this but Donald Trump's rally he said America can't be great again and they hate that so much they say Matt that because I Can't bear to say make America great again he goes there's nothing wrong with you know based like Bill Clinton said there's nothing wrong with America that's not right with America we can at your that uh\nUm you're the age of ... all of you are all ...\n... ... exactly but I I'm going to buy these numbers David where you kind of support we knew it was going to be remembered the beginning the other side was saying that they're holding it at a smaller arena because they're afraid they can't draw and then we see this drug at least a hundred thousand by police reports today that is staggering we've never seen anything like that\nSo he couldn't get he couldn't get the Eighteenth the stadium a Dallas Cowboy state he couldn't get it all Trump is Trump's thanks for the fence every time are you kidding me do it ran out two stadiums back to back if it's good Trump knows that he's going to pack out any new he goes to especially in Texas\nSo now it was just a matter they they're bigger bigger venue sort of a yard that kind of a shorter noticing so up but\nTrump give America hope but yet Reagan did it in the eighties Trump is doing it again so we can do it and you're the ... year\nThat's that's exactly right well thank you David thank you it's very Reagan esque ... Reagan had a different approach more the sunny side versus the attacking side but they both brings to that the spirit why not why not return America to those days and President Obama would say no that's not realistic it's not science space we're not going to go people rallied to that\nEight six six fifty jumbo here that the upwards of a hundred and Fifteen thousand people even if it's a hundred thousand\nThat is tiger ring you know I Can't imagine what it must be like in that area the arena completely packed but then the tailgate stuff and all that going on\nYou can imagine if you're a ... now after tonight you know what's coming\nMaybe are all this nonsense or another Kennedy and all that\nMaybe it goes way run for president then let's see what happens by the way I'm looking at the latest with a wizard with Warren she said she ... in the debate last night she said she took the DNA test to help rebuild trust in government I God I let's go to a quaint in Houston, Texas hey Clint welcome in\nHow you doing very good\nOh I was just a year this job you know said you were to ... somebody that had gone down there I was I Will freely admit that I was not a I was not a Trump supporter or when you know when the uh you know\nWhen the twenty sixteen ... election cycle started I was I was a ... uh uh\nBut I Will I Will freely admit now that I was wrong I mean I Would I was I was completely wrong and that\nThey don't they only reason I went to the rally or not but there's not a I was down here on business\nAnd I will I Will say that\n\nWhile I don't agree with every thing or maybe not maybe the correct way of saying is the way that Donald Trump to\nWrite this man has he has the balls to say things that we're all thinking\nWhen you did you get into the rally did you get in\nYes I I was able to get in because I Know that other business where he he was able to get a thin\nUm and it was it\nI I'm not a big concert downright outlets very lucky to be around a lot of people but it was a it was an amazing thing to to experience or is it I mean it I said I I I I I consider myself a really big in politics or out I keep up on it\nI Would I was never a big Donald Trump guy right\nBut there was something about this man that\nHas he has people thinking the way that we need to be thinking right now\nThat you're going to have you enjoyed it and you got in there thank God you knew a business guy because you know based upon the stuff I'm looking at here on my screens and all it's a chaotic to get anywhere near there Dave is in Wichita, Kansas he earned about ... show Hi Dave\nHey Hi how are you doing good Dave\nHey ah it it's it's a auto privilege him well you know a fortune to get in because uh uh I really\nReally key in on on the ... I hadn't been a a politically minded before but then I came to realize everything as there has been for decades has been politics people just don't want to get involved in politics 'cause it's so controversial\nBut ... isn't that isn't that what our First Amendment\nShe worked on was controversy or without ... and\nWell you know I Love what you just said there that's a different way of putting a controversy without banks that's exactly\nRight huge debate over things without killing each other or throwing boulders or the window of the opponent that's right\nYeah I mean I mean it it can stream is a ... achieve anything except of discord right and\nWhat what what does that the the cheese nothing but it seems to me the progressive or exactly that that was when they don't get their way then they throw this low temperature and throw a which is extremely spends a scam in my estimation 'cause I'm I'm sixty two years old I've been through a lot\nAnd ah but I got the man it's time to get up and be active about something not non activist right we are all too\nWell they did the Americans to do that they have the better off we are thank you thanks for the call and that's where President Trump ignite it is and here's my overall take on what we're going to see play out in the midterms when we see these caravans coming our way\nThe average American apolitical they may have been like Dave they're activated by this and they say what Trump here's a guy finally taking his head on\nYou know they vaguely might be a Democrat or Republican but they're sick of the politics they see this is a different time in a different person what do they see on the other side they see people doing stuff every day that are mob like these are mops\nI've had it here in Philadelphia I've experienced some of it we have a lot of anti ... here but it's not just ... its people going crazy all over the place believing that's the first amendment right to harass people scream at them as a professor this week\nAnd the University of Mississippi did nothing about it he tweeted out don't just arrest these conservatives Republicans when you see them out there if they're in a restaurant\nStick your fingers all the way through their salad and all mess it up if they've ordered appetizers take them and distribute them to everyone don't let some Adam bring boxes with you to steal their food and take it home type of stuff that's being condone that's not freedom of speech that's not that's democracy\nNo it's not it is a mob so you're seeing that mob domestically and you're seeing this other mob headed toward the border invasion the caravan and which side do you think Americans are going to side with even like Dave or like quite said if he doesn't like Donald Trump the way he presents at times and all that\nThat's protecting America even if lot versus the other side just on the attack significant numbers are going to go with the Trump agenda side that's the way it's going to work\nAnd this caravan is exactly that coming up soon to take a moment to put something on your radar screen\nAnd I bet a lot of people listening I've not heard this but when you do maybe you'll tell people about it and you'll start and I know the media's got a lot to cover now but\nThen they tell you the story of Katy Brand name Katie Brennan from New Jersey and they Murphy he's the governor there administration you know coming off cabin up we're supposed to believe women were supposed to take actions to validate that if they make a claim this woman made a big claim about rape sexual assault\nAgainst an official in the Murphy campaign and then it official in the government wait until you hear what happened with it or didn't happen the wall Street Journal just did a big piece in our but that's the only national media the rest of the national media said we're not going to cover her but at the because Murphy is a far progressive\nAnd that's why they won't cover so we're not seeing national media it's worthy of it I Want you to by hand and listeners to know about it promised people in Philadelphia I Would tell you so I'll give you the breakdown of that next and your calls at eight six six

so we keep the U.S house we need to\nTake over the U.S Senate and we need to hold our seats in the state legislature\nAll right well thank you thank you very much for that okay let me go to mark in Port St Lucie Florida hello mark\nAbout good\nI was listening to your story on the on the on the woman\nWho was eighty oriented salt it yet um and I heard you mentioned the rape kit and the story but never anything about results to it and that would really hold the key to everything there was\nA I haven't seen that released I haven't seen that talking well I mean that's like you were telling\nYour telling a story of a leaving out the vote\nOn I'm not leaving it out I mean it let me be clear it doesn't really even matter what they say or don't say here because here's the point when a woman does this when they go through this that's why the wall Street Journal interviewed her should they not have investigated this whole matter that claim as they did not\nObviously there's not much of a need for the investigation if you say that she went with her friends sobbing to get a rape\nKit that means it's in the hands of the police at this point it's obviously being investigated at least at that level correct\nUh well the Hudson County people the prosecutor has said they're not going to prosecute now here's the issue do Hudson counties very corrupt it's Murphy administration and the judges there and the wall Street Journal's a woman stand by their story that there is evidence there\nMy point is what's the lesson of Kavanaugh what were we told that you have to move forward with this in a job interview right\nWell I mean it's ... whether you're kinda sounded like the other side now let's get the guy whether he's guilty\nOr not I'm not saying that she didn't look I don't know no no I'm not but they did not do anything in this that's what the argument is that Murphy administration did not investigate and that's why they're being investigated now what does that tell you why is the legislature ... anybody\nTo investigate their own you know that so we all know that that's why it shouldn't go to the police but I was waiting for the end of the story and I still want to know what the evidence and if there is why it's really a restive I thought\nThat's OK well the ... the Hudson County people have said they're not going to prosecute All right thank you mark thanks very much for that I'm Glad for the year the challenge I Want you to take a look at that though Katie Brennan\nAnd see whether there's a double standard or not here I think there is and so does the wall Street Journal and we'll see wise the legislature now both sides going to investigate the Murphy administration and what they did not do\nBased upon their policies and based upon what we've heard you should do that's where I stand and I just wanted media coverage on this\nThe Democrats are getting out there big guns to two weeks before mid term elections former President Obama in Nevada event\nOf

imagine stopping these people it's pretty obvious when I look at\nThe caravan coming our way a lot of young men and their verses women and children and that's one thing to take a look at by the way well this is going on with the midterms I'm coming to your calls in just a second\nHere's an example of how wild it's getting with Democrats\nThey are running the one thing they're running on is Republicans want you and your kids not to have health coverage to die if necessary\nThe preexisting condition argument again now I've had on people that have explained\nAll right in a synagogue\nNow as I understand that this may be a synagogue is very liberal the Scott while I was one of their Scott Wallace is seen as the guy who's anti Israel\nAnd that is true the Democrat in the middle of this Wallace can't take it anymore that pitch Patrick is using this a Washington Post story to rebut this why and he drops the F bomb\nNow this is on the is it pronounced the beam ma if you're Jewish synagogues FEMA\nIn elevated platform used for reading the ... the tour of during services\nAnd then the rabbi and others chastised him for this in other words he blurted out the F bomb towards this stuff from fitzpatrick while in the holiest places I understand it inside the temple\nAnd then he sort of apologizes but not really and he says he's passionate and Democrats want people that are passionate about this what\nHave you heard during this particularly in a circumstance like this\nGuy throwing out the F bomb\nNow if I had to sound the sound was on a well this is what ... wanted in place but a TV station may have gotten it\nBut just think about this and this is\nClassic of what the Democrats are prosecuting which is the health care thing when or even the Washington Post as the Republican did not do that would not do that\nIts ally wow I Can't take it\nRight there and they you know and this is a sacred spot this guy just blurted out I Can't imagine is you just\nProbably but the average American has to face it they're tired of with is\nThat's what Trump want want on that was obvious from the very first day when it came down that escalate by the way the Trump Administration I Can't tell yet where they'll land but Hollywood's tonight is going crazy and that's always a good sign\nNew York times reporting and they may be trying to do this to ratchet up support on the Democrats' side even more for the midterms but it seems to me that the Trump Administration is looking at the you know they've cut regulations and one of the ultimate regulations they're looking at rolling back\nThe Obama era initiatives around transgender and protections in other words this idea of gender fluidity this idea of used whatever bathroom you want used in schools and showers and everything else it's going into this now if they land\nWhere they say the only thing that is the term in is what your agenda tail you are at birth well I wouldn't be fully on board if the land that that's what his operative but if you go through and you change your biology so to speak\nActually then yes you can hold yourself out to be because you are a woman or man the opposite way that's where I Would be\nBut if you just want to say you are and we have to use all these pronouns and go down that path no no longer that doesn't make any sense we're not going to go with that well Hollywood Tonight reacting are just incredibly\nBilly or I can hear a kind of like his show on a boy what is the channel [noise] they'll come\nTo me it's a comedian this is pure evil get your friends together and vote like our lives depended on it because they do that's what he tweeted out I'm Cathy Griffin\nPlease reading share this important threads and she puts out a guy named Parker mulloy lots of people asking what they can do to fight back against the Trump administration's anti transactions elect Democrats eye and on and on and on it goes mia Farrow\nIf you agree we cannot let this happen call your representatives Senate switchboard operator will contact you\nSo I think this could be reasonably\nThat Trump is reinforcing the legal definition of a person sex to be based upon biology not personal mythology\nAnd if you go through all that which is a lot and you change it I Would recognize that who would but we we got to get away from this idea of fluidity and people just saying whatever they want to say at a point and that self determination versus the reality of this legally\nThat's what's being debated here I think they're trying to ratchet up getting people more rate I don't know how much more raged they can have how much more can you have\nTo show up and vote\nRosie O'Donnell let's see if she even shows up and vote she's so enraged she just can't even get

all the people said that they use and then they'll have a field day about pay a bad picture of President Trump told to take people's mind all the election\nAnd to ah make them change their vote because they want to do both things they want to paint a bad picture of the Republican\nAnd uh they want to say oh here's what's really going on and we took a bad president when we moved just the opposite we know he's been so much good for our country and still doing good and will do good in the future\nYou gotta thank you thanks very much for the call the idea is to say you vote for this or

criticism I have all this again\nWe need urgency here that are moving more federal judges\nYou get your hearing we do it quickly not months not weeks but in a matter of days and then you're going to be deported him many of these cases were not\nGoing to let this go on for six months and all the stuff that comes out of that that's where we need more people because by law they have the right to the hearing good\nLet's give them the right but let's move for once\nThat would help to alleviate some of those but to blunt this caravan coming our way it is going to take the military or let's go to
