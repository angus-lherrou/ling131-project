reflection of the times we live in we can uh pine all day long about how we got him or not but the reality is is that we're in these times and the design build from the ground up both from a practical and cost standpoint\nTo factor in security features from a range of particular threats is a it's a smart way to do business it's a proven way to do business it's an effective way to do business\nThat'll return many times over whether it serves as a deterrent because the feature is hard enough to deter an aggressor or whether it serves to mitigate the events of an attack or\nBoth are reasons to do it from the ground up but but I Would say this also even if you're not in there isn't an opportunity to design build\nThere are still physical security measure matters or or measures I should say rather that you still can't take to harden it but to your point\nParticularly in public space gatherings and whether it's a government facility or a meeting venue like we saw out and in Las Vegas\nUm or or a religious ... building in security features heartening that facility from the onset is the recommended approach\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six we'd like your thoughts how you feel about this whole notion of going to hyper security\n... and something that we must keep in mind of course in all honesty bruised and when we talk about this increasing security even if you you go to tremendous linked almost ridiculous links there are no guarantees here that you are doing is making it less likely only you're\nYou're absolutely right Jim ... what what you're doing is you're you're got one or two frankly a response is on the spectrum if you will at one injured you're it's a deterrent at the other end you're mitigating the results or the impact if you will of any such attack and to your point\nYou know the story I like to use this is a ... with President Reagan you know the United states president is arguably one of the most protected\nVigils in the world very robust security you know basically the resources of the entire nation but when to protecting the president yet here's an individual and determined individual with a revolver\nManaged to penetrate many you know that those levels of security and still prove their point to the other end is is this even with an armed guard\nYou know it only takes his German attack or time enough to figure out what is it I've got to overcome and build an attack plan that seeks to overcome whatever security measure you have there so you're again you're you're spot on there is no panacea for this\nAh and then at some point in time we also defeat the purpose of what these institutions are intended to do\nThat you know we can harden that facility down so much so that nobody could get in and nobody could get out and ... would defeat the purpose of what is there for an end to what end we we'd be right back to where we started from\nOne of the six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six I guess Bruce Alexander the president of security once illusions David and crushed in Iowa joins which hello David\nBut a little worried about it or you know uh I work as\nA I think for all this stuff ... family values on the hill pretty much in the country a lot of them and also uh I like to say that that\nI don't know how we could probably approach this other than that have the public when they hear about people like this either give 'em a reward or I don't know whatever you know you get a tip somebody has low but a weird and acting kind of gray like they're talking about\nI hate this light that you know it it probably but there are local and you know at least have a name you know what I'm saying to somebody tell you what might be some sort of age or a look look bad or you know checked out a little bit more sharply or watch\nAbsolutely are excellent points it even further than that of what a a David is is talking about even or even further than that would I think it'd probably be the question of frankly Bruce of of whether or not we need to change our laws\nIn a such a way that some kind of preemptive action as possible recognizing full well that this opens the door to a lot of potential abuses would have to be a very carefully worded law and they're very carefully enforce law but nonetheless\nOr in the case with some of these back to the case of the last two situations like the or a pipe bomb Baylor in Florida and the shooter in Pittsburgh we're talking about people with a serious history of a letter in the world know what they thought\nAnd and I'm not sure that the public isn't going to demand that we do something preemptive\nGym you know I I don't I think we've got some options are already available without even needing to change or to look at changing the laws and and I don't dispute that\nBut you know to your point and data David says that if you look at many of these instances somebody knows something someone always knows something\nWhat what the issue is is that having ineffective reporting mechanism that protects anonymity if you will but facilitates coming forward with information no matter how innocuous but that information once it's been received after all\nHas to be treated like a piece of intelligence from the perspective that it's got to be completely process has got to be analyzed disseminate it's got to be evaluated it's got to be investigated you know the NYPD has got their very famous ... see something say something you know I think that without changing our laws it's something that we ought to all be encouraged to do\nA oftentimes people see things they have indicators they had nuggets of information and we do want to do things we dismiss it out of hand and say oh now that's nothing you know that can't possibly be because we approach it from our own optic of logic\nBut to someone who is carrying out these acts you've got to sort of look at it from the illogical perspective on his face and so\nA David's right we've got to have some mechanism to encourage people to come forward um freely and also without fear fear of retribution fear of perhaps some of the other ... overlays that do exist that might preclude or prohibit\nAh people from sharing information voluntarily the last point I'd say is is\nThis has got to be a community effort\nIt's got to be a stakeholder community effort we're not going to solve this just at the point of a of a pistol you know when we're not going to be able to show gun face to everybody\nOr in terms to deter this or what we really want to do is to identify these threats\nAs far away from ... in this case let's say the synagogue door so that we can enter Dick Dennis ... start to target collect on these types of individuals and or the threats sources so that we can stop this before it gets to the door of the synagogue before it gets to the door\nOf the school as well but that's not just the law enforcement that's that's the community\nWill have more than just a moment\nI used to post a job for me to be overwhelmed with resumes which made it easy to miss a great

against Jews was rampant but he also knew we couldn't work in certain industries we couldn't live at certain areas of town that kind of social anti Semitism is now over religious anti Semitism so the most part is over or the various a\nProtestant and Catholic churches have rejected it it still exists with in some in the moslem community and some moms preach\nAnti Semitism both in this country and around the world but we're we're seeing increases is in in really three areas one and the most important one and the one that's never mentioned is on university campuses are among the hard way\nAnd that's the most dangerous more dangerous than the heart right let me tell you what\nHard left our future leaders of students on university campuses and the faculty demonized Jews\nPeople at Hunter College you yell and scream Zionists are not welcome here by which they mean Jews complaining about the design is president of the university we don't even know what the sheet sports Israel just happens to be Jewish so what's going on in university campuses with a heart last\nIs extraordinarily dangerous 'cause it's teaching the future leaders the heart right is very dangerous to as evidenced by these two horrible events or the shooting in Pittsburgh and the the pipe arms um\nAnd um then we're still seeing tremendous amount of Islamic anti Semitism more in your in in the United states but someone in the United states as well\nBo is our number one eight six six five oh five four six to six Alan Dershowitz our guest of the jumbo had a Joe and pat calls in from northern Michigan good evening pat\n... or ... ... um well I was talking to your your call screener gather the bottom do they Darren subject that you're on the last half hour but rather I was a bouncing ball um I guess\nMy my question would be to your guest ... back\nI don't know a couple of thousand years ago the uh the Islamic community and the Jewish community which has always been migrant because of their land problem back in the day live in peace ever just gone up people in the book\nThey weren't they threaten they weren't her as they were assigned their own section of town but\nYou know that this whole hate thing didn't exist\nTo a considerable extent it as true you go back of course of the Islamic community only goes back to the the seventh century uh and they they certainly spread or shall I say at the point of the sword but there were periods of greater uh\nShall we say a coexistence weren't there Allen\nYeah there was a golden age are in North Africa particularly where Jews and Muslims or work together and of course Jews and Muslims were victims together at the crusades which was a\nA Christian I'm bigoted attempt to murder a disc believers Jews and Muslims who lived in in Jerusalem so we've had these problems throughout history and it varies from time to time I left at one another group that's very important and that's a very dangerous\nAnd that is followers of the Reverend Lewis ...\nWho is a very large hater of vicious anti Semite anti gay anti women are but he predominantly focuses on the Jewish religion and what she calls the gutter religion he admires Hitler and he has hundreds of thousands of followers and the thing that's so disturbing events Eric on\nIs that people like Bill Clinton were willing to sit next to him\nHad Aretha Franklin's I'm a funeral and that a bronco bomber was willing to meet with him and join in his million Man March and that Keith Ellison number two made a Democratic Party\nWorked with him and you know when he made his horrible statements recently uh comparing Jews to termites you didn't see very much condemnation from ah people on the left Democrats on the left\nCertainly not from political figures 'cause they know that a fair con supporters are important part of the African American community in some inner city areas\nAnd you just can't allow any group to get a pass on anti Semitism\nUm whether they're black or white or or Muslim and I I've been very disappointed at the way a democratic leaders have remained silent in the face a fair economy complicity to her credit Chelsea Clinton was one of the few people\nWho really came out and attacked him and deservedly so but we haven't heard enough of\nThat [noise] yeah I I just don't understand the mentality of the stake here you you you think sometimes I guess listening to people like this the the Farrah Khan\nA being a person of color is a is immune from criticism from the left of being a moslem which is enough itself rather odd given me the views that uh he expresses and some of the middle east express from that point of view of that faith that people who live the Islamic face should be put to death that women are property and the like\nBut the part I Would think I guess for the left would would come into criticized would be the uh the ad he gay views that he expresses does the laptop ever have any principles left at all\nWell there are some on the left who don't have any principles there many of course you do have principles and there are some on the extreme right or don't have principles look when events like Pittsburgh occur the first instinct\nFor parties and politicians is to try to get some partisan advantage from it people jump on it immediately and blame their political opponents and you know I think we have to\nFocus on the fact that we've had these kinds of shootings 'em all over the world from many many years now and your earlier guest made some very important point to that hard targets and all that\nYou know in Israel when new synagogues or a new public buildings are built\nThey built by security experts\nAnd they're built with security in mind it's harder to do that to old buildings but today in Europe you can't go to a synagogue um without going through multiple ... metal detectors I went to a synagogue in Madrid a couple of years ago you couldn't go unless you a made an appointment in advance went\nThe synagogue the day before show your passport had attract\nThen you had an appointment as to when you could come I wanted nine thirty in the morning and my wife and I were allowed in and we when we tried to leave a little early 'cause I you know I don't usually stay for the whole service um they wouldn't let us\nThey said number no once you're in the building you have to stay and then when we laugh they made us leave two at a time and walk into different directions so you know\nSynagogues or targets most Islamic terrorism all over Europe and now of course there are a target of these kinds of ah radicals\nMore to come our guest is Alan Dershowitz you can follow him on Twitter at ... ...

Harvard University is our guest and we're talking about of course the terrible events of recent days most notably the eleven people murdered in Pittsburgh\nBut a similar such activities in the goodness knows we we followed them all on this program Tulsa as ah the the side of this call from a John denied the good evening a John welcome\n[laughter] I Love the both of you or Alan make God does keep you healthy and may you speaking out I just I just absolutely love it and you know and I would just say that I Would just say this I\nThe school thing is very important concept to be talking about because it we remember I read in the seventies\nAnd they were the ones that took the hostages were school students supported by the ayatollah and so on and so forth that Iran's the biggest threat that that that the Jewish people have it's it's it's just it's a given and what I wanted to say tonight is I I really feel like\nWhat's feeding this narrative and I think Mr\nDershowitz is gonna is gonna be more and more Republican every day because we have a president that sets up at the oval office that absolutely is a supporter of the Jewish nation\nThey call him a raise if they make him seem like he is anti Semitic and anti black and anti everything else but he is doing more for nationalities all over this country and for a belief systems of Christianity and of the Jewish faith\nThat is doing more for us that any president and I have seen in my lifetime and all that I Would well I\nGuess I guess respond to you or John not you're going to see our changing party registration anytime soon\n[laughter] it may happen at some point if the Democratic party abandoned me and leaves me I'm not going to leave Democratic Party I completely agree with you there isn't an ounce of anti Semitism in\nIn Donald Trump there never was even before he was a grandfather to Jewish kids and a father in law to\nA Jewish or a son in law on it and and the father of a Jewish daughter even before that there was never an ounce of anti Semitism that was always a bum rap\nUm you know he has a he has strong use uh I went to Israel to be there when the embassy was moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I thought that was a great day and it was\nVery important that he undo rock Obama did in the last month a lame duck\nAnd he declared the western wall the holiest site of Judaism to be illegally occupied territory\nIn the Hebrew University in the hospital the Jewish quarter all to be illegally occupied territory that change the status quo and made it much harder for there to be a negotiated peace and when he recognized and move the embassy that restored the status quo there was a great movie I think many of the city Arab countries\nNow support that at least they don't openly oppose it\nAnd so he's done some very very good things do I agree with this policy on immigration now I don't I think separation of families is a terrible thing and I think some of the language they use is a is is unacceptable and so I'm not surprised that I have mixed views of our president\nThe way ahead and excuses every previous president I don't think there's ever been a president in my lifetime that I've approved of\nCompletely but with President Trump the extreme views or so\n... that when I have done anything to defend his basic rights is basic right not to be charged as a criminal for exercising\nHis constitutional authority I have been so ostracized by people of the left on Martha's Vineyard and elsewhere they simply wouldn't talk to me uh they demanded that people give them an advance warning if I was at an event so they wouldn't show up\nIt was so personal um and I've never experienced that in my six years of public like\nAbout the thirty seconds to go here are are we going to see a an attorney here a light at the end of the tunnel are you an optimist short term\nI Am an optimist I think the American people are so\nAre so anti racism the way the American people gathered together to support\nThe people the Jewish community of Pittsburgh is absolutely remarkable even some Muslim leaders are have shown support I Wish they would also condemned terrorism

I I agree that that that that is probably even where we're headed\nA course in that is that the religious bodies as a group\nTend to be open and welcoming and so while what uh what we're talking about here are and what ray is talking about a ... may well become the necessity ah and of course ... should should Trump other other issues here but\nUh what's wrong with it is of course the the the central core tenet of most of these states has to be to a certain extent violated the mad is the openness and welcoming and again I I if if that's the situation we're in you tell me I'll I'll lock the door and but the people to go ahead\nYou're absolutely right we live in the open and free society and what we learned this weekend in a very non publicize story is that a man went to a church in Kentucky could not get into the church\nWent to in nine eleven close by and killed two people in the nine eleven\nUh instead of being able to potentially kill people church those people lost their lives and to the gentleman's point for California that those doors were locked so does it stop him from killing people at church it did stop him from killing people elsewhere it did\nSo you know what we have these nuts running around this country and potentially dangerous nuts\nThey are going to hurt somebody if it's in the temple or church or how ... how so warship or the local establishment\nOne

about is a little hard to understand Israel and the state of Israel which is a separate entity and not all Jews are pro Israel nor vice versa but a ... state of Israel is a lot more susceptible to criticism it's hard to say a whole lot about Jews who simply don't do much besides the\nWorship together that's about all you can draw them is the common thread among Jews\nJim I Want to go one step further it's\nAll right let's let our last go a little one step further here go right at one\nStep further is this man walked into a temple killed eleven people wanted countless others and was taken after being recorded by police officers to a local hospital which Jewish doctor saved his life\nSo that he could appear today in court to answer the charges\nThat's the society we live and be a Jew or non Jew or any other religion that's what people are sworn to do and that's what they did where's the police didn't shoot and kill him they took him to a hospital to be treated and to appear now in court\nYou know we'll come back with more in just a moment here but I Would simply no to the point brought up by the color\nOr there isn't much really to criticize about Jews they don't go around a

they are on a list of more than a hundred people to whom he intended to send packages\nAt Fifteen suspicious package was intercepted Monday This time address in Atlanta headquarters FBI Director Chris

Center for them\nAnd I'll come back to some of the points in that to our guest Thomas rescued but right now to attempt to calls in from Medford, Wisconsin the good evening Tim\nThis in squirrel held the center of Jewish life in and around Pittsburgh resident ... says fear was never part of the equation\nUntil now before everyone was just saying how they felt stronger and they felt braver and I don't feel brave I feel scared\nNow there is a reason to fear eleven people were just slaughtered in synagogue in America\nFor years incidence of anti Semitism were on the decline in America then came the twenty sixteen presidential election since then a meteoric rise thirty four percent increase in twenty sixteen fifty seven percent increase in twenty Seventeen according to the Anti Defamation league that track that\nThat's the single largest surge we've ever seen since he started tracking that\nNothing is sacred not seen in life or places of worship\nOr even where the dead are buried in Omaha Nebraska Veterans Memorial scarred with a swastika in Indiana a synagogue desecrated in Sacramento, California flyers targeting Jewish students on campus\nIt's screams at the same type of graphics in the same type of design that the Nazis you have no one can forget the torch bearing man in Charlottesville, Virginia viewing their hate filled rhetoric [noise]\nWhat is behind all this the ATM and those who tracks hate to say there is no doubt political rhetoric is in part to blame that rhetoric can be subtle or in your face\nLike us Representative Steve king for example re tweeting messages from unknown Nazi sympathizer\nI'm not doing that because any all pile on me and say can you had to apologize he was wrong you know he's guilty I'm not I don't feel guilty one bit I'm human\nThis Trump will add raised eyebrows featuring prominent Jews to target this special interests and some of the women's march for Sanders with Louis Eric Hi freeze anti Semitic sentiments for years when\nShe was literally under attack we should have a zero Pollard zero tolerance policy an intolerance is unacceptable that anyone from the president to minister fairer continue and in between should make the recent comments in all of this should be called out\n\nThat is CNN Sarah ... reporting one eight six six by boat jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we are joined by Dr Michelle banks and author speaker board certified ... neuro psychologist who joined us from this portion of the program and to think you are Dr banks did for being with us\nOh it's my pleasure in going to be here\nThe trail of hate that exists or sometimes are out there does it does seem a remarkable that uh uh ... rears its head as as much as it does ah why do you suppose that that is\nYou know and I think\nThey can ship builder also political that there's some that we're seeing in our country right now a study ... there's so much political activism but it's not stopping or how\nIt's affecting our work life one in seven people say that the stress has just gotten to them or hunting sleep difficulty because they're worried about politics\nAnd twenty seven percent of people had said that in the workplace it's much more stressful now because of the political discussion that are going on they can't even talk is on their job\nIt would seem to be that in general but other than of course ... three manifestation such as the\nThe pipe bomb case in Florida which ah ah would seem to be a a started by someone was extreme middle aberrations and with the deadly attack in Pittsburgh which was uh something good done apparently by a person of a a virulent or a hateful views that for the most part\nOf the political rhetoric and the country I Would agree has reached shrill proportions\nBut a that doesn't mean that that I frankly as far as I'm concerned that should give people a pause to to just crawl up in a corner and I'll just say at the way I see it sucked their thumbs I mean yes I Would like to see the level of rhetoric pared back a bit\nBut I think there's a lot of people are are are getting just a little bit over rod\nThings like the uh the attacks that we mentioned and other related activities or things like shutting down for example free speech on college campuses\nThings like groups calling themselves antifa are using fascist tactics of intimidation and vandalism or those are very serious things and those indeed uh uh can sometimes make me loosely but\nThe general level of political rhetoric well not\nWhat I Would prefer I don't think is a basis for nail biting frankly it's a basis for road trying to constructively tone things back your thoughts\n[noise] well I I think you're right but I think are a lot of people it's bringing about anxiety and as little as an all time high in our country and for others it's not so much it matter as fear or worry or anxiety but it's\nAnger and they're looking for an opportunity to express their views I think so often what happens chance is that when people start to feel like\nPeople aren't taking control and doing what they want them to do they then decide if\nIf it's going to be at that to me and they take back control and that power in their own hands whether it's for good or involved unfortunate circumstances or devastation\nThat does bring up something that I find remarkable a\nNobody I Know people in history\nHas ever had the power of self expression more than we do today everybody has their own publisher through social media and when\nAnd other outlets and the notion that somehow people don't have the ability to express themselves is frankly in my view a total cop out we're talking I think in many cases you're about spoiled children\nWho lash out like spoiled children and who in some cases\nAre have anxiety because they simply have never been taught the skills necessary to cope in this world ah so I mean if if someone's excuses that than I\nHey how ya doing by the on this\nUm yeah I wanted to give us feel a pointer on what what I learned from the mental health system um and also about a problem that we have\nRight here in Studio in this county um recently there was a a weapon and drug busts a of a group outlaw group known as a single white boys\nUm there's a lot of uh uh ... uh I I wouldn't go as far as I say that that are\nIn it now if you know anti Semitism you know there's it's that racism and a shift part of this a\n... that people have that they can commit predatory acts against common people and and wages banner and and feel that they have a some kind of a free for all just get go out and commit crimes\nYeah so there are sort of equal opportunity bigots I guess is what you're saying John ...\nExactly right and I've had this problem personally or I've had problems with a vandalism or people I'm spraying graffiti like ... or\nIf we might ask a singer you're at least ... some curious why you would be the target of such things\nI'm just just the fact that uh I I'm not having not as not you know but I I have I have endured much poverty in my life to get to the point where I have something\nWhat would I Would have one now why would watch being poverty stricken make you a target of bigots I mean it's not critical to the conversation but I'm just curious why you would be a target\nWell it could be just chance that I hire people to get some work and they just got carried away and your own lifestyle would involve drugs that sort of thing and I became it's our that could I say what I'm doing about ...\nAnd then I Want our guest to comment yes go ahead\nOkay well I started a foundation called the anti climbs association of America\nThe I'm Sorry the the anti what\nCrime associated with a crime association OK of America I go ahead yeah\nYeah yeah and um because I had this problem I'm not just here but I have the same problem in Seattle and and it's a reversal of the point where you have not white people I'm waiting these banners and and giving them the ex used to go commit crimes that had problems with black people\nOr you know again so as I say an equal opportunity thing All right I Would like our guest to comment on the on the job obviously is has tried to be proactive and uh and productive in this sort of thing I think most of us probably a doctor banks didn't feel somewhat inadequate but\nThat it's a problem and we don't like it but the the we as individuals are not capable of making much of a debt\nWell and that's unfortunate because really jama that comes back to having a lack of ...\nAnd I think that's the worst thing on family of American today at the lack of ... and John I'm so sorry that you were at target and and that kind of that but I think it is universal that we see with so many individual that people want to be part\nOf something larger than themselves\nSo when they kind of acts superior they have become larger than who they really are\nAnd unfortunately it has an detrimental impact on their relatives ... by that make a big headline and so it gets than their conscience\nThey're wanting all along\nUh one thing that that you brought up earlier that it's a rather peripheral I guess to the conversation but a a curious you mentioned about your income dropping because of Medicare reimbursement uh I Believe you do retain the right to refuse to take Medicare patients if you if you chose to do you not\nOh yes yes yes that is absolutely true that all the other insurance companies rate predicated by the Medicare rates and when they ever met says and they go down than the other insurance company rates go down as well\nInteresting I was was not aware of that are less than a minute to go here I'm just curious of what one recommendation you would make based on your ah your knowledge in your experience and your expertise\n[noise] you know I think the biggest thing that I have learned in Thirty years in that field is that we have to pay attention\n... Atkinson and those kind of is that I like that children sitting alone at lunchtime at school isolated or the strange band that's out in the parking lot when we notice that thing\nIt's our responsibility to give something to say something to inquire\nFerret up a satellite will speak briefly off there again Dr Michelle banks than is an author speaker and board certified neuro psychologist or website is her name a title DR M.

me because I was able to get my own ideas here before he began to talk about it\nBut he has been saying that the media is exactly doing what I'm describing tonight and my last point would be\nIf

they caused it and they're going to do more of it\nA voice well taken and the speaking on behalf of a of the media which we are a part of although many of the media would not to appreciate me saying

your last couple of callers have said and you know it shows a Trump Obama can take their own responsibility for what they said but on a wider scale I think that\nA lot of the actions that we're seeing are ... and not extreme behavior to this point but\nI think the American people are so frustrated with not seeing any leadership out of these politicians gym where you have watched the politicians decker and backed by and go eat at each other and the name calling for so long now and it's getting worse and yet we're getting no productivity out of them\nAre RAICES rating is lower than that of of a\nPlumber with weekend rates you know I mean it's just\n... nothing's getting done and I'll give you an example I called my congressman's office three times now and I've asked specific questions about for example if there's a blue wave where does he stand on the impeachment and I cannot get an answer I get things like\nWell you know we don't know that that's going to happen to okay if it does like here's what I Want to know where does the congressman stand\nIs that they're really not the core problem there are a vacuum fill out I think I think we're going through a strange moment where the digital revolution which is a fascinating thing economically but culturally as a lot more mixed and complicated\nThe digital revolution we're going through is undermining place and it turns out places where almost all people derive their real happiness\nSo in other words by place I gather you mean geographic place\nSo I mean there's the social science literature on happiness is actually remarkably clear over the last decade or so and it says things that probably most whites humans who have grandparents\nThat believe through almost all of human history which is there's a limited number of things that determine whether or not you're happy you have a nuclear family you have a couple of deep friendships idea of meaningful work do you have shared location you have co workers\nNumber for do you have a theological or philosophical world view to make sense of death and suffering you have a local ... community\nFamily friends work and theology or religion those are basically the for drivers of whether or not people are happy and they're all highly connected with rooted ness actual place where humans with bodies can give each other hugs and help each other up when they fall down and pull on a horse in the same direction\nAnd what's happening in our bowl that is there's this great tension between rooted ness and ruthlessness rudeness is what makes us happy and yet the technology that we get a consume now that is making us the richest people in all of human history\nIs constantly whispering to us that we can be ...\nWe don't need to be anchored in any one place we can let our identity in our consciousness in our tribes be these really distant things well it turns out being aligned with people emotionally on social media 'cause you support the same politicians\nDoesn't actually give people much of a sense of community it really is just a sense that the enemy of my enemy can at least pretend to me that it will be my friend but it doesn't really give you any comfort when you're getting older\nNow as we speak I'm about to go back to my old hometown of Lebanon, Missouri loved the town of the people who gave me a great start in life most of the good things than I Am today\nAre due to that town my parents of course in particular but the the scout leaders the church leaders and the teachers in the schools all of that I left there uh after high school I've never been back except to visit\nA I feel a sense of connection but it's a it's tenuous I also feel a sense of connection with the other communities my broadcasting community and the like and I certainly have not found in any of these different if you will competitors for my allegiance\nAre uh are evil or in competition with one another I'm not sure that I mean I recognized in other words my life has has them and us in it but but it it's not like the people on the other side of the divide or my mortal enemy\nGood Anya right I mean that's that's a healthy way to live um what's different in our time though is we have statistically an epidemic of loneliness where we have half as many friendships in America today as twenty seven years ago\nSo I graduated high school in Nineteen Ninety a town called Fremont, Nebraska pretty similar to Lebanon, Missouri I suspect\nAnd in Nineteen Ninety the average American statistically had replied to friend the average American today statistically has one point eight ... half as many the nuclear family is in statistical collapse at America lots of the things you started with with the deaths of despair\nOr from the fact that we're gonna have the third consecutive year of declining life expectancy a lot of this is about the standing of local tribes a lot of times in the in the media and\nAnd the national conversation or pundit tree we talk about the word drive like it's always bad clearly the political tribalism at our moment is that this tripling of the sense that people that don't do politics the way I Do I'm supposed to think of them is not just confused or people to be persuaded but as evil but that that kind of tribalism politically\nOr leads us to forget that the word tribe is often a really great thing when you think of your family and your brothers and sisters and their cousins as a party or cry when you think of your friends as people that you're going to keep over the course of life despite the fact\nThat you might have a dispute about something tomorrow friendship isn't transactional that decline of local thick normal natural traditional tribes\nIs happening at a pretty great statistical pretty horrible but pretty a meaningful statistical rate right now that what we see is a decline of association all neighborly America Robert Putnam uh the\nPolitical scientist and sociologist at Harvard has done a bunch of work on things like the Bowling Alone phenomenon that he discovered Twenty years ago\nWhere more Americans are bowling or were in the data that at any point in us history and yet bowling league memberships where their lowest little leagues are declining across America the Rotary Club is declining across America\nThere's much less participation in a sense of what we eat locally where most people live\nAnd so then when that subset of us that fleet of politics as the way to fill that void I Try to find out why there is a great meeting there there's a lot more U.S and them a lot more them frankly\nAre in very little we but when you say that isn't your experience then you're a part of that healthy chunk of America that isn't seeing that atrophy of of neighborhood in association in deep friendship and then it allows us to go and engage in politics in a meaningful way where we try to do stuff like get a cost effective infrastructure belt on\nBut not try to find a grand meaning and Republican versus Democrat\nMost political ... most political leaders in America are interesting enough to project your grand hopes and dreams onto\nWell probably not do and although I ... my own experiences have not been quite so ah so dire but I I Know that they are for for many others out there and it sounds as though you are suggesting senator that Facebook friends are not actually a substitute\nYeah there's tons of data which shows that so if you go for the two hundred five hundred social media friends\nIf you go from five hundred to a thousand social media friends you don't actually get any happier at a certain point actually more social media friends is correlated with declining happiness but there is a lot of evidence which suggests if you know the person who lives two doors away from you and your neighborhood\nYou're going to be happier and more time spent consuming social media actually just places real human friendships so what we have happening is not\nA use of social media to augment the good relationships we have you can use it that way that's why I still use social media is because I Want to use it to keep up with\nYou know my college buddies and and group X y and Z a across my life where job change let us to move\nA it's an easy way to communicate with people on the Fremont wrestling club or by my son wrestles a there's all sorts of ways that social media can be used to augment relationships but what it usually is doing is supplanting physical relationships and then it's correlated with declining happiness\nThe average American is now checking our iPhone every four minutes a four point three minutes per American adult checking their phones and usually what that's doing is displacing relationships and people and ... that are right in front of you with sort of ways to\nRage and grieve and worry about things that are far away from you that you can't do much about and we moved from being active in the local community to being passive in a digital community and a lot of that loneliness spills out as rage and it's one of the reasons that our politics look so deformed at the present moment\nWe'll continue our conversation
