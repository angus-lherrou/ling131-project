that we had no energy actually a\nNun whatsoever you have to do with regard to the way we're throwing the ball obviously the big swing by yes he'll but um one thing about our team we we could play one of those has been like that the whole time I know we know that\nIn the last third of the game we're we've been really good rather season in the playoffs and I'm now Mitch with a big swing and that got us going\nAnd steep stand on your left Alex can I just ask you I we know teams can come back we know which never over till it's over the cliches are true but can you talk about the way this team came

only two ... two teams left in a\nIn a big lives right now and both things are going to fight too and um we did it they did it to you saw the last minute and sometimes I Know Tobar are we talking

good or bad some in the big swearing and and we kept rolling and we're gonna stop when\nThere's always core of the red Sox manager and they got rolling in the seventh inning tied it in the eighth and then the big explosion in the ninth inning and don't miss a World Series game five tomorrow eight o'clock eastern on Fox seven eastern time right here on ESPN Radio mark has to share and buster only with you and in a vibrant league Craig kimbrell\nCame in probably wanted him for a cleaning but as you pointed out uh with relievers never comfortable when it's a non same situation so he pitches in the night what does that mean for kimbrell tomorrow\nI'm sure that he'll be available we saw similar situation the American league championship series were Kimball was work very hard in an alley score came back the next day and said\nThis is my guy so I Would expect that he would pitch I Would expect that uh after Chris' sale that David Price will be available records sell it didn't work tonight I Would expect that he's going to be available\nKorea is definitely taking this day by day by day focusing on that day and that's got 'em now one went away with three opportunities to close it out in this World Series and has the I was thinking about this is I heard the discussion about Chris Sale and what he said in the dugout you remember the two thousand sixteen World Series during the rain delay\nOr in game seven that Jason they were made a big speech to the cubs\nGetting his players getting his teammates all ready to go and if the red Sox go on and close this out then that Christian Bale explosion in the dug out in the middle of this game one as Alex core sad as deep here said they had no energy that's going to go down in New England lore\nYeah and if I'm not mistaken in just in Berlin or had a similar\nType deal or in the dugout her down the runway in game two last year as well so sometimes those things can spray you want and speaking of Chris theloop delivered the message tonight is going to face\nClayton cursed shot at one point for nothing gets the home run we're thinking Kurdish or maybe gets too too now the pressure is on a curse Shaw who did not get out of the fifth inning in game one\nYeah and it will be very interesting to see how the Dodgers used their bullpen the criticism of day Roberts to this point is that it's to push button that there's not a feel for it that they continually will go back to someone like Ryan Madsen who's been struggling\nAnd it will be interesting now after ten nights a implosion into Dodger bullpen if any of those roles or change think about that\nAre going into tonight's game when the Dodgers had leads up four plus run their record was fifty four no well that evaporated tonight in game for the world series with the Dodgers had a chance to even it up in October or that that is going to go down in history\nA buster I Want to give you some breaking news here to chew on I Believe our core I'm told just said that David Price is going to start tomorrow likes him in the national league parks sale is healthy so just your your quick gut reaction on there's up three one and go to David Price tomorrow\nYou wonder how Chris Sale is feeling and physically we know that he's had some issues with the shoulder maybe that's the case where\nA he just isn't a hundred percent and David Price on the other hand has been throwing the ball better and better with increase velocity since he's made that adjustment with his delivery working more downhill soul that they're trying to close it out maybe trying to get crushed sale some extra rest if this series in fact continues in Boston for game six and seven is a\nPrice was warming up in the bullpen tonight sale is not hurt a and we'll start game six if necessary so
