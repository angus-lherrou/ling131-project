is that politics are like war and in that battle we've heard Democrats compare it to inform the candidates this war concept the end justifies almost any me so what he's basically saying is to

recent remarks\nMade by Nancy Pelosi in the New York city the of course the house minority leader and uh she hopes and some polls suggest you might be once again the speaker of the house\nNow it's hard to know exactly what Nancy mean sometimes sometimes you just a little goofy ah ah referring to of course the famous quote about Obamacare we're just going to have to pass it to find out what's in it or to what extent do you believe this could have been a rhetorical rambling on the part of Nancy Pelosi\nWell no I think I think what she did is give a window to her so I think you know you brought up Obamacare the fact that she and her party\nBasically we're willing to pass this massive bill without having read it and we're basically engaged\nIn a a a propaganda campaign to fool the American people at least a portion of them into supporting those the American people were told by the president and by the Democrats that if they like their doctor they could keep their doctor\nThey want to remember that eat Italy yes they were told that their premiums would go down\nI don't know if they express disgust deductibles but I Know the American people were not told that their deductibles would go a phenomenally um higher\nTo the point where the insurance was almost worthless which was the situation with Obamacare\nAnd and of course\n... I don't think the American people were honestly told that what they were engaged in was nationalized saying I'm a significant industry when is it they knew the healthcare system in the United states is similar to the legal system in the United states\nWell it was the I'm not sure that I Would share quite those apocalyptic views or follow the president as sending troops to the Mexican border we don't expect any bands of liberals to go out and the and the pose was armed forces are going to do their best to stem the tide northward but I'm not sure\nHow a fifty two hundred of them are going to to stop all those people in terms of of trees and woman or a specific definitions for treason\nAnd I'm a I'm not sure anyone has committed treason yet a James Harrison your thoughts\nAs well as your first uh as far as the caravan I Believe as I said that it was engineered I think the purpose of the caravan which they have them arrive at the border and to cause embarrassment and damage\nTo the president and his administration and two Republicans by having something untoward occur if you have you remember what the un I mentioned is all of these attacks that have been against the president\nFor all for all these two years if if we look at them all the one that got the most traction\nWas when they said he is separating families at the border that got a lot of traction so this is our hope that that will repeat but I I Am optimistic as you are Jim I think first of all are we now I think are up to\nAt least a couple of thousand or several thousand troops I think our military\nOr the capabilities of our military even compared to Mexico and Guatemala and that is so much more sophisticated and I think they're going to find a way to what's left of the Caribbean you know the Mexican government reportedly is offering them and to stay in Mexico they're trying to slow them down\nAs a rule demanded the by the way say that when you you leave the country you must you must take that embassy in the first country you reach\nSo there's not even by international standards which I don't always accept or all of these people who kept on coming to the United states have already bypass the their option for amnesty\n... exactly and this is a lawless bunches you if you recall the president was attacked for suggesting that there may be criminals and there may be terrorists among\nThe these people and the caravan ... well now that they have exchanged gunfire and they have had Molotov cocktails\nAnd they have destroyed property in committed are something\nI think it's very clear the percentage of words right um but it is so I think a group of them are going to make it to the border and the people that are backing this uh obviously there's ... there's logistics and transportation there's a trucks\nThat are carrying them otherwise they could make it in time so some of them are going to make it before the midterms 'cause that's that's the October\nSurprise so it makes perfect sense as far as the justice people being brought to justice or we can only hope and pray that John Huber the U.S attorney has been assigned to\nUm to look at the wrong doings in the Justice Department the FBI and the inspector general\n... I'm a subsequent report is going to come out of the the you know behavior and the FBI or rice a page Peter Struck cetera\nOne would hope finally had Road Home there's a lot of\nPeople that have lost their jobs and there are a lot of people were there's grounds to indict them\nAnd I think I Do believe that the president has quite a bit of power that he is restraining himself from using until after the midterms right including the de classification of the Pfizer application that has been postponed\nYeah we have a call from Steve in Chatham county North Carolina good evening Steve\n... gym but I always enjoy your show thank you\nLewis and um I agree absolutely everything guests to just said my thought the same just pause it this is there is going to be in group I Do I think Mexico is doing everything they possibly can and then there have been in the back is obviously\nWe're gonna have to give some concessions to them or as as\nYou know because they're doing that for us but my soul is\nLet's learn from the Israelis um that group our big they may be used rubber bullets and tear gas do not use live five\nWell certainly there's no need for lethal force except as a very last resort they are all kinds of ways to to quell a you could you will crowd disturbances and that's just a lot of this would be\nSadly the gym but you know some of these people walking up here and I assume videos they literally have automatic weapons and you know within the caravan yes have you not seen the latest videos\nI missed that I guess but anyway All right all of it wouldn't surprise me so we'll assume that that is correct\nI Wonder if these people actually hostages so that these gangs can get their people I'm into our country\nI was that our guest to answer that I suspect that most of us just want to come up here and grab whatever is available or be it a jobs for those with the work ethic or a or a freebies\nFor those without a granted good conditions were bad back in their home countries but one thing I Would add to those who are upset about being separated from their children\nIf in fact you had a husband and wife who happened to bring their kids to work and work was holding up a bank the kids would be separated from their parents once they were apprehended they're breaking the law entering this country if you do not wish to be separated from your kids don't break into our country uh this this whole nonsense of\nOf uh wringing our hands about this just started to really freaked me out a James\nI perfectly understand his state it is is right there to bring this up they did have for sure they have firearms this group and that that they asked a\nPortion of them are young men the fighting age\nAnd it does appear that they want to use the women and children ah it as a kind of thought that they would if and when they arrived at the border they would stick them in fraud or to try you know if if the military to use water cannons for example um I think they want\nAltercation and injury this was a so it's a delicate situation but here's the big picture we simply have to stop the if they were to get into this country\nThere would be an endless number of caravans and ah it appears as though the people that want to abolish ice the Democratic socialist so they called themselves the people that wide open borders chained to never be able to answer the question\nOf how many immigrants is enough\nAnd so they they seem to be on a trajectory to turn the United states into a third world nation because there are certainly enough people in the world that would love to come into the United states of America with to just walk across our border and not have any red tape and be able to get\nBenefits at the same time\nUm especially for example the state I'm In California they're ... they want to give them healthcare\nA tuition discounts and for all I Know probably proposing giving each one of them a condominium on the ocean\n[laughter] [laughter] it say so it's a it's a situation where\nUm we we have a finite infrastructure and we've already seen\n'em a loss in terms of in California particularly hospitals roads prisons colds um with this ... a philosophy of just bringing everybody and by the way also don't filter it them in any way\nYeah that's interesting I Want to talk about that when we come back here at one eight six six five oh jumbo

Bible one thirty nine thirty nine eight hundred Bible one thirty nine thirty nine [noise]\nMy mom\nKnow and his\nWas up in my life was in\nToo hard to tell them\n\nI Believe that eventually makes it a the Halloween Caesar and we're glad to be talking about the things just a tad spooky tonight with a Hollywood executives\nWho has written a than ... book the ghost photographer Julie ... our guest and uh she has to put some considerable thought\nAnd the imagination into the steel what's the uh the most uh I guess a scary or realistic thing you've ever seen in this particular brain\n... well at that they're really great question because there certainly things that have been scary that I've seen and um and there's things that are scared that experience that actually didn't see\nI think that I had at one point I'm In the house they ... me back at I think after if you will the door kind of crash\nDown into the other side for me um had a lot of ghost if you will that I'm kind of entered the house and we had heaters turning on by themselves light\nOf and computer rated it was it was absolutely insane and and so that was probably more frustrating but probably the scariest thing was the first coast that I I I took a picture of because it was the idea of it\nActually scared me and this is where the Hollywood in the play where what studio that may hold her guys\nAnd so I'm thinking to myself oh no have I open the portal\nAnd am I going to get sucked into it and you know start screaming out for Carolyn or something I I I really was petrified\nUm I have I have seen um some some scary scary goes that look like they've been beat up\nA ghost I had no idea [laughter] I didn't I think there will beat up before they cross our lives\nYeah and so there was like I had a black guy and like a a fat lip um\nSo yeah there's been some scary things for sure but I think that first one was more scary for me 'cause I don't know what the heck it happened\nIs Hollywood doing more of this now you have this return to the Halloween the movies with\nA a a\nCurtis ... hurt evidence yet are we going to be a return to those good old days of the of the scary this and the Freddie Krueger and that sort of thing\nYou know kind of it looks that way doesn't it I think that guy like faith and blonde and have figured out how to make 'em really commercial um horror films\nAnd and you know and it was so interesting I think about the horror genre and Hollywood is it really is that movie that you want to see in a theater because you want to be next to someone even if they're a stranger you know it's a it's a really great reason to go and have a communal experience\nIn terms of of of how we view these things anymore or the days of the the movie theater limited are we going to be downloading in the future\nThis is sort of what we all want obviously a superior returns and lower risk although we're generally told well you can have superior returns and more risk or you can have a a less risk and a lower return how do you get both\nWell it's really a myth of Wall Street that you have to take on more risk\nIn order to get more return Wall Street sales people use is to sell people a mortgage obligations and risky securities but the truth is that if you keep your losses small you make more over the long run than if you are taking big risks\nOf\nReally ... the other words there is I don't know what category of a of of stocks or a category of investments maybe it's a a bonds or or who knows what\nUh maybe you can tell us but you're one the one that that if I just look at the category I automatically going to get this uh this muscular portfolio is that a fact\nWell there's two things one is that people learned in the Nineteen seventies Nineteen eighties\nTo be diversified to not have one hundred percent of your money and the S P five hundred which crashes about every ten years on the average and you don't want to have all of your money in cash either because that is guaranteed to go down as inflation goes up so instead of just trying to spread\nOver all the bases you you need diversification but you also need momentum what the economists and researchers have found just in the last few years and the twenty first century is that you can\nHave a portfolio and slightly shifted month by month away from the things that are going down\nAnd shifted toward the things that are going up this is called asset rotation you're just rotating your portfolio you just have to check at once a month you don't have to watch computer screens all day long just a simple checkup is all you need to keep your four one K. or IRA or whatever you may have from crashing\nYou do this\nYes most of my personal wealth from my dot\nCom businesses is invested in muscular portfolios I go to my website muscular portfolios dot com the tables there tell you what\nOf the exchange traded funds and index funds are the most likely to go up the most in the next thirty days so I guess by those once a month I stay away from the ATF that are likely to go down in the next three days everything\nWhat was that last thing that you stay away from the walk through like do they go down\nWe stay away from index funds that are likely to go down into like thirty days\nAnd so now as investors we have a fantastic opportunity because it's maybe one tenth of one percent to hold these very low cost index funds this has never been so cheap and history\nOne eight six six Bible jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six in terms of how you go about doing this uh oh what a what stocks or do you pick six I assume that it is a stocks which you presumably invest correctly is that correct well\nThat's a fallacy people think that the only thing that goes up our stocks really the world now is a place where you can get very cheap exposure to real estate you can get very cheap exposure to commodities you can get ... are precious metals and\nThere's a very simple rule that the economists have proven over hundreds of studies which most\nInvestors and individuals are not aware of and the rule is just whatever went up the most in the past three to twelve months it's statistically more likely than chance to go up for one more month that's all we know we're not predicting next year we're not saying what the market is going to do tomorrow but for people who ... for one k.'s and I raise\nThey may not be able to trade their portfolios more often than once a month their plan may restrict them to only trading once a month this is perfect for them because they need to know\nThis is how markets crash\nThat's as some people have hunters starts going down then it goes down more and then all of a sudden you're down fifty percent like we saw in the global financial crisis people don't want to see their life savings be cut in half that's very bad for their wealth\nAccumulation very bad for their retirement people need to learn how these low risk portfolios are put together\nThis will be five hundred is that a lot more important to you than say the the Dow industrial\nNo the mosquitoes for polio is never have any holding and the U.S and the five hundred you do have exposure to large kept stocks if that's what's going up you have exposure small kept stocks of that's what's going up but there's way too much attention paid to the U.S and the five hundred it's just a number it's just a five hundred stocks\nThat people in the standard and Poor's think will go up the most in the coming year they're usually right but you have some five hundred is very crash crowd at it drops forty percent are more every Eighteen years on the average people are not ready for this because we've had this almost ten year bull market people have forgotten how fast the bear market and go down\nYeah and some of course get a reminded the hard way I'll stay with us more to come by and living that our guest use a consumer advocate entrepreneur and the author of muscular portfolios and he has a

our state in a new direction\nThe newest dead claims that I was in favor of raising taxes this is false and nothing more than an act of desperation or those special interests the truth is the tax reform proposal that I supported would have eliminated state income tax for\nEvery hardworking West Virginia I built a reputation as a conservative fighting back against the liberals in Charleston who have repeatedly tried to raise your taxes I've\nWorked tirelessly to control government spending and to lower taxes for working families I've supported eliminating the tax on Social Security benefits

paid for by it guns for state Senate it Bailey treasure for overweight\n[noise]\nBack to juggle had a joke one eight six six five oh jumbo Brian Livingston our guest consumer advocates entrepreneur author of a number of books including muscular portfolios now here in the book you make reference to something called a lazy portfolio what's that\nPeople have been told for decades that they should just diversify their money across different stocks and bonds that's called a lazy portfolio because it never changes his position you are stuck with whatever percentage of stock it says to have and whatever percentage of bonds that says the house\nRight now stocks are looking like they're not going to be making very much in the next year or two and bonds are going to be suffering from the increase of interest rates so people need to know\nHow inexpensive it is today to get index funds that can give you exposure to real estate commodity as precious metals are the kinds of investments\nJust being in stocks and bonds is really a bad idea now that we're looking like we might be going into a bear market\n[noise] do you ah have a particular formula for picking the stocks that that go into a muscular portfolio I mean\nWell my own mother was in that situation she was having strokes she was falling into dementia she spent the last three and a half years of her life in various nursing homes she made me the trustee of a bond portfolio that she had built up\nBy buying houses renting them at the students and finally went she couldn't take care of those houses anymore he sold them before the housing crisis so she got full value but she couldn't really take care of herself anymore she needed someone to take care of her\nBusiness affairs and take care of her health care needs what we don't want is to be having fights with their brothers and sisters are fights with our inlaws over how do we manage the family's assets without muscular portfolio\nThe computer formula always tells you exactly what to do you don't have to know anything you don't have to invest in your brother in law's real estate deal and swap land the index funds that have just become available and the last few years are very highly liquid it's very easy to buy and sell them they don't charge you\nVery big fees it can be as little as a penny to get in and out of an index fund these days that's not true and the past you used to have to pay two percent of your trade just to sell one thing and buying the thing now it can be as little as a penny and you don't have to worry could I Do they should I Do that a computer formula just\nTells you exactly what is the best investments for you this\nWhat about bonds they figure into this\nThe global asset classes that we have available to us now with index funds include bonds and include stocks and includes real estate and it includes commodities so you can find\nIn the Thirteen different global asset classes that experts divide the world up into you can have\nUs bonds you can have foreign bond sometimes they're paying a lot more than the U.S bonds vanguard for example has a foreign bond fund that is hedged against currency changes so you don't have to worry is the dollar going to go up as the dollar going go down\nYou just never think about that kind of thing is taking care of for you so when you need to have\nMore bonds and your portfolio you will automatically move toward that kind of index fund when the market for example is crashing in the U.S and the five hundred when we have some people have hunters doing great your portfolio will automatically rotate more towards equities whether they're us stocks are there non us stocks it's very easy\nWhat about the futures of derivatives and all these are these new to me newfangled things that I don't fully understand\nWell you see a lot of these risky futures options which really should take someone who's an expert to handle that kind of thing the\nNew kinds of index funds that just crack a whole market really take care of all of that for you for example let's say during the global financial crisis we were in two thousand eight to nine and stocks were down fifty percent\nThe fact is that treasury bonds were up precious metals were up and commodities were up so just by\nMoving your portfolio into the index funds that had bonds and precious metals and commodities you could actually go up while the market was crashing into thousand eight to those nine having a commodities fond of course means that somebody out there\nIs using computers to bet on commodities growing up in price or commodities going down in price but you the investor don't need to ever think about anything like that it's all ... for you automatically that is the way it should be I don't think anybody should try to become an expert in the energy market or the precious metals market just let\nThe computer program tell you which ones are going up\nYou mentioned all eight and nine and our recent little financial hiccup there what lessons did we the investing public learn from that a a mini crash of ah ten years ago and what lessons did you learn\nWell in two thousand eight thousand I and it was\nThe worst crash since the great depression and it led to this horrible recession which we're just getting out of now the fact is that the S P five hundred crashes thirty percent or more every ten years and it has a severe crash a forty percent or more every Eighteen years that's what people need\nRemember it's not that the market goes up and up and up it goes down and it goes down like\nTaking an elevator down whereas the bull market with like climbing the stairs up we've had this bull market for almost ten years and the bear market is probably going to be only one year or maybe one and a half years like in two thousand seven to two thousand I this is the lesson we can take away from this is you can't just\nHave diversification you can't just by three or four things I think you're save those three or four things could all go down south ... crashing just like they did during the great recession only by looking at your portfolio once a month and giving it a little too it up giving it a little checkup where you you put\nOut these things that are doing well and you bring into things that are doing better\nAll right Brian ... and the book is a muscular portfolios
