walking into your Boston saying I quit and how would you like to commute to work without ever leaving your home will not long ago at thirty\nPlausible deniability and I'm not again condoning anything here I just I Am appalled at the other arrogance and stupidity of inviting him into a government facility and then apparently this member again I just I'm Amazed anybody could be that stupid\nWell I think that it was very clear message and deliberate message of the Saudis to any of their dissidents abroad\nOr they simply don't tolerate any sort of division or expression and freedom of speech and criticism of the government whether it's in the country or outside of it\nAnd I've picked up a couple of stories today that indicate to other people might have disappeared recently from other countries that are Saudis I don't know whether I don't have the names\nSo is there anything to give you right now but it just kinda it sounds like it might be part of a pattern that they're cleaning up internationally at this point\nIt's horrifying it's absolutely horrible but you outlined all the competing considerations that the president Jared Kushner have and how complicated very complicated the situation is [noise]\nAnd something else that I Would also take note of and that is this atrocities happened on this planet all the time I had this been an American reporter and by that I mean a citizen of the United states uh that would be one thing\nBut he is not or was ... years probably seems to be the case past tense and as such a again I I'm I'm Glad to see that we we stand for certain things but I'm just not sure exactly how our deepest\nStrategic interests are at stake here and I again I I Know it sounds as though I'm a I'm a a centrally are adopting a very a Mackey of LA in ah almost to the point of of a a moral point of view here\nUh but as I say I have no illusions about the reality of this world and I'm Wondering your thoughts am I Am I not uh being outraged enough\nWell I think everybody is outraged by what happened but what it boils down to is what businesses it of ours is you know it was an on our property is not an American citizen it's doesn't have anything to do with us other than it's an international\nOutrage and everybody should be outraged about it but what if anything we\nCan do in response to it I'm not or whether we should I I'm not sure I certainly don't think we should cancel the a huge contract that any number of American companies have to provide equipment to them because they just go someplace else\nAnd those contracts provide jobs for thousands of Americans\nAnd of and furthermore I Would I Would do that as I say they they can be useful at times and to give them the alternatives that exist on that wretched peninsula ah they this is the Saudi royal family as tragic as it is probably represents the the the best\nAvailable governance\nFor that area I mean the only way you would ever fix Saudi Arabia quite frankly is an international occupation lasting maybe half a century and costing trillions of dollars in which people simply had a very barbaric culture just erased\nAnd nobody is prepared to spend that much time money and blood to do that I mean ... you know some things are just beyond fixing\nOne of the things that the Bush center has done in the last well since the ... since President Bush forty three left office and built the Bush library as they've started a program for women internationally\nAnd they bring women from Saudi Arabia and other countries like that over to the United states and take 'em to different places so they can see\nHow democracy works or not you know that their their view is that we you know we can make the world more democratic one woman at the time and that women are the key to the future for any democracy I think those are very good point so they're doing very good work with\nThat yeah and there's only so much we can do as a country the Sufi another country and its sovereignty\nNow ah and ah again it it it is very disheartening it is very unfortunate although I Am amazed at your your analysis may be quite accurate here that this was done in such an arrogant way as a deliberate message but I must say that or\nAre they so devoid of reality that they could not foresee this international reaction there may well be far stronger reactions than you and I are offering there could be all kinds of\nOf cuts in aid and the like and for a country that was presumably moving in the direction of civilization as I say letting women drive cars or is it pretty uh pretty temperate step but it but it is a step\nA for a country that it was supposedly moving in in a a civilized direction it it is remarkable that they would have the same time countenance something that is a step back into the darkest times in human history\nAnd you're right about that too it's just hard to imagine given how outrageous it is that it wasn't deliberate\nIt it is that we would

votes jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six\nWe're talking with a journey simply Powell about the apparent murder\nOn the Saudi Government property a consulate in Turkey a dissident journalist and uh we're at one eight six six five oh Jim bode to offer thoughts about this let's start with the Casey in the great falls Montana and the Casey good evening\nYeah I uh I was just thinking that there seemed to in my memory there was a strong linkage to nine eleven with the Saudi regime or at least the portions of the population in\nIs anybody really stupid enough to do this this publicly\nAnd you lead look at all the events that lead up to this so Jared Kushner goes over and quote unquote negotiate a deal the century to completely isolate the Iranians we all know that the Iranians and and the Turks right now and of course this happens in Turkey of all places that the Turks are are very tight against the Kurds nobody stops\nTo say wait a minute is that just coincidental or or is is maybe there's something else here a couple of other things is that the journalist himself is a known the Muslim Brotherhood\nA supporter and if you look behind the scenes of everything that's happening here or something just doesn't smell right because I Know that that the the Saudi crown prince is bold he's young he's thirty three years old but\nLoose cannon some would say yeah somewhat say but it is he really that stupid\nBecause there's no way that he wins out of this deal to put President Trump in this situation\nUh and it seems purposeful that you go and create outrage to create chaos and when you look at all of the other things I'm just getting introduced one more factor that I'd like to say here in the cities are interpretation of this\nUm who is the gentleman that is the former now under investigation CIA director and at what point during the nine eleven attacks who was in charge in the CIA office desk in Saudi Arabia at that Saudi Arabian desk\nWell by who is there do seem to have a pardon\nJohn Brennan Jon Benet\nAre you what are you I'm not sure exactly what you're suggesting are you suggesting ... well just just to pose the question are you suggesting that John Brennan was was somehow involved in this\nI'm suggesting that there's a lot of stuff that doesn't smell right when the heat gets turned up on the quote unquote deep state\nAnd all of a sudden this just happens to be after Jared Kushner very quietly goes over there and isolates the Iranians now here's another thing that's happened in the last ten days Mm what pressure was applied to the Turks to release our dear pasture that just came home to great fanfare\nAnd all of a sudden now this happens in Turkey so ask yourself the question we already know and and I think Rush Limbaugh pointed this out that it is impossible for an hour or I watch technologically unless it is connected to a why fight network to record this\nAnd so so where is this coming from\nWell Ayers the recording oh we've heard that a a quote unquote source an unnamed source in the press in Turkey has heard all of these recordings this this just it doesn't pass the smell test\nWell All right let's let's examine just exactly what all is is going on here as regards to the notion of the crown prince with Saudi Arabia and chaos\nChaos is exactly the last thing that the Saudi regime needs stability is what they need desperately they are clinging to survival and uh I seriously doubt that they will survive the next twenty five years they are such a throwback to the dark ages\nAh I'm not sure quite how the Kurds fit in to do all of this was I don't think the Saudis care one way or the other about a quote the Kurds as for the connection between this and the release of that uh that pastor a again\nAh this this involves a Mac you valley a tie ins that the that frankly elude me Sidney Powell it sounds to me like an arrogant regime that uh apparently thought they could get away with a lot more than they could have uh your take on on how how deep this goes to do all the connections that were just put forward\nBut I think we do have to consider the possibility at least and less evidence proves otherwise that there are forces at work in the background particularly with or through the Iranians\nTo make it up to drive a wedge between the United states and the Saudis and other Middle East interests because we have been effective in causing them a lot of problems with sanctions and and carrots work to isolate them\nAnd are you talking about about about sanctions against the Iranians are against the out at the Iranians Iranians\nAlright ... again or if we are to assume that this took place on Saudi property that is to say a Saudi consulate in Turkey\nAh it's hard to imagine how the Iranians could have been involved in activities on on that property I mean the last person who could get into a Saudi consulate undetected would be an Iranian\nI'm I'm not suggesting that Iranian people went in I think they've identified the the ...\nWell they went in you know\nIt just a large extent\nI'm suggesting that the Iranians may have had some sort of hand and facilitating that being done encouraging it to be done paying for it to be done I I don't know I just know that they re Iran does benefit apparently from sowing discord and likes to\nWell yes they would benefit from sowing discord but I mean it is bad enough to do things with such an action could take place inside a Saudi consulate there suggested it could be done\nA ... by a sworn enemy of the Saudi regime the Iranians would go far beyond any level of incompetence imaginable I mean [laughter] yeah\nWell it may be right\nOr they get the Saudis and the Iranians detest each other and and how you would arrange as as the as a rod for such an action to take place in side a Saudi consulate uh I mean if they could pull that off\nA that would be ah the ah the double cross of

consider myself a really delicate for that but you know what I heard on Wisconsin Public radio I listen to public radio a lot of it they were talking about George Washington when he became president he did not want to ... them and I just think to myself\nWhat a shame they take it out because\nYou know if it if you got people that I don't care who's name it they're whatever letter or named up the base it on that and that way I see it we don't need any ... other white\nUp but on that cap it off or whatever something happened at a port woman and I can't imagine a traumatic experience like that but that to me it's not if you're right here in the fact that Obama when he killed somebody for the oil we got to wait till after the election\nOut issue it on the other for how to get an ordeal that\nWell you've covered a number of the issues of the day but I'm not sure this directly relates to uh the topic at hand I Would just make one vote before it deferring to Dr Creighton\nOr it was very naive of George Washington or anybody else to suggest that there would not be factions factions are almost proof that we have a free government if you have a genuinely free society you will have differences of opinion\nAnd like minded people will get together and organize to try and convince others of their point of view it as an essential part of society now can faction lives will be carried do far well yes it certainly can and perhaps we're seeing a manifestation of that\nWith the notion that you can have a free society without different factions is an impossibility and by the effort to Dr Creighton\nI Would have to agree with you entirely about that I think there's a psychological motivation ultimately for\n... can unify groups to ultimately break down into smaller divisions so I I think there's no way of avoiding connections or what you do want to avoid as you mentioned is uh the extremes of polarity between two factions so that there's no workable solution to the system\nAnd we'll come back and explore some of that here in a moment but the writing a call from Steve in Chatham county North Carolina good evening Steve\nLoon earns always enjoy your show through shake your says thank you ... ... when it gets to a point when you go to a restaurant or or you Bill out and then\nOn I ...

I think that the this was happening because we've had people who systematically taught this and they've created a a a generation if you will of disruption now that's just my view what's yours\n[noise] uh once again I think we're in complete agreement um I I think the greatest problem that the United states faces and maybe the entire world at this point is what's going on at the center of higher education uh\nThere's always been a kind of liberal ... each other to most to universities are in the country so that's not unusual but it's no longer liberalism as as we do it's a fifty years ago [noise] uh this is now a radical leftists the gender\nA which is\nWhich fails really to educate so that the curriculum and many of these\nInstitutions no longer includes the the bases the basic western canon that's critical of the ... of a a democratic uh society\nAnd instead it's been replaced by ...\nA racial and feminist studies\nOr all of these things which again a indoctrinate or the young people into a mindset and they really no no no better\nThey knew very little about the history of this country\nAre and what they do know is largely inaccurate and distorted and propaganda rather than factual so what what people are learning in the schools now\nAre not really the types of facts that one needs to learn in order to again maintain a democratic society they're learning propaganda and unless we somehow approved what's going on in the schools\nAre these are some of our best schools unless we do something about it I I think we're we're going to be facing a generation coming up that's going to be truly problematic\nNow than in that regard at private institutions it is difficult to have a lot of influence although I Would suggest\nThat a federal aid and in many cases of many many of such institutions receive a lot of federal even Harvard which is in doubt like a a Gulf Oil shake dumb even Harvard gets lots of federal aid and that that aid could be withheld\nBut a lot of this is happening at state institutions were talking about the faculty the job paid for by state tax dollars and for the life of me I Do not see why\nThese universally deans ... presidents were not call before the state assembly education committees and read the riot act that they want one penny but their institution then there will be the following changes including personnel changes and in fact if necessary at take ten year at and toss it in the trash can\nOr the the idea that this happens is bad enough but Dr grade and but that it happens on the tax payers die is beyond intolerable its its tragically comical\nWell I think all your points are well taken is certainly at the state schools\nUh there should be ... state and I think the curriculum and the people teaching at the schools need to be closely examined\nUh but the same is true for the private schools as you mentioned I I was offered a ... the schools are not really private in the true sense that have tremendous amounts of federal dollars pouring into that and I think they really need to be\nTo find a and certainly needs to be more influence on a lot of states are as to what's being taught and who is teaching in the schools because really they just are ruining society\nWhat eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six our number\nA in regard to the the whole notion of a of I'm virtuous therefore I should get a pass on the the rules of society or there's a portion of your book out of control here on page one hundred and fifty for\nA title hypocrisy\nAnd you're right it is easy to maintain once opinion of oneself as a quote good unquote person if one's own flaws are kept at a distance could you amplify on that thought just a bit\n[noise] Oh yes uh I think that's one of the greatest ... that were encountering now could you actually ... on the left or most of us like to be thought of as as nice people we'd like to be liked by a fellow man or however you know there is a certain degree of honesty and\nIntrospection that's required or if one completely aggregates any possibility of being less than a morally virtuous individual than what one sees psychologically is again this phenomenon or projection\nA so that one's denied\nIt or maybe less than perfect traits get projected onto everybody else in order to protect one's self image\nAnd so I think this is what we're seeing in large measure in some aspects of the left you know they see themselves as or at least superior early\nA virtuous individuals and they see anyone who doesn't agree with them as being a either evil or failing in some a moral a way\nAnd uh it's probably not in a way of being in the world\nWell it certainly is who says this type of conflict\nYeah uh I I again I I suppose that I'm hardly unique in thinking that uh that my viewpoints are correct\nOr they are my viewpoints that I've arrived that been by whatever thought processes involved and I would like to think that it as a rational analysis of\nOf evidence and arguments that that reflect the the circumstances in the world but for whatever reason yes I like everybody else would tend to agree with my viewpoint so it's almost a a a ... uh uh it it it naturally follows however\nI have never been so enamored of my viewpoint that I Would suggest that a I must be right and therefore everybody else who disagrees with we must be wrong\nOr nor be that no matter how right I may be that it's somehow gives me a pass on the rules of society that that is the level of arrogance that escapes me even on issues where I'm\nVery confident that my viewpoint is correct I I just it's it's the attitude that goes with the viewpoint that escapes me\nWell we we've done a very poor job over the last generation or two at raising children or children have been raised with this concept of preserving self esteem or with the concept of self esteem is based on never criticizing number correcting\nAn individual and this carries on into the educational system so you've ... you've got ... now or at least one maybe one generation\nThat's really able to look at it so critically a as a result they they have to preserve this concept of perfection and anything less than that it is not even within this fear of consideration\nAs as we go to a break and then we'll come back with some calls but I have to ask you\nIs this a terminal condition that has to say are these people beyond redemption is it impossible\nTo ever a inject them if you will with a note of rationality or have they been so ... into this notion that my self esteem isn't violet that they will for the balance of their lives which in some cases maybe fifty sixty Seventy years\nCease to be affected members of our society\nA well if if you want an honest answer I certainly do yes uh I think no is this is a clinical level is a very difficult thing to treat and I think that's what we're talking about around and so I ... the\nThe prognosis for this generation is not good well and in fact most of the society is not good as a\nResult oh it certainly isn't well honest answers are exactly what we need right now will come back and talk some
