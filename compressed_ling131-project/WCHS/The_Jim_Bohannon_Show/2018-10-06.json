rushing by that\nBack in the pants landed up being a fifty one Eighteen but Fred I got to tell you I have never seen there was nine penalties by Tyler Seventy five yards ... team by way it's done and they still score fifty one point\nI'll hang on a second let me bring Greg ... news of course the voice of Tyler concern\nWas right next to me yeah and I encourage or as David Was saying it's\nLot of penalties in his ballgame buddy\nIt was a silver nights were guilty of that law early on the season richer county they fell victim to that and they also fell victim a daughter and she county they they put up a lot more ... should have but those games with work county a and also even last week with Webster county I was very impressed on how well they kept their composure\nA deep sense has been the question all season long for Tyler consolidated approved it tonight Williamstown was just a much more prepared team I'm going to say it Williamstown I feel they keep this going they're going to be the most prepared teen going into the playoffs\nWhereas yet really central who was the most talented team\nAnd I felt that was going on I I feel they just proved that tonight as silver and I still have playoff hopes alive but you know there's penalties are not going to help you for one game to the next and one thing that surprised me about Williams towns there's a lot of off sites buildings on often so recalled against them yeah there was not right you're right\nYeah coach Smith was not happy with that at all tonight when we talk to him after the game and\nHe said we need to work on that and you know it was very laid back about he was happy to get the win but you know coach Smith is never happy\n[laughter] that's one of the students are he's never happen again you got the interview interview after every game and it's always interesting trust me I I I'll let you guys you guys can continue this sounds like [laughter] a great job of both of you called an okay I read and I go out\nThere you go to the correct that and then David Hall I\nKnew I felt like to join the conversation I think I did you know a Chris Lawrence joins\nMe now the polka dots and the wind field generals a poker pretty good onto buddy\nYeah they are they are um they got a lot of talent career than it is it John Bruce tonight but I got to give a lot of credit to the wind field generals like a man with a pretty good game plan and defensively Winfield got a pretty tough outfit because at half time it was only fourteen to seven and it\nVery easily could have been fourteen to seven or the other way or the second poker touchdown came after\nA for a fourth down the interference call that put them in position to get their second touchdown ... fourteen developing credit Winfield do considering kick off they drove with the length of the field and scored\nAnd there were three minutes to go in the first half they picked off the first ... ... the play a first player that next series they picked it up drove the link to the field and have the play has the parents in the hands of the receiver to score entire ball fell on the ground though and\nHad to go and fourteen to seven second half though poker just started to exert its muscle and basically just war Winfield down they did the best they could but uh you know they had a score here in school were there and after that it's a pretty much\nJust more of the generals down poker goes on to seven an over the thirty three the fourteen when over Winfield here this evening a for the dogs Ethan pain carry the load he had twenty Jerry's traumatic for yards three touchdowns on the night on the planet ... had nine\nCarries a hundred and two yards and to see these for the gods\nHowever late in the game he left with an injury and did not return and it was something involving his hip so these are these quieter he's quite a feature in this office were bogus you certainly hope that it's not anything serious in that are here to be back next a next year\nFor a for wind field John covert was their big man I'm an IT at twenty three carries for Ninety two yards and one touch down for the general so the final score again here it Winfield poker winds that thirty three fourteen\nOr Chris always a good job but appreciate it thank you sir are man there you go traveling\nTo the eastern panhandle the night job or condo and a joke a game and I were talking in it and I got to listen to a lot of the game when I was preparing for gain night uh I don't think the ... she ran do Virginia game was near as close as the final score\nNo laws and uh it was a ... thirty one game when Martin or a touchdown or early in the fourth quarter then five and a half and he goes right into spores that you thirty eight and then it slow it\nUnder ten seconds left regulation to make sure that you know forty five ... recovers the onsite chicken that was that so like you say that they get a little bit interesting late but for the most part\nThe second half was pretty well a secure by Martin Bert ... Nineteen early in the fourth quarter and that pretty much put it out of reach\nAnd they do that without a ... or send out the game with a foot injury has some short so a Martin's Berg again as we've been saying most of the season I still think they are the team to beat until someone beats them\nA question about it the other when stirring up to thirty five you mentioned the or the injury to weigh in Grantham head coach they walk or said after the game it was just something that happened on the weight back from a they're in a couple of weeks ago at academy park Pennsylvania um and he is optimistic that he may get back into line up soon but there's a there's no guarantee that but\nThat really hurt the tigers and then the body language sometimes you know when you're oh and five or six now you know you get one thing going wrong and you feel like\nThe horses just collapsing on you but uh some individual performance tonight\nAs an individual performances tonight for print and that really stood out countering Kennedy tend catches a hundred and Ninety eight yard he scored a touchdown than\nI Am trying to confirm if that's an individual uh school record for receiving yards and again I think it's got to be pretty close at least to have that many receiving yards and a game and then ... the quarterback grandson Graham\nHe three for two hundred and fifty to your to third straight game was at least two hundred yards passing through three touchdowns owned the night so some often so stand out tonight for Princeton but the same results there wasn't there\nFor the tigers as they fought a oh insects with that for you to Eighteen lost and [noise]\nAll right you get three of your last for at home that's that's a plus you get a James Monroe ball club coming to your place next week that's that's a good rhyming game but uh uh both teams struggling should be pretty good ball game next week\nYeah I think James and I was in ... a little bit from where they were earlier in the season I actually have watched the mavericks live this year I'll watch them play a back and we are I guess it was weak for a watch them play\nAgainst like if you live and I I think next week is you know I'm not going to say it's a for sure women I think it's an opportunity for friends in the navy it on the board next week it's going to be home coming into hunting kept stadium print than his travel\nSo many miles these last five weeks spread I mean I I think I counted up last week I'm going to that grand game for instead of travel like seven hundred and ... miles\nDuring the last minute Parkersburg south trip so you attack on a you know another a hundred and thirty or so miles tonight or a hundred and thirty miles hundred and twenty miles whatever it is from Princeton directly and you know these tigers are road weary so hopefully they'll be energized next week\nThey try to get that win over Jamestown wrote back\nOn it got stadium and emotionally travels who came yeah\nThank you for and we got the planners at one of those states coming into the Callahan stadium in like fourteen hours\n[laughter] yeah you gotta love late Friday nights and Saturday afternoon kicks don't you\nAnd the Fred said some of us think about it yet thank you take care\nUh-huh saint Peter joins me now St Mary's and weren't counting\nThat's right it was homecoming at St Mary's tonight Fred and the blue devil sent the alumni I'm happy with a forty three to nothing shot out when a over the tigers the blue devil scored in every quarter\nIt was a slate Amos a couple of touchdowns in the first half of thirty four yard a run after a lateral a halfway through the first quarter\nAnd his second touchdown came a with less than a minute to go in the first half of fifty yard a touchdown pass a caught it in the flat in Iran at\nForty hours and hours sandwiched around a couple of joy Sanchez us feel goes that was twenty to nothing at the half St Mary's\nA they tend to work county inside the one on a beautiful Jason Clayton ... gun safety on the next play and ah then Williams still got in on the scoring party scoring on touchdown runs on thirty six and a Twenty one yards and Jacob moist\nRounding things out with the one yard or after a St Mary's blocked a pond and recovered at the tiger one yard line uh overall for\nSt Mary's two hundred and four yards rushing on the ground that was there a best night of the season so far they were led by steel with three carries Seventy five yards and those two touchdowns who's followed by quarterback Brennan bore on\nA seven carry sixty six charge for on also a sixty eight yards passing that one touchdown pass and a slate Amos as mentioned fifty nine years\nRight now which is kind of an certain which may be a ... a verb or something like that we're not we're not even sure what did you happen to have the cat in the court Jay and I'm going to be okay but we want to make sure that he's completely healthy healthy before he comes back\nTalking with Martin ... head football coach Dave Walker has bulldogs are seven and do some kind of give me the handicapped theory one thirty five straight going into Hedges bill next week you're stepping into you win again tonight ... where does the head coach think is Martin ... teams that are about three fourths of the way through the regular season\nI still give us maybe a a good solid be\nAble to map a scale\nBack a lot of mistakes and it's still need to clean things up but uh I'm really proud proud of the way our guys face adversity and they overcome and they play hard and in the ... to quit and you know we're we're maybe not as talented as we advantage certain areas but in certain areas were really good so\nYou know it's a good mix of kids and we've had some good step up to that you know every year you have so much that if you don't expect to and we had we certainly had that issue here and and I'm just proud of the effort that we're getting from\nThey all have known him for a long time and I know it's not about the records it's not about anything like that it's about the kids in your team and I get that but\nI mean you've now one thirty five in a row the

were sexually assaulted I have no problem with that\nI Hope that if we do learn that we also learned that while it is All right if you had been sexually assaulted\nTo suffer lapses of memory perhaps or you're trying to block of very unpleasant circumstance from your mind and that's fine I tend to uh I Would tend to be very sympathetic in that regard but\nBut if you go down the road further to making accusations against somebody else than you'd better have the goods to back it up otherwise there's no reason to hear from you and if in fact you really feel like that there is something that happened to you that deserves justice\nThan it is incumbent upon you to sit down and force yourself to write down details and had been on the night of such and such it happened at such and such a location such and such people were in the room name them give times anything that you possibly can and write them down if you're going to try to make a case out of something\nThen you need the ammunition to make such a charge credible a and I think we've seen a classic example of how not to do that and again I have not been there I'm sure there may be all kinds of reasons why one would tend to block something from your mind but if your blood from your mind\nThan you'd better just leave it as a bad memory because you haven't robbed yourself of the very weapons you need to make it into a a federal case if you will in this case literally so one eight six six five oh jumbo when eight six six five oh five or six to six we go to Mike who is in western Maryland denied good evening Mike\nHey Jim thanks for taking my call yes or\nWho you were talking about death row inmates and dementia at ours my immediate reaction was we would not have that problem if we put in extra and an express lane which is similar to what they have in Texas it seems like the death row population is the longest lived segment of the population\nI Would argue that they're keeping people on death row for decades the Internet itself a form of cruel and unusual punishment and I agree with you there should be a basis for some appeal but you and I both know that passed a couple of appeals\nAnd passed a couple or three years a sitting up there everything that follows the nothing more than stupid lawyer tricks\nOh let me ask you a question in that ever sat down and had a drink with someone at that time on death row\nNo I to my knowledge I have never even interviewed a person who had done time\nI have a neighbor that I have a neighbor lives right around the corner of the two years at Pennsylvania prison he was convicted of felony DUI style one was hurt badly not killed\nHe did two years in prison and when he first ... the only place that role for him for a sale on death row\nHe told me the story that context there\nThey were to ask what state how many\nThat's all they would say meaning how many did you kill a Mockingbird reply [laughter] and kill anybody on air for drunk driving they just laugh at him\nWhile uh that that that's interesting that that uh that they would put someone on quote death row unquote or who was not a up to be executed I I've never heard of that before\nThat's that's the only place like first entered that parental ... wow\nThat's a that is bizarre a an idiot and he is out now or what was his thought I'm curious to before we move on I'm I'm curious as to his thoughts regarding the attitudes of those he knew on death row where they uh resigned to their fates\nWere they a morose and the depressed or how did he describes his fellow inmates the ones who were supposed to be on death row\nWill now we really did not discuss that but the next time I have a beer with al ... will talk about that\nYeah you can report back in I I appreciate that very much Mike into thank you that that's an interesting situation that the people in my line of work are always looking of course for interesting people do to talk to\nSomebody was on death row because they had no place else to put them that's a that's bizarre one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six and um\nThis will put a assuming that it all goes as it apparently will this would mean that Brett Kavanaugh will have missed a week of the new term or a week and I'm not sure what all that includes the arguments that may have been hurt I don't I don't know what the schedule has been for the quote past week unquote\nUh but I Would uh swimming has been getting ready for example clerks and the like uh obviously wasn't in in a position to hire anybody my guess is he has talked to any number of people and said if this goes through I may need you to hit the deck running\nMy guess would be not only will he be sworn in quickly but he will have a symbol of what might be considered a shadow staff that is to say I'll need you pretty fast if this goes through\nA so I'm thinking that you'll be hitting the deck running to be wrong\nBut that's my guess one eight six six five oh jumbo

gas chamber except instead of using lethal yes cyanide they hit you can't use a non lethal gas that does not support\nIn other words what do you simply simply suffocating people to death\nNow they're putting nitrogen into the gas chamber and since we were you get your joke and gas bought you just won't last asleep and your brain shuts down at all the system shut down and eventually don't wake up\nA that's a curious I I I wasn't aware that did that in fact you would go to sleep you would of course if you were breathing pure nitrogen\nAnd yes the air we breathe is about Seventy nine percent nitrogen now that's very true but without any oxygen in that atmosphere I Would have to think that far from just going to sleep that you would tend to go [laughter]\nAnd eventually I Would think rather painfully you would suffocate I could be wrong but uh\nI I don't know that would be interesting to know which state it was\nI can recall that issue it had to do with the fact that there were a couple of days that refused to sell the chemical to this day because they were they were anti death penalty I I Want to say Florida but I don't think that you write in any of it I made a statement\nAnd they were saying because chemical during being misused by state\nYeah so I mean I mean we are so ridiculous on the subject I mean the idea that you have to swab the arm of those about to be executed I mean ... we were afraid they're going to get an infection I think not\n[laughter] uh but uh yeah I certainly see what you're saying that that's interesting I don't know exactly what would happen if you breathe only nitrogen my guess would be\nThat it wouldn't be as painless as a perhaps describe but in any case ah thanks for the call arch you would go to dawn and Kalispell, Montana [noise] ah good evening done and welcome\nAnd thank you for taking my call sure and I mean there's some people say go back to the ... well forever hanging yes we can only I'm about Twenty

again you know who cares would have to be my ... but but I was the reaction OK you chose to to try and eat your way out of the problem well guess what you're about to lose your head that would be my answer and the ...\nYeah 'cause they did it and say oh it'll be painful when you put the chemical in ... I don't think they cared about painful and they killed somebody\nI don't think they did either\nYou know I think it should be done and over with and not forty years on death row well\nAbsolutely again I argue that that all that time on death row in and of itself is cruel and unusual and I that that's how I see at the dawn thank you for your thoughts\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six Brett Kavanaugh\nIs just on the verge\nOf getting a new job to Steve in ... North Carolina good evening\nHey let's sham vote 'em cannot go back to the government a hub hub debate last night care no I don't care going\nUp ... ... ... ... ... is in some other pretty recognizable people or ... or a button and a little mutt for the is it article five the convention in states\nThe well the article five convention of states movement is under way I've spoken to people from that uh I Would have brought it up but I was unaware that Mike Huckabee was involved in the movement\nYeah the the petition ...\nYeah you're that's a that's the move but we're talking about yes yeah invoke article five of the U.S constitution to call a constitutional convention yes or ... or anything I didn't know about was that Mike Huckabee was involved though it sounds like something with which you would be involved\nYes I Know ah I just wonder uh I kind of wander ... it it's about you about it and it could be something that you would be willing to participate with\nWe've we've had on people from the movement now on at least two maybe three occasions I support the notion wholeheartedly and maybe it's time we had someone else on so yeah\nAnd the main reason I Would just notes that you brought it up Steve\nMany of the amendments that we need would never get through Congress and that's the way that all twenty seven amendments that we've adopted have been done with the two thirds vote of each house of Congress\nBut when you're talking about amendments that would say Congress may pass no law that applies to the public doesn't equally apply to Congress or that no budget\nFrom Congress no pay for members of Congress or term limits these are all proposal ... would never get past even a simple majority of Congress much less two thirds of Mets why\nA lot of the things that need to be done which directly involve the uh the U.S Congress will have to go through such a a constitutional convention there's no other way they can be adopted\nAlso yeah you're right if it if the government shuts down\nPay shuts down that's what happens to us folks out here in in the real world um you your job closes for weight you don't get paid full week so I think that would that work at a stop a lot of\nA government shutdown and budget speech allow it they need their salaries what's involved also\nAnd it it needs to be coupled with a a balanced budget amendment with teeth in it so in other words we are forced to do something this country just dearly hates to do and that is make choices\nI mean we make twice was all the time we make choices all the time when we're dealing with our
