conference play and up next of course on Saturday November the third\nSo ready November hopefully on November bird\nWest Virginia will travel down to Austin battle the Texas Longhorn but before that Texas has a big game coming up Saturday against Oklahoma State than again interesting to see who will be\nStarting quarterback for the Texas Longhorns because only gr a much different player when he's in the game it's much different game Jeff Jenkins for the Texas Longhorn\nNo it is Fred and uh you know it's going to I'm I'm intrigued early here by the matchup between the longhorns defense in the west Virginia and it's right and uh we're kind of play you get from West Virginia means of law and the early we can call this bread in and day that that'll be a key [laughter] that'd be a key to the game right oh question fence of line play ...\nYou know the one thing I was thinking about just looking at it to the Texas game though that this game as over\nBaylor's wide receivers tonight we're just not that impressive at all um you know I think there are wide receivers only had maybe one total catch in the first half now they're going to get into it when they go to Austin that's going to be a big challenge for West Virginia secondary when they go against big physical wide receivers like colon Johnson and\nJordan Humphrey of Texas that's a whole other conversation I was going to be big\nMatch it is but you know what you go back to this Baylor team that you just start tonight not stop anybody they held Texas in check when that shameful shells and a quarter back as they were putting eleven guys or older guys on the defensive side within eight yards of the ball a bunch in the second half so that's a Texas team totally different if you get ...\nYeah ... was really ready to play I mean he had played one snapped there's going to that game that season so he threw a cup on the ground in the cup overthrows and they drop the cup on things just weren't going their way for a long time but they're still good enough to win\nLet's go back to the phones run that fill in Winfield calling in so go ahead buddy\nHey guys how are you doing doing well sir where a lot better and last time and yeah a whole lot better\nWell I'm anxious to hear what you guys are still great the off into a lot and maybe see that I think our defense of wind stepped up to maybe a B plus what are you guys think\nMan I don't know I think you got to give them a better grade than that I mean the average and almost appointed minutes a night\nYeah but I'm ... yeah go ahead bill\nWell I'm just thinking Baylor just kind of I don't I honestly after they our state game what the heck was Baylor game tonight\nAnd they should and they learn anything from watching our state because they didn't really do anything that our state did defensively\nExactly exactly\nYeah I think the jury's still out on the ... and I and I think I think the defense has played well and and and Steve you defensive coach they seemingly get better\nYeah you know the difference between last year this year as we have more bodies on the defensive line he's wrong you know I think at least five or six guys in there so we keep a lot of fresh guys and that will pay off it toward the end of the season I Hope\nAs a put everybody in the box and go to replace single there's no way to get around it you have a running quarterback you're playing thing on the water\nAnd you you talk about defense that's going to be a big big\n... absolutely and I think we'll see pits back next week that seemed to be what hope is that before the game tonight he thinks that pits open about\nNow I Wish we joke we get some are linebackers back especially some of the big ones when we got three or four guys or two hundred and thirty pound range of haven't played\nNo ferns and walls are those guys and there's talk there was talk in the in the pre season that both could be ready as you start to enter November So that is something to keep an eye on over the next few weeks\nI think that will be the biggest a question mark going into into Texas because they're going to get not heavy package in West Virginia is already kind of\nJust light and in my on their second level so I can be the pretext to to get into those heavy packages and just try to out physical West Virginia for some you know to to basically come up to ... scrimmage and place them in a physical football so we'll see how that all plays out but\nThose heavy packages can be hard for West Virginia to try to match up against\n... you know taught her landers defense coordinator Texas He came from Connecticut and he was they were very very good defense in Connecticut and he's the same God's bringing a lot of pressure and getting after people pretty good their defenses almost done it three sixty since he's been there\nIt was good to see ... back into the line up tonight in place of the ... bits and he did pick up one of those three interruptions how you you you get a play maker\nIn their last best ... as the defensive coach defensive coordinator that's all you can ask for and ah I said before I think those defensive backs for West Virginia has been playing very good very athletic and um that's ... you need to count on guys who you're not expecting to to step up and they play so\nYou figure guys that are going to get so little tackles and you know David long junior of course in in ... the leading so we'll tackle tonight\nLooking Bailey I thought a keen played extremely well tonight\nAlso had that forced fumble but when that Bailey that jump in there and put his helmet on the ... it was the again good playing the defense of late tonight by the mountain ears and uh uh that that's what we have to keep on doing there's no question about that All right let's get you caught up on the traffic situation Kevin Nicholas is still high in the sky neck what's going on buddy\nWell just got a good look read at the uh sixty eight I Seventy nine

but everything was formation in the boundary trips they they thought what they can do is keep us in a certain from coverage\nYeah so we couldn't pressure and we fix that after the first series how
