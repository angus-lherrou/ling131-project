on top of the stage [noise]\nBut I tell you what I mean they are a group [noise] as to gather\nYeah what a season they put together a hundred and eight regular season when they were the best sports all season long record wise [noise]\nThey had the top ... in the game [noise]\nAnd that ability to make Todd jak while still getting on base and scoring it at a really high level\nBut that also delivering the power that's one of the biggest things that made them stand out and it's interesting I mean look the pitching was great and I think\nYou'll get a chance to do that Yankee series and Red Sox fans of the media were so scared of the bullpen and show worried about going forward if the bullpen certainly answered questions but also the thing that was underlined is the fact that this could really score\nAnd they were able to do that even without their big boppers in bats in martini as you know doing a whole lot in this World Series but they came through the night in a couple of knocks not really made it after the to run home run the top of the first we didn't know that would stand up\nAnd be enough to beat the Dodgers especially when Friese answer in the bottom of the first the solo shot leading off the ball game\nBut a very talented club they know how to score the score just ridiculous rate with two well yep\nHere in this series we tough time\nTo get it done but that's when they were able to string or a\nString along a whole lot of hits\nThe Dodgers on the flip side and they lost and they seem to be really overshadowed by how good the red Sox were in this World Series both but I mean the Dodgers they had a good season a really good season when you consider from Turner to secret occur saw the injuries that they had\nThey Roberts I thought that a nice job\nLet's go downstairs the manager of the world champion Boston Red Sox here's Alex correspond to draw the\nAnalogy standing here with a trophy with his daughter\nHow cool is this for you [noise]\n\nDo you work for the\nI don't have words you know I'm I'm I'm In shock honestly um wherever consistent from the get go when spring training with an outstanding job to prepare for this there was a plan in place which took care of the pitchers and then we were able to just go in October and this is a result\nYou get the Trump championship trophy come off the stage your daughter's here in tears to make it feel when you saw\n... she's\nA she's among the person in my life\nOh I'm very proud of her\nShe uh she lives on the bench a it's kind of like they weren't turning a sea bass is that patients is an outstanding woman\nI suppose your front of that but I'm I'm proud of our in our life is not perfect but she she makes our life forever\nI Love her Alex how do you feel about how your claim responded to you this\nTheory is that first of all\nThey're very good they bought into the concept that an outstanding job throughout the season to get into the weather\nThan I Am so happy for him\nNot only as a manager but as a person a lot of people out of him but it came out on top I'm so proud of data and vent about her back to you guys\nI bust or Alex thank you so much obviously very heartfelt right they're standing at his daughter's side\nAnd holding the world championship trophy and steep here's the world series MVP\nAnd what a job that he did and again you're talking about ... home runs you this one the whole world last like the big double last night Mitt effectively these last two games on the road ... here's what was the one that did it\nYeah and and just mean a solid guy to have on the team quiet leader quality that does the job at first base ready to go every single day and\nYeah I mean it's it's pretty special when you look at the different guys that contributed to\nThe red Sox in getting the postseason but doing all the way it'd be in the last team standing just just outstanding I mean this is going to be one of those qualities that even for guys that were here both just maybe half the year that they'll look back and probably say that was the best season of my life the group of guys that they were Marta\nDownstairs Jackie Bradley junior with buster all the Jackie your World Series champion\nHow does that sound sounds the best um this is the best feeling this is what we worked for from day one and the accomplish that goal\nDescribed out this team came together during the course of the air seemingly altogether during this World Series\nWe had a very telling the ball club\nI'm starting out the season when it started off real\nHot and you know who knows how you know how we would get throughout the year and then we have fires pieces there are like those puzzle pieces those last few puzzle pieces when you're you're trying to figure out how to make that perfect puzzle and you know\nSteve in may and all\nThe guys that we picked up\nThe mess that puzzle and we were finally able to complete that public tonight\n... home runs tonight\nWhat'd you say in him [noise] amazing amazing\nA moment\nWhen a tremendous performance and I'm I'm so happy and glad he's getting rewarded\nAlex for was in tears just after you got the trophy presentation\nImportant was hey do you guys this year\nThe best the best came right in [noise] had a plan knew what he wanted to do\nInterested in and anytime you have that type of you know trust in one another no good things are bound to happen Jackie thanks congratulations\nTo you guys I bust their Jackie thanks so much Red Sox what it\nWas so you'd be alluded to the idea that a Boston Red Sox are teams would appear on our hair a lot\nSo we were certainly familiar with this group and\nI think it you know very times during the year when you watch\nA lot of other teams we certainly had an idea that this team was separated from most of the other teams that we got a chance to look at consistently you ought to me that we would watch them play and say okay that seems a lot better than just about everyone else very balanced\nSeemingly no holes and again the one thing that was somewhat of a question mark was the bullpen and you know the Houston Astros really were the team they were\nIn my opinion considered the favorites to defend their title\nAnd when another world series but you credit I mean the red Sox beat the Yankees Yankee easily could have been in the world series I mean talent wise they could be here\nAnd they beat the Astros without question they could be in the world series they could have won the world series this year just like the Yankees but the red Sox had to be probably the two best teams in the postseason field to get to this point to play the Dodgers\nSwearing in a high fly ball [noise]\n\nAre dirty boy brought you buy audible audio books listening on any device your first one is free at audible dot com back to a slumping busters lumping no more\nYeah and that that represents bookshop in that situation was before the game when we met with Alice score he said he thought ... would have a big game look look he bets going into that it that had been open Thirteen his longest Hitler streak of this season\nSo for ... home run hit allowed in an elimination game and his career he came out to pitch the seven and was facing JD Martinez so one one [noise]\nSwearing in a high fly ball well struck center field Hernandez attract [noise]\nMarch [noise]\nAdd another\nMake that aid home runs ... shows allowed buster ... elimination games in third tonight\nYeah as with Mickey bet you could just see the JD Martina she would struggle against three and four was starting to get his swing back and when that ball cleared the centerfield wall and explosion in the red Sox dug out with their lead continue to be patted\nYeah four to one and David Price came to hit for himself with two outs in the seventh inning against Kurdish grounded out so price was still in the ballgame pitching in the ... got Machado on a lighter got max max Muncie on a fly ball to left field then facing yes we are getting it done play the game and a bit [noise]\nSwinging slow roller back to the local in front of them out by price\nDavid Rice gets are going to breed he has tremendous\nParents should I write down the last four and a wrong\nOr getting it done play the game ... by Granger rangers got your back when it comes to the safety in industrial supplies they keep your facility running get what you need one you needed at Granger dot com and David Price was more than spectacular probably buster more than even Alex Cora could have hoped for and wish board game by\nOh boy he was terrific and looked steep ears won the MVP it a great choice I Would have voted for David Rice you think about his work in this series game to he wins game three the epic Eighteen and again he pitches in relief came pouring warmed up twice and then he comes out in game five shuts down the Dodgers\nSo for one price wasn't done yet but ... show was as we go to the Boston aids Pedro buyers up and that man Steve Pearce at the plate\nHere's one for three with the whole reveal more\nSwaying in a high fly ball\nWas the other to [noise]\n\nFor the red Sox\nDaily to five\nComedy\nAnd buster only how about his last six that batch of this World Series three ... and a three run double his third or run of the world series right there\nWrite a game dying home run and gave Baugher which propelled the red Sox who that incredible victory and then starting off game by the way that he did think about Steve beers in his career twelve years in the big league all kinds of injuries bouncing from team to team and he has these moments in this World Series very cool\nThe Paris tennis player to have a multi Homer game and the potential World Series clincher eight or the other night or in the hall of fame the knife is Kirk Gibson and molest red socks to do it in the world series Rico Petra silly game six of the sixty seven World Series we told your price wasn't done he came out to start the eighth inning walk to lead off bad joke Kelly came in\nStruck out the three batters he based Christian Bale it was originally scheduled to start game by would come out to pitch the ninth got Turner got Hernandez and then facing ...\nSam again look said he's ready to turn catch fire [noise]\n\n\n\n\nA hundred eight wins in the regular year buster a hundred Nineteen overall\nThe question marks were David Price he answered that and the bullpen and tonight it was joke Kelly striking out the side and Chris sales striking out the side\nAnd Chris halo I really think established the culture for the red Sox in this post season at the beginning of October he told reporters look I'm going to give what I have and we saw in those first game Heathrow in eighty nine Ninety Ninety One clearly diminished I add players on the Yankees an asterisk telling me he looks like he's pitching hurt\nBut he was grinding through\nAnd it seemed like if the postseason went along all the other starting pitchers fell in line behind stale\nDoing everything that they possibly could whether it was David Price working out of the bullpen Nathan a balding was remarkable work in this series Rick pour cello and Chris Sale getting that opportunity to close out the world series Alex score had told us before the game he was dying to participate and he was beckoning him\nDuring the uh Eighteen and game in game three to get in there even is positioned player so you can imagine how much juice there was for sale\nThis thing on him he unloaded and do not about the red Sox ... say fourth title in the last Fifteen Years all those since the eighties six year drought as their FIRST Championship since twenty Thirteen Boston wins that five to one in five games mark asked this year buster only baseball tonight post game show on the other end of the spectrum the Dodgers now\nBack to back losses in the world series last at home in seven games last year they lose it home and five this year the manager David Roberts with the media at Dodger Stadium\nWhat'd you see from Clayton tonight [noise]\nI I thought um I probably had really good stuff I did I thought he was\nMixing the fastball to different ... I thought he competed like you always does up a slight is good I put the breaking ball was good there were a couple of mistakes in their uh with the fastball\nPeers J. D. the ball that just didn't get there and um the mood you sweat are just sitting there and that's a good club over a very good club a gray club so when it did make a mistake they hit the ballpark and\nYou've got to give credit to David Price over there 'cause a heck of a ballgame couldn't put his together couldn't get base runners and and really stress the middle so um\nIt was pretty straightforward but I Can't say enough about you know what ... what our guys did and unfortunately I'm we came up short again this year\nAre you what can you say just to sum up your club this year you know all year you've kind of gone up to the edge and always come back from it and you know finally just uh you know ran up against the really good team\nWell I I Can't say I'm enough about our our book club\nThe fight the compete you know all year when we're not it didn't look so good\nOur guys start together stay the course and believed to one another and um put ourselves in a chance to win a championship and that's not easy to do to get to the world series were two teams are playing at the end it's very difficult there's a lot of hard work that that comes with it a lot of sacrifice and you've got to have good players\nWe did that this year a bachelor against the law numerous times and there were markers and points where we could have went the other way but we found ways when baseball games and\nRan up against a very good ball club just a little bit too much force\nI Know you'll be I'm discussing this with the front office over the coming months but just a from your from your got where do you believe this team needs to improve in order to win the world series and it it has a specific areas\nNo um no I I think that that's something that we're gonna have a lot of time to kind of thing through it and\nNot everyone's going to be back so uh you know when you're talking about back filling it and how things go so right now to kind of figure out where we need to go that that's a tough one um we have a lot of time for that like I said our guys in the front office to a heck of a job to put us in a position to uh get the players\nWill get over the ... it's not easy it hurts is disappointing all that\nTo say we didn't want a championship and to say was an unsuccessful season I think that's uh doing a disservice to everyone in the clubhouse\nThere's day Roberts in the interview room out at Dodger Stadium a buster only it's back to back World Series losses indeed they are the national champs a for the last two years so they fall one wrong short again what do you think they need to do to get over that hump\nBoy had as Dave said not everybody's going to be back and they have to make a decision on many Machado who's headed into free agency my gut instinct after a talking to folks around baseball is the Dodgers probably will not try to resign him Clayton Herschel has an opt out his contract\nI think eventually the two sides might try to work out an extension to keep her short hair and the legacy player and there's a question about the robber\nHas the option of contract for\nThousand in Nineteen the Dodgers have to decide whether or not they want to bring\nHim back in and look the one thing that we haven't we don't really know about the Dodgers ownership is what their response in the face of real disappointment and I think losing the world series back to back years all the scrutiny day Roberts bullpen moves in this World Series\nAre in the month of November as the red Sox are in a position to tell us what's been going on with his left shoulder a David Price of course is going to have a chance to opt out of his contract this fall I don't think that's gonna happen great temporal they're closer he's a free agent they have to make other changes on their staff as well\nA within a couple of years some of their key position players also\nWill have a chance to leave ... is a free agent JD Martinez could opt out of his deal after next year Red Sox already have a really high payroll so they're going to have to make some really smart financial decisions in order to I think returned to the world series next year\nMost are great job in the
