promised a severe punishment but not if it hurts us arms say I don't want to hurt jobs Senate Republicans meanwhile are speaking out that did happen [noise]\nAgainst this morning Republican Senator Marco Rubio and see I see John Brennan\nMorning of course money Andrea Mitchell\nThe White House correspondent for the New York times\nNews national political reporter Carol Lee\nAnn ... of Stanford University\nGood Sunday morning Tip O'Neill famously said all politics is local he was right that Boise wrong now\nAnd the age of Trump all politics is national Republicans mostly in Senate races want to remind voters how much they love President Trump Democrats mostly in suburban house races want to remind voters how much they dislike President Trump\nAnd Mr Trump wants to remind everyone how much he loves to be at the center of it all flooding the zone with made for TV appearances all week long we've never seen one party take over a chamber of commerce or Congress while the opposing party gain seats and the other chamber\nThis year President Trump's popularity and write America and its toxicity and blue America suggests Democrats could win back the house or Republicans actually picked up seats in the Senate\nMaking securing their majority for perhaps for more years in other words reddish getting red or blue is getting bluer and then there's purple those independent voters with a blue tend to them they could end up deciding this whole thing\nBut the question what three weeks to go until the mid term election is this for the Republicans post Kavanaugh momentum continue\nGrabbing a lot of victories folks get President Trump eager to energize his base in Kickstarter is twenty twenty campaign has a message for Republican voters the mid term elections are all about him\nThere is going to be a response from Congress it's going to be nearly unanimous it's going to be swift and it's going to go pretty far and that could include arms sales but it could include a bunch of other things as well\nAre you are you by the president doesn't look like he's ready to commit\nTo commit as far as you just went\nWell some point like I said I think when all the evidence is and we'll see I saw an interview after the fact after he said those things about the arms sales where he said in fact this proves to be true there'll be a lot of punishment for it it actually impacted the stock market's a view of Saudi Arabia\nSo ultimately I Do believe that the White House or if this has happened and it can be proven well do something significant about it I Believe they'll do it I Know Congress will do it\nRight Senator Marco Rubio Republican from Florida as always thanks for coming out of ...\nThank you you got it and joining me now is the former director of the CIA John Brennan and he's a one time station chief in Saudi Arabia rented walking back and meet the press my truck as I was a sort of joking with my step earlier it seems as if in the early parts of the Obama administration\nIf there was a problem between the Obama administration that Saudi Arabia you were the ones sent to try to mediate the situation so let me ask you this um\nWould um what is the CIA doing right now when it comes to something what would you be doing right now I'm trying to figure out this mystery\nWill be working with our long standing partners the Turkish intelligence officers as well as Saudi intelligence officers and others to see what information they might be able to share with us but also are looking at what types of other collection capabilities that we have\nAnd going back into systems and databases and to see whether or not there any indications of what might have happened when Jamal could show he went to the southern constantly we have\nPretty tight intelligence sharing with the Saudis do we know yes\nHow likely is it that we would have a hint that they were they had some issue with the shows you that maybe they were going to arrest him or maybe they were going to detain him how likely is it that we had some clue about something\nWell I think it was pretty open that the Saudi Government had issues with democracy because of his writings and so um I wouldn't be surprised if the U.S diplomats or intelligence officers of we're mindful about the potential for something that happened took a shows it a interested attention a but unfortunately it's\nWhat our duty I what's what's the what's the U.S government's duty if you have this information you know the Saudi Government is going to get aggressive with you mhm I'm very careful when you're you know he was a it was the U.S resident but he was the Saudi citizens do we have do we have a duty to warn him\nIf there's credible intelligence that somebody is under threat a violent attack there that will trigger a process to decide about the ability to warn that individual\nI don't know what type of intelligence we had before his disappearance uh but if it was the arrest or detention or capture of mullah ... is the Saudis citizen even though he's in American a resident\nSo I Am unclear exactly whether or not that threshold for duty to warn was triggered but it would have to have some type of threat of violence into it so she had with it\nI'm just curious as ... the release of pastor Brunson on by the Turks president said there was no connection any connection here or could there be some sort of this is the Turks way of trying to get a little more on the U.S side because maybe they want the United states to believe their version of events here is there any connection you say\nI think one can make the argument that the Turks are trying to improve relations with the United states not just for this issue but also just more broadly typically on the economic and political front the coincidence of the two in terms of ... disappearance and run since release a is a sort of interesting but I don't know what it was that might have been a brokered between\nAnkara Washington ah there's a lot of people who seem to be pretty confident that this was likely an order from MPs and the and the and the government Saudi Arabia where are you in a\nWhile I think there are two points if a ... had disappeared in Turkey when he was at a hotel or a private residents I think there is plausible deniability on the part of the Saudi Government\nBut he disappeared when there is video evidence of him being at the consulate the Saudi costs led a diplomatic mission under the full control of Saudi Arabia so they're denials ring hollow very much ring hollow [noise] to go after a permanent resident states ah who ... writes for the Washington Post\nAnd doing it on foreign soil at a diplomatic mission to me it would be inconceivable that such an operation would be run by the Saudis without the knowledge of the day to day decision maker of Saudi Arabia that's a crown prince Mohammed salon\nI think it is just beyond a reality um and so I I I think it's it's up to the Saudis now to explain what actually happened\nWould it matter if they're explanation is this was a rendition gone wrong this was an accident we didn't quote mean to kill him\nWell I think that has to be a full accounting of it and I think there have been calls for some investigations now\nKing ... father has had a longstanding reputation of being a fair pious but also meeting out justice to members as well family\nAnd there had been princes enroll family in the past who had been held to account for some transgressions of the law including executions [noise] so I think it's going to be up to ... if he has the mental capacity right now and the political strength the\nF ... you said if if you don't think the king has mental capacity right now\nThat well he is aging and are there are indications that he has a sales are a bit and whether or not now he is able to muster the strength or in the capacity to find out what happens including the role of his son\nThe issue with Saudi Arabia it seems as if it's always been a transactional relationship to the United states and Saudi Arabia no matter which party has been been in the White House um isn't it understandable to Saudi Arabia always things at the end of the day the U.S needs them\nMore um and we'll overlook\nThese things is that what NBS was possibly gambling on\nThe strength of the U.S Saudi relationship goes back many many years of but I think in particular NBS has been emboldened he is a very bright ambitious and aggressive individual and clearly is trying to make changes in Saudi Arabia but his relationship with the White House with Donald Trump as well as which are Christian or I think probably gave him increased confidence\nUh to do some of these things and the more aggressive way look what has happened in Yemen and that's awful awful tragic war but I also think that Donald Trump's uh I'm\nSigning up too authoritarian leaders around the globe the ... and others are Donald Trump's condemnation of the press that's critical of Donald Trump's continued dishonesty and denials of the reality even went All Facts point against it I think that has encouraged\nAnd be asked to go along this road is you put MPs and the same columnist ... and ... I Would put him is clearly in the authoritarian autocratic a cap absolutely All right John Brennan director to say come on sharing your expertise fingers thanks very much appreciate it\nWhen we come back those mid term elections and why and they all come down to the man was not even on the ballot hell is that [noise]\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops new dollar saying some experts say another crashes coming what will be left of your investments for your children are your grandchildren\nWill you know you can't fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins in an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nDuring periods of great volatility precious metals regularly outperform stocks because they're true wealth has said that have real value\nDuring this through your recovery period after the two thousand eight crashed the Dow went up only three point five percent well gold doubled in price Foley goes to now at eight five five eight five eight five eighty seven and learn how am I right by my physical gold and silver\nCan hedge against inflation and build a true legacy for your family regained control of your financial destiny and calling us are precious metals right now they'd five five eight five eight five eight oh seven to get your free gold i._r._a. guide\nCalled eight by eight five eight five eight oh seven as an investment the price of gold and silver may fluctuate over time and you could lose money checked with financial and legal advisors\nIn the midst of [noise]\n[noise]\nVideo attention all authors page publishing as looking for authors have you written a book you'd want to get it published page publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and Brazil on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets they handle all aspects of the publishing process for you\nBringing ... publicity copyright and editing go eat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author ... should get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author somebody should get again eight hundred bonds or one thirty six eighty nine\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with addiction please call this toll free number right now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight that eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight by calling your addiction team you're taking the\nFirst steps to recovery to help you need to be one Callaway eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight make the recall now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight ... third party advertiser for various treatment centers and play some networks individual results will bury visit your addiction team dot com forward slash turns for more information\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them if you want to fifty year old male maybe it would be for your even with type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance my only cost you about two hundred bucks a month of ... life insurance is out there called term provider and speak with big blue it eight hundred for a one\nResults made very none of solicitation for legal services if you owe the IRS back taxes payroll taxes were I'm not filed you return the IRS will get you they can take your property take you to court even put you in jail with one call to wall you'll never need to talk to the IRS again our average\nClients settles for about ten percent of what is owed we offer free face to face consultations in your local area call eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three that's eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three\nResults made very notice solicitation for legal services if you owe the IRS taxes payroll taxes have not filed you return the IRS will get you they can take your property take you to court even put you in jail with one called to wall you'll never need to talk to the IRS again our average\nClients settles for about ten percent of what his old we offer free face to face consultations in your local area call eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three that's eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three\nIf you have a hard one or the lines scale not only leads white spots plugs pipes that breaks down appliances costing you hundreds of dollars in energy and wear eliminate lunch scale and other water issues like brown standing bad\nOdors and lead with hydro care water products available from wave homes illusions waves affordable systems don't use salt or chemicals you'll look the way your water taste\nSmells and looks satisfaction guaranteed\nFor more information go to good clear water dot com\nThat's good Clearwater dot com\nRaise your space in science IQ every Sunday night with planetary radio on five eighty WC H.

S.\nWelcome back there are thirty five Senate seats in play in this year's midterms including twenty seven seats held are controlled by the Democrats and nine by the Republicans and Republicans hope to use this very friendly map\nTo increase their narrow fifty one forty nine majority meanwhile the numbers are pretty much reverse and governor's races there twenty six Republican seats up along with just nine democratic and one independent and Democrats are the ones bullish about their prospects on that side of the ledger\nSo we want to talk to some of the challenges in these races and we have to with us this morning say the ... the Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia and Republican Josh Hawley if that is challenging Claire McCaskill first ... in Missouri both candidates joining we're going to begin with Josh howling in Columbia, Missouri or Mr attorney general welcome to the show thanks for having me let\nThat question about erase this way if you win\nIs it fair to say the number one issue on on voters' minds was judges and an injustice Kavanaugh and if you come up short and Senator McCaskill wins reelection is it fair to say the number one issue in voters' minds with health care is it fair to say that you both have two different views of what the most important issue is the Missourians\nWell I I Do think we have different views jak and I do think that ah the debacle with justice justice Kavanaugh what the Senate Democrats did in that case is hugely motivating to Missouri voters they cannot believe\nThe conduct of the Senate Democrats they can't believe the smear campaign that they lost and by the way how they drug Dr forward through the mud as well and now this Bob behavior that we're seeing all over the country it is motivating folks\nBut of course a health care as well Missourians are paying outrageous healthcare costs up a hundred and forty five percent price increases in the state\nThey want to see that change Claire McCaskill is responsible\nLet me ask you this if you get elected and you're gonna vote to repeal and replace Obamacare yes I\nWould I think it's absolutely vital that we get rid of the failures of Obamacare we bring down costs we protect people with preexisting conditions in the law with a mandate Chuck that ensures that we do it but that we multiply options for families you know I've had family after family in this state\nCome up to me and say look we can't afford health insurance we're having to get a second jobs and a spouse back to work it shouldn't have to be that way it that way because of Senator McCaskill\nBut as you know to get rid of this law you also get rid of the protection of pre existing conditions and and well I I Know that if you believe it can be passed but frankly it never has been as you know I'm In your lawsuit as attorney general you'll find you could have\nSevered the issue of preexisting conditions how do you plan on protecting preexisting conditions\nYou know a check I think that we can do their ... number of ways to do to protect folks with preexisting conditions Congress should mandate it my position is insurance companies should be required by law to protect folks have pre existing conditions my own son I've got two little boys at home\nHere they got five year old ... year old by the way\nDo I do absolutely I Do what's what's not constitutional is the requirement that people buy health insurance\nThey don't want but it's absolutely constitutional say that insurers have to cover people with preexisting conditions Congress should mandate it people like my little boy who has a preexisting condition should be covered under the law but apart from Obamacare we don't have to have Obama Care to do it\nThat's the big difference here Claire McCaskill wants to protect Obamacare by with any condition by any means necessary I think we need to clear away the failure of Obamacare and put patients back in charge of their health care\nI bought a question for you without a clip of a TV ad you ran when you're running for attorney general\nIn two thousand sixty here's what you said in that\n\n... fold career moments isn't just climbing the ladder using one office to get another I'm Joan I think you deserve better\nNew within two years immediately ran for the U.S Senate what would you say to yourself in that\nI Would say that the future of our countries and sick\nAnd I would say you could see it with the hearings with justice Kevin all you can see what we're seeing out on the streets now the future of this country and our way of life years and steak and it's incumbent upon all of us to do all that we can I'm trying to do my part to make sure that we fight for the future this country and fight for Missouri Claire McCaskill has\nNot but I Will All right\nJosh Holly Republican nominee for the U.S Senate in Missouri appreciate your coming onshore interviews be safe on the campaign trail with\nVery similar to sex jokes and you got it like you\nAnd joining me now from Atlanta is Stacey Abrams welcome to meet the press thank you for having me let me start with the impact of hurricane Michael particularly on southwest Georgia I Know your opponent is going to be two in the area or this week in his capacity as secretary said he says to to see how\nA local officials are going to be able to see if they can handle the start of early voting tomorrow or let me ask you what do you know uh about the area how things are going are they ready to to be worrying about early voting yet or do they need to be worried about getting the power\nI think it's going to be a combination of areas like Albany ore Glasgow county heroin\nParts of south west Georgia were very strongly devastated\nI Know that Georgia Power and the ... are doing the best they can to turn power back on and deliver it to many people as possible\nBut luckily early voting allows for major centers to accept votes and I hope that the priority will be in terms of voting making sure that those places are ready but I Know all of our hearts are reaching out to everyone in those areas\nI've gone through a hurricane is a devastating process and it takes months for recovery to happen but I think that the governor and at the state leaders have done a great job of responding very quickly\nI'm curious what your message to residents of the area or you could be the governor and a cup you could be elected governor in a couple of weeks suddenly the task of rebuilding\nUm this part of Georgia is on a is on your to do list what's your message to those voters of why you would be better prepared to leave the recovery than your opponent\nNumber one I've been through this myself I understand that it's not just the physical plant that's a problem it's making sure that people have access to the resources they need\nAnd also when the camera's turned off and when people go home and stop volunteering that's when the real trouble starts when people who have been unemployed are continuing to try to figure out\nHow they can make a living and take care of their families and so I Will leverage the responsibility of the governor the ability to connect with state and local officials and federal officials to make certain that resources don't just end when the memory of the storm passes for the average person\nAnd I think that's what you need someone who's thinking about this not as a three day or three weeks return but really as a ten month twelve month recovery period\nDemocrats but certainly the winds have shifted polls are narrowing in certain races and\nThat is not the message had a Democrats than certainly want to send their chances are miniscule but they are diminishing and a lot of it has to do with Kavanaugh I think the question is whether or not that energy that Republicans have can hold over the next several weeks\nOn because Democrats are also energized or in their own way but there's\nThere's definitely a sense and even a Senator Cornyn said and I believe on friday that there's a chance that Republicans could pick up the right in the Senate which would be highly unusual um and so there's there's a shift happening and whether it's just that between now and election day you know ready to be said\nThat was just in Missouri for a few days and it it does feel as if they did is just two different races the Democrats are running a campaign on health care law neither Republicans Josh Holly I could see that as as a running a campaign about conservatives judges and and the importance of what the Senate majority means\nAnd Missouri's one of those states that has a red tend to it and it seems you can see the Kavanaugh effect\nUh in real time no absolutely it's absolutely help Josh Hawley in Missouri mid term elections are a lot about convincing voters what is it you stand to lose what is it you stand to lose and and for Republicans the pitch is if a Democratic Senate gets elected you're going to lose these judges\nFor Democrats is if a Republican Senate gets elected you're going to lose Obamacare\nAnd that's why the pitch has focused in on judges and healthcare so thoroughly and I think the challenges in in some of these states you know Arizona Nevada you're starting to see the race creek away from Democrats and it's happened in a slow but steady fashion in Nevada jak euros and the Democrat has not been in the head head in a public pool since the end of September\n... in Arizona you've got kissed in cinema all this opposition research coming out on a recently being out of touch with Arizona and so these races are creeping away but the meta narrative here is really about what do you stand to lose and I think Republicans are prosecuted that case effect\nAnd I think it's clear that the Democrats had really energized their voters\nHispanic voters have not been well you know reach out to and many Hispanics especially in Texas are really concerned about registering for anything whether they're legal or not they don't want to be part of the guys who they're so afraid of ice and and if\nWe're the ... rather than being angry by what's happening on immigration they really afraid of the government right now in registration and voting is being part of the government tells you where you live\nThe other thing is millennials may not be as excited and energized as Democrats had hoped where's the gun debate where are these other issues that had an animating young people you know several months ago after Parkland and seen it does feel that the Republicans are gaining on the Senate side\nYou know Peter when you look at this from thirty thousand feet which you are asked to do a lot in your position at the time a result that had Republicans gaining in the Senate and Democrats winning the house is actually pretty much emblematic of a divide in this country and rural America is in one place that's running which is where the Senate battle is suburban America's on another which is where the ...\nThat's right and what we set up then is a two year period of complete and total gridlock and fighting and you'd think the catalog and it was ugly just imagine if you've got split Congress\nA president who wants to play off of them to to to to benefit his own possible reelection twenty twenty possibly Democratic House it not launches an impeachment inquiry it may not go all the way a further but it certainly can have a lot of subpoenas and investigations and so forth it could be thought the Kavanaugh\nThing was ugly we only saw the pre season we're always we're about to head into the mainstream\nI'm the president is doing sixty minutes and and something leaked out about Jim Madison ... dramatic was a colleague it at the Hoover Institute and stand for him you would if the president it he has a tell us when somebody is about to lose their job he says I think they're kind of a Democrat he one time were referred to Rod Rosenstein that way\nAnd when he was asked about the future of Jim Mattis secretary defense\nHe said I don't know anything but you know I you know he may he's kind of a Democrat that well boy that's a tell is either I'm across\nNot not not that I've ever seen I mean I think this would be a staggering\nA finding to anybody who spent time around them I mean look I Jim Mattis has been a stabilizing force for national security policy during this administration he's been somebody that's presented very reason point of view I think a lot of people would be very nervous if Jim Mattis hr departments administration that having been said it does seem like the writings on the wall with respect to some of the the tells that we're seeing it as president\nFund their relationship has been strange for some time I mean you can say that geneticists as Ben you know the level headed a cabinet member who's had put forward very traditional physicians but the president hasn't really been listening to him for months in terms of whether it's on Iran or other issues and so there's been tensions in the relationship to begin with\nThe Woodward book didn't help either matter whether they're still at a gym and I'm a gym out if there was going to go voluntarily and so that's a situation where president state's gonna fire Jim Mattis are pushing mount that's a bigger list and say Rex Tillerson\nHowever with with palm pale at state and with ... and his deputy Nico Rick I doubt now at the White House there's been a poisoning the atmosphere certainly from Britain and his deputy against Jim Mattis and that relationship is Cal points out has been very strange I\nYou know I I think it it it's gonna be hard to fire him but I think the big changes coming after their terms and they are telegraphing that he feels empowered\nMid term

their assets and we were discussing the fact that a lot of individuals as they look at\nOptions for their assets they expressed an interest in having financial products that have guarantees but the question is what's available out there because there's only certain options when it comes to guaranteed financial vehicles and let's talk about what's available and then who's making those guarantees\nSherman or a absolutely and you're right and the other piece to that is what exactly is guaranteed\nAnd then we'll get into that a little bit later too and we come back to talking about annuities as a potential option but\nFor many folks entering retirement one of the tried and tested strategy is to put a portion of one's nest egg or retirement savings into some kind of a guaranteed what I call a bank type account or bank investment our product like a bank CD is a good example\nYou know what the interest rates going to be when you buy it you know how long that rate is guaranteed for and you also know when you have the ability to move it or to change that strategy without getting hit with some kind of a\nPenalty or a ... in your interest earnings are surcharge or what not so you kinda know from the get go exactly what you're gonna get and what to expect\nNot also comes with some downsides\nIn today's low interest rate environment CDs it's been a long time since they've been an attractive guarantee an investment for most people because of the rates are just so low\nAnd it might take time even if the fed does maneuver rates down the road we don't know our interest rates might end up in the next five ten Fifteen Years you have no idea so it becomes a little challenging to get competitive yields and rates of return sometimes on CDs depending on the interest rate environment\nThe interest rate is taxable C do have to claim that is taxable gain when you're earning gain in those dollars so it comes with a few challenges as well\nAnd when we look at who's guaranteeing those dollars\nCDs come with FDIC insurance and so there's a nice little\nI guess security blanket when it comes to investing in CDs and that's part of the reason why a lot of people find them attractive and they're willing to perhaps give up some of that that upside potential for that security\nAnd comfort of knowing that there's that guaranteed backing it the next option you might look at it as U.S Treasury securities and\nEssentially if you're not familiar with us treasuries are used to finance the federal government debt and so\nIn essence what's gonna happen is they are guaranteed\nBy the U.S government's full faith and credit or in other words their ability to tax us right and so there's the guarantee there and really that's a pretty safe bet however when you look at rates of return there\nThere's nothing to to get overly excited about usually and so again there's that given take that comes with it and this is where people will often look at\nThe annuity as another option\nFor some guarantees until it's talk about the different types of annuities Brent and later we're going to get into you know the downsides and what to be looking out for but first of all let's talk about the difference between two broad categories the first is\nThe immediate annuity and then in a moment we'll discuss the deferred annuity let's talk about the immediate annuities first what is it and how does this work\nShare my you know it's one of the simplest annuities out there in in a basic thirty thousand foot view of an immediate annuities is\nMeet the press Sundays in

entire radio show to safer guaranteed money but they'll never mentioned the word annuities because they're scared to Brent\nYeah end or are you ever hear about is positive positive positive they don't also disclosed the potential negatives and again we settled law and usa financial radio there are very few bad\nInvestment tools or investment products out there it's just either somebody shouldn't have it at all because it doesn't sit right into their portfolio or maybe they should have it but they don't have the right specific one or they simply aren't using at the right way that's the difference\nYou know later in the show we'll discuss why annuities have such a bad reputation but first Brent we want to look at\nThe different types of deferred annuities because I think that these are the most popular in terms of what is out there being recommended by financial professionals so let's look at the different types of deferred annuities\nAnd break them down and look at some of the pros and cons of first there are three broad types of deferred annuity is the first is the fixed annuity the next to this the indexed annuity and then there's the variable annuity let's first discuss the fixed annuity what is it and how does it work\nI'm sure Michael with all these remember we talked earlier that there are immediate annuities where you put money into a contract that insurance company they immediately start paying back a deferred annuity the whole point is to put money in and let it sit for a certain amount of time\nAnd then you can decide later whether you want to move those dollars into a different annuity somewhere out maybe you do want to turn in income stream later it gives a little bit more flexibility in terms of when you may or may not want to turn on income or take withdraws but the first one you mentioned mark was just a traditional six deferred annuity\nAnd what that is as you put money into a contract or into a policy with an insurance company and they are going to declare some kind of an interest rate to you and when you go into it you know at that rate is in you know for how long it's going to be guaranteed\nCommonly it's guaranteed for one year at a time\nSo you put money on deposit you get X amount of interest for one year guaranteed at the end of that term\nInsurance company is going to tell you what your renewal rate is might be the same rate could be higher could be lower a lot of that's a function of what's going on in the interest rate environment with the insurance companies doing with those dollars and where they're investing on what kind of yield they're earning off of\nThe pool of other people's dollars have been put into those inequities but you know for at least a year typically what you're going to get and then it just starts to renew when you're at a time\nAnd when you look at that renewal rate there is usually a floor a minimum rate of return a rate of interest that will be credited to your account and so some investors really appreciate that and again we discussed earlier\nThat a lot of folks today are willing to give up some of that growth in order to have a little bit more safety and so the fixed annuity just a real plain vanilla there's not too many frills to these contracts are pretty easy to understand the grand scheme of things\nWill declare that rate might be one year it might be three years it might be five years\nNow let's let's look at the indexed annuity let's talk about how it kind of has some similarities to the fixed annuity but let's talk about how it credits\nInterests for sure Sherman are happy to a couple of different things are kind of happening at once if you put dollars into an indexed annuity the lion's share of the money gets invested by the insurance company again pulled together with other policyholders just like yourself\nInto the very similar if not the exact same types of things that a fixed annuity investor would have their dollars but into when I say they I mean insurance company they're investing in government treasuries T. bills corporate bonds things that are\nRelatively conservative but trying to earn a decent rate of return for which there are going to give a portion of the field they get back to you as a policy holder\nThe lion's share of the dollar is actually go into that that provide certain guarantees that minimum guaranteed interest rate for that you talked about a moment ago\nBut they also take a small portion of the dollars and they actually go out and buy index options\nIf mayor without an index option is it basically gives them the right to buy into a stock market index say the S. and P. five hundred at a later date oftentimes when you're down the road\nAt some kind of declared price and the whole being that that the market is actually higher than what they have the ability to go purchase that option and then they get the pocket the spread of the difference with again and then the next option and they give you a portion that gain back into your account so\nYou're getting a little bit of gain because of the typical fixed the new the investments that they make but you also get and potentially some game because of the indexes and what's happening in some of the stock market\nIt's important to understand though with with an index nudity that is not you purchasing the option if the insurance company that is doing that you've entered into a contract and they stipulate the terms and and usually how it works\nIs your earnings or the credited interest into your account will be based off of usually let's just say one of the stock market indices so the popular one is the S. and P. five hundred\nAnd they might put a cap on what your upside potential could be so they'll say

the new Supreme Court justice seems like a lot longer than that doesn't it here to talk about all of it is our White House correspondent Karen ... first of all let's go to president\nTrump talking about the hurricane 'cause it really was devastating he says he's going to go down to the hurricane zone where you see that\nProbably at some point early next week of course the big concern Sherry as when can the president go and not impact any of the operations on the ground\nCommunications are still quite bad down there and they don't want to take away any time attention and ah work power away from the people that need help so the president says he wants to get a firsthand look though at the damage we expect that when he goes down he'll get a briefing from state and local officials\nAnd do some touring of neighborhoods that were particularly hard hit it'll look a lot like the events he's done in North and South Carolina after Hurricane Florence\nAnd Texas and Florida during last year with hurricane season\nOkay you in a bathroom Nikki Haley saying that she's going to step down at the end of the year did we see that coming\nIt was a big surprise here in Washington especially here in the White House press this was something nobody was expecting and it was pretty amazing that they were able to keep this really a closely held\nThe president said he and Haley had been talking about this for some time and that the timing was right for her to say at the end of the year she was going to step down the big question of course now is what is she going to do next and she indicated this week that there is no set plan\nPresident said she could come back to the administration at any time she wants and have her pick of any job it certainly sounds like she's going to take a little bit time away and not ruled out jumping back into politics and shares you made it very clear I'm prompted\nNobody asked her a question but she says she's not running against President Trump and twenty twenty she will be out on the campaign trail supporting his reelection\nOkay so talking about campaign rallies we saw a couple of more than we were going to see several more before the midterms these or something President Trump just thrives on he loves\nIt he loves getting out on the road the White House likes getting him out on the road in front of enthusiastic crowds he has for rallies this week and that's the case that's going to continue between now in the mid term elections\nI think he'll be on the road for five days notably these are all evening events seven o'clock eastern time he wants to try and get primetime coverage\nBut there's been some reporting this week that he's actually not getting that wall to wall cable television coverage like he used to he said something really interesting this week Sherry in an interview with Fox News he said people are telling him at these rallies that they wish he were on the ballot they say I Wish I could vote for you again\nAnd I just don't know if I'm going to show up on election day now maybe this is just a stick he's\nUsing to try and get people out but it's certainly something that a incumbent White Houses presidents ... their parties are concerned about\nIn mid term election year how big a deal is Brett Kavanaugh these are at these rallies is his name come up with the president earlier this week with bringing him up a lot as a rallying cry for Republicans and was using it to a point out the politics of the Democrats you know saying that they handled the process badly\nAnd tried to bring down a good and qualified man\nHow much mileage the president can continue to get out of this because if you say but Kavanaugh suffering in was only this week and it feels like it was a month ago at this point\nA smart Republican strategist also said this uh this week that it's a lot easier to rally you're faithful rally your base on anger when you don't get something so that's the Democrats you can't keep saying Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh because he's already on the Supreme Court okay finally\nKanye West what they had what what was going on and this is one of the more bizarre events I've ever seen that the White House and the\nPeople here who've been here longer than I have many administrations will say they've never seen anything like this are we supposed to see the president and Kanye West together it wasn't on the official schedule but uh our colleague John Carlos asks\nThe president Thursday morning can we come in and see a little bit of your meeting and he said sure it brings a press and\nFor the oval office photo op and\nKanye West just went on a very long rambling speech profanity laced he was angry banging on the resolute historic desk at one point\nAnd the president for the most part just let them talk it was very rare to see the presidency the spotlight like that he let him talk I worry about education and jobs and gang violence and guns and race relations\nOr even his own mental health issues and at the end of it President Trump said that was pretty impressive and then he said to reporters what do you do after that that was a question a lot of us were asking yesterday and Jonathan Karl got a hug from Kanye West at the end he said thanks for taking questions and kind of said come on in and just bear hug them\nCertainly John crossing a lot that was unique okay hash tag ...
