the head of the table when it comes to making U.S foreign policy and it really any administration\nAnd uh you know Nikki Haley came into this job with no experience at all or in foreign policy which even in the Trump Administration is going to diminish or clout bad she uh had a reputation particularly when ... Rex Tillerson was secretary of state\nFor going her own way for sort of seeming to each other off the costs are based on her own uh ideas rather than going along with at least what Tillerson seems to be voting or when it came to Syria or North Korea in particular so in that sense it was a bit more independent and maybe some people have like\nA like a you know I just I don't think it's new most important position the world but she's a you know a a sort of charisma addict politician or was one of the few women obviously at the top of the a Trump Administration so she gets a lot of attention [noise]\nAlso I I Believe if I'm if I'm not mistaken that uh the UN ambassador a sits in a cabinet meetings although if they do of course technically had a department of government\nYeah it's yeah it's it's technically a cabinet position that's true\nYou know one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six of Benjamin Friedman our guest senior fellow at ... at the fence priorities their website is their name defense priorities dot org\nAnd uh uh let me have your thoughts are if you could about uh the transitions from secretaries of State Tillerson to a Pompeo uh\nAbout any any changes the bats signaled and about uh the methods by which they have conducted foreign policy\nSo that is that message by which they conducted foreign policy or ... or ... a little bit nebulous or in that um I don't know much not much has been written or has come out about how management practices have changed under com pale except for the fact that\nHe's been a little bit more of the cheerleader for uh the state department personnel on and it has got some credit for that after\nTillerson or who want it to slash the budget and so forth was not too popular with his\nEmployees but uh in in substantive policy terms uh Tillerson and this administration wound up being one of the biggest dog's a he was an advocate of or at least a [noise]\nSome of the time or an advocate of hard to pull the sea and uh getting along with uh North Korea is ultimately occurred uh and he was reluctant or to get out of the Iran deal a President Trump cited that as a reason for firing him so a\nPale was is more of a down the line hawk\nOr who fits into the sort of new conservative camp for the very hawkish a pro war side of the Republican Party like ground ball and Haley I think it's pretty well in that in that group is well she's maybe a little more fond of allies but other than that I mean she's quite similar those two\nYeah that that by the way brings up an interesting thought as well I remember when John Bolton was first a tab to to serve this administration and I I uh invented an imaginary conversations in the oval office in which President Trump is sitting there with his top advisors say you know we\nWere vastly over extended with us troops around the world in Europe or fifty thousand up in in Korea and the like we need to start pulling back\nHow do you feel about that John Bolton and it just [laughter]\nI mean it just struck me as this is kind of like the odd couple pairing in that regard and as is drew on on a lot of issues it makes you wonder just exactly where Donald Trump is I Know that he's\nShown in some instances a great job we say versatility of conviction about various issues but but I'm not sure the extent to which this president could be considered neoconservative\nNo I ... I I have a lot of words that um but that's probably not one uh\nYeah it is he's come around a one way or the other or whether it's because of conviction or just personnel decisions or whatever a tool ah being much more amenable\nTo people who were labeled that way and and probably neoconservatives not the right word or for people maybe like Tom pay or golden who are just a\nVery aggressive and willing to use military force or maybe more than most people and particularly a eager I think\nTo get into conflict with Iran a ...\nSo that that a a big theme of the Trump Administration this president talked about ending some wars and reportedly want it to get troops out of Afghanistan wanted to get troops out of Syria obviously not all the things that happen\nAnd we re committed uh in in

but pragmatic us or to and defense policy that maybe as a few wars and say let's say it was a few bucks\nSo uh as we take this first call or how's this administration doing from the defense priorities a perspective\nOr we remain a hopeful that they could improve\nHuh OK we will not put that out as an a plus or Tom calls in from Sharon, Pennsylvania leaving a\nYou know I was surprised I I honestly didn't see it coming but I don't think that the president surprised um you know they make the alien the president while they had had certainly there cause like\nI think they do have a good relationship I think Trump obviously as we can talk with speech today it's very very proud of the early work as an eye on 'em and you know from Nikki position I think resigning now kind of makes sense\n[noise] one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six that the timing\nOf course in relation to the midterms with a a some a degree of instability certainly for the first half of the of the first term of the Trump Administration more than than the average administration in terms of turnover and of course continue speculation about names like\nJeff Sessions the attorney general and is a deputy Rod Rosenstein uh it it does seem as though this could have waited until November seventh\nYeah you know it has seen that it could have waited my only gas is potentially they see this as\nSomething to basically kind of ride the cabin out laid out because think about this you know the cabinet wave is definitely going to galvanize Republican voters but we have\nFour weeks until the mid term election year so I think that if we can basically have ... as we can try more the media by talking about you know who's going to a place they ... as they talk about her record that's going to keep I think the Democrats away from essentially getting too are putting a cap and I will still all Republicans to turn out you know especially the base\nWas taught to Randy calling from Springfield, Missouri good evening Randy\nYes sir and you're on the radio on your mind reading\nOr yeah or earlier this year uh she's she said she told Donald Trump that she was going to resign by the end of the year that she was done right five or six months ago so I don't know what the big hubbub is\nWill the hub of I guess would be that this administration does not need any more signs of instability and it could have waited until after the election I think that's the main thing that I see why why announce it now a ... granted it's not a major factor I'm sure the casting a vote by most people but\nBut politics is made up of of little factor is this going to wait it I just it it seems rather odd that uh that we had to announce it now in the middle of a one of the more important midterm election campaigns in us history that would be be my feeling a\nBeat her yeah I understand that yeah it it all makes sense now that you've said that\nUh well I mean then that's the thing to me it it it doesn't make sense ah that's that's why I'm I'm I'm having trouble understanding that uh Peter was there anything about this well at least based on what we know what do you think about this that that couldn't have waited\nSure you know I'm not saying that it couldn't have waited ... again I think at this point you know eight ten twelve hours after it was announced it is really just rank speculation I mean as far as kind of what you call it a ability I I Will say that people certainly don't like the turnover at the top not that the turnover is excessively unprecedented but it\nIs that it it's higher than average age is higher than average but I think the fact that she's willing to stay on for a few more months it's not like she's like hey I'm resigning next week you know an Anthony Kennedy reputation do it's a lot different than I Am\nA ... your take if you could give us a on on the the Trump foreign policy uh today and as we noted a bit with our our previous discussion with the been Friedman\nUh it it does seem like the president who campaigned pretty much as a very uh\nUh anti neo conservative has at times or move more in that direction or not the least of which our\nOur uh moves in Syria and of course the naming of John Bolton to the the inter a White House circle is it's a little hard on this as of course on a number of other issues to depend on as president down in in terms of just what it is\nHe he believes yeah you know I Do agree\nYou on that I I Will say though that if you are going to try and present down you can pin down by the people that are out and so we've seen as an eel Conway grow and the more anti global is weighing that Steve Bannon wing type at the White House diminish um as far as there is like so you could essentially seek out a precursor\nTo what the policy will be by the the personnel are\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo when eight six six five oh five or six to six are wondering about\nPossible names that we can uh mentioned in terms of a replacement of course uh the president himself has floated one named it is said to be on my list of five or a shortlist names the former White House advisor Dina Powell the president praised us ... Germany Richard Grinnell\nAs a person who would do a great job although he likes him where he is as a passenger to Germany\nOr any other thoughts that you have as regards of\nThe possible direction this might or might signal\nWill will Tina Paulos is obviously the made in heaven or the fact that he says is that she is on the shortlist and you know your name would ideally said that she is the leading candidate I mean other people that he didn't mention is that credit and Vassar Russia is John Huck Finn and acting under secretary for public policy and public affairs Heather Nauert\nSo those are two other people you know we don't know who the entire Charlotte says although Rick Cornell is currently on that short\nBut has always can change 'em so you know it's certainly something that you know I think he's been expecting and I think he's just kind of waiting to announce it for a little while to get the dispatcher not because I don't think he I especially you need to basically close these days that I think he does and he's got a pretty much decide\nTo try to court and these days it's you and I know\nWell that's true yeah ... that's that's one aspect of this job but he certainly

at a just a what all of a can be a\nSince we have you here we might as well wrap up on a look ahead or just a less than five weeks to the mid term elections arguably one of the most important ones in the in recent memory your thoughts on the Democratic prospects for taking either house of Congress\nYou know I think the Democrats have a pretty decent shot at taking the house um just because of how the races playoff obviously all four hundred and thirty five seats are up for grabs however in the Senate um ... seats that are up for grabs are currently held by Democrats the old one by Trump or most of those by double digits including West Virginia by forty three points\nDuring a lot of states are opportunities for Republicans pick up a I Would say going ahead I think if the Democrats take the house I think the Republicans slowly maintain that ... the seats in the Senate\nAnd we're going to spend the next two years taking out a lot of regulation and confirming a lot of judges because probably not a lot of legislation is going to get out and they're going to spend the whole time just trying to impeach the president very unsuccessfully\nYeah absolutely I mean I I don't think it would take more than ... seat majority of due to impeach the president in the house but of course that they would never in a million years get sixty seven votes to convict in the Senate so it's not like a Donald Trump would be going anywhere for about an hour of Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh\nWhich it strikes me as really an overreach the notion that I don't believe that it would be constitutionally permissible or even assuming that you place credibility of the story from Dr ... board I don't think you would be\nA constitutionally permissible to a beach for something that happened thirty five years before he took office\nYeah and I mean look here's all day bring it on because it's just going to really anger the average American I think when people see Republicans tried to get stuff done and Democrats just trying to do anything they can with investigations into peanut hours and\nDoing everything it can really bogged down the Trump Administration like you really think that if the Democrats investigation and they found nothing for Russia or any of anything else that they're doing that they really say All right well we'll give up this game and just got burned like normal come on we already know what they're going to do what we saw what they would do with cab and I gave him an edge\nWait till they added mile so I bring it on and they're going to get that impulse is twenty twenty\nWell certain I Would hope that you are correct in that regard I'm not sure that the majority or at least of all of this where there was a significant portion of the population out there that I think that anything that was against Trump's they would they would be for uh I also ah\nThere's also see the population that any anti Trump there again yeah yeah it was a very large very very motivated base of that and I think your average just flyover country type of\nAmerica and uh they're gonna just probably look at the eye and look at any radical leftists but after twenty twenty look they put up Joe Biden different day but depending on who they put out if they put up to the radical left this war on our Cory Booker Bernie Sanders\nPeople are also vote down ballot generally how they vote for the presidential party so we can take back the house if they lost it at actually pick up more seats in both houses of Congress in ... the I think it's a real possibility I think it'll happen I'd a crystal ball but nothing was either\nYou know it it is tough for me to imagine what happens in the next two years if in fact the Democrats capture either house probably the house of representatives if if either\nA I'm not sure what is left with this administration to do in terms of executive orders I mean most of that it would seem to me was addressing the first two years what's left the audio\nSure I mean they can do is watch the regulatory efforts as they can and frankly because the Senate has you know advice and consent hours he can basically just push through a ton of ...\nIt is and here's this legislation is great legislation can be overturned it a lot harder to\nBasically an stack up which I'm not big quarterback but I'm saying fill you know and the seats and make sure that the priority that voters though that that's what we're doing illegal I guess the same thing with the deregulatory offers those a lot longer than any tax reform package or anything else\nI'm not that they're not all Orton but they're really critical especially Democrats take back the house to do what we can and those are big things for the really big things I have to do this year is\nYeah I have to wonder if in the next ten years we're going to see another Supreme Court nominee receive more than the four votes let's say from of the party a lot in the White House I mean it seems like this becomes was a totally partisan thing\nYeah I really think it will be that way and I think frankly I think Republicans that if you know there's the Democrats and Republicans would do anything that can like I mean let's say God Forbid something happened to clerics tall that\nLike what's that mean you know I I don't know Clarence Thomas itself but he doesn't look like America runner to me and he's Seventy years old All right let's say you know selling cars and in\nFive years when he's Seventy three Seventy four Seventy five and Democrats that of whites along I could see

or or at home or kids probably in school\nAnd the it is very possible to be separated under circumstances where are the homeless say has gone wow my whole neighborhood destroyed where we're a mom or dad and so this I guess this preparation includes a lot more than just a\nA old friends and a and a family or let's say in some distance aunts and uncles this sort of thing the immediate nuclear family has to know exactly what these places are to go and and a and B order a priority right\nAbsolutely because that's the way you know where you're going to go so let's say we have to you know we're in the central market\nAnd we have to evacuate if the storm is coming from the directions we backed away at area number one which will be no our land the area that you know the east coast of Florida so this way were on that side of the state you know while you're traveling\nYou know what happens is communications can go down\nEspecially when the storms in the outer bans knockout technology like cell towers you could be in a dead zone family is trying to get a hold of you they don't no way you when you want at least if they know that you are definitely headed towards option number one\nThey could at least leave word for you and call that hotel or call that a couple of all that and so that's an important factor is when you're out of reach people should have already know what the plan is way you're going to go as well as those\nWho are coming in your direction because they have to evacuate so you know that family is coming to your direction to your place or within your area to evacuate in the area that is under you know I'm evacuation routes\nAnd ... this may be a little weird but then again maybe not maybe it's just prudent I'm Wondering about the possibility of some relatively slow weekend\nOf a mom and dad saying you know we're we're going to a pack a picnic lunch\nAnd we're going to actually go to our various options in case we ever have to evacuate the home and the will make a will make a a kind of a fun day out of a drill a maybe we'll even taken to a tourist attraction or something on the way but we are going to rehearse where we go or is that are going too far\nNo not at all I mean that is very ... and and the ability to know where you're going to be so when you make reservations or you're going to that specific place people should know not only where it is but how to actually get there in the best route especially\nIf you're taking any kind of odd ball side road route you want to know how you're going to get there so let's say it's a certain major highway that takes you directly there but you decided hey why don't we take the side wrote people your family should know\nThat you will be taking the side voting case there is a blockage on the main artery 'cause this way they can at least\nKnow how to find you know in case you would have to be the last in a side road that is pretty much a band\nBarrow enough a one eight six

six\nDisaster preparedness expert Anthony co because our guest his website by the way his emergency prepping dot org ... emergency prepping dot org and I would assume that that's where one can go to a copy of your book emergency prepping\nThat is there a or you can go to Amazon and look up emergency things or Anthony ... very simple and you should find that book and other related topics\nFantastic Kobe by the way K. O. V. I. C. K. O. V. I. C. word one eight six six five oh Jim bow and the Allen calls in from Dallas this evening and listen to the cliff five Seventy good evening welcome Alan\n... going to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind to lie about\nOh here he was sure spending that my experience has been I'm sixty one years old I've ... I've tried ... travel and most of the major freeways in America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith ... with on and on the major freeways but then if you run into a situation where like in a south to North Carolina where the Florence are gender flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou need to make sure that when you're when you're going now they'll go on the major freeways first and they wait for the Detroit then that's when you should you shouldn't start on the side roads because it'd be judgment there is a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay under clear major uh interstate and then and then then if it happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then go to the side routes that's all I'm saying\nAll right well let let's see what Anthony kovac has to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me and then he\nIs absolutely correct but importantly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to work those roads you should at least be familiar with and so when you're traveling on a leisurely um track\nTo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there now and the other people are gonna meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several of the major roads to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those roads\nThat are all computer systems on the east coast were affected the fact that there were times when you could go further than going to a website and then you could not in Iraq because it was just too much traffic\nPrevious to that one New Year's Eve I was sending out a happy New Year's messages\nAnd a quarter after twelve I suddenly started getting notices that my messages had failed okay the phone trying to reset and then it wouldn't work of about four hours later I started getting messages from people why are you sending me so many messages\nEvery time my phone and tried to reefs and it just piled up in the queue at the local a cell tower cell tower was still functioning but it was overloaded with messages and then it started sending them out and I had to spend the next day\nGoing through my phone and canceling every message I sent out so it would stop sending them in an emergency I can just imagine your cell tower works\nBut there's so much traffic that your messages take two days to get out and by then how much good does it do to tell someone that where you're going because you're nowhere near where you you were when you set the message\nYeah ... well that is correct but let's say they're they have managed to play that takes place that's causing this problem is a seven day event and you got your messages to daily two days later\nYou're still out in a in the wilderness and you still needs to communicate even if you are messages gap there a day later two days later it doesn't matter how many days later the important thing is eventually if your messages to get through\nAnd the people on the other side now now that you're fine and you just took another route and you're at your location that's good enough for them because now they don't have to spend the next four or five days thinking about what happened to you\nKnow I'd point to ponder thanks Randy appreciate your thoughts one eight six six by boat jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six\nOr in terms of uh uh things that are easily overlooked uh one thing of course when there's a sudden disaster like a tornado or something and people think oh I got to grab certain things I got to grab the are the important papers got a grand above the wedding pictures\nAre there are are are granted where the tornado probably that that there's no time at all but let's say it's a rapidly rising flood\nThere there have to be some order of priorities here or perhaps maybe even a grouping of things\nMaybe ah ah I don't know putting putting certain important documents in in a in a certain uh a portable box or just sort of brain stormy here but but clearly when time is the essence and people want to rescue certain things they shouldn't jeopardize their lives to do it what advice do you have\nEveryone has a print or nowadays I'm sure I don't know if anyone does and and most printers come with scanners so everyone\nShould be scanning their documents putting it on a thumb drive that very inexpensive a sixteen gay thumb drive ... pretty much all of your pictures let's say you needed a sixty four gay\nOr something of that type that not very expensive there under thirty to forty dollars to the dollars you can scan all your documents\nMake sure that you want to have copies of your license copies of your passports copies of everything that is needed so you can read coup your life\nSo this way when you go to the and be when you go to the state department and or you go to any place you have at least the documents whip the numbers the code numbers of those accounts et cetera so this way you can recapture your life\nBack from wherever you are because you have at least a digital scans documents on your possession you\nKnow putting it on the cloud you know there are those that wonder whether or not their security out there at the Pentagon and the White House and you can talk about other important celebrities who had their files hacked\nThere is no such thing as security anyone that things that they were as there is so have you\nYou know most important documents scanned and ... percent in a cloud in a um thumb drive format that only when it's plugged in sort of computer that that data can be accessed\nOne eight six six Bible jumbo let's go to Jim moves in central Oregon tonight and hello Jim\nYeah smoke serves Oregon at Central Oregon Coast\nWell OK central Oregon coast and go right ahead\nA you guys don't talk about earthquakes out here and ... we will and um they they do have quite a lot of stuff that does go on the half science person armies everywhere of course\nThe state has got that made sure of that and every city has their safe areas to run the term silver or so\nBut as far as your earthquake preparedness\nUm um\nEverybody's different and uh the bridges will probably all be gone\nWell that depends on the sides of the earthquake\nWell that's true if they if they keep saying this mind for him to come along basically everything's growing up here who are\nWell but I mean it depends on where it hit somebody it's just you you just can't know that certainly a possibility but but I mean you never know\nOkay well what other than all of the things you said so far about your license you're damn ... thumb drive your record all of that\nStuff already been done but you know what other um physical things kind of guy really prepare for you know besides food water and that type of thing or is there a um your goal kid would probably not even work because\nYou wouldn't be able to drive anywhere anyway\nIt's not that that's not necessarily true at all you may or may not you just simply have no way of knowing if you're talking about\nA a an earthquake that it's a you know twenty on the Richter scale of the every structure in road is flat and well I guess you're screwed but I mean I don't think that's a that's too likely and go kid is always a handy thing to have even under the most dire circumstances or your your advice or for a gym would bleeds Anthony\nAbsolutely I mean Bill Gates\nJust that so let's say your you have to abandon your vehicle and you have your whole trunk full of goal kits\nBug you had your backpacking you carry ... central stuff a few days the food and medicine that other things that you can now walk and hide it to the next town or wherever it is that you can have safe lodging or maybe even just it just ... nearby and just\nYou know wait it out and so you know already start putting\nTogether what's happening now think about it was the last ... that came so far I mean most of the states now are starting to take seriously you know emergency management of these type of situation like in the state of Florida because we've had so many hurricanes back to back\nIt taking it seriously the money and management of each county each district each region the state itself\nI mean we moved I think it was seven million people during the hurricane to one that hit a\n... was it er but I Can't remember from so many names now but think about how many people were relocated\nNot only in the state of Florida but to Alabama Georgia it was just in an age thing you know relocation of the masses and from what I remember no one was\nKilled during this whole process\n... one eight six six by boat jumbo one eight six six Bible five or six to six of his we go to the break an important lesson to keep in mind\nDo the best you can uh again or the idea of throwing up your hands on the air and say well do more to go ... or any other preparation we're all gonna die is a a counter productive way to think at least make the effort you never know it could save your life will be back in the moment\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety med everyone's on them if you're a

period of about five years buyers fate had an emergency that was an overwhelming the resources\nIn the emergency manager could activate their people to help out in many different ways it might be local achievements to your ... your neighbors and make sure they're All right ah it might be helping with the three R's\nMight be helping the fire department to overwhelm the um whatever that would be it\nIs the day uh there's twenty and forty five votes throughout the county different areas that are already being paid for such a thing that would be over your ... some sort of an emergency they're overwhelmed resort not only their county but also to be\nA that was just something that was interesting in my county\nWell very interesting you know here\nWe have to go back to have a hard at the first date equipment and that type of thing ... pages in radios so they\nThey just got back to that debate of obviously if you're trapped your house you're not going to respond to that will will know that you didn't respond to no check on you\nFair enough I'm like our guest to comment about that to me the most important thing to me that the Billy said was the word training or certainly if you have been trained to help out I'm sure that you could be a valuable additional resource but I I Am fearful of people who suddenly you have the impulse to help but they they don't know what they're doing\nI mean all emergencies our local when you think about it let's think about your home town who you're going to have come down from you know a thousand miles away to help you out\nHow are they going to even get a route where are they going to stay all those resources and Rene largest is local the more the low so people are informed of their own resources\nAnd they learn in the management they participate in their elections making sure that their systems are up to date in accessing just like in their doing their state of Florida we all know that this is happening all over the state and because of that\nThere are systems in place\nThe ... because we've been having so many of these situations\nThat people haven't gone to sleep so far away from the last incident that no one knows what to do so in places\nAround the country that real emergencies have not happened a long time away that is more important to really know what's happening in your community so this way in case there is something\nEmergencies or in your local area your local district\nPeople helping people within their vicinity those other people that are going to care more value than people traveling from a great this as as much as they care they need resources and the ability to access your area and if those people show up from great distances\nThere skepticism of how much can they help as well as who are these people\nRight now that are in the time we have left here about a minute and a half I'm Wondering about things I didn't bring up that you'd like to emphasize\nI mean we know that food is important can goods have a beverage good shelf life you should stock up on\nYou know you're you know your goal pack I mean they're telling people to evacuate you should have enough resources to where you're going you at least have a few days the resources whether it's water whether it's soups\nCanned goods already pre cuts so you don't have to utilize utensils that other stuff that you ... you you don't have the space to carry all these things\nYou just need one of those dry food you know your beef jerky is that kind of stuff\nYou're medicines are important make sure your medicines\nAre with you and if you have to\nYou know if you need refills if you're located if you'll medicines are located on the chain store and you have a re failed in there you can go to another area of that same Shane and pick up your medicine is\nSo there's lots of little things such as that you know grandparents parents that are elderly people that are\nEspecially children making sure that they have their you know the toys\nThat special foods there's nothing worse than a child that constantly cranky and cross 'cause they don't have their favorite toy or their favorite food that they want to eat and stuff but emergency rations you're not going to have a good time what a crying baby or a toddler without their without their proper you know toys et cetera so these are the little things\nWhen you

coming ashore [noise]\nUh years ago um the dilemma that we used to face was that when you evacuated the area [noise] uh most people wanted to go north to get away from the storm there was only a two lane\nHighway you might go to the highway that went north up to Alabama\nAnd uh that was the evacuations site now they have\nA change just there are a larger lanes and you have to go around Eglin air force base to ah to get away from the Gulf Coast of my daughter uh lives in Fort Walton Beach evacuated this morning's which Pascagoula\nAnd uh my other daughter lives there is a they boarded up their

over it starting over again you know but it uh it is quite an experience and it can be extremely dangerous\nFor certainly a number of them that we went through we were either are usually the one side or the other of the storm and it didn't last shift too badly\nMutt um ah they the idea of evacuation is is so important if it's going to be close enough at your home is is in danger get ...\nWords to

storm some of them were really bad like you'll see one big condo building and then walk\nStuff that is neat and anyway my I have a couple ideas that's beach front living just basically started what they are in the ... like at Seventy year old by the time and it used to be that would just\nSay they're ready motel and then those were bought out on the building but\nI haven't I it it could start buying out some of these ... and the dancers 'em by all the people I have relatives on the east side of Florida and storm surge twice a year for every dollar following up but\nI think what more are parked there already are a number of along the beach so people can get their RV thinking well on\nNear the beach or on the beach then when he commanded up four months of that hurricane that they can just say we got another one prominent everybody leave and come back when we got our fault clear but I\nI get my idea it's just the start brand\nThe fighting these people out when they have a big thing the insurers are the fate kids in the war and the people in by standing the a hurricane insurance stuff like that and if they bought 'em out\nAnd it's hard to do with the condo buildings that are like Thirteen story yeah but\nThe whole you know fire out as many as they can and leave the insurance for that kind of buildings and stuff like that um and then put in more are you part because they can withstand that they send everybody away they can with the power outage just hit the people going back and it's all\nYou know All right well I Do indeed that's an interesting thought I'm not sure what
