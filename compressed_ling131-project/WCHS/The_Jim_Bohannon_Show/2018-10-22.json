don't usually starts October twenty third year around us that's right you're is is that opposition so it's on the opposite side of the earth from\nThe sun I mean it's marginally closer than it is other times during the year\nIt will be rising around sunset sitting around sunrise your water look up a find a church or to look for if you ever really dark sky you might be able to see it with your eyes or if you are a lot yours\nOr telescope you probably can see it as a little blue star ... blue green dot so it's a good time go looking for here in us\nAll scout that much easier to see a Mars from the south looking reddish and Saturday in the southwest on the early evening and then in the early evening Jupiter\nGetting lower and lower or looking bright low in the west we move on this week and space history\nIt was two years ago that the trace gas arbiter of the European space agency went into orbit\nAround Mars joining a whole fleet of other spacecraft there and looking for trace gases including groovy things like math and\nAnd now and then a is able to sniff that out from orbit which is pretty amazing\n[laughter] little sniffling they're not full that's a good word isn't it it's just a heartwarming word\nI I was ... random space fact but I I don't really know how to do that\nFor you know I I Can't do it I don't know I was a pretty go try I think\n[laughter] space [noise]\nIt's a little gross but I might just go with that okay [laughter] so um as you know the sun is huge\nBut the bright red star and Terry's in scorpions is super enormously gigantic re impossible to imagine huge if we're we're the son is in our solar system\nYeah auto parts and Terry's would extend out beyond the orbit of Mars\nGood lord bar goes down for that is that that is one big star God that is that's a bigger story than Lady Gaga [laughter] [laughter] uh glad you're taking a vacation\n[laughter] I guess it's time okay well like we said no contest to answer so I suppose we can go straight onto a a new one\nWe're going to talk a little bit about things you can observe the night sky with so on a typical pair of binoculars what is it two numbers mean for example ten by fifty binoculars one of the numbers mean go to a planetary dot org slash radio contest and a and get a straight answer\nYou know I just read a book that actually explains that and does it so that you understand how to use binoculars to look for stuff like urine is another cool stuff in the sky I I Can't remember the name of the book though can you help me\nWhy yes I can I add the book is called astronomy for kids how to explore outer space with binoculars or telescopes or just your eyes\nIt will be so much easier for me to look up this book if you tell me who the author was\nBruce that's ph\n[laughter] okay no more fooling around it's a great new book at that Bruce has just completed and it's going on sale I guess as we speak is the e book version of available\nAh yes uh well no

hard copy version of this I read it as a basically as a PDF you know a a preliminary version pre publication\nIt's a terrific book I've read a lot of intro to astronomy books this one is targeting what would you say young adults kids but it really is good for anybody and it's just nicely done it's beautifully designed and it's very much in your voice so ah I have no qualms at all recommend in this book\nWell thank you math that means a lot of money\nSo let's let's offer a signed copy of the book to or whoever wins this brand new contest along with of course a planetary radio T shirt chop chop store dot com or you can see the whole planetary society store\nAnd a two hundred point I telescope dot net account and you can use that account to look for some of the stuff that maybe you can't see from uh where you are but uh the stuff you'll read about in bruises book\nCool in the same copy I I signed that right\nI don't think they would care as much if I signed it maybe maybe we'll both signed it no you'll ... you'll you'll cited you you wouldn't Lady Gaga\n[laughter] I\nI'm not sure we can totally fulfill on that part but uh I suppose we could try\nI Do prospect but Bruce for short hot and I think that means we're done oh I never said that you have until the twenty fourth October twenty fourth at ATM Pacific time to answer this one and maybe when Bruce this book\nAstronomy ... everybody go out there and look up the night sky and think about alarm clocks and how annoying that are\nThank you and good night getting a bright and early tomorrow huh well yeah just fair and stared at the alarm clock threatened again\nJust ignore that a jet lag he's Bruce bats the chief scientist at the planetary society who joins us every week here for what's up [noise]\nMy imagery radio is

conditions\nOne frame Republicans and out of the mainstream I Do\nSenate campaign committee Tom tell us up north Carolina is ...\nPublic and post cabinet surge real or we're just seeing a natural closing of the mid term we have a brand new NBC News Wall Street journal poll out this morning with some unusual\nResume that you make both parties a little nervous\nGoing to work for inside an analysis on NBC News correspondent\nColumnist Eugene Robinson Peggy Noonan a columnist for the wall Street Journal and David rosy cheeked political analyst for CBS News welcome to Sunday meeting the bronze [noise]\nGood Sunday morning and welcome to the choose your own adventure mid term elections\nIs there a democratic wave coming we've got data support that as a surge oppose cabinet enthusiasm for Republicans turn back the Democrats momentum there's data to support that or could this be a typical midterm with Democrats making just modesty there's data to support that too\nAnd we have plenty of new data this morning here's what our brand new NBC News Wall Street journal poll shows with just over two weeks to go until the mid term among registered voters Democrats hold a seven point lead in the generic ballot forty forty one that's down significantly from the twelve point lead Democrats held just a month ago pre Kavanaugh when it was fifty two forty\nBut wait there's more among likely voters the Democratic leader gross not shrinks goes to nine fifty to forty one here's why that's interesting\nIt's a first time ever in our polling that are likely voter model shows a better number for the Democrats than the registered voter number normally in midterms Republicans have the likely voter advantage so what's different this year it's the heightened enthusiasm for Democrats among millennials Latinos and younger women groups that historically\nUntil there is a completion of a third party investigation into this kidnap murder and God Knows what followed a that occurred in Istanbul and we should call on our allies to do the same unless the Saudi kingdom understands civilized countries around the world are going to reject this conduct and make sure that they pay a price for it they'll continue doing it\nThey have a ... a journalist who's currently in prison\nFor criticizing the Saudi regime there was another man will lead out care who is also facing president and torture if necessary by them a unless he changes his criticism of the ... if we want them to stop this and make it clear we don't accept that we need to be decisive expelled that journalist\nStop or assistance to their war in Yemen let them know they're going to pay a price\nDo you believe the crown prince was ordered this telling Senator Corker uh this morning says he believes that the crown prince himself ordered this\nBelieve in five of his time\nPersonal bodyguards or those among those currently accused in the Eighteen his personal bodyguards and one of them said publicly a year ago I don't move with I don't exist order from the executive the crown prince says his fingerprints all over this and the fact that he's heading up the investigation makes it totally incredible\nAlright Senator Dick Durbin I'm going to leave it there senator I appreciate your time and for coming on insurance is much appreciate it struck joining me now is the vice chair of the committee in charge of getting Senate Republicans elected or reelected it's time to list of North Carolina senator tell us welcome back to meet the press or\nGood morning let me start with the Saudi Arabia issue a and and the and the killing of Mr ... so do you probably may not have seen but at least heard that the timeline and took the Saudis Seventeen Days\nSame question that I had for Senator Durbin is there any part of the Saudi government's explanation that you find credible\nNo not at this point I agree with everything Dick Durban just said we've um we've got to get to the bottom of it and Saudi Arabia you do not do something of this magnitude without having clearance from the top we need to find out who that is and hold him accountable\nArgue is convinced is Senator Corker in Durban are as I just that that the crown prince himself ordered this telling\nWell it looks like it based on the people who were involved in the actual act I think that's why we need to help from the Turkish officials to get as much information as we have drawn conclusion and then there has to be a consequence for it\nWhat are the consequences to look like a ... is it ... and what is the goal of the consequences to get the Saudis the king to name a new crown prince what would be the goal of the punishment\nWell I think it is to hold people accountable who committed this horrible act and if it is the crown prince then I think that that is something that has to be explored I don't believe you can have someone\nWho would authorize the sort of an act being a position of power with a nation that's very important to us but we have to have limits as to how far away would go to work with them a in a very difficult complex part of the world and I think that we have to do the investigation with the intelligence\nCommunity with the Turkish officials Saudi officials outside of the crown prince to get to the bottom of it\nAre you at all concerned that the president seems to be um maybe more patient than necessary with the Saudi Government\nWell I think that oh you're saying as they are the public responds I Know that the state department the intelligence community in a number of other people are taking this seriously we've got a lot of resources focus on it and I think the president will take the appropriate action went all the facts around\nCan you imagine us having a relationship with the Saudi Government that's positive the crown prince is still there\nNo I don't think so I think again if the facts lead to what we all suspect they will I think it'll be very problematic for our relationship going forward\n[noise] let me move to the midterms the president says these midterms are about the following cab and all the care of and law and order and common sense you're the vice chair of the interests see is that the best summation or that you would advise Republican candidates to give up around the country I think\nThose are factors but I Believe historic job creation historically low unemployment among Latinos and African Americans the economic performance the the work that we've done to get NATO to contribute to our mutual defense there are a lot of things\nThat resonate with voters and again I look at the top one numbers that you gave earlier in a more specific why and how they're playing in states that were targeting and we're looking very good in a number of other states I fully expect we're going to add to our numbers in the Senate for the Republicans\nI Want to show you a column that a a ... a conservative ... wrote a in Bloomberg earlier this week\nAt the end of twenty Seventeen it was talking about the Republican agenda house Speaker Paul Ryan was pushing Republicans to take up well whatever form the Trump Administration talked up an infrastructure bill the party compromised by making a concerted effort on either but Republicans are asking for voters to augment that majority now and they still have no agenda\nWhat would you say is the case for re electing a Republican majority in the Senate going forward beyond just confirming judges I think\nYou go back to the age old question in elections do you feel better about your economic circumstances today than you did two years ago and I think the ... the answer that question is absolutely yes I think that most voters by their pocket book I Do believe the Kavanaugh um matter ended up\nIncreasing intensity on our side but are only slightly we typically have greater intensity going into the off year elections but I think this is about ah economic security economic growth those are promises that we've made and we've fulfilled it's difficult to get some of the things done we want to continue to work on infrastructure but an F a a bill\nThat the jobs the economy those are those sorts of things matter to the voters and I think they're going to put us in a great position in the Senate\nOne issue you didn't mention that Senator Durbin a mention nonstop was health care and these are pre existing conditions and twenty fourteen you ran I remember covering your race down there it's when we first met you ran as a repeal and replace Obamacare Republican\nWhy aren't we hearing that this time around we don't really hear Republicans talking about repeal and replace is it because of the popularity of the pre existing condition clubs\nNow what for one thing it's a false narrative to say that we want to remove preexisting conditions I filed a bill got several cosponsors to try and and and the vet than a lawsuit throws out the Affordable CARE Act we have to have a place for people with preexisting conditions to land we also have to allow\nA young adults under the age of twenty six to be on their parents' health care plan it is a\nFalse narrative to say that Republicans want to kill that it's simply not true and found out she has to do but in fairness you've had for years and the majority in the Senate to come up with an alternative in two years with full Republican controlled Washington yeah and I know you\nKnow how these two words probably better than I Do you got to get sixty votes to make that happen we did through reconciliation get rid of the individual mandate and take some of the underpinnings of the\nCARE Act out we've got to replace it in the same way that we've got to make sure that shows were ... the Social Security and Medicare can be paid for and medicate over time\nWhat what the Democrats are not mentioning are widely publicized reports that say if we stay on the current trajectory we're going to have a crisis in funding and those programs\nNo one wants to take away Medicare Social security or Medicaid from people who need it but we have to have a sustainable solution and we need sixty votes to get that done math is if\nAnd here in Washington nobody seems to want to ever site it but we have a record breaking deficit\nA record breaking debt everyday when you watch the debt clock but a record breaking deficit this year that may surpassed a trillion dollars\nYou're now annually never mind obviously the multiple multiples of that in the debt the president yesterday talking about a new tax cut you're talking about reforming Social Security and Medicare ... where are you how you got to pay for this tax cuts that the president is apparently proposed\nWhile we've got to make sure that it's at least a support it by facts round dynamic growth that has to pay for itself we can't go further in debt I voted against the spending bill I'm the most recent one because it was just too much money being spent a\nAnd and so we've got to we've got to get the American people to recognize that we had a powder keg of dynamite and the debt that continuing to grow we're reaching a point where the service to our debt service could exceed\nOur contribution in our investment in the military we've got to make sure that the American people understand we've got to balance our our books we got to be on a budget just like the American people\nYou just said you wanted that any new tax cut to pay for itself up this current cat tax cuts clearly not paying for itself the debts increasing not decreasing and there's no sign that it's going to decrease well if you take a look\nAt the scoring for economic growth over time we can I I think that there is a way to\nRationalize that does tax cut will pay for itself through sustained economic growth we don't make the numbers at wall but if we do and we're already seeing it early into this cycle than I Do believe that way create an incremental revenue is not going to be enough to come anywhere close to retiring are Twenty one trillion dollars in debt that's where we are going to have to look at\nTough choices so that we can balance our books\nCenter of town tell us Republican from North Carolina I'm going to leave it there thanks for coming up sharing it'd be as much per thank you when we come back\nMore on those mid term elections which is stronger the Republicans opposed to having\nThe same democratic angry at President Trump handle is that as we go to some of what I heard this week from voters\nFrom Arizona [noise]\n\n\nNone of those people\nUsing\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops of valor saying some experts say another crashes coming what will be left of your investments for your children are your grandchildren will you know you can't fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins in an IRA for us too precious metals\nIn September the ... the split between what who they want to be in control of Congress among people that have a negative on both parties was advantage Democrats but narrowly forty three thirty eight a look at this number here in October among those that are negative on both is suddenly a an open break here towards the Democrats fifty nine Seventeen\nUm that's what we saw with Donald Trump Peggy was narrow interests\nAmber October came and the next the ones that were negative on both broke heavily towards Donald Trump what does that time\nAnd now it's breaking heavily towards the Democrats in general yeah hordes towards that kind of thing um I don't know exactly what it means my sense in this campaign in a way to pop off something you said Katie is that there are a lot of different local issues coming up\nThat had something to do with the overall trend I'm also wondering if issues like Dick Durbin mentioned started saying those Republicans are going to cut your Social Security they're going to cut air Medicare cutting their Medicaid that something that's going to be coming up\nSo I and many people who had supported Donald Trump were very don't touch my Social Security Medicare Medicaid so maybe a little bit of that is going on\nI've had anecdotal evidence from some uh from some Republicans who say they're nervous at some Trump voters may vote democratic because they trusted Donald Trump that's who they trust and they want to have a you know what punish the\nWritten I don't really like the Republican Party or a Republican and how they're\nGoing out in the campaign trail making at all about himself why you're saying I Am at the top of that second even though I'm not at the top of the ticket don't vote for Republicans are not voting for me it's making it about\nTrump or I guess I have to posit here will pick it up we're going to get into the\nWeeds and some of these races next time we bring back when we come back on the revolving door and the Trump or the\nCounsel Don McGahn became the latest person to go through the door\nAnd one man that is here to tell us about what it's like\nTo go through the revolving door and worked for President Trump is Anthony Scaramucci

Trump Administration has broken records for turnover among staffers on the west wing just this week White House counsel Don McGahn left his job after months of speculation that after successfully shepherding Kavanaugh's confirmation to the U.S Supreme Court\nAlready to White House is on its second cheapest at its third national security adviser and its theft communications director the person with me or most noteworthy and shorter\nIn in the west wing is one of those five Anthony Scaramucci well at the white asked me to shop for just eleven days he's out with a new book about his time though in President Trump's orbit particularly before he became President Trump the blue collar president\nAnd he joins me now Mr Scaramucci what can we just had to Sunday so the timing of your book are coming out comes as we get reports of a screaming match between a a former boss of yours John Kelly current cheapest at the national security adviser John Bolton was over\nThe issue of immigration was clear it was it according to our sources it was\nOver some comments that national security adviser made to the secretary of homeland security a former deputy to the chief of staff\nJohn Kelly apparently walked out furious there were rumors of a [noise] a potential resignations out how and there was at St ... was that\nSeem to you was there any profanity I mean that could have been right so we're at possibly some profanity look this is really not that familiar to me and you have to remember my incident was on the phone with a reporter who I shouldn't have trusted in so that's my fault and I totally on that but I think the more relevant thing is you\nKnow people are playing in the NFL and verbal contacts and so people playing very hard for the president um I don't know what happened in that specific incident and um but you know I I Know that the west wing and the way the president set up the west wing it it's it's tough in there for ...\nYou were pretty tough though in General Kelly in your book I'm going to put up an extra pair the general style\nWould be in direct conflict with the way Mr Trump had always conducted business President Trump doesn't work in a precise way right never has never will it's been over a year since John Kelly became White House chief of staff but my scouting report early on proved to be quite accurate his personal in security has proven to be a poor match with the self confident gregarious president\nLook I think that's pretty self evident I mean just even this past week you know I applaud the general service of the country I'm obviously forty years in the U.S Marine Corps but this is a very different job this is a civilian based job and I think he's tried to apply\nMilitary like management style to a group of civilians and so that doesn't necessarily work and and\nAnd by the way you know the the president has a free wheeling style is very different\nFrom a a John Kelly's you feel personally mistreated by John Kelly it seems pretty you've seen pretty upset at him and his book well listen not you know he didn't need to fire me the way fired me and I had this conversation with the president you could have done it in a different manner totally I mean come I gave a tremendous amount of money to campaign raised a tremendous amount of money\nOr did countless hours of media advocacy during the campaign and the transition and even after\nPresident was inaugurated a there was a better way to fire me but he was trying to make a spectacle out of it and so he got the spectacle that he wanted and it\nOn the other side of this coin those who strongly disapprove of this president blame none other than the president himself followed closely by the Republican Party but even amongst\nThose with mutual feelings about President Trump's job performance\nThey still blame him for the country's divisions followed closely by the Democratic party and liberal and they throw us in the media in as well what it is not breaking news of the country is divided\nBut after being out on the road this week I felt there is a sense of exhaustion anxiety over this division and this whole proves it and it told voters do punished politicians for creating these divides\nRight now there's no incentive for them to lead by example when we come back and game and why Democrats hope history\nThink a coda to the divide segment I just had one thing we do agree upon in this country is that we are so divided\nUh we've had a couple of mob scenes where ... where leaders of the Democrats and Republicans were both publicly harassed here's this scene a with a house democratic leader Nancy Pelosi down in Miami earlier this week\nThey kind of Republican Party chairman actually apologized for the treatment of that meanwhile Mitch McConnell the Senate Republican leader or TMZ posted this video from friday night in a restaurant in ... he is getting harassed take a listen [noise]\n\n[laughter]\nYou know Peggy Noonan each each party and I've watched them and it really disgusted me they tried to weaponize these interest the these incidents on the other sites like look at what an angry mob saying on the left or what these angry people on the way we have been great people left and right now than made up its ugly it's bad and and I think leaders of both parties need to accept\nThat somebody's got to come down we've got two weeks to go people are on edge there fighting the fact that we live in the media world we live and means everything taped so everybody can see it and everybody can get a little bit matter\nBut I think somebody has to come forward maybe a group of people\nAnd say you know what everybody come down normally that we're in a democracy that maybe we can work\nThis president of the United states ways bragging about Bob later he cannot\nDo that he's not really in a position to he could be one of many voices\nThat the president does it obviously a and it works with his base but at the same time look on the other side already I recalled or kick 'em right um yeah a Nancy Pelosi collateral damage Hillary Clinton where all civilian and they can start\nI think you have to acknowledge that the heating up of the rhetoric and the and the anger and the punch him in the faith in the body plan on that started when Donald Trump started campaigning and suddenly you move the ... Congress\nSaid well down for a while there's something about family animal variants which\nWas from ... in ... along people too intensely about this report it will come down here in Studio ... I'm not sure if\nThis is you know we're coming up to the really important election and our constitution guarantees people what right do they do but if you're into or such as what they\nSay is encouraged though ... it's it's encouraging every facet and you have an ... when you get on social media\nAll you see is this person is evil or that person is the devil at thank you so much for for hitting back at that person you see that in every aspect of the ocean and I mean even when we do interviews and you even I have talked about this with\nWithout either person either side of the of the political spectrum you'll have raw story coming out and saying oh Chuck Todd slams down ... or ... or ripped apart why is it that it's the way we talk about sale and well and the way things are describe that's dividing the\nCountry I was going to say the voter is responsible as well for this how they get their information or they go into cocooned on both sides and so there was a responsibility there was well\nCan I tell you also too many people are living just for politics they see themselves as political beings they go forward into the world with political anger\nWe are narrowing what we are Americans used to think of themselves as religious beings people love the team this and that it's now like I'm about politics I'm going to get your face it's wicked and it's not going to help\nBut haul attrition to fail for so long for decades and decades along comes Donald Trump the great disruptor and he is channeled into that and my point simply is is that when you go after thirty forty years of this look you're going to have issues of where we are today on a world\nJeeze I'm sixty acres additional election um everybody on where's all this energy go out and vote\nDon't don't scream but don't harass vote that should be our knew or knew among try anyway a thank you all by the way you guys were disagreeing without being disagreeable we can set a great example for America that's all we have for today\nThank you for watching we'll be back next week because of its Sunday and it's the week before the election\nMy image\n\n\nABC News [noise]\nI'm Dario all they are the mid term elections are less than two weeks away and President Trump will be on the campaign trail much of the time until then he'll travel to Houston tomorrow to stump for Senator Ted Cruz the two were bitter rivals during the twenty sixteen GOP presidential campaign but Cruz's now locked in a close race with Democrat that over\nThere were some hurt feelings in some false accusations but I asked both Ted Cruz about it I asked his father ... and his father said look we have a country to say we have a state to say he says we are going to put those differences aside and stand shoulder to shoulder ... unbelievable considering what was that\nABC is Paula Ferris the president says a caravan of Central American migrants trying to make their way to the U.S border is a sign that immigration reform is long overdue ABC's met government in southern Mexico\nWhich I'm not Mexican authorities offering asylum to control the flow and that's the vast majority of migrants toning it down for now\nDetermined to reach America\nBut President Trump valley a bit of Mexican authorities don't stop them he will the\nPresident also tweeting today that the caravan is a disgrace to the Democratic party on Tuesday Turkish officials are expected to announce the results of their investigation into the death of journalists ...

president's when it comes to discussing long term care and whether they handle the insurance peace or whether they have a partner or a strategic relationship with somebody who focuses on this it is still an important part of the wealth management discussion now\nWhen we look at what exactly is long term care well\nLong term care as a range of services and supports that you may need to meet your personal care needs and as as the term suggest it is generally\nOver the course of a longer term so something that is short term\nA few days you know there are certain insurance coverage is that that you'll have that will cover that sort of thing but you know most long term care is not medical care it is assistance with the basic personal tasks of everyday life this is sometimes referred to\nIn the insurance industry as activities of daily living or a deals now\nThe insurance industry has defined\nWhat these activities of daily living are in the medical industry is is kind of piggyback along with it and they defined it as you know the basics of of living are bathing so your ability to bathe yourself dressing your ability\nTo get dressed and function in in that way putting clothes on getting yourself ready to face the day the next thing is using the toilet what is your ability\nTo use the toilet do you need assistance in terms of that particular activity of daily living they also consider something called transferring which is really transferring from one spot to the next so from the bed to a chair or vice versa\nThe next thing is caring for incontinence and the last real activity of daily living that they they evaluate is your ability to feed yourself so eating the other piece of this puzzle that will come in when it when looking at whether or not you'll need long term care in the services is your cognitive\nFunction or you with it mentally\nIll a lot of your wives in the ladies that might be listening right now you you may immediately think well my husband's

need that care\nIt's not exactly like planning a vacation but it is an important piece\nThat you have to evaluate and really a couple of things that that you need to look at on the front end in and if you want to look at this if you want to actually start to address this in at least engage in the conversation that says hey I acknowledge this is a risk\nShould I look at this risk in in how should I

the website or You're welcome to request one of the reports that we have available specific on long term care which is focused on\nThe cost of care ... identifying what it might cost and really that's going to be the first step\nAs you look at addressing this risk is realizing the potential likelihood that exists and the potential costs\nThat are involved and let let's start with the cost and where you could receive care as you think about everything that you should know when it comes to long term care in addressing that risk\nAs I mentioned earlier the preference for most individuals in terms of where they receive cares in their home in fact the vast majority of all long term care services are in the individuals home fortunately that's the the desired spot I'm\nThis is his name for for me I thought oh I Hope one eight six six info for me I\nGuess is the usa financial radio show\nOnce again here's Mars Mars but\nLooking back to the program we've been discussing long term care and evaluating this risk because the biggest threat to the long term success [noise]\nWell it's not exactly the most enjoyable conversation it is very important conversation to have and I want to start out now by looking at\nThe need for a long term care arises [noise]\nThere are essentially for different ways that it can be paid for the very first one is looking at insurance is do you have any insurance that you put in place to help pay for some or all of the long term care needs so if that's not the case the next step is\nSelf funding with your own personal assets indoor getting assistance from family now that might be financial assistance from family and or that could also mean some degree of the care is provided by family now this is a very\nCommon occurrence oftentimes if if the insurance isn't in place the family will step in and at least initially they might help provide some of that assistance when it comes to the the physical care aspect of it now the last piece of the puzzle there in terms of how it could be paid for his medicate\nAnd we'll talk about that in a moment because a lot of people are have different understanding or the wrong understanding of when Medicaid might step in and what that situation looks like for them so it's first of all talk real quickly about\nSelf funding with with your own assets so if you decide you're going to be self insure you're going to pay pay this ... this need or this cost for the long term care and eat out of your own pocket\nThere are some pros to the the the biggest pro obviously is if if you decide on the front end that you're going to self insure and pay for it out of your own pocket if you don't end up having a need there is zero cost to you there is zero impact on your portfolio and you did not\nPay for insurance along the way so theoretically there's a when they're financially now the assets that you save\nBy not investing in insurance they're not paying for insurance you theoretically could turn around and invest\nAnd hopefully there would be some gain there on that pool of money now the downsides are obvious so when we're looking at evaluating pros and cons of this the downsides are obvious\nAny long term care expenses are coming directly from distributions from your financial assets so not only are you staring at a potential hit to your portfolio you're also staring at\nA potential hit to your income stream as as a family unit so especially if you have a spouse or all of a sudden if if dollars have to be redirected towards your care their standard of living changes in a hurry now if you elect to go the self insurance route also\nAnd decide well I'm going to try to invest what I normally would have spent on insurance\nThere's obviously going to be some investment risks for that underlying portfolio in there's there are certainly going to be some difficulty in terms of managing the assets managing the payments and that's that's one of the I guess the big advantages to having insurance involved is that\nMany of the insurance programs out there will take a more active role in helping you to identify the care that you're going to need the care options that you have an ultimately setting up how it is that that care will be paid for\nSo let's transition assuming that you say you know something\nI wanted to address this risk through insurance rather than through my own assets paying for for myself what are the options insurance wise so\nThere are essentially two different options you have from an insurance perspective the first is what's commonly known as traditional long term care insurance\nThis is very much akin to\nYour homeowner's insurance your automobile insurance where you specified a specific risk in this case it's it's the need for a long term care you've identified what your coverage parameters might be so that traditional long term care insurance policy might\nCover you for X amount of years up to X amount of dollars per month and there are certain stipulations that will be involved within that policy coverage but\nEssentially you are going to then make a monthly premium payment or an annual premium payment just like you would on the automobile or the homeowner's insurance now\nThe biggest upside for this is that you are now you transferred the the big risk as we talked about earlier that the threat of the the huge costs that eighty thousand dollars a year that Ninety thousand dollars a year of the nursing home you transfer that risk\nOnto an insurance company\nThe other potential advantage there is that there may be some degree of tax deducted ability on those insurance premiums so again this is something that needs to be evaluated big picture with your financial professional with a tax advisor\nIf you want to take that first step we're talking with you today and and encouraging you\nTo engage in a long term care readiness checkup and it's really ...\nThat's where the conversation addressing and looking at the risk and looking at your personal situation you can take advantage of this by giving us a call at AAA triple eight Ninety five Seventy two to eight eight eight eight eight eight nine five seven to or you can visit is on line at usa financial radio dot com\nSimply punch in your ZIP Code get connected with your local usa financial radio advisor\nHit that button that says talk with an advisor and you can shoot them a note saying you know something I Want to have a conversation about long term care or maybe you want to have a conversation about something else within your your financial life\nReally to start that conversation is going to be important so\nAs we look at the downsides to traditional long term care insurance these are the things these are the reasons that will commonly hear why people decide not to purchase long term care insurance and interestingly enough a lot of them are the same reasons why\nFinancial professionals decide not to even talk with you about it the first is\nIf you don't end up needing care and you go through life pass away without ever needing that long term care that those insurance premiums\nAnd the traditional insurance policy are gone you will you theoretically wasted those dollars if you want to look at it like that however it may be it gave you the confidence over the course of your retirement to no way I had you know I've I've got this this risk address so the\nThe if you don't use it you're going to lose that mindset is one reason the other thing is\nThe cost the annual cos it's maybe prohibitive maybe the cost is higher than you want\nAnd the other big piece of it and if you've talked with anybody recently who has purchased traditional long term care who has owned it for a number of years the biggest knock on traditional long term care today is that those premiums\nAre not locked in stone over the course of your life\nSo you might see big premium hikes so these spikes in your premium increases of twenty percent forty percent sixty percent one hundred percent we've seen this happen and you feel a little bit like you're stuck\nYou've been paying some premiums for these years\nA number that you felt was affordable and then all of a sudden they come and stick it to you and increase your premium costs at a time when frankly you're not in the spot to all of a sudden boost your income in any way shape or form so that's a big risk you know here's the thing\nA lot of financial professionals don't like that and so they say well I'm just not going to deal with it and what's what's really interesting in part if you get down to the root of what's causing this\nAs we've seen in the interest rate environment go down to next to nothing right now and as you look at how these insurance companies\nAre able to offer these policies if once you understand the economics of it you can kind of understand why there is a need for that premium increase when insurance company prices this out when the price of policy out they anticipate\nA certain percentage of people lap seeing their policy just stopping payment\nWell what they found is that that hasn't been happening nearly to the degree that they thought it would and so you couple that with a low interest rate environment so that\nThe investments that they're making with those premium dollars within their general fund are becoming more and more difficult to earn a higher respectable rate of return and so you've seen in turn these increases in fact\nYou've got that hundred thousand dollar initial deposit that you put in\nYou then would have a death benefit so in the event that you passed away and so I ... the example I'm giving use for sixty year old female in relatively good health so keep in mind that that these numbers are going to vary depending on your age and your gender and all that good stuff\nIn that instance a hundred thousand dollar premium that initial deposit there is a death benefit associated with it a one hundred and Ninety six thousand dollars so that that initial one hundred thousand dollars you never have to put any more in in this example that we're sharing with you\nYou have a death benefit of one hundred and Ninety six thousand dollars so let's just assume that you go through your life you never ever needed\nAny kind of long term care services you passed away\nYou would have a hundred and Ninety six thousand dollars income tax free that would be passed down to your beneficiary now if it's a spouse if it's a kid whatever it might be this sort of addresses that well what if I don't use it\nObjection that that excuse that reason for not liking long term care insurance that addresses that\nNow let's just say that you actually did need some long term care services the way that this policy works in the the one that we're talking about specifically is from a particular insurance company but there are a few different options out there so I don't want to get hung up on the product or the the actual company that offers at\nUsa financial we are advisors are independent advisors and so\nThey take shopping this in evaluating different options very seriously so let's not get hung up on a company or are the specific product but the idea here is that\nIf you needed long term care it leverage is that third bucket so that you had that first bucket of your initial premium that deposit you've got the second bucket which is the death benefit in this case a hundred and Ninety six thousand dollars\nAnd then there's the third bucket and this example of four hundred and forty four thousand dollars which is a pool essentially of money\nThat's leveraged off of this this life insurance and long term care combo that you can reach into in the event that you need coverage for long term care\nNow there are of course going to be specific rules within the policy in terms of how you can access it how it works\nBut at its most rudimentary level it's creating a few different buckets that you have a premium in one policy or one bucket that benefit another and then a third bucket of a long term care pool of money\nAnd again if you didn't need that long term care pool no harm no foul you have that death benefit to fall back on\nI gave me an example of a ... but one time deposits at one time premium payment of there are options for you\nThat can be monthly payments or in your payments and that sort of thing but I wanted to the reason why I'm sharing this with you is is a part of the long term care readiness check up in the emergency action plan we're going to evaluate\nAnd we encourage you to look at all the different options in terms of how you can pay\nFor this potential threat to your retirement\nIf you've taken nothing away from today show I Hope that you take just this one thing which is this is a very real risk and if you're nearing retirement or if you're in retirement and you haven't at the very least addressed\nHow you would pay for this need this long term care needed in the event that it came about in your life or your spouse's life\nI urge you to do so today you are not going to be any healthier ten years from now than you are today so I urge you take
