trying to throw down and didn't do\nHe had the the back right there Kennedy McCoy at the beginning didn't get it to him so probably going to cost safety here never take the ball out to thirty to fourteen and West Virginia will have to have to point out a way to um on the free kick it was going to be a hold on West Virginia\nOld man's own thank you can it's a safety yep [noise] thirty to fourteen read [laughter] talk about I mean who is not a lot of good but you don't think the fence simply they played that poorly and is that right well you\nGo back to to what the what we had the first half we settled we held we gave up twenty points quickly at the beginning of the game and we gave up a began at the end of it to give us the chance so fighting chance there are some positives there are a lot of twos in there right now uh-huh encouraged Gibson and his staff have been a good job getting them in the right\nPlaces now have been made this place\nWe see in that time and time again I missed tackled fade over and over but we're trying to do the right thing defensive what often simply\nI Can't defend but I I I wouldn't\nI cannot remember a performance this this poor in terms of play calling and maybe the last ten years or certain game comes to mind that I was a part of it was another hard burger but you just can't figure out what's going on as a fan what are we doing as a

Tina that far I don't know if you go that far um twelve somewhere I'm I'm thinking\nMaybe around Fifteen but uh yeah he has another ... here's the other thing too that that's exactly right for it you've got a bunch of other teams in the top ten that have lost Miami is on the verge of losing\nUm George only out of the top ten oh yeah definitely out unless they have enough things to get into the top\nTen honestly I'll be interested to see what happens is how far UCF moves up after you know they look like they were on the ropes today and they managed to win and everybody ahead of them in the in the tops and ah that was on upset alert did get upset\nJeff Jeff you're watching this as they was talking it seemed like give me a lot of guys open down field where\nI I I don't know Steve\nGetting there what do you what ... what do you don't usually did you see that Steve I out of those deep crossers were talking about it looks like they're wide open and we'll just seems on hold on to the ball\nWas nice to see the crosses at the end of the game and the fourth quarter [laughter] yeah but I remember it was three quarters ago and at that point it was a two ... it was a to score game I mean still that game was not over with and had the games are with now I'll Israel's the game was over with now but if you had\nA quick score there which was a possibility now NSA one score game and all of a sudden you know if you want to better actually\nYou're right but the possibility really just exist in the abstract than that I mean you didn't see anything that gave you any evidence I mean you're technically right what you're saying but you hadn't seen any evidence that this all fence was remotely capable of getting you anything tonight so I mean this has\nFelt over guys from the very beginning of the game I mean you got about three minutes into this thing after ... for that first touchdown\nThought okay here you go to Iowa State bounces right that this thing's been over since then and it hasn't been closed\nYou know what are your exactly right about that but uh I understand the thought of hey West Virginia is going to make that big play you know they're going to get that Seventy five yard touchdown somebody's going to make a big play down the field that just didn't happen tonight no not at all with\nSix forty seven remaining in the first quarter West Virginia scored on the Eighteen yard past David Sills since then that one defense or a special teams touchdown that's it\nWell if I'm On my reading this chart right can someone interpret the chart because I Can't be reading this right West Virginia did not cross midfield once the only time it did was off the turnover when it started in Iowa State territory recon I get Sestak in a can I get a second opinion here I'm looking at a chart that shows West Virginia\nIs often could not get across midfield\nGood lord well they had they had to write or email a right to that I'm looking at right now is that there's not mad across many election was made on their on their side of the other day when I started over that ... itself did not cross midfield why don't we get too close bread right now I'll be honest\n[laughter] we're working at a drive chart gracious [laughter] that I Know I Wish they had the front loaded schedule but the thing is is a two and three team two and three teen Brett you're losing to here I don't listen to a top twenty five ... Fifteen\nTeam that's the other point I made two and three give them a ton of credit they've had a better scheme they'd been better coached they've had better execution tonight but you're right this isn't Oklahoma from last year this is not Alabama although it does look that way tonight and this hasn't even been remotely close\nWhere we all predict and I think when when somebody's rather run at us\nWhen it's like the big ag states you get you guys remember oh have you seen two and three tied into full back in the game and and it was\nGetting big and beat him up goes everybody thought she was light and you couldn't order up against the run so that's what you got a lot up so you know give me a little shorter and personnel far as having big guys he lost his starting Sam for the season so he's playing in the back of families in the third third banned it in the second my backer so\nIf you go back and and you look at Iowa State and what they've done the season I as you mentioned Steve they lost my town and Iowa Thirteen to three they lost my ten\nNow and then panic and remember the Allegheny last call camp right game so that they put the backup in which wouldn't ... or the kid ... done\nBut they lost about ten against Oklahoma and they lost by three at TCU so it you know like a ... again they can play they can play they can play the record not impressed me they were two and three they beat Akron and ah\nSo don't let two three four yeah\nRight well I don't like All right side do at two and three fully and all that use that as right however yeah this was in a close knit the buds field goal to win the game is not a total complete disaster offensively\nFor West Virginia fourteen points we'll we'll throws for a hundred yards you run the ball for whatever only nine yards ... you don't have a drought yeah seven points by the officer right you don't have a Dr Laura ... yards it did I I mean again give Iowa State credit this is a complete debacle disaster\nFrom West Virginia away all the way around coaching plane execution plan readiness adjustments\nAll of it as a complete disaster but what you said it's going to get a lot tougher on West Virginia come November maybe you were just a little two weeks late it's maybe a gotten ... ... yeah I just started tonight yeah started tonight maybe maybe there's West Virginia team\nHow many of us really thought West Virginia was the number six theme of the country anyway after watching them play the last two or three games like anyone did\nKnow but here's what I again what I didn't think I didn't think I'd be sitting here after a game going through all of those problems offensively if you would have totally Iowa State was going to win this game okay I could have bought that I Know that I spent all we talking about the situation of ads I get at a loss could have happened tonight it's the way in which West Virginia law that I think is not only disappointing\nRush gets alarming like I mean if I if I say Ryan's I'm asking for some questions man I'm saying what in the hell\nHappened out there are guys that was his batter performance with as good as often as you could possibly imagine tonight\nWest Virginia is five in one I think it's fair to say with the remaining games that we have on the schedule Baylor\nTexas TCU Oklahoma State Oklahoma\nIt could be five and six oh ...\nOh no way we played the way ... denies the way the mountain display tonight where they play like that sure the way they played a one quarter to games ago the way they blade one quarter one game of go the way they played all night to night\nJust saying it could happen everyone's looking at me like I'm Crazy\nExcept for the other these almost all my son is closed one eight hundred seven six five eight to five five is the number to call if you'd like to get involved in the conversation tonight but\nAh no one can be happy with this performance tonight by West Virginia university thirty to forty seeing the final score every every stat that you look at is embarrassing for the mountaineers every stat again number of plays tonight and\nThat was a now it looks more like what we thought it was going to look like Brett how forty two for West Virginia Seventy two for Iowa State and that's what it felt like all night\nLong how many places for West Virginia forty to forty two right and a sixty minute game yes I was living with this off and see what these weapons with this talent right forty two Seventy two summers aren't right in three ball club I I was ... I Can't come up with any stronger words for help out of her performance as was\nI bet you good [laughter]\nWe are are they are going to wind down time out yeah okay I have a ... we go back to twenty twelve were fifth Frank team in the country and Gino\nSo I had some serious far apart often we go down laying eggs against Texas that can get blown off the field so it happens it happens again\nIt happened again they've can you find a bright spot\nMan it's hard um blocked a bill go return for lunch down there at one there's one there's one end of ... you didn't a grid and get hurt 'em\nWhether to take a look at the injury report how it plays out not a lot of not a lot of positives here ah you know I was railing and a half to ... I'm I'm like a broken record\nWanting West Virginia to run the football more at least attempt to run the football\nThey tried they tried 'em in the third quarter you know they seem determined to give Kennedy McCoy the ball and they just couldn't block it um yeah I was the stuff that I Would say one all categories\nI mean if you think about it what would the score this game have been if I was special teams had been average tonight I mean\nThey missed a field goal that was make a bowl that goes on an extra point\nThey had a field goal that was blocked that was a return for a touchdown it could have been worse and it's not going to point to a ... a more lopsided game\nAll night long West Virginia with the two running backs they employ denied carry the ball Seventeen times Seventeen Montgomery wow estate Gary to Jeff Jenkins twenty nine times oh yeah you control like you\nGuys are are coaches here in the former players or Steve read I mean if if you if you can run the football right then you can do everything else\nIt's always been that way he asked everyone to change you know you have total control of the game you eat the clock up you keep the other team off the field and forces you're placing on receivers cause you got to put gas in the box which is near after great pitching catch\nNow here here is here we know we're going to have they been hoping to some point here tonight we'll hear what he has to say but here's a question for me in a horse and is will Greer hurt\nIs he hurt\nHis feelings or heard on the other questions about that I mean there there's the answer the question there's been no indication from anybody associated with the program that there's any kind of injury I Know he took that hit last week that should have been called targeting on his head it wasn't but we have seen no evidence no indication that he's got anything wrong with them physically\nWe know if you take a look at a ball that he threw tonight I'm he was on target I mean a Lebanon Fifteen and with a couple of dropped if he's heard it wasn't a indicated in the way he threw the football when he had time to throw it he just didn't have time to throw at seven ...\nI had time to throw it sometimes you just didn't throw it they take a break we come back we'll get your school board update take your phone calls at one eight hundred seven six five eight to five five you can text us at three or four eight to five five three or four back with more on the rapid show\nThe brain has been called the final frontier in medicine the experts that that WVU Rockefeller nurse Science Institute are pioneering\nNew treatment on all the time is Parkinson's addiction and mourn with new technology medications and innovation we are transforming the lives of\nPeople with brain and neurological disorders for West Virginia for the world that WVU Rockefeller nurse Science Institute visit W.

know the top like play off the well and what not yawn if you really get out so he's got a week and a half the coach them up and I really do think he's going to take a more active role and everything\nOh buddy we appreciate the phone call I think you are you a head coach just won't go following what even just\nThe just remember this he I guarantee you do in the office of meetings he has a lot of input there's no doubt you know that that's what he had that's what he does\nYeah and that and you're right this is on all of them in the caller's right you know it's amazing you go from five

Baylor is not a great team but they're sneaky good enough to beat ya they're getting better they are I had really almost you almost got out last last year I mean this is a team now if you're West Virginia\nI don't think it's unfair right now the question everything they're doing especially on the defensive side I think we all agree you knew what the defense of holes were going to be a lot of

WC HGF network dot com\nAlways had one eight hundred and Seventy six five to five five bucks shows\nLeft the number to call one eight hundred seven six five eight to five five give us a call we'd like to see what you think about this West Virginia University of football gene\nI came into the game tonight in Ames, Iowa white ranked number six in the country five in oh I really had the inside track to or certainly the conference championship game and a may still have we'll just have to wait and see how\nThe next six weeks or so developed but they lose the night thirty to forty gene in a bread how I Know that you've been a little busy\nSo [laughter] I'm doing more typing over now than I ... a lot of tax coming in at three zero for eight to five five three zero for\nLet's try and mine's few a few or mine through some of the here's one the fence is not elite Greer on the fence overhyped they did not respond to pressure like major and patch teams that it's all needs to be replaced no adjustments more shutdown shorter routes poor coaching I've been saying that all year\nThat's one another tax\nWhat is damaging the w._b. gets the opportunity to be on the national stage both in raking in with the Heisman candidate candidate and waste it once again\nThey lost in a tough battle is one thing but a thorough embarrassment is unacceptable and I ... that that to me is the biggest point right there it wasn't a last chances are that you're not going to go through a season undefeated there's just not many of those anymore\nBut this wasn't just the last this is a total collapse\nAnd it leaves you wondering what's happening moving forward\nAnd the season the next ... says state to say there's not a team left on the schedule that can't be West Virginia ... that's very very true\nWe're you know I don't know about Oklahoma State I don't know I don't know for Oklahoma State towards play the way they did the night they have a man I don't know here's the other thing too I I Know we're all upset but this was one score game going to the fourth quarter a\nIt was amazing the west Virginia was still in the game the stats for those wanting to the other way but I mean this was a one score game in the fourth quarter\n... recalls a defense gave you a chance yeah yeah yeah I ... I mean you're technically rocket of course on that that is hard to find any solace in that the way this off and split\nThe other thing I wanted to go back to just\nAnd they just said about how rich rod after that last in Tampa to the bulls a few years ago immediately turned the page and and basically started focusing on the positive\nOf all the goals still being there I mean ... West Virginia is still in that position if you take a look at it I mean the only team and the big twelve right now tonight\nThat controls its own destiny is Texas Texas is undefeated in conference boy therefore no now West Virginia's got lost Oklahoma's gun laws and technically a Texas Tech is right there there too and one as well\nBut West Virginia will play Texas West Virginia will play Oklahoma if they take care of their business in those games going forward all their goals are still there I mean realistically how many of us thought they were going to go undefeated\nWell I I I agree with everything you just said there are ... you know and when you look at it number to Georgia last number six West Virginia last number seven Washington last number eight Penn State all last day that that's a true fact however I think what Brad was saying earlier\nThat you have to take into consideration it wasn't so much that West Virginia got beat right it's how they got beat in how they looked getting beat that I think is reason\nFor concern absolutely right and again I think if you would come in here and this would have been a lost that you lost forty five to forty two because the defense couldn't stop David Montgomery I would've said alright disappointing loss but she thought the defense may struggle\nThere without a bunch of guys they were ... you were playing guys out a position he would've said All right now you got to move on to lose the game was seven authentic points a hundred yards passing five plays as your longest drive I think that\nThat's what I'm Talking about here this isn't just they lost or discussion about a law into effect on the manner in which he did a total beat down right to again all due respect Iowa State\nAid to in three team this this wasn't a top five team this was an Eighteen that's going to go when the big twelve conference it was a two and three team that absolutely demolish do and took you apart especially on the offensive side\nAnd it takes that even further you mentioned the one hundred yards passing off inch and that was Fifteen more yards and what we had on the ground eighty five yards of rushing off since that's the part that you just boggles your mind really\nI think the part of it that really shakes the media and the fans to the core here is you know you always kind of felt that West Virginia in every game they're often could keep them in it you know we spend a lot of time before the season began\nTalking about the defense because the ... was going to be okay or at least that was the theory right West Virginia was score and forty points to a game or Greer look great was a Heisman candidate\nA West Virginia when you're looking at the stable back so they started the season with four guys when you thought all of them could be a potential start as well so forget the the fact that brown did not play tonight he might have made a difference in the ... who knows I we're just dealing with the the reality that\nMaybe it's going to take a little bit more than I'm finding a way to out score people just overwhelming them with West Virginia's often because it didn't show up tonight\nWell you you know you look at the fact that West Virginia did non score offensively for the last forty two minutes and Eighteen seconds that's football\nJust annexed political bent inexplicable and again it all goes back down through the possibility that you have multiple weapon wise we've always said you want to take David cells away find you die and Gary ... he went to ... find markets them you want to try and take two receivers away here comes the tide ends\nMean Trayvon west you won catch where was your Vonnie Haskins where with the check down to any receivers out of the backfield my reading this right there's not a receiver that caught a ball tonight there wasn't a single receiver they caught a ball on a check down past there wasn't any of that\nNone of it you mean it back to\nCut back on that field yeah just run some back on the back to throw scream pastoral hit send him in the middle of the field drop it down in there wasn't one of the Kennedy outgoing editing L yeah you're right that really yeah see that's just why aren't you write a Kennedy\nMcCoy was the only one yeah unbelievable to get I think that goes back to the fact we were talking about as well we'll ... did not look for that check down he was looking for the home run ball\nFourteen targets Fort teen targets they're fourteen attempts obviously fourteen [laughter]\nTo do that to Dr ...\nYou're so right you're so right so again now all of the things that we've talked about\nMaybe just throw it out for it maybe just throw it out why don't you think you have to I I don't know maybe it's just so it's just so but I Would throw it out again I said as if they would have been playing better offensively in the two gangs prior to this\nWe brought it up in the shows that we've done after those wins we brought it up the boy they didn't look good in that second half against ... was the ...\nOr they didn't look good in that first half against Kansas right Kansas yeah now that they didn't look good at all so I I agree with you I think it's been building and building and tonight I don't know\nThey ran into a really good coaching staff\nThey ran a marathon getting that went to a scam yeah I'd give a ton of credits I always say that staff and Matt Campbell and there the whole defensive staff a tremendous job by them they were clearly the more prepared of the two teams they had a much better scheme they didn't deviate from it and it all work tonight give them a lot of crime\nYou guys said earlier that they felt good about what they did last year in the second half played hard after falling behind West Virginia and came out of that thing we could have won this football\n... difference there as well\nThis one\nGame six games in a place that the boys are probably going to get a little bit behind a ... century I don't even know if their injuries but they hurt a lot more when you're getting your car with we'll reevaluate where we're at a\nMoral was bad guys won't go back in their practice to get rid of that\nWhat are we we're we're ... we're about to buy records and ... all the time all at all [noise]\nYou know who you're going\nOn why they play then get a first I was on that ... awful low ball a little bit in the first quarter scored a touchdown run backwards overhaul want pets made a nice way\nGave us the momentum butter energy on the sidelines was good and you can't get it first advantage is going to go way already has now they're playing the whole time your your energy going to wrestle go\nThere you go thoughts of head coach Dana hold her son and uh just to point out number thirty two he mentioned David

either you can't sleep or you just said\nYeah I Know that I listen to tell you what give it a the inbox on the text line might blow up so I don't think there's too many people clean the cars are still coming in heavily and I was thinking about stand the night by may drive home now what you've done here\nIs is you know you you go to those people who see the script before\nYeah well yeah we we we yeah we had a couple of weeks like it already yeah yeah same same thing and the rents and repeat what that means that\nYou get all excited about the relation and I remember when ... first came we started winning games and the excitement of it was just over the top it was unbelievable I mean just to go to a bowl game was a big deal\nAnd when when I re I Believe for like three years in a row and you know that excitement starts to come back then it gets that same thing in twenty twelve\nYeah though and and again you know and I think I don't think we can lose a lot of this\nWhere five un one mountaineers or by one yeah we're looking down the tunnel than he will I Know it could be a train coming up [laughter] yeah I agree they're up to and then you got to wait and see what happens here is the one a coach I Want to hear from the get his thoughts ... coordinator ... until\nGot to be smarter with the ball in a situation sometimes just chalk it up and throw it away\nUm but yeah I felt like there are [noise] everybody at some point you know for for their turn throughout the course of a drive if it was a ... who is well taken facts are allied or running back you know I'm you know we only called forty three plays you know it's\nProbably the least amount of recalling the game and a lot of that is just do the efficiency of where we're at we're\nUh I thought we had to run your there they're going to give you a light box I talked about we've talked about how the bond game ever be um what side of the result for us and um I thought it hit at times and stuff\nAnd the other you know accept sticking to it you know I'm you know you look at what will round like will likely ended up with a Fifteen pat ... there was there's a few scrambles on those though a while you know six seven bucks plus whatever\nI mean you probably thirty thousand driver\nMaybe yeah you'd have to look down at the end of the the two minutes as relations and the driver you're trying to do something matched it up but I I just thought we got out played outpost everything throughout the course of the game and you know we knew we are going to have minimal possessions than we've talked about taking advantage of and we did\nWas there any adjustment you wanted to make but just couldn't 'cause the situation was always behind that you\nHad that was hard and you know and they they're tough team to ah to make sure like when you're behind the change day there drop Eighteen that keep everything bottled up so you're you're searching to get it to like cut the\nDistance and a half on that second now called to try to get you in a man's author down and we sometimes we can never do it sometimes we did you know it\nYou know probably disappointing one was where we had a like a second in twenty I felt like and then we hit the screen to dairy we got to a third too which is a great play by\nBy willing Gary and then we couldn't capitalize on the third too with a with a run game so [noise] um I still I I gotta look at a lot of it but I just overall I felt like they just got average across\nThe board that thirty two calls going off their tendencies or\nYeah you know they they give you a favorable boxer runs then throughout felt like it was a light box you know ... we got to take advantage of that you know if the teams are going to you know be concerned with our past Damon and bracket everybody we got to be a fish in the run game and [noise]\nYou know I felt like at times I was going on in those working in in times a week just all out and we weren't getting anything popping in the wrong day and so\nUm yeah we're we got to figure out how to to get back to work and you know watch the tape and and make sure that these kids understand where we're at and the seasons out over and there's no finger pointing going on and and that we're we gotta keep moving forward 'cause everybody's got lost in this conference right now so they're still wide open\nMy mind in the absence of bloody felt at all you think\nNow I thought they hit at times um\nI've had Kennedy and passed away we're doing a good job I really did or didn't we didn't have very many opportunities and we didn't take advantage of it you know we put we put the defense of behind the times and you know and we we understood that if we didn't take advantage and score that we may never get the ball back then you know when\nYou end up with Ford possessions and they're going to have you know you when you're ... one possession damn time you've got to take advantage of that\nJust than we've seen will use at least it seems like that you think he was ... that were they doing stuff just a drop in eight\nAnd yeah housing problems I thought and on and I got to look at it but I felt like they would they get to they've they're covered the first read made a second read and then I think he I don't know if you had time to get to the third read I don't know if\nWouldn't come back ESPN ESPN and CBS we're talking about reporting on his shoulder being checked but you're right he did have something on his hand they had that brings it up as well yeah exactly\nSo interesting to see how that is developed but again the Texas is down the road you got to be concerned about Baylor coming in and out of being twelve days or whatever it is definitely because\nAgain ah it's it's a ball club talking about West Virginia that what you saw tonight is in disarray for whatever reason I don't know what the reason is but it's in disarray\nWell and I think it ... in my opinion it's in such disarray offensively that nothing is off the table moving forward until I see differently now you come out against Baylor and put up fifty six and run them out of the building All right then maybe it starts to change a little bit but given what we just saw over the last three hours I don't think you'd take anything\nOff the table in terms of who this team may or may not be moving forward\nYou know and again and again I think somebody somebody tweeted to me earlier that they could win the rest of the games West Virginia like a really good yeah and they could lose the rest of their games in ...\nThe on what you're going to get it from week to week that's the biggest problem\nBut again I think we all an agreement I'm sure the coaching staff in agreement him and I hope will ... and you've got either throw the ball away you got to check it down because the home run ball is not going to be there as much as you want to throw it\nAnd as good as that looks maybe the worst thing in the world would have been was that great touchdown pass the through the David ... and I was six months to go in the first quarter goes I think I Know I thought okay here we go looks easy done yeah Islam you know right there with only ... David deals going to catch that ball and he got touched down let's go and it didn't happen again\nThis was going to be a ... it's going to be a chicken character with how the coaching staff with the players and get along and you know how and how well the ... players respond to the grocery Danny\nDavis said noting winning fingers that ... that's the way it has to be as can\nBe your your team you're not all going the same direction you're going to split or fall apart real fast very quiet plane ride coming back oh I'd say it probably won't be a beep goes you know understand some of the players want when does the badger that is so you know even though when I was the coach and that was my mortgage run up and down the field\nYou know [laughter] yes she's actually [laughter] I hadn't thought of it in those terms but it's very very true you know you're right\nBut uh yeah I I I Can't believe the team that won five games is as bad as the team that we sell tonight\nWell maybe they're pretender because they play good teams either\nAnd I said the same thing um but but again a really ran roughshod over several of those teams\nYou know I Do feel rose what I heard him as I was driving over here to the enthusiasm excitement were really good we can cover and we can do this and they can do that\nThat's all the site but of kittens sometimes you get over confident and you don't stay focused on the task at hand and and that's what happens these young kids you got to realize you play with Eighteen to twenty three year old so that's what you're going to get\nYou know never know from week to week so I'm like okay hey this shows coming to an end we still have another hour to spend with you in the next hour we'll hear from giving we'll hear from rich Donahue from Kennedy McCoy from David seals and we're also going to hear David ... response\nAs well because I thought he had a lot of the things in there that we want to talk about final score was thirty to fourteen we'll talk about it for an hour on the point after coming up after this you've been listening to the rest of\nPoints after coming up next\nImagine that you're able to deal with all kinds of tremors now imagine retaining\nControl through advanced care at WVU Madison neurosurgeons use neuro modulation like a deep brain stimulation implant the targets to part of your brain triggering the trainers and stops that movement to sweater and Parkinson's also can be treated\nTo regain control of your life covered WVU Madison neurosurgery experts\nAt eight five five W.

but yeah I mean that that we could\nGo into that but I'm a you know it's just a they got a lot of time to think about this and then a horse and said\nWe're talking about the which did you hit thirty to fourteen most of the Iowa State that you know not going to have a whole lot of time off I'm sure that a lot a lot of things to work\nOn well David Sills you got two balls tonight think about this guy and they would still got two bowls one was an Eighteen\nYard touchdown catch some means the other ... he was the was for yards that was it he has had a I'm not I mean\nThey paid attention to him and he has not had a monster year Rand Iran may right about that Brent I'm Sorry say that again David Sales he's not had a monster you know but some of that I mean shouldn't you expect\nThat a guy does what he did last year in terms of number ... going to get the attention right you know I don't know that I'm totally stunned by that he's had his moments when he looked like one of the best receivers in the country but I'm not done these not putting up the same kind of numbers last night which were ridiculous he's close to seven hundred yards I think something like that you will to catches your eye banks or your good yeah one touch\nDown and after the game Greg Hunter caught up with a\nSurprise by the office of struggles is is we worked with them you guys been so good all year\nUh yeah I mean they had a good scheme to friends who is um you know come really get in our group\nI didn't really get to where were\nYou know the mass [noise] I'm Down in the scores on um you know\nThey play the game a goes well I'm\n... they had a good schemes or what [noise]\nWe have to actually\nDo um movie for like a you know you you definitely see a change in an office and how we approach saying how we approach each game [noise] um and I am coming from a senior interacting problem is that um you know that that for and we will be better [noise]\nHow so what what was it to think that really hurts you today that we need to prove a point\nOh I think we need to um throughout the week I think we need to have better practices um you know continue to a reflecting on how much time and effort we\nPut into this um you know because of the game day and then just on January first or isn't just today from that starts on January first when we when we started training for this um\nYou know I I Want to uh definitely reflects on a blog that you know some workouts and everything we did everything all of them were put in you know it's not just for nothing for the moment is um you know when when we need to see more and we need to get in the hands on we need to figure out a way to do it [noise]\nIf you're walking the thought that was the outcomes comes from talking to a lot of different [noise]\nYeah basically said that this one was on the fence um defense playing great football right now I'm you know we we didn't help them tonight I'm you know it's it's something that\nUh you want to want to complement each other you know plan a fast one that feed off of the fence on the fence wants to be off the off\nAnd um you know we really didn't get any any anything for the defense of heat over and they were still playing a game and uh you know they were getting stuff for us and we didn't capitalize it off so that that's something that um\nYou know us as an off and we need to be better I mean I think\nIt is somewhere on a hundred and fifty yards um you know with the total yards and that's something that uh we expect higher um we are better off than we need to point out better product are feeling\nExactly where do you start when you go to fix this I mean I think there's so much there to look at we we knew about the all kinds of line issues\nYou just go back to tonight I just keep coming back to the the seemingly lack of adjustments the lack of trying to do something different the lack of running different routes I mean I mean why why would that not done why would there not more done to mix it up a little bit tonight when clearly what you were doing wasn't working at any point throughout the whole game\nYou know the the excuse was they dropped the guy well you're dropping God you don't\nGet a lot of pressure you got five officers lumber to block three which means the clocks ticking quarterback standing back or hit clinic town to throw the ball they kept potent yeah multiple times or the ball you got five guys that are out and you got three men Russia I mean there's got to be somebody open somewhere\nBut they still get sex seven times well did
