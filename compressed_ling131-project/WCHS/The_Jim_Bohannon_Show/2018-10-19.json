everything you have to say about ... except for this I'm not sure I trust their motives\nI mean tell us what is not primarily country anymore she had been\nPrimarily pop and the question I get it that fans of pop probably lean more to the left and they do the right there was a different story with Dixie Chicks I gave them credit because they were primarily country and they did actually they did suffer because of that is what is that\nThat that's a big yeah\nI'm not sure I trust Kanye West's motives either um I'll have to wait and see if I'll have to wait and see if anything happened to that does it benefit him as a result of his support [noise] I'll just have to wait and see her\nI see what you're saying and and and again the uh I'm willing to to wait and see as well and yeah Taylor

you doing tonight and thanks\nI Love your show and I have to agree with your previous caller about the motives of Tanya wellspring made a big spectacle of giving Donald ... praise and uh I just happened to wonder I have to wonder if he was really sincere or just trying to jump on the tramp Trump bandwagon to to gain a little known notoriety\nGood at the when you mentioned tell you this with you might like to hear the mindset of perspective a Tennessee voter and a miss ... titled or opinion but I decided several months ago Jim how I was going to vote or Taylor Swift even\nWeighed in on the Senate race between former governor brothers and then there's like burn it to me tell you the swift and Kanye West are both over rated\nIf you can call that stuff they make music I call it joke but then I mean it's just kind of [laughter]\nIt gives me a migraine headaches and think about it a little over here that are all that stuff but as I said I don't think I don't think I missed was the doors were will have to have a bearing in the grand scheme of things in other woke me I'm an independent I voted I vote for the person I think is best for the job I don't let a celebrity tell me\nWell I think that's very wise of you are and and I I Would uh would hope that the frankly everybody listens to such views will do so in the same spirit that you do Neal because\nAgain or unless they have something special to say I just don't care the fact that they've so the ... billion records is of concern to me again if they were up ... about a\nAbout a record labels or recording studios than I Would respect their knowledge but on this not particularly\nThe celebrity I can think of it ever made the transition from Hollywood which Mr Reagan he went to the governor's office in California and then the White House but then Reagan had a lot of credibility as a spokesman for General Electric and\nAnd um yeah he he was a well known figure but you know as I said ... very overrated not okay I think that he was\nWell I I I I certainly respect your view into generally would the would agree with the deal thank you very much for that now Reagan paid his dues devoted to quite simply he earned respect a tad in Jamestown New York high\nHigh ... high there on a couple of questions sure ah okay\nOh gosh Schwarzenegger was governor ... California correct that's right and heads and a Clint Eastwood was a mayor mayor of Carmel, California that's correct\nAnd by the way I I I think I think you can argue this ... was a pretty fair governor and uh that uh he would frankly I think helped the town of ... so to be a celebrity doesn't mean you're capable of being a good practitioner\nWasn't there a an astronaut named John Glen\nWell yeah you're on the corner from Ohio and he was the senator from Ohio that's correct or Harrison Schmitt one of the astronauts who walked on the moon was a senator from New Mexico uh there have been others\nUm and a professional wrestler\nWell Jesse Ventura was of course governor of Minnesota that's correct\nThank you um how do you hiring sad but how do you feel about their performance besides being reelected\nWell let's let's look at a at the the people involved there as I say I as I understand that there was some particular issues and uh uh Eastwood er I I Believe in rent a bar or something in Carmel ... my understanding is that his brief tenure in opposite he improved a Carmelo certainly for the the business community\nOh Schwarzenegger I think it was a very credible as governor Reagan I Would do would feel the same way Jesse Ventura\nI think he had some problems of being an independent uh dealing with the uh legislatures when he didn't have a any voting bloc in the in the assemblies but again a I had to have to look deeper to offer a more profound thoughts about the\n... the simply I Would note that that that they did in fact in the arena they didn't just offer their opinions but they they put themselves on the line and then the cases we exam mentioned they they were elected so I I give them credit for that\nIs very true I mean they were elected in cases Schwarzenegger wondering gee a reelected that fear\nAround reelected he when he was in fact a reelected yes that's a that's correct in fact he he took office I Believe in the aftermath of a recall of a of a governor drew Davis so yes a better than that is true\nAh again of being a celebrity does not disqualify you from being an able administrator but it also does it make you one either so yeah I think your point is well taken a Stephen ... North Carolina good evening Steve\nHey Mr ... well I Yes sir I Am a yeah you bet that a good a shy ... that night ... um\nThis is a kind of Iraq so that's cut [laughter] pope over the last ... years and celebrity and having a lot of power I think is a very stupid thing that they are to able to get into\nA late night may be\nA big percentage of your ... or paying\nAll the [laughter] and the people they may\nBuy your records but they have a right to say what they want to but just the college your celebrity and whale now and have many fans that follows does not equate to some kind of great wisdom\nNot automatically know it certainly does it\n\nWhen they call it they are talking of course a lot of them are actors and and you know\nThey know how to present themselves I mean they had when Oprah taught at the Oscars they asked her running for president [laughter] I mean yeah\nAnd if she ran she would probably do fairly well over his popularity has been immense\nI think you would automatically let her as a as a as a strong contender should choose to run now I don't think she's going to because I think she she recognizes as a as dirty Harry ... a man or a woman's got annoys limitations and I I think she's much better as a\nAs a media communicated that necessarily as a candidate but I think she could be a formidable candidate I really do\nBut my point is is their job description whether the whether they are not fully or this kind of a pawn up nine but a athlete\nOr at their job description\nIs has the word play and it you know actually plays a sport right I get paid a lot of money and and has a lot of bad actor plays a park I'm\nMusician but the thing that play music and theater people play and\nPlay [laughter] ... book that's not where I go to\nTheir paintings are set it because they are American sets them up and they have is like the other body part they we all got to pay but um their opinion it's not necessarily any better than lying or Joe blow down the street\nOr anybody else that they\nThat that that is the whole point Steven I like you've you've summed it up nicely exactly their opinion is not necessarily any worse than mine but it's not necessarily any better either end that was pretty much to the point that I was making All right\nTheir precious metals Coley five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how and I are re backed by physical gold and silver can hedge against inflation calling us too precious metals right now at age five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and get a free gold Ira gun call eight five eight five eight five eight oh seven\nWould you like peace of mind and comfort for your family we're final expense direct the average funeral today cost over a thousand dollars on now for free information about our senior plan so eight hundred three one nine eighty four sixty four that's eight hundred three one nine eighty four sixty four [noise]", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "19"}
