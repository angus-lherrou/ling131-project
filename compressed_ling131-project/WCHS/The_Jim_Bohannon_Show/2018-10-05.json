mechanism out there I don't know that that it's necessarily the best way but it would certainly be a way to uh do attack this\nAbsolutely that's certainly something that is I think uh that needs to be\nScott I'm and you know what what's what's interesting is a lot of people will say well you know the free market will correct is the problem is that really in this online space it's not so much a free market anymore and that's really for a couple of reasons Jim or the first one is\nThe barriers to entry are enormous now you know that may seem strange I mean the perception that a lot of people have is you know Jim if you and I want to start a search engine will just start one and we can put it up on line and people will find it and uh we'll do great it's just not that simple the barriers to entry\nAre very very difficult and Google has a history\nOf working very very hard to sort of squelch competition\nNow than ever self it'd be great if I'm wrong about that that is an avid competitive practice and I believe that alone would be a slam dunk base for a lawsuit\nAbsolutely yeah and they have been sued 'em the challenge is that Google essentially a argues\nUm that we do exist in a free market which is what they are going to argue obviously in a legal context but the second part of the problem is not only did they deal with competitors in a very aggressive fashion but gym they have gone from being a company in the early to thousands which was\nAll about Silicon Valley it was all about innovation\nThey had very small footprint in Washington D. C.\nThey have gone from that scenario to today being one of the most aggressive lobbying country uh companies are having a lot of former politicians on the payroll or making a lot of campaign contributions and very aggressively working the machinery of government for their benefit\nAnd to the detriment of competitors so yeah I think you're exactly right looking at anti trust laws are key\nBecause we do not have a free market that will correct this problem um and the question becomes how should the company be split up\nAnd the question is always this challenge of regulatory capture right that when these decisions get made in Washington D. C. oftentimes that process is influenced by the very people that the regulations or the anti trust the action is going to be going against\nBut I think anti trust is a big part of this smashing the power in the grip that Google has in dominating so much of the information space\nNow another factor to consider here would be that when a ... I guess similar arguments were put forward a in an earlier era and the the steel trust him the sugar trust and a host of of the trust that existed around\nThe turn of the century nineteenth into the twentieth century nonetheless uh the trust busting did come in ...\nBut those were all domestic concerns that was long before the Internet\nAlong before satellites and host of other things are these days you have to ask very frankly\nIf the United states government and all of its power and majesty has the uh the jurisdiction if you will to go after somebody as big as Facebook I mean good just to have it might not be cheap but it it it it would be an option I suppose they could do what they do\nFrom a lot of different places they don't have to be in the territory of the United states\n[noise] yes that's exactly right and we also have to factor in that you know if you're going to go after standard oil you go after standard oil and of course they're going to use all the techniques of lobbying and hiring the lawyers but if you're going to go after Google you have the added problem that when people go\nTo look for information on the line about anti trust actions against Google\nA Google controls that flow of information and and it's important to look at the history here [noise] you know again Google official position is\nWe just give objective search results it's essentially like coming to the library and we've got this digital librarian who's going to get you the best search results but here's the problem we know from history that that's not the case\nTen to twelve years ago you had several Web companies like Yelp\nAnd trip advisor you know they they provide the ranking services and descriptions of restaurants in travel options and they complained that Google was in the nippy late in the\nAlgorithm to their detriment that they were pushing them down in Google Search results and that Google was favoring companies competitors that they themselves had started now\nYou could say hey Google has the right to do that you know and when you can have that debate but here's the problem Google insisted that this was not true\nThat they were giving safe and and and fair search results well the Federal Trade commission and the Obama administration looked at it\nThe European Union looked at this academics at Harvard University and looked at it and all of them said Google is lying they are cooking the books\nWhen it comes to commercial search and local search they are manipulating results there's also a body of research done by whip Richard Striner a Harvard a PHD in psychology former editor in\nChief of Psychology Today magazine he certainly series a peer reviewed studies for the national Academy of sciences looking into something that he calls search engine manipulation of fat and what does research results show is that Google has the capacity\nAnd he has research shows they use that capacity to actually manipulate search results on very important issues including political issues so when you think about an antitrust action taken against Google you're not only going to be fighting the way that\nStandard oil fought a hundred years ago you're now actually fighting an entity that can control what people actually the in terms of their research on this topic\nA lot of power to be sure will come back we'll talk some more ah with our guest in this

New York times author that consultant president of the government accountability Institute and now the producer of the documentary the creepy mine dot com bust ... dot com have a call from a Tim\nWho calls in from Medford, Wisconsin hello to him\nOh Danville good to talk to you as always anti you Mr Schweitzer and of course I'm a fan of a lot of the conservative commentators on YouTube as well as Facebook and others that I've seen a lot of them\nAll they've had Benji monetize pushed aside you know pushed out of searches and they've all come up with one of two ideas that I wanted to see your your opinions out of it either thought of at a lot of them hate the idea of regulating the Internet as a public utility\nBecause they are very strongly against that but the one that seems to have caught the fire amongst them\nIs the idea of an Internet bill of rights that thinking that Google Facebook YouTube and the rest of the bar or less become the digital town square and therefore everyone should have equal access to it\nI think that's a I think that's a great point um and and it's really instructive here to look back at how the Internet\nWas organized back in the day and in terms of the regulatory structure there was a law passed in Nineteen Ninety six called the communications decency act see da and in section two thirty of that act\nIt basically split the Internet into two categories\nCategory one is the the the company or the entity and this is what Google and Facebook claim is that you are a quote unquote neutral platform and basically argument\nHere is that all you really are as a telegraph you as a company or conveying information from point a to point B you're exerting no editorial control your not censoring you're not doing any of that if you are a neutral platform\nYou have no regulation whatsoever and you have no legal liability whatsoever\nThe other category of course is if you are a publisher you're exerting editorial control if you're restricting certain voices from being hurt Well Google and Facebook insist that they are neutral platforms\nBut we also know for a fact and they grudgingly admit this that they do exert editorial control so one of the arguments that people have made Senator Ted Cruz has argued this and others\nIs that we should essentially tell Facebook and Google you have to choose if you are going to insist on being a neutral platform you essentially as you just said the caller said\nYou essentially have to allow all voices to operate equally you cannot exert editorial control if you are going to exert editorial control you are now for all intents and purposes is going to be\nTreated in some respects as a media company\nNow Google and Facebook that is the last thing in the world that they want but I think it goes to the heart of the issue that the caller raises which is you know you have a certain set of rights particularly if an entity claims to be a neutral platform\nAnd I think this is probably the direction that the solution needs to go in addition to the question of breaking up these companies like a gym you and I were talking about earlier in the show\nAbsolutely again uh I don't know that that ah anything in our history as ever prepared us for something quite of this nature is this is an intersection\nOf the traditional issues that face notions of of concentrations of a power economic power and and other power coupled with the er an incredible powers that go with the twenty first century the digital age I mean this is a a whole host of a of a different a\nDifferent color here I mean for example the steel trust over a century ago was very powerful but I'm not sure it's even analogous to this [noise]\nI I think this is a hugely important point and I think you're exactly right because it is a media company that controls concepts it's different I mean imagine if in the United states back in the day\nOne newspaper controlled Ninety percent of the information that would be a huge concern I think to a lot of people but here's the other part of the problem that that that speaks to what you were saying we haven't been here before is\nThe the kind of actions that Google is capable of taking in Facebook also to assemble the extent\nThat the problem is we don't know what we don't know because the algorithm is secretive and because the shifting and the editing and the shifting into information is all hidden process\nWe don't know what we don't know we don't know what is being a kitten from us we don't know what is being pushed in in front of our faces and that's the nature of\nWhat we're facing so it's it's it's a challenge that you're exactly right we have never faced before but it's ominous and it's important I think everybody would agree\nThat as citizens we benefit from access to all sorts of information all voices in the information um and that is just not happening in this era of these large corporations that feel like they have a duty and responsibility to censor certain voice\nYeah which is another way to put them none of your damn business they have either the duty or the responsibility a I mean that that's the kind of I mean just a ... a ... if he were alive today would think boy I was born to sue this is the perfect tool for running a a Nazi said\nNo you're you're you're exactly right um and if you think about all the sort of just ... uh uh novels about a totalitarian has and it was all predicated on one thing Jim essentially the power of the state\nWas going to smash in control people so you know in Nineteen eighty four it's big brother and you have these you know large television screens or these voices that are sort of pumping information to us but it was visible it's kind of the you know the the the clenched fist right in front of your face you know what we're\nYou see now is not any kind of police state but what we are facing is this all this power that is trying to persuade us that is trying to steer us in a certain direction but we can't really see the fist\nBut it's still there and the power is still there and I think you're exactly right I mean imagine a ... imagine I'm Mao or a stolen or a Mussolini\nThat had this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we give them an enormous power and Google basically tells us trust us yeah trust us\nGeorge Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello Lyndon\nAlone can um I I I you know make a quick comment a lot of us do believe that the party has been building the Nazi techno state with still going on Facebook and all these people but what I really call let's say asking that want to thank our guests for what he's doing and at that search engines\nAnd they're used to be I click which had a they they have another one called start paid for the same company but they got rid of ex click and that was if you didn't want to use Google result he wanted other result\nAnd I don't understand that Google suppress did they make them suppress I click or what happened to it and I use that that go\nYeah no that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in this space so look at apple for example apple has this search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google have apple nine billion dollars a year for the opportunity to run safari searches so think about that\nIt's an apple product and Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing their searches but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that because they want the information and the data that comes from search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing\nEverywhere and you're exactly right start page a\nIs a a search engine you get great results they actually use the Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without data being present\nI think that is that is going to change eventually because start pages becoming more popular it was a deal struck awhile ago Dr go is good\nIt's it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges the best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google but the place that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you to either steer\nYou are manipulate you in a way for commercial gain or for other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there's even you know discussions about the fact that\nThing which is the Microsoft products which is sort of the great rival\nTo Google a centrally in twenty sixteen struck a commercial agreements a Microsoft and Google struck a commercial agreement we don't know exactly what that agreement is but um they essentially have stopped being so hostile to Google with a lot of people believe\nBe [laughter] [noise]\nThey\nTalk about the general had a show one eight six six five oh jumbo with readers' rights were producer\nOf the freebie lined dot com documentary and a well what's your name said I I couldn't repeat all better my life depended on it but the your response\n[laughter] yeah I mean Jim means right oh look what people have to recognize is that Google like any other company in the world has to sell a product\nThe product is not the search engine and they don't make money off of the search engine product that they sell is you you and the reason they want all that information that Janine is talking about she's actually absolutely right about Android Android tracks everything you do even if you turn off\nThe location it tracks you anyway if you turn the phone off once you turn the phone on it all loads the information from where you were and where you went even when the phone was off\nThe reason Google wants all this information is they want to sell to advertisers and they are building profiles on us that they can use to manipulate us remember any time\nSomething can do somebody something for you they can also do something to you and we're giving these companies the power to do a lot\nThough it would seem Zack in Durango, Colorado good evening hello is\nA gym do if you have to talk to you you have some longtime listener first time caller and I was wondering if you had any ideas\nOn uh\nI I personally would love to like try to experience\nSome of the ideas that where I can you know find a source from the Internet where I'm not a force to experience biased coverage I mean even in Google Search I have a lot of bias coverage and I realized that um\nI was wondering if you had any advice or ideas on how to try to try to negate that by it\nOh well that's a great question I mean I actually going to go old school here when I went to graduate school in the United kingdom at Oxford in Nineteen eighty eight to Nineteen Ninety [noise] my favorite thing to do was to read three newspapers\nI read the times which was kind of a center right newspaper I read the guardian which was a left wing paper and I read the telegraph which was a conservative paper I think the point when it comes to information is no source is going to be completely biased free\nI think what we have to get used to is the notion of looking at multiple sources and it's also the way we think about information in the news surveys show that because of the Internet because of social media people expect the news to find them\nWe become kind of passive recipients of the news feeds that we get and the information we get what I Would say to people is read multiple sources that are different on cable news don't watch just one channel watched several channels that have different views and really filter in source information\nDon't count on these large companies to shift to to sift in filter it for you because you are going to get results that reflect their interests and not yours\nAll right very rough enough said let's go to a village Kennedy ...

North Carolina good evening Steve\nHey let's hope you're well yes are due to\n[noise] um I like to help and that this is a legitimate question is because I'm confused on it and you're probably going to get married at age they asked for and and now look kind of stupid [laughter]\nI doubt that you will look stupid Steve so let's just go ahead and let it out\nThe ... the Senate is lie to fit the war on Republican right\nCurrently it's fairly one Republicans in forty nine Democrats that's correct\nOkay well it's ... it's an easy answer to it probably a Denise reports allow it and keep saying that the Republicans could vote could afford to lose two votes\n[noise] ah I\nI I've heard some reports that say that and for the life of me I don't know what they're talking about either no they can afford to lose one vote which would then be a fifty fifty split\nWhich would be broken by vice president Pence is tie breaker\nThat's in the constitution and the event of a tie vote in the Senate the tie bought outlook for ... the vice president of the United states however they lose two then it becomes fifty one to forty nine against Kavanaugh there is no tie breaker and Kavanaugh loses so I I have heard that that also said\nNo they cannot lose too that you're you're absolutely correct ... their stupidity here but it's not yours Steve\nThere that was owned a nice break uh at at uh the half hour\nWell again the we don't provide the news on the half hour those come ... no no I'm\nNot saying that but you but a lot to say that that we're losing the wall and because of a wedding\nUh for that like that\nYou know a lot more closer [laughter] [noise] uh we didn't need to lose won you know for for any reason but uh I mean I can I guess I can understand them playing ... or\n... or something of this airport I think I Would say that my daughter I Hope you understand as the daughter of a senator the importance of this the voters come up this way we can move the wedding to Sunday but if we lose this vote it will affect the entire country I've heard people say just what you just said and and my answer would be no\nNo that that's more important I mean it's not like your your daughter is not going to get married later getting married tomorrow or I'm In this case if you're talking about Saturday to get married Sunday\nUh he does say that he will attend the his daughter's wedding in Montana and uh uh\nThis is an interesting thing right here though there's been an unusual late night phone call in which a senator Danes of Montana Heidi Heitkamp colleague called Kavanaugh and personally assured him that he has made arrangements to be there to get him across the finish line as needed so uh for whatever uh\nIt's worth a I I guess he's found a way around this so that that's the short answer on that one that he has a he has promised cabinet if he needed he will be there so again well that makes me feel better\nIt left me feel better too I got to tell you Steve a I had been the bothered about that and I just re checked the wires here and uh the GOP could hold the session open bar they overnight and allow Danes to vote on Sunday if needed to be\nA a whether or not the cabinet or a a\nA whether or not they deserve promised to Capitol I mean people up here for a hypothetical Sunday's vote is not clear but the GOP could hold the session open overnight\nOr that could happen so technically uh in the Senate parlance that would be that uh Saturday would be a Sunday will be redefined as Saturday\nOr they could do that and and I'll guarantee you if it came down to the point where let's say it is a it is fifty to forty nine against Kavanaugh okay\nAh I'll guarantee you that is what the Republicans will do and then the Danes will fly and quickly make it a fifty fifty tie and the parents would cast a tie breaker so that clarifies that for me I I had been\nThe most curious as to how how bad could happen and apparently that's that's the circumstance that day ... of a Montana will be there for Kavanaugh if needed we'll be back in just a moment\nTechnology truth to buy like oh no proof you have fourteen Logan passwords and you can't remember any of them\nAre one or two Doug ... is a ... a ... is awesome one two three truth", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "05"}
