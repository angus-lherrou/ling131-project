national beverage corporation facing a class action lawsuit ABC's either pilgrim\nOkay Mike Huckabee or how do you feel about the entire Brett Kavanaugh deliberations a high point in American democracy\nYou know it's one of the real low points in American democracy and the reason that we're here is because the Democrats refused to accept the results of the twenty sixteen election must be very honest this was not about Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd what he did when he was sixteen years old that is never been proven even though the allegations were serious and they were ultimately outrageous because not one person not one\nCouldn't validate these accusations being true but he's had his name and his reputation drug through the mud and must also keep in mind\nThat these very serious allegations that ranged from a it simply groping are attempting to grow the young lady all the way to being a serial gang rape is which is a pretty serious Melanie\nNone of this even surfaced until the Democrats through the hearings realized they didn't lay a glove on him to discredit our disqualifying him in the normal course of the errands and that's when Dianne Feinstein reach back into a ball somewhere\nPulled out this letter that she'd been sitting on like a hint sits on an egg\nHatched it and said oh wait here's something maybe we can throw this against the wall and it'll stick gym it's been disgusting it's been embarrassing\nIt's been a threat to our republic and I hope that this never happens again but quite frankly I think the Democrats have very little else in their quiver to shoot and I'm afraid it will happen again\nIt does seem unlikely that in the near future say the next five years or so that we would see another Supreme Court nominee go for the Senate in which the final tally would defer more than say four or five votes from the partisan breakdown of the Senate\nAnd that's unfortunate because historically a people recognize that the role of advise and consent which the constitutional function of the Senate in this regard the president makes the nomination\nThe Senate advisors and gives consent but it's still the president's nomination and to quote president rock Obama elections have consequences and unless you can determine that a judge is simply not qualified to be on the court or he doesn't have enough experience are a navy his uh\nHis judicial writings are against the constitution in some way\nOr the Republicans have voted for the nominees of democratic presidents and vice versa and that's the way it's been you had a job just like a soda my air cave and\nAnd before that Ginsburg my gosh what are the most liberal justices ever served on the court and I think the vote on her was like Ninety seven to nothing\nUh this is the way it was you said okay we didn't win the election the other party did or this person is is qualified we don't necessarily agree with their physicians but it's just as a qualified person and we move forward\nThe gym I go back to my point this is not about just the Supreme Court\nSince November of twenty sixteen even after Hillary in October of that year gave us all a nice little lecture about how we need to respect the will of the voters recess when she was confident she was going to be\nA than the winner of the election and how appalling it would be if Donald Trump didn't accept the will of the voters but since the election results\nThe Democrats have refused to accept that Donald Trump is the president and they've done everything they can to stage\nNothing short of a coup d'etat\nAnd try to de legitimize his presidency and every decision he makes and every person he hires\nEnd up points and the policies that he implements and that does represent a threat the pendulum swings back and forth between the left in the eye and we can survive that we cannot survive if the losing side of an election\nRefuses to accept it and instead those to the streets and tries to overturn the election\nI Know the previous report we heard mentioned the north Dakota democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp who said she will be a no vote on Kavanaugh the reason she has given his quote his temperament unquote to your reaction to that\nWell that that sort of a phoney and ridiculous excuse he showed through twelve years have been\nOn the second most important part or the appellate court in D.C which handles many of the very big cases not one person has ever said that he lacks the temperament in his career as an appeals court judge not one not one and because he\nHad the audacity to defend himself against these attacks have been everything from a drunk or to a gang rape is\nAh of course he defended himself in his honor he defended it because he has a mother yeah so why he has two daughters he has friends yes college\nAnd he had every right to defend themselves\nUm and somehow that means he lacks the temperament I wouldn't want someone on the bench that was so robotic that they have no emotion had no passion and didn't understand what right and wrong or all about\nMike Huckabee as our guest will continue with more from Mike and of course the calls for him as well and don't

O. L. I. T. I. C. O. dot com wonderful website if you're at all into politics you'll really enjoy the information that is a is put forward there so I'm looking before we get down to the election as such let's look at uh the the Kavanaugh situation\nA Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota Democrat so she is definitely a no vote\nA we've already heard a Claire McCaskill a fairly definitively the G A\nA is a a no vote a Joe Donnelly of Indiana and other Democrats very trumps state had the first said he was a no vote and then I think the last word I heard from him was more like a maybe no and then of course we have a\nA a Joe Manchin of West Virginia we're not sure about him and on the Republican side obviously Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona a dividing the confirmation tea leaves here what do you see Daniel\n[noise] yeah it's a lot more optimistic for capital or because of this FBI report which Democrats are saying uh really was not comprehensive it to the doctor Christine Blasey Ford and I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd so they're saying that how could they\nEven begin to understand the truth uh scenery and the players\nBut a number of those swing Republican senators have said that they thought the FBI report was comprehensive a and you know they're happy with that\nAlthough we have not had vote commitments from those are three main Republican a swing a senators and so it's possible that they could pull a health care type boat where they advance to debate so you can actually have the confirmation\nVote and then once that actually comes or to the final vote than they could vote against Kavanaugh and so that\nUh is unlikely but still a possibility because uh they just don't get along with Trump and they may have come to their own conclusion that a Ford is telling the truth\nAlthough both columns and flake are now saying good things about the FBI reports uh I haven't heard the word for Murkowski of you\nAre not much I'm although you can say good things about the FBI report and yet still vote against ... you know that's not\nThat doesn't preclude one from the other and ah if they had been raised in a lot of\nConcerns about the airport than\nThey might uh then they would be under so much pressure from a conservatives and the rights or in terms of voting for Kevin uh that uh it would\nAlmost uh they're not a fund situation so not a surprise or if they want to vote against Kavanaugh than they can do that without the nutrition sort of pressure from a conservative media and also uh the White House\nNow than pivoting to the election\nLet's assume for the moment that the indications are pointing toward a confirmation of Kavanaugh in that case the Democrats would lose so the question is in regard to November six motivation our people disheartened discouraged or are they made mad as hell\nI'm I think Democrats still have an upper hand and then there's the as them because\nThey they are attracting a lot of orders from a state where they were not a strong and it looks like a Republican base is rallying to Republican but mostly in a they're\nIn their ... states and so if you energize a lot of holes in Texas maybe that's good to prevent\nA bed or from a toppling textures but it's not going to save you a ton of swing\nCongressional seats and so uh you wouldn't really have to find the Republican age as him in a in swing states and a safari it uh it seems like Democrats are more eager to vote for their\nCandidate and to show a kind of given middle finger to Trump that uh that this is an election based on a day\nOn the president's performance and um how he's acting up\nYeah I I think that a lot of it depends on whether you see Trump's name on the ballot I think that the Democrats look at the ballot at least be Trump's name everywhere oh it doesn't say Donald Trump but anything anybody with an R by their name that's close enough will vote against that person\nWhereas Republicans I think look at the ... and they don't see the president's name anywhere instead they may see a lot of people that they made you ride as a as rhinos Republicans in name only and uh\nAnd so I think those two viewpoints may not be a good news for Republicans\nYeah all all all true I think all\nTrump has basically said as a referendum on the hand that as a nationalized election not good for a Republican or any time in the power and the party in\nPower and so they're trying to like that's a localized election uh and not have a problem at the main issue they want all day on TALK judicial appointments or do they want that to me talk about\nBecause a child support and still not great it's a and the\nYou know the low forties if you look at a solid gold and then the thirties as you look at other people and so ah he's seen as very polarizing figure and he seems to stoke the culture wars\nIn a way that is not how old are the Republican Party or the country a mocking the accuser okay it is to go and saying I don't know I don't know\nAre not great for a national thing because uh you\n... ... ... who all holding off with all of qualities\nNow you know and after the victim\nWhen when I when I heard that I remember thinking at the time you know everything he just said factually is absolutely one hundred percent true\nThat in fact in terms of someone who was a a bringing accusations against others that she was she was pretty vacuous at times and I I agree with that completely the same time I grand and what he said I also grown because I think this is exactly how it's going to be taken he is again\nHanding ammunition to his opponents and he just doesn't need to do that if he had merely recited the areas in which your testimony was rather deficient on specifics instead of the mocking but\nHe just

and go after the your guest\nBut one thing that really try to get ... you know there are a lot of crazy people out there and because of the news all the stuff that you're going on right now there's gotta be somebody out there I'm kind of worried about\nTheir safety the president whether it's a thing comes down to our code and uh I Know that they got the uh you know they're pretty protective and they're always ... of the show or\nSomething practically happening but uh I Would just wondering if they should take a little more of a car and this time because of all their rhetoric crap going on or some idiot out here are the\nUh you know and they were out there for\nSure oh there are idiots without question and certainly I'm sure no one is more aware of this than the the Secret Service or if I'm not mistaken Daniel le Brock Obama received more than the average number of threats for a president wouldn't surprise me at all if ah if Donald Trump is top even that were these were very polarizing times\nOn a ... through the first African American president uh seem to get more\nRacial ... threats a than the uh than otherwise are what are you a white president and so a Trump or has attracted\nA his share a ah threats and so I think the secret service I was actually stretched thin because you have a lot of uh you know Trump kids who are running around and like to travel internationally and\nDomestically and so you have a lot more protect these ah than in previous administrations but\nIt seems like they are pretty protests on how they deal with Trump securing a and there's been a change and that of course Trump much to do those rallies and so there might be some risk to that ... or a you know they they try to do a good job protecting him\nIt's China he's just a sign of the times I mean the we we live in perilous times and uh it it's a worry but you do with the best you can Franken Cumberland, Maryland time for a quick call real quick\nAs anyone mention of

previously respected to have it on and uh he is a really come out swinging right before this confirmation pretty unprecedented for a retired justice to ah try to intervene or with the current process\nAnd in fact since since uh it could only be based on on a Kavanaugh's testimony I Would have to say to a Justice Stevens your full of it or anybody who could take the the incredible

C. they have gone from that scenario to today being one of the most aggressive lobbying country uh companies are having a lot of former politicians on the payroll\nOf making a lot of campaign contributions and very aggressively working the machinery of government for their benefit and to the detriment of competitors so yeah I think you're exactly right looking at anti trust laws are key\nBecause we do not have a free market that will correct this problem um and the question becomes how should the company be split up\nAnd the question is always this challenge of regulatory capture right that when these decisions get made in Washington D. C. oftentimes that process is influenced by the very people that the regulations or the antitrust action is going to be going against\nBut I think anti trust is a big part of this smashing the power in the grip that Google has in dominating so much of the information space\nNow another factor to consider here would be that when a ... I guess similar arguments were put forward a in an earlier era and the the steel trust him to sugar trust and a host of of the trust that existed around\nThe turn of the century ... deep into the twentieth century uh nonetheless uh the trust busting did come in\nBut those were all domestic concerns that was long before the Internet\nAlong before satellites and host of other things are these days you have to ask very frankly\nIf the United states government and all of its power and majesty has the uh the jurisdiction if you will to go after somebody as big as Facebook I'm a good just to have it might not be cheap but it it it it would be an option I suppose they could do what they do\nFrom a lot of different places they don't have to be in the territory of the United states\n[noise] yes that's exactly right and we also have to factor in that you know if you're going to go after standard oil you go after standard oil and of course they're going to use all the techniques of lobbying and hiring the lawyers but if you're going to go after Google you have the added problem that when people go\nTo look for information on the line about anti trust actions against Google a brutal controls that flow of information and and it's important to look at the history here [noise] you know again Google official position is\nWe just give objective search results it's essentially like coming to the library and we've got this digital librarian who's going to get you the best search results but here's the problem we know from history that that's not the case ten to twelve years ago you had several Web companies like Yelp\nAnd trip advisor you know they they provide the ranking services and descriptions of restaurants in travel options\nAnd they complained that Google was in the ... the late in the algorithm to their detriment that they were pushing them down in Google Search results and that Google was favoring companies competitors that they themselves had started now\nYou can say hey Google has a right to do that you know and when you can have that debate but here's the problem Google insisted that this was not true that they were giving safe and and and fair search results well the Federal Trade commission and the Obama administration looked at it\nThe European Union looked at this academics at Harvard University and looked at it and all of them said Google is lying they are cooking the books when it comes to commercial search and local search they are manipulating results\nThere is also a body of research done by whip Richard Striner a Harvard a PHD\nIn psychology former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine he certainly series of peer reviewed studies for the national Academy of sciences looking into something that he calls search engine manipulation of fat and what those research results show is that Google has the capacity\nAnd he has research shows they use that capacity to actually manipulate search results on very important issues including political issues so when you think about an antitrust action taken against Google you're not only going to be fighting the way that\nStandard oil fought a hundred years ago you're now actually fighting an entity that can control what people actually the in terms of their research on this topic\nA lot of power to be sure will come back we'll talk some more ah with our guest in this report to the program Peter Schweitzer the president of big government accountability Institute either number one in New York Times best selling author and also he is the man behind the documentary\nThe creepy lined the website for that is the creepy Lyme dot com one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six really back in just a moment\nTo come in I went back rates are very basic reading history Amazon sponsored this promotion other restrictions apply the whatsoever details\nHow did I get into credit card debt a trip to the emergency room\nMoving expenses there is a million ways to get into a credit card debt and good ones your way to start getting out of on a von ... access to online and secure loans from two thousand dollars to thirty five thousand dollars a competitive race and no extra charges Burbank back early over five hundred thousand comes to ...\nIn some alone drove on no wonder a bond has an a plus rating from the better Business Bureau the application takes minutes in it for ... for\nThirty pm central time Monday through friday funds are deposited as soon as the next business day and now if I Would also give you a fifty\nDollar Amazon dot com gift card after your first name but it's made on time to check your loan options and to get their special radio off or go to Yvonne dot com today and enter promo go Seventy one Seventy one going applying that's ab ...

take a moment to make your kid last because dad jokes rule make your kid laugh today fatherhood dot Gov rocky by the U.S department\nHealth and Human Services and yet\nThey've had been ... pushed aside you know pushed out of searches\nAnd they've all come up with one of two ideas that I wanted to see your your opinions out of the invaders thought of at a lot of them hate the idea of regulating the Internet as a public utility because they are very strongly against that but the ones that seems to have caught the fire amongst them\nIs the idea of an Internet bill of rights thinking that Google Facebook YouTube and arrests at far less become the digital town square and therefore everyone should have equal access to it\nI think that's a I think that's a great point um and and it's really instructive here to look\nBack at how the Internet was organized back in the day and in terms of the regulatory structure there was a law passed in Nineteen Ninety six called the communications decency act see da and in section two thirty of that act\nIt basically split the Internet into two categories\nCategory one is the the the company or the entity and this is what Google and Facebook claim is that you are a quote unquote neutral platform\nAnd basically the argument here is that all you really are as a telegraph you as a company or conveying information from point a to point B you're exerting no editorial control your not censoring you're not doing any of that if you are a neutral platform\nYou have no regulation whatsoever and you have no legal liability whatsoever\nThe other category of course is if you are a publisher you're exerting editorial control if you're restricting certain voices from being hurt Well Google and Facebook insist that they are neutral platforms\nBut we also know for a fact and they grudgingly admit this that they do exert editorial control so one of the arguments that people have made Senator Ted Cruz has argued this and others is that we should essentially tell Facebook and Google you have to choose\nIf you are going to insist on being a neutral platform you essentially as you just said the caller said\nYou essentially have to allow all voices to operate equally you cannot exert editorial control if you are going to exert editorial control your now for all intents and purposes is going to be treated in some respects as a media company\nNow Google and Facebook that is the last thing in the world that they want but I think it goes to the heart of the issue that the caller raises which is\nYou know you have a certain set of rights particularly if an entity claims to be a neutral platform and I think this is probably the direction that the solution needs to go in addition to the question of breaking up these companies like a gym you and I were talking about earlier in the show\nAbsolutely ... again uh\nI don't know that that uh anything in our history has ever prepared us for something quite of this nature this is an intersection\nOf the traditional issues that face notions of of concentrations of a power economic power and and other power coupled with the uh uh incredible powers that go with the twenty first century the digital age I mean this is a a whole host of a of a different a\nDifferent color here I mean for example the steel trust over a century ago was very powerful but I'm not sure it's even analogous to this\n[noise] I I think there's a huge really important point and I think you're exactly right because it is a media company that controls concepts it's different I mean imagine if in the United states backing the J\nOne newspaper control Ninety percent of the information that would be a huge concern I think to a lot of people like here's the other part of the problem that that that speaks to what you were saying we haven't been here before is\nThe the kind of action is that Google is capable of taking and Facebook also to assemble the extent\nThat the problem is we don't know what we don't know because the algorithm is secretive and because the testing and the editing and the shifting into information is all hidden process\nWe don't know what we don't know we don't know what is being a hidden from us we don't know what is being pushed in in front of our faces and that's the nature of\nWhat we're facing so it's it's it's a challenge that you're exactly right we've never faced before but it's ominous and it's important I think everybody would agree\nThat as citizens we benefit from access to all sorts of information all voices in the information um and that is just not happening in this era of these large corporations that feel like they have a duty and a responsibility to censor certain voice\nYeah which is another way to put them none of your damn business they don't have either the duty or the responsibility a I mean that's the kind of I mean it's just a ... a ... if he were alive today would think boy I was born to sue this is the perfect tool for running a a Nazi said\nNo your ear you're exactly right um and if you think about all the sort of just Toby and knowledge uh novels about a totalitarianism it was all predicated on one thing Jim essentially the power of the state\nWas going to smash in control people\nSo you know in Nineteen eighty four it's big brother and you have these you know large television screens or these voices that are sort of pumping information to us but it was visible it's kind of the you know the the\nThe clenched fist right in front of your face you know what we're facing now is not any kind of police state\nAbout what we are facing is this ominous power that is trying to persuade us that is trying to steer us in a certain direction but we can't really see the fist\nBut it's still there and the power is still there and I think you're exactly right I mean imagine a ... imagine I'm ... now or a stolen or a Mussolini that had this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we give them an enormous power and Google basically tells us trust us\nYeah trust us George Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello Lyndon\nHello can um I I I Want to make a quick comment a lot of it to believe that the party has been building the Nazi techno state with still going on Facebook and all these people but when I really call let's say asking that want to thank our guests for what he's been doing\nAnd about search engines and they're used to be I could click which had a they they have another one called start page the same company that they got rid of ex click and that was if you didn't want to use Google results you wanted other result\nAnd I don't understand that Google suppressed did they make them suppress I click or what happened to it and I use that that go\nYeah no that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in the space so look at apple for example apple has the search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google have apple nine billion dollars a year\nFor the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that it's an apple product and Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing their searches but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that because they want the information and the data that comes from search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing\nEverywhere and you're exactly right star page a is a a search engine you get great results they actually use Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without\nGay to be president I think that is that is going to change your bench Lee biggest star page is becoming more popular it was a deal struck a while ago Dr go is good\nIt's it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges the best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google\nBut the price that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you\nTo either steer you are manipulate you in a way for commercial gain or for other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there's even you know discussions about the fact that\nThing which is the Microsoft product which is sort of the great rival\nTo Google a century and twenty six teams struck a commercial agreements a Microsoft and Google struck a commercial agreement we don't know exactly what that agreement is but um they essentially have stopped being so hostile to Google with a lot of people believe\nBe\nAnd and\nThe and I\nWant to go back to the general had a show one eight six six five origin or with your wife\nProducer of the freebie line dot com documentary and a well what's your needs that I I couldn't repeat all better my life depended on it but the your response\n[noise] yeah I mean Janine slight ah look what people have to recognize is that Google like any other company in the world has to sell a product\nThe product is not the search engine and they don't make money off of the search it ... ... that they sell you and the reason they want all that information that Janine is talking about and she's actually absolutely right about Android Android tracks everything you do even if you turn off\nThe location it tracks you anyway if you turn on the phone off once you turn the phone on it all loads the information from where you were in wherever you went even when the phone was off\nThe reason Google want solve this information is they want to sell to advertisers and they are building profiles on us that they can use to manipulate us remember any time\nSomething can do somebody something for you they can also do something to you and we're giving these companies the power to do a lot\nSo it would seem Zack in Durango, Colorado good evening shallow\nIs that a gym though if you have to talk to you you have some longtime listener first time caller I was wondering if\nYou had any ideas on uh I I personally would love to like try to experience\nSome of the idea is that where I can you know find a source on the Internet where I'm not a force experience biased coverage I mean even in Google Search I have a lot of biased coverage and I realized that um [noise]\nI was wondering if you had any advice or ideas on how to try to try to negate that by it [noise]\nAh well that's a great question I mean I actually am going to go old school here when I went to graduate school in the United kingdom at Oxford in Nineteen eighty eight to Nineteen Ninety [noise] my favorite thing to do is to read three newspapers\nI read the times which was kind of a center right newspaper I read the guardian which was a left wing paper and I read the telegraph which was a conservative paper I think the point when it comes to information is no source is going to be completely biased free\nI think what we have to get used to is the notion of looking at multiple sources and it's also the way we think about information is surveys show that because of the Internet because of social media people expect the news to find that\nWe become kind of passive recipients of the news feeds that we get and the information we get what I Would say to people is read multiple sources that are different on cable news don't watch just one channel watched several channels that have different views and really filter and source the information\nDon't count on these large companies to shift to to sift in filter it for you because you are going to get results that reflect their interests and not yours\nAll right very rough enough said let's go to a village kind of a Washington next to the L O feel welcome\nThank you for having me on true I I just\nWanted to thank you for your program that you've really expanded my horizon and what I think about it because of the way you for your show my question for the gas is\nYou don't know anything about the closed door hearing that Ted Cruz had was a little while but Kavanaugh case what's going on because Google show up\nWhen Facebook they're hearing and Ted Cruz was really on working with China\nRight we've got we've got thirty seconds here or do anything about that\nI don't I doubt I Do think it shows Google's a confidence and even arrogance that one where they had the hearings on Capitol Hill\nThey didn't show up when Facebook and other companies did and I think that's what a flock to him about the fact that they feel like they're going to get past this storm of attention and controversy and I think they shouldn't we need to push for real change\nSure enough All right we'll wrap on that note and uh we didn't get to project dragon apply but there was a lot of stuff out there and again this is the documentary the creepy line dot com

[laughter] cars made in China and imported into the U.S says it at a\nFairly small tower of only two and a half percent is put on and now China if we make a car and salad there they put a twenty five percent terrorists and on some models cars we uh uh sell over there they put a fifty percent terrorists\nAre so that's not fair and Trump wants to bring China to the table as soon as possible um and I believe they'll come to the table before the end of the year\nNot only as we just have to look at China for just a second here you know was somebody in this country really stupid enough to make that deal or either Chinese simply a ignoring what they agreed to do in the first place\nI Know as somebody made a bad deal\nWhy when you make a deal that ban I I'm I'm astounded I mean why would not anybody run against any administration made such a deal by citing those very figures\nAnd campaigning in every state that was affected with workers that were affected by that I I'm just astounded how could it would be better to have no trade with China than than trade in that kind of circumstance\n... yeah I'm a ... it's it's worse than that if ... if you look at every agreement we we have\nNAFTA with China or what we did have with South Korea what you made a little better Japan or even the European Union every one of the agreement is slanted in favor of our trading partners\nAn example I use is it's it's as if we're playing baseball\nAnd we get three outs every inning and for some reason that's where the agreements resign give every one of our trading partners for house every inning\nThat why are losing every ball game\nWhy in the world would we do this I mean I just ... I'm astounded that that we would do this ... ... ... we have the ministry nations would you have done this a night given the number of deals you just mentioned I assume this covers democratic and Republican administrations why would you do that\nI think the idea was that a particular with master back in the in the nineties look the U.S economy is so big that um we'd like to create a free trade zone in North America but look or so big we really should help Mexico and Canada\nOr develop their economies so even if we give them a break\nThat will help them grow and develop and we ... we should have an obligation I guess I had to help uh some of our our trading partners\nNo bless ablaze are you kidding me that's not a I mean I I guess that would be nice for all of those are those are those voters who elected us presidents from a an auto was Saskatchewan and a Chihuahua but of course there are no voters they're the these are are deals worked out by administrators elected by Americans we have no\nObligation of legal certainly and as far as I'm concerned no moral obligation to build up their economies\nI mean this isn't the days of the Marshall Plan for Pete's sake\nThat's exactly right and ... you know and President Trump when he was running for office he says look ... everybody we're all concerned with globalism and trying to help everybody else and it's time we put America's interests first\nAnd then uh other countries of interest deals are are are just so bad that we have hundreds of billions of dollars\nFlowing out of our country every year because we allow these the deals that they had to look at the European Union same thing with cars they have a two and a half percent Tyra for cars made in Germany or\nFrance we charge a two and a half percent to Arab we make a car salad in Europe they charge at ten percent tariff\nSo we buy a lot of their cars money flows out of the country they buy very few of our cars very little of that money flows into the country we end up with this huge negative balance of trade\nI Wonder how that happens [laughter] and by the way just for the record just for the record now you're talking about Europe the European Union I suppose from the moment of its formation until this very day has always had a bigger economy than the United states\n... yeah in in total if they add up all twenty three ... of the of the European Union yeah yeah so um\nThe idea what was it was all at look at with with Canada so the the us dairy farmers are extremely efficient at producing dairy products and we can make a product sell it in Canada for a dollar\nA Canadian dairy farmers cost them three dollars and fifty cents to make the same product so the Canadian government says look we want to protect our dairy industry\nOr going to put a two hundred and Seventy percent tariff on dairy products of something we sell for a dollar two dollars and Seventy seven tier of picks it up at three Seventy that may means the Canadian dairy farmers that can make it for three fifty stay in business but it closes the U.S\nDairy farmers out of the Canadian market\nThis agreement it doesn't completely fix it by ... ... works toward a rectify that situation\nWill talk some more about this with our guest Dr Michael butler he is a public policy analyst and professor of finance\nAt Stockton University on line that the Stockton dot edu that if you look at this and this case a renegotiated NAFTA which has yet to be ratified to be sure it is called the United states Mexico Canada agreement\nIt doesn't have quite the hand the acronym of NAFTA but I guess uh maybe uh\nUh in line with an old popular song us M.

the ... one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six delighted to have you on the program tonight as we are talking about the new deal that's been were dealt with Mexico and Canada\nUm uh but if you and I taught in the very beginning of the show your cat and when I said all these trade deals are skewed in favor of our trading partners are kept asking me why and I don't couldn't come up with a real good answer\nAs though it may they have to do with follow the money um I still it looked to me like\nUh the u._s. was just trying to make these deals and uh had some a sense of are wanting to help other countries\nAre and that's why these deals were so a lopsided in favor of the trading partners it could have something to do with the money I don't know I Can't for the life of me figure out why everybody kept making all these deals for all these years or so if somebody comes up with a good reason um it may it may make\nMuch here and I would I Would only add again seriously you must understand the first of all and this was the view that is far too widely held among some ... some elite circles in this country we're only Americans number one\nAnd number two ah there is this this deep empathy for the the bass teeming masses of anywhere else\nAnd this notion that we have this this moral obligation to to lift them up and if it costs American workers a little bit well that's okay are they all have a relatively higher incomes and I really\nA series of that's a major motivating factor a lot of these people with a lot rather have a Nobel Peace prize that maybe would a billion dollars Sharon\n... you know what can I think not I'm not going to suspect that that they believe that they just kept ... ever [laughter]\nWhy thoroughly agree I thoroughly agree you just you just have to understand the people with whom we're dealing here and I said that that I've been around these people and that is the attitude maybe there's some money here maybe Sharon's on to something but I I think that as a lot of simply has to do with the fact\nThat that these ... you must understand that the the ... many of these people is how to make themselves morally superior to the rest of us\nAnd and if they go to night go to bed every night thinking you know I've I've made things better for the teeming mass was out there somewhere thanks of course do they're screwing over a lot of my fellow citizens in a better term by the way that they\nThey it's true that they don't believe in citizenship anyway they they're they're all part of this one world thing to buy on hold hands crowd or but but seriously that that's a major part of the motivation here\nUh but anyway thank you very much\nYeah absolutely I mean I I I really honestly do despite my questioning of a doctor bus or about that I really think that's a large part of the of the motivation and ah let's not talk to a Maggie who calls in from Alexandria, Virginia ... show hello Maggie\nThanks for taking my call sure there might be more than ask you a reason for this um situation if these lopsided trade deals because we have to think this is not really trade that's coming in here either outsourced American goods coming in here from China from Mexico from ... in from Canada all those cars you know\nSingle in some cases no they're not all outsourced but some are that's go ahead and\nThe thing is so um [noise] DC oh see the problem is outsourcing American seals they should be made to register as foreign agents for the country that the uh for production to really have a tattoo on their forehead\n[laughter] Hi this is a scarlet letter I like it or I Would read too yeah yeah you know the\nThis endangering the country if we had no steel industry here or know anything else we can't defend this place you know see see China has a communist government will be the shut shut down your opponent or shut down your opponent and altogether is shut down the industry you don't see if you have the industry can't we can't defend this place you know of course ...\n... those were points that are worth discussing first of all of course although officially the Communist Party still runs China but uh as I've long said the the the changes taking place over there you could power Beijing off of Mao spinning in his grave with all the millionaires driving around in Shanghai on their Ferrari is\nSo it's not a communist economy although it's still partially come to this but it is a a a a a a communist government with a huge dose of capitalism but that your thoughts that Dr butler\nYeah I I was just going to say I'm everything makes sense now here's the argument for allowing a China to make the products instead of being made in America so so let's say it cost a U.S\nA company's a hundred dollars a ton to make steel\nSuppose China can make it four eighty dollars a ton and sell it to us at twenty dollars less than we can produce it ourselves that will result in lower priced steel which means that slower\nA price deal going into finish goods and that should keep the price of finished good wow so that's all consumers benefit by having the lower priced steel now some people argue well it's lower price because China subsidizes the Chinese government subsidizes the steel industry and that's true\nBut if if that's the case um many economists have argued if they subsidize their steel industry so they pay part of the costs and sell it to us for less money aren't they really subsidizing what we pay for steel\nAnd if that's the case shouldn't we take as much of the subsidies as they're willing to give us\nAll right let's legendary carry the argument a little bit further here it costs about nine million dollars to making him one a one Abrams tank I'm sure the Chinese could make if we're far less than that so why don't we\nOutsource our entire capability of making battle tax to the Chinese and while rather we could also outsource you have thirty five fighter in our modern ships in the like and that we would just make out like band is except for the fact that of course we will become the third rate world power\nYet except we don't have to have them built the tanks in the planes but\nIf the tanks in the planes have so much steel and them we can try to steal from the Chinese are much lower cost\nThan it cost them for us to make it ourselves then instead of these planes costing whenever they cost a few million dollars a piece you can reduce the cost to make the planes we don't need to give China our technology we don't need to let them make the finished product but if they can make components\nCheaper than we can make them ourselves are we better off taking it from them um and that allows us to produce it cheaper and that will be better off for us is\nWhich raises another point and I only as a dumping I'm going to bring up when we come back from the break but the point is you said that ... we we shouldn't have to give the the Chinese our ah our intellectual property secrets but of course to build a plant in China Today that's exactly what the Chinese have extracted from us\nAnd we'll come back and we'll talk some more about uh some of the the Chinese are applications that possibly this new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada are may\nPreview one eight six six five oh Jim boat with our guest\nDr Michael butler from
