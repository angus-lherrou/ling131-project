{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "And so that'll get you into a mess I and so you know I Would if I knew I Want to prove to myself that I'm not going to do this up and that's what I'm telling you to do a is so go to the non classes in nine weeks\nAnd then stay you can watch the videos and you can go on keep going you go to the legacy journey class online or you can you can get into groups on line and say you know continue the discussion with the tribe and talking about it you got every dollar plus connecting to your bank on line and that's there with you for a year I'm giving you every bit of that\nUm we sell all that for a hundred and twenty nine dollars is about five hundred dollars worth of stuff though\nAnd it's a really really really incredible value and uh it's all eight years and we want you to take care of it all we ask is is that you follow the stuff both of you plug into this and\nSome day when you're doing really good find a guy who um feels like a product will and you help him out and that's all I ask you to do things for the call Megan is in Chicago Hi Megan welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I Am a newer and listener here forgive me for my ignorance um\n[laughter] I Am on baby step to we have our um housing our savings that are currently working on our we have about thirty forty thousand dollars and that includes our cars we do not have a mortgage we currently rent now my question is\nUm we're going to have it paid off in the next two years maybe even a year right\nNow we have a plan that we want to take our children into an RV for about two years and travel the country um\nHowever we would have to finance ticket Harvey and something to tell us when we feel like kind of have to ask them to her kids are getting older I'm terribly would not like to wait if possible but I just wanted to see what your advice for something like ... ...\n... it's an eight dream I like having the dream that's cool very cool well um mugging I don't tell people to borrow money because every time I find people borrowing money I'll find broke people right and um and if you borrow on something that goes down in value as fast as an RV does I'm going to find really broke people\nHave you ever tried to sell used RV and seeing other people\nAnd most jak possible to get rid of them are they're hard to get financing on and they go down in value faster than almost anything what wheels and motors they are mathematically horrendous\nOr they're just a mess and so um the other the other one is a big a medium sized boat if you get a hundred million dollar boat you can get financing on it and if you get a cheap ... you can get financing on it but the middle range of boats the fifty two hundred and fifty thousand is a difficult product\nAnd uh so you just about have to have the money to just consume it and be able to afford it so what I Would tell you what's your household income\nAnd it's got sixty thousand\nOkay I Would get myself out of debt I'd worked extra jobs and then I Would save up and pay cash for an RV that would um\nThat would suffice for the two year period of time and then if you sell it at somewhat of a lost at least you got only me dead on it and you don't get caught in it it's not a problem it doesn't ruin your life going forward because if you take a wonderful dream like you have and you finance it you're going to turn it into a nightmare\nRight it's going to cause a problem for your family because I mean you put a hundred grand and an RV by the time you get home is worth fifty\nAnd you're going to be stuck and going all that money and you know you're going to mess up your kid's college plan you're going to mess up your retirement I mean it it could be disastrous if you do this wrong and so what I Do save up and buy one or to look for a program where you can rent one for two years if we can do that for two years and just turn it back\nWell it is a pretty hard to to figure uh not always clear exactly how our views are are are are brought about a sometimes but nonetheless there it is a interesting enough Stevens ever not mistaken was selected by Gerald Ford was not a Republican\nI Believe he was yeah and you know that just goes to show you that are no matter who gets nominated and confirmed to the Supreme Court you can always count on which direction they're going to go after a particular time and you know they they get settled in and they\nAnd they look at the various cases various issues and maybe maybe their minds change on some things too\nI think conservatives at all I have a lot of hope for a justice cabinet or ah I Know that most of the people line\nOh I Wish him all the best in and hope that he has a a good in a long career on the on the Supreme Court\nBut you know as a journalist you know I'm a skeptic ... you're you're into broadcast journalism I'm sure you're skeptical about a lot of things too and it it let's just wait and see what happens or the ... we still don't know if there's going to be a Second Amendment case coming up or not if there is\nA we'll get to see how he handles\nYeah having having noted that but yeah it's always something of a crapshoot when presidents elects a a Supreme Court nominee one that they they always of course regardless of their background always hope will be more or less a media logical clone of their own thinking it seems to me that in recent years\nThat a Democrat democratic presidents have done a better job of picking such people than have Republicans that that most of those who enter into what their uh their followers my call heresy tend to be a Republican justice is maybe the most notable in recent memory of being a jeep Justice Roberts\nOn a Obama Caribbean constitutional since it is a tax ignoring the fact that if it is a tax and it was adopted unconstitutionally tax bills have to start in the house but\nIt just seems to me that that somehow democratic presidents have picked more shall we say idiot logically pure nominees and wonder why that is\nWell honestly I don't know if if I figure that one out I'll call you then we'll both have a scoop but\nI I think that a ...\nOn the left with with Democrats picking the people who are either the ideologically the same as as they are that's that's fairly predictable or I look at it this way or the Republican presidents\nPick judges that may or may not adhere to a strict party line\nAnd that's maybe a good thing you know because uh when when somebody gets appointed to the highest court in the land\nThey have to I think have some flexibility and look at each case as it comes along I didn't agree with the weight Roberts came down on Obamacare I thought that was just nonsense but he decided it that way and\nUh on the other hand Robert sided with the four other justices in two thousand\nEight in two thousand and ten one they affirmed that the second amendment does protect an individual right to keep and bear arms\nUh that's my that's my news beat that's where I'm at with this and and I think that was very important for the nation and not just good owners of the nation but\nUh the the in the entire nation um the writers there you don't have to exercise that right or the trick is not trying to stop somebody else from exercising that right the right as always going to be there\nAnd ah twice in the last ten years the high court is protected that right so and Justice Roberts was what the majority on the\n... I stay with us more to come as we're going to be taking a look at this aspect of what may indeed be coming\nBefore the Supreme Court and new justice Brett Kavanaugh although I've checked some of the

justice Brett Kavanaugh including mainly gun issues in this particular instance in that scenario of course where there have been many many a resounding battle that has occurred at the Supreme Court Charles calls in Springfield, Missouri this evening hello Charles\n[noise] Hi there how you doing Mr Bannon I'm fine thank you um I was\nListening and I you know you hit on a topic that's always been a kind of a hot button for me and that is how the liberals always do get these ideologues that you know completely side with them but the um\nYou know people get bored you know anytime that a conservative tries to get someone that really is on their side not some halfway you know a ... a you know the Democrats are an absolute fit the we the the conservatives do nothing they they have constantly there the\nThe party of appeasement and they need some on this got some fighting in just says no or we're going to fight for this and we just haven't seen it I mean I look at the Democrats and how they treated cabinet and that'd be despicable\nAnd neither party however why don't we ever fight fight they put up\nYou know the ... that's a good point out what our guest to address and I certainly agree with the Charles uh absolutely uh Dave in regard to the motion of the next time there's a a a Democratic president if we put up a liberal justice so we start coming up with the stories about how they uh\nThey uh they litter or have overdue parking tickets or what have you I think that that is the droves noted that disgusting practice\nBut uh I was wondering uh have Republicans fought hard enough regarding some of the more liberal a recent pick say for example a bronco Obama's pick some of which I I think sailed a ride through I mean it seems to be Republicans tend to follow the the the victim\nI if I'm not mistaken and I could be wrong but police department so I Believe in general are began to come into being probably oh sixty or Seventy years after the nation's founding\nOr you may have had constable or or something of that nature but in terms of full scale police departments are I'm not sure Dave that uh\nThat they really did exist at the time that NATO\nFact or if I recall correctly the oldest a loan\nUm and I you know I I think part of the fault lies over on Capitol Hill to\nWhen you get a activists at one extreme or the other trying to recreate the the constitutional laws the way they want to created I'm at some point\nThat whole process is going to run right off\nThe rails and yeah I Wish I had the answer to how to keep everybody in line but I just don't you know I I just write about this stuff\nYeah I I I certainly a share your uh your\nUh your views and and and the Charlie I have great sympathy for him as well I've cited us before a number of times on the program and I think it was sort of my or one of the liberal women on the court are British or in at some point during arguments Sotomayor I Believe it was made reference to something being beneficial\nI remember thinking of the time beneficial is none of your damn business you're concerned about beneficial than resign that Supreme Court seat run for the house the Senate or the presidency and let's see if your idea of beneficial coincides with that of the public\nBut beneficial to describe me coming out of the mouth of U.S Supreme court justice beneficial ... nothing to do with your job\nWell yeah um so uh you know you're here we are a back I guess at square one how how did she get on the court will the Republicans say they were collegial and didn't challenge some of these things\nAre obviously they they at least somebody\nHad to know about this did they ask the tough questions but I frankly I think\nWe just with this with the cabinet or a confirmation process the rules just got changed even even Senator Lindsey Graham who is\nTypically a laid back guy he ... his things were out the other day he was\nFurious at his Democratic colleagues are on the Senate Judiciary committee and I don't think that's going to go away I think they changed the rules and you know what they're going to have to live with that for a very long time in ... when Republicans\nCome back and say there is a Democrat is president uh sometime in the next four to eight years on and we'll see how that works out uh if if if someone is nominated to\nA a vacancy on the high court I think the gloves could easily come back off again and in ... what is what good does it do for the country I don't know I don't know what some of these people are thinking well\nI I I can tell you what some of them are thinking and then we'll take a quick break here but a lot of Democrats are really running very scared right now the divorce happened to them is the same as what happened to Joe Crowley the prominent or\nA Democratic House member many thought might may be a successor to Nancy Pelosi is Democratic House leader beaten by its Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nWho

situation in California because of that law out there where everybody runs in one primary and the top two finishers\nAutomatically go on the ballot in November which means that the Republicans this year have nobody on the ballot for Senate you've got Feinstein the incumbent and you've got a Democrat even further to the left than she is and the California Democratic party endorsed her opponent\nA lot of these Democrats I think in their heart of hearts are probably not thrilled with this but first and foremost they want to keep their jobs and they are running hard scared because of their own

Supreme Court\nWith its full nine member complement of justice is a Brett Kavanaugh about included a showing up or work tomorrow morning mark in Bonner is very Idaho is our next call hello mark\nRight Jim are you doing fine thank you ma'am\nListen I'm of course up here in North Idaho were very storage defenders of our Second Amendment rights\nUm and I noticed that through the heartland and other states it really relax the cherry laws for um arms and the question I Want to ask your guest is\nUm gimme provide any concrete um statistics regarding reduction in crime rates with the increased um secular and Jerry well\nThat's always tough because there are there are different points of view on whether or not a concealed carry is contributed to reduction in crime but I Will say this over the last several years we have seen\nA steady increase in the number of us citizens who are legally licensed to carry right now according to a one estimate it it's about Seventeen and a half a million people\nIn the United states are licensed to carry over here in neighboring Washington state where I'm at a we're above five hundred and Ninety eight thousand\nThe active concealed pistol license I'm not sure how you guys are over in Idaho but we're both open carry states too and and people really need a permit license to do that uh but I have noticed a John lot for example who has\nA crime prevention Research Center bag and a frequent guest on the program but yeah and\nA nice guy and and he always has a pretty good handle on how I'm concealed carry and gun ownership relates to reduction in crime\nAre now the other side will see it has no bearing whatsoever but I I Will say this\nI've written about this several times ah it hasn't\nContributed to an increase in crime so everything that we were told for all those years that more guns in in private hands more guns on the street more licensed to carry concealed is going to lead the blood baths\nThat's nonsense and it's been demonstrably proven so but it's nonsense all the crime we see in Chicago for example the Detroit the Baltimore Washington DC none of those people was licensed to carry their own quirks carrying guns legally\nOr the law abiding citizens don't contribute to the problem at all but it it it's the bad guys to begin with and that's why there are so many law abiding citizens we want to ... an even playing field\nAnd if in fact it was the the presence of guns per capita that contributed to crime then the murder capital of America would be a young males living in rural areas\nWell yeah and believe me we be reading about that every day on the front page of every English speaking newspaper above the fold because that would be a real genuine problem\nYeah uh uh looking ahead\nThey've got the less than a minute to go here of what are you thinking is likely to be the next ... such a Second Amendment case to get the court\nI think the the high court is eventually going to have to consider a right to carry whether it's a challenge of concealed carry laws in in California or New Jersey or one of the other states with very restrictive laws and then we're going to get around eventually to whether or not semi automatic\nA modern sporting rifles are protected by the second amendment I think they are well see other court comes\nRight very good say on the line we'll speak off the air again uh Dave workman our guest is senior editor at the gun maggot dot com and at liberty park press ... communications director for the citizens committee for the right to keep and bear arms

enough of that of a criticism that the people now are much more conscious of it and I mean schools are conscious of it too\nAnd we we have one thing that we have to deal with that is very big and that is and you mentioned it earlier\nUh the NFL has a really captivated this country to a certain extent or by the news is by the ... by the in the Suzie as it might generate by the publicity it gets\nAnd you know kids grow up thinking that's their dream maybe it's the same dream the kid going to major league baseball but what I'm trying to say is when you add up the number of kids that come out each year as seniors or eligible for the pro draft when it takes place\nAround one a little over one percent of those kids make it so there's a large percentage of people that have to go on to do other things with their life and that's why it's essential that they get a degree get an education\nAbsolutely ah just to uh to quote from the forward to the book was by the way there's a pretty distinguished cast of characters along with Bob cats the ... in the book first in forever forward or is by Archie Manning afterward by Bobby dowden that's football royalty but uh\nUh\nJust to quote from uh some of the remarks that were made a bio Archie Manning as he was a\nA being a a\nPresented I guess of this was the he was a twenty sixteen recipient of the national football foundation gold\nMedal award a forward they give and it's gone from presidents to coaches who Archie Manning\nRight ah and of course of those who don't happen to follow football that much the father of Peyton and he lied and a number of other ... by the way some of whom also played football but uh yeah the father of two\nUh imminently a a successful a professional football quarterbacks and of course he was one himself here uh manning\nHad this to say I understand that everything evolves even our game and like the changing seasons everything goes in cycles including how young people celebrate how they want to dress different be different but it's still a game of blocking tackling competing and getting up after you've fallen down and doing it all over again that's called resilience\nAnd no one who questioned the value of Brazilians and the ever changing world\nAround us I'm a bit old fashioned but that's okay I admire when opponents show respect for each other including that well deserved post game hand shake up I Wonder your thoughts about football the character builder because as much as I said about that and the notion of teamwork\n[noise] I think the thing that sets it apart from other sport and this is not a criticism of other sports but just the fact is just what you say team even got eleven guys\nOn often eleven on defense you have especially team you have a kickoff team you have a lot of participants involved in the game and for them to work together eventually to go out there and put on a show and hopefully be successful not always but they are\nIs team and that's the concept\nThat art she's referring to in most football players when they talk about their experiences in the game and go on in their lives they come back to it and if you read that book you'll see that the majority of those guys will talk about the fact\nThat they referred back or cold on that team or concept in their lives when things were a little bit tough matter what the situation he can't over exaggerate that that team work has to work a condo Lisa rice\nAnd we all know her very well [noise] uh in two thousand Fifteen was awarded the gold medal the same award that Archie got two thousand sixteen\nAnd people were wondering why it was kind of police or rice and they brought a New York to dinner and he got Fifteen hundred people from all over the\nA tree in the audience college hall of famers and what have you and she got up and she summed up I think the game as well as anybody I've ever heard she said you won't believe this is my daddy\nWas a football coach he coached high school football and Alabama and he used to say Condi or what is the lead guy do when he pulled so right\nHe's trapped blocking daddy he's trapped block it and why they have five defensive backs in there and his third long that Supreme in daddy that Supreme it she said she summed up the impact of football or the American culture she said you watched team made up of young men of all backgrounds ...\nAll races all ethnicities pulling together working together as team loving each other respecting each other\nIs a reflection of the Americas journey and I think that's exactly what I mean when I talk about teamwork and football and the kind of game it is you need all those guys to make it successful and uh I think that's what sets it apart\nAnd still does you know why people continue to play outstanding and\nThey will continue our discussion here but I'm going to take a little change of pace you're just a note one particular thing that may have impacted a lot of you if you were a loved one jet lag or foot crabs you know how painful and disruptive they can be muscle cramps could Joel ... out of a sound sleeper interrupt your daily life\nBut listen carefully because I recently learned

Seventeen the headline was playing tackle football before twelve is tied to brain problems later and so I ask you Bob Casio though are we heading to the day when\nAll football is a flag football or or tag football this sort of thing because other so the lot of athleticism that can be performed there and yet I don't see stadiums being filled either at the collegiate or the professional level\n[noise] I don't think I don't think you and I may see it perhaps we may but I think we can see that that there's going to be less contact on the the smaller level it could very well be that they changed the rules for young kids and youth football to do that\nOr because they didn't keep them away from hitting before they get to a certain age and I just want to make a very quick note here because I think it's important gym ah this past year and the state of Texas are ... that the football\nEvery high school coach whether he'd be varsity junior varsity a freshman had to take a test\nOn state wide tackling certification program teaching the proper techniques of tackling or they couldn't coach over Ninety percent of them got through it but it's something that was run by a company called out of this eighty eight of us\nHad to Portland, Oregon and hey have moving on through different states and that's what you're going to see you didn't see techniques changing in a seat teaching techniques changing and getting more and more away from using the head and\nAs a tackling weapon going back to what even by the thousands says in his chapter he taught and coached and played as a shoulder tackle it I think to see a lot of those kind of changes they may come about at the lower level too\nBut I Do believe you're going to see a greater tendency now to put emphasis on coaching techniques particularly tackling technique\nAnd I suspect you're quite correct that's the direction that we are heading a but again can you see a a football\nGame if you will or that is is that much a reduced from the level of violence that we've seen in recent years or maybe it doesn't become flag football as such but the contact is so reduced it's I think to a certain extent\nLike why many people will honestly admit they go to a to stock car races or they go to watch NASCAR to watch the crashes\nAnd I think that the more than a few people go to football games college and professional to watch the collisions I mean the the greatest hits videos out there that exist in some of them are are are pretty brutal stuff uh they're very popular\nAnd I'm just wondering if your thoughts about whether or not granted football can remain an activity that is played at the amateur level the for fun level the stay in shape level but will it remain a big time spectator sport without a fair level of just flat knocking people down\nI don't think it'll come to that totally but I Do feel that that will be a greater and you'll see it you see it now you watch a football game whether it's a Saturday afternoon or Sunday and you see more flags on the ground why because they're calling more penalties they calling penalties perhaps they didn't call before the cut back\nOn this that the intensity as well as how people are going after each other I don't feel in my heart I don't feel that's going to happen because he said something very important they ... they had a game in at Texas a and end the Saturday at a hundred thousand people watching Kentucky played Texas A M\nI don't think that's going to change dramatically right away\nAre you concerned about the number of high schools that are dropping football and and apparently that's quite a few nationwide\nOr if it's been reported that and there are some sure and and there's some that have gone from from a\nA you know\nCutting back on the corners they play how much time and again yes that's happening yeah I'm concerned and I think it's happening and you've got to face it let's be honest about it the entire country is changing when you think about how many pounds that can go back to the days I recruited in Pennsylvania heavily\nColds have steel town a lot of those towns don't exist anymore because those industries that Don the retailers have gone\nThe young people who are involved that\nAre not there anymore so that changing scene of the population you got a lot more students coming from different parts of the world\nSo I think that part of it could have an effect in time but there's still a great deal of time for people to see the opportunity to play the game I Believe\nAnd what it can do for you as far as education

of football is published by posts to press [noise] what do you think the future is I mean having major case are you an optimist\nAnd I'm an optimist if people are willing to consider what the game has meant to so many you know we need to promote would I I said earlier the good in the game because there's so much of it too much to squander and deny people that\nThe experience that over the years has helped build so many young lives and lead them\nTo great futures and careers which for many led to great contribution to society that's not an exaggeration\nThe game is it does that for people and there are many examples of it not just in my book there examples all over the country and I just feel it's so important that that avenue will be there for them wherever they might be not everybody should play the game I realize that\nBut there's a percentage of kids who might have the physical structure mental toughness ... city and the talent to make it work [noise]\nIs there anything about the equipment or the rules which you would like to see changed\nBut I think the rules and tackling have to change ... years ago we went to spring practice a coaching at Dartmouth who in the spring practice in the south and we had a couple of coaches came back after being at a university down there and they came in and\nSaid you know the teaching a whole new tackling technique and he said what does that all about and they said they using the head they feel they get more balanced by putting their head right in the chest of the above Kerry or whoever they intend to defensive player is because you have more balanced and less chance of making a mistake or slipping by and that\nBecame the way to do it that the biggest difference now I think those kind of rules have changed and they are and that's a change I think you'll see a as and coaching techniques change with it or I think you'll see more safety and more kids playing the game and less\nLess injuries as I said earlier it's a physical game and it's going to the injuries but less hard tough injuries and I think we'll see a change in that\nI'm not sure what we can really do I mean today's helmets or so designed to distribute to\nA force or a you've got to the face guards of course a a padding all over the body I'm not even sure my imagination can't carry me or to a great deal more in terms of just what we do short of a case of a player in a in a virtual suit of armor\n... would you change the equipment at all\nI think it is changing Jim I think you're seeing new changes in helmet structure you mentioned something earlier you mentioned the a buddy\nYou mentioned tackling and practice study ... says the coach at Dartmouth College and he instituted about five years ago a rule that\nOnce preseason practices overeating never was going to have contact during the week contact with someone they played on Saturday he created all kinds of equipment with the help of manufacturers\nBlocking tackling dummies and things that\nGave some type of resistance but safety so they could run through something and not be running into a brick wall hit is taken on so well you mentioned Brown University\nSeveral schools throughout the country you're looking at it now and I think that's what you're going to see less\nPhysical contact during the week and limited to the game time and uh basically I think those kinds of changes will help the sport and also show people parents that people care and looking at the best ways to coach their kids\nAnd the briefly what the time remaining if you will check the highest paid

of rape versus an accusation of rape or an accusation of rape unfounded would be a terrible thing or being raped I I I have no idea what that would be like and I'm very glad that I I bring Noah\nNoah ... ah empathy if you will to the subject it's not something we most of us want to be familiar with but I certainly see your point lives and and I mean again today\nIn town hall and man not mind because some of these moving more rain and I sympathize with them and I I mean it's wrong I like it being I could see them but they have nowhere I taking it out on on ...\n[noise] well it certainly is not a correct thing to do I would absolutely concur that uh again there's just no legitimate basis for doing that I mean it would be the same thing as if we were to say are based on the Duke lacrosse case all women are liars really based on one case\nHi Ken Hi um is it your comments\nSo far the expression of our age regardless of the recession\nI merely noting that often outrages expressed in an arena in which there simply isn't significant reason for that outrage and sometimes it as expressed in the way up since I was not treated justly\nThat therefore any retribution against someone else can make make up for my circumstance I merely noting misplaced outrage that's all\nRight here on national radio so I Am and you're and you're saying it's okay for me it's okay for me to be outrage but no one else\nI Know you're wrong absolutely not I have said no such thing I simply have noting misplaced outrage and I gave the the two principal types I'm Talking about talking about\nOutrage about a silly basketball game and I'm Talking about outrage in the form of the because society did not treat my particular sexual\nAssault correctly therefore last year out of anybody else in particular against somehow redress the balance that is the type of outrage I'm Talking about\nI I agree um\nAlmost entirely okay but again\nYou're being outraged about being our age\nNot really not really in a way I'm poking fun at it to a certain extent but I'm also opening up the bones to people like you and he but he wants to be outraged with me is fine but I barely know that we have outrage about everything anymore and it is time to lighten up a little bit\nUm\nYes I agree Germany is that what you're talking about well being outraged\nAbout being Eldridge it just seems\nI don't know well up for a while\nI don't consider it off the wall because I frankly in it to a certain extent big more tongue in cheek with the case of of the basketball circumstance but I've certainly outraged at the misplaced outrage yes I Am absolutely\nAnd and again I I I don't know about going into it a third time with the ... the police suffice it to say that I think it's time that we were a little more specific and a little more careful about our expressions of outrage which you are free to express right here where they in Burlington, Vermont good evening\n... jumbo um thank you for taking my call yes ma'am\nDizzy and heartbreaking president said that the youngest of Ted Kennedy has\nTwo daughters today on a Fox when President Trump had\nThem on the family and congratulating him\nYou know that little girl when he it was announced that he was going to be considered for the Supreme Court\nJudge Kavanaugh says yes and I forget her name that he said yes he's always you know his young his oldest daughter was more subdued and and he said yes she's the little one she's always happy always smiling a lot of you know she was so happy when he was announced and\nWhen I saw her today I Swear Jim she must have cried as as in tears she looked she she looked so different like that little girl I had been through the ringer I mean it was heartbreaking to see the difference between\nThat little girls happiness or what was it um how long ago now that they first announced a week because today I forget yeah\nIt's just heartbreaking that little girl never never forget what her father and her family had gone through and the hatred and the terror and\nHaving guides going to school I mean it's just I've never seen anything more of a testimony to the vicious cruelty of what was done to that family\nYeah I I Will girl yeah\nHer her ... she she would smoke\nAnd when she looked at that age then but then she stopped smiling more often than than she smiled and it just was so such a contrast Finland she was so happy for her dad she couldn't stop smiling when it first\nThen and it was a tremendous contrast and I certainly would concur with you\nIn that regard winning a very unfortunate\nAnd again uh it it would be helpful if we could target our our thoughts and our feelings a little more and also put them in greater perspective\nA again whatever may have happened to someone else out there and it was not the precise circumstance is whatever they may have been that may or may not have involved Christine board and Brett Kavanaugh\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo we

courage to go down for the last forty years the violence is shooting this has nothing to the young kids right now they don't know what it is when I watch it on TV\nAnd the school shootings and they were Hollywood bowling for any of that\nWell I I I haven't heard them I have heard of the blame in the movies and everything I have heard them in fact the blame for it and in some cases I think that that is probably justifiably so I I don't know if ... percent will be the appropriate figure but certainly yes there is a\nA a a reason why are some of it should go in that direction I Would concur one eight six six five oh jumbo Marlene in the ... Georgia good evening Marlene\nHi Jim how you doing I'm well thank you\nUh I was calling just to kind of I've been hours right when I was like ten years\nOld and I'm I'll be Seventy next month I remember every detail as far as that goes and it was brutal right close off at gunpoint and scared me you know and I could never tell it never it daily\nUh I I must ask you if you don't mind me asking\nSure uh\nWhy why did you not I mean what were the circumstances would have prevented you Jill I'm going to prevent you from from going to the police or your parents were somebody and then there was this was someone was\nMarried my husband was in Vietnam and this was someone you knew\nNo no I didn't know him but they that they knew you\nWell know a friend of mine we work together and we share our supposed to go to ... go window shopping or go jogging and I went to pick her up and she had started staying with this guy\nAnd he came to the doors ... back any minute and it was very nice and pleasant and I I Know it was stupid I guess I was Eighteen going his grass\nIt may not you know nothing about what allowed Godfrey and didn't know\nIf I should say you you knew this was a ... a a person that a friend of yours new\nYeah but but but ah I mean I went to college\nAnd they her up really bad I mean really bad\nRight well I mean I guess the point of getting out of here is ... and all of this was terrible and I'm Sorry to hear it but I guess the point I'm getting at is that why you couldn't go to the authorities I mean uh uh uh granted that's a terrible terrible threat that somebody would make but I mean I\nIf in fact you could make a compelling case or or it doesn't mean necessarily but did you automatically have to be a a victim to this individual it it would seem to me that uh if nothing else you could\nMaybe move out of the area for a while or something until the trial was over I mean it it's it's terrible that the the the justice was never served and I gather in this case this person was never tried right\nOh he was not no he wasn't and he kidnapped me and kept it for three days you know and he and another guy but fortunate does the guy didn't bother me I'm so glad for that I mean\nHe is could have been worse you\nKnow I was mad enough [noise] pardon me is I Believe it was bad enough but the point I'm getting\nAn album and I love Florida really wanting to my point was and I mean I ... yeah that's\nBeen you know that many years nearly fifty years ago yeah now right and I remember every detail pretty close to every day too but I'm On my point is\nIs is way men that are up you should not put every man in that category that manner Maine in ...
