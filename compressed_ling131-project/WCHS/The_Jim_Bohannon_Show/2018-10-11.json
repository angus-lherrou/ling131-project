I Do a lot of tourists\nWere told to her out of\nThere were actual permanent residents here I Know that they had they want or the pick up so much beat it last minute\nI worry about the the the the type of damage that you've seen that from Michael because of the rapid movement of the storm\nI'm Wondering about a comparison of the storm surge that is the water with the wind I mean over a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds uh people who've been through that including me I have no real idea of what that kind of wind velocity is all about\nRight and it can handle tell me that never seen any sort of like this at Easter or ... without windows or cattle were no issue ... or ... are are at this appeared quickly it at a\n... start at science art that of course we don't get much on what number that dog starch was because of all level that starts at ...\n... ... in the in terms of of of your own personal safety I've actually done some of this storm chasing it must be ... that was in my uh my my younger and or shall we say a\n... a ... hour days and I admire what people like you do but I must have asked you still have you ever ever sit there thinking this isn't worth it\nYou know I think it's really important to show people there's a third of a storm here will be on\nThe reason that\nThat was critical spoke to someone who said you know with all the crops are ... ... ... they're not they're not going to ... well that's true that is exactly serious on I ... a lot of them really ... ... ... ... [noise]\nWell stay as safe as dry as you can touch and thank you for taking time out\nBoth thank you very much that's the ... in Panama City Florida where the brunt of this storm struck into we return now to our discussion with Dr Brian tag and it's just a professor of the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the university at Albany State University of New York\nAnd I was noticing a doctor ten or comments made by the Taj a regarding the relative a quick pace of Michael in Florence of course as we recall was guilty of loitering\nOut why is it the storms of vary in terms of the pace at which they move\nWhile you can you can think of hurricane sort of like a leaf an extreme and that if uh you know the leaf is is moving in a very slow meandering stream that that's sort of a sudden it or not moving very quickly would like for instance sort of linger over place in a given period of time whereas a leaf in a fast moving\nDream like um like Michael will move very very quickly through an area\nWould it be safe to assume that a a faster moving storm is more likely to bring with the wind damage as opposed to the water damage in comparison with the Lawrence where the wind might be less but the water damage more or or can you even make that generalization\nUm uh it's certainly if a storm is moving slower it will it will produce um a window overall uh area for a longer period of time and that has capability in fact likelihood of producing flooding rainfall\nUm but in terms of the when you can you can have a storms that are very intense much like Michael that are moving both slow and fast\nI say so in other words the the speed at which the storm moves across the surface of the ground that is to say it's it's land speed is not necessarily related to the uh the speed of its wins\nNo no it isn't\nA very good one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we watch\nMichael the remnants they're up continue to move across a Georgia having of course if the Florida Panhandle portions of Alabama as well\nAnd is still heading across the state of Georgia is our guest Dr Bryan tang uh this uh\nDepartment in which you teach atmospheric and environmental sciences\nOr that the people today I think uh they look at all these terms like uh oh we'll satellite pictures and we hear things like Doppler radar most of which of course most of his early know what that is but\nIt sounds like you folks were are totally on touch a\nWith the with what happened in the storm in other words I think we we may at one time we use to make jokes about the weatherman and how little they knew and compared with today I guess you know a whole lot today we act like you guys know everything and if you're even off by a little bit I think we get on your case for that and that it strikes me that there's a happy balance there that\nThat you know more ... than you used to but it's not like you have a complete handle on every single storm but every single moment\nRight it it's it's the nature of the beef that weather prediction will always be uncertain to ... to some degree but in in the last decade or two we we've really come up very very long way and ability to predict whether interdict extreme storms like Michael\nYou I understand you have a research that you undergo at Albany a that focuses on tropical cyclone formation intensification and interactions with the the climate system let's start with formation\nWe also need people to be very safe with generators do not put a running generator in your home it is not safe\nTo knock it out on the roads until you're told to just say we need the roads to be open for first responders and search and rescue to do their jobs and save lives is not safe to leave your house don't leave it\nIf you're in your family made it through the storm safe for the worst thing you can do now is the act foolishly and put yourself in your family in danger or keep law enforcement and rescue workers from saving lives\nOur law enforcement and first responders or heroes are leaving their families to help others we cannot thank them enough as I said earlier today and we are deploying a massive wave a response will be sending help from air land and sea\nThis includes thousands responders for power restoration medical search and rescue law enforcement food and water distribution and every other critical resource\nI was briefed by the U.S coast guard today and they are pre positions and tap and mobile was critical critical assets in resources along with there are thousands of rescue workers local law enforcement has nearly Eighteen hundred personnel ready to deploy\nSo let's all stay safe stay alert to weather updates and watched the storm closely through the night\nFlorida governor Rick Scott a news conference earlier this day after Michael made landfall Michael has been a week doing as a charges across south western Georgia\nWith the still damaging winds and rain it's dropped from my watch formidable category for storm do a bottom to your category one storm if you've ever been through one of these storms by the way\nBottom tier means a storm that is still worse than anything you've ever seen unless you've been in a tornado\nA a a bottom tear a storm like this you're talking about when the conduct rip down trees and the causes immense damage it's just not quite as powerful as the upper levels here\nA work after the storm flooding is still occurring along the Florida Gulf Coast\nAnd the throne was heading out northeast crossing into south in central Georgia all into South Carolina and North Carolina in the coming hours we were one eight six six by boat jumbo one eight six six\nFive oh five or six to six with Dr Brian ... sister professor at the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany State University of New York\nAnd that we're looking at a this storm and others of of the like\nThe uh the storms that we tend to get to in the in this country ah how do they compare with let's say the uh the uh the Thai food's that hit the uh western Asia you mentioned there are more of a border there but in terms of intensity do they tend to be stronger here or there or does it simply very\nThey do tend to be stronger or the storms that do hit the Philippines and Taiwan and China and Japan are on average uh just because they're simply more of them and and if you have more than he does have a greater chance of them had him and the land\nThere is of course that old line from a Mark Twain everybody talks about the weather but nobody does anything about it in fact are we uh since we seem to be able to understand an awful lot about these storms are we in any kind of a position to do something about\nMet is to say to to modify them to weaken them to change their direction anything of that nature\nUm I don't I don't think we we certainly don't understand sort of enough in terms of the science of how to go about doing that um I Know there have been attempts in the past to for instance uh tried to uh\nPut silver iodide in the cloud cedar and hurt hurricanes and um that that didn't really have much in the fact uh and was inconclusive I'm so I'm\nAt the atmosphere is you know a huge a big thing and there's only so much one can do to you know kind of control it or do weather modification\nThe story I've told before this happened I think about half a century ago and I'm not sure anybody was ever able to determine cause and effect but it scared I daylights out of the people\nOf hurricane that was off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd they they cloud seeding vi a bit when I think one particular side or something to see what would happen well or something did happen and what happened was the caves grader sure until August is a double damaging as I say I don't think anybody ever figured out\nIf the relatively meager amount of uh of silver iodide that a plane could put into a hurricane really did that but I think it scared people away from trying it ever again but\nBut I I don't think most people as we go to a call here I'm not sure that most people really are able to think about the uh the immense\nPower of one of these ... we look at the course of the satellite pictures of things you know as big as as several states and the like but I I'm not sure we understand we had a guy the other night call and it's just that we might drop a huge explosion in the middle of the storm and and I told him I said ignoring for the moment radiation just ignoring radiation\nIf we dropped every nuclear weapon in our arsenal every single one my guess is that it would have a minimal impact on a storm of decide they're just so huge I just like your your thoughts about that not that I'm advocating this wide you\nWrite and uh that that would not be a good idea I'm I'm hurricanes in terms of the amount of energy they produce is um you know in more than enough to power every household in every car I'm running into us at once\nI'm it's just a huge amount of energy and the day when you're talking about you know trying to alter that I'm In in any significant way it's just that we we just don't have the capability to do that\nWe can tap into it I mean we're going to suffer the damage it'd be nice if we'd get some some kind of a of benefit from it too but I guess that's not really really likely either at this time yeah\nYeah that's a that's why I think it I think that these are things you just you know if you have one that's coming out you signed up just to get out a way\nWe have a call from Donna in Huntsville, Alabama on the jumbo how to do with our guest Dr Brian ... of the University of Albany State University of New York good evening Donna\nHi ... I'm a native New Jersey and I can make a restaurant here I feel kind of like a hurricane knob and there's not much of Africa ever getting to hurricane Camille okay ... right that was the thigh yes and nothing after\nI had never been worse uh I think a lot of these other storm hit been getting a wrong intensity as comparison get Camille I mean that even had a hundred and twenty five foot wall of water come up from the Gulf or there were\nTankers ever African freighters barges on highway Ninety and up into the residents that area\nAnd they didn't have the type of coverage that we have now I mean we couldn't get on a computer or you know Facebook or cell phone or anything how I was wondering if\nYou can comment on the fact that um that's giving new reference as far as the ... of it and I really don't think any of these others come anywhere near it\nOr you're exactly right can mail is kind of in a class in its own and and live a lot of people these days don't you know remember a restaurant because I did occur such a long time ago and you're right the pictures of of the the devastation along the coast uh\nWere was absolutely tremendous um what's what's different today perhaps is that uh the one thing that has changed is that there's just so many more people\nAnd I'm buildings along the coast so uh when we do have any sort of major hurricane I'm heading inland it's just affecting generally a lot more people a lot more buildings a lot bigger portion of our economy\nI'm just I'm because I've been on a ... a very desirable thing people love to you know with a look at the ocean every day um and so that's their choice to do that you know\nYeah and there was a tremendous amount of that conversation I went through the entire thing uh-huh I went to all of it so I mean I'm a got a crash course and I'm surprised that people are surprised to oh I'm going to lose my electricity\nAnd I'm going to get some water in my house that seems a little not to realistic purity\nYeah ... or ... you're exactly right I think people who especially are new to the area I'm a tendency to underestimate their risk sometimes because they they just don't have the experience and um you know they they assumed they can for instance they can tape their windows and\nUm by some buy a bag of chips and just sit through the event and that will be yet but I'm the the there's always we always stress you know before the hurricane season begins you have a plan you prepare and emergency kit and and that's the best like this where where um you know it comes to fruition\nI Lived through the the tail end of your meal and uh it almost eight my car uh seriously it hit the war way at the side of of some land by a screen bed that became a raging torrent and uh uh literally had I if I had not gone to the the lot where this car was\nAnd moved it I buy my car I could not get into the car and the driver's side but I I moved to\nA away from the uh the edge of the water but that that waterway was and this it was littered with cars or the next day and this ... this was the weekend tale of Camille the thank goodness we were lucky portion of of meals so I didn't know what I'm Talking about looking back and we'll talk some more with our guests\nCertainly er I I think your guest brings up a a sorry your caller brings up some really good points um again it it's a very complex issue it vary state by state\nUm I I think a given that we've chosen to you know built on\nThese strips of sand or out in the ocean the barrier islands and all over time if you if you sort of look at um\nThe geology of these a barrier island state they shift they move they they break up they disappeared reappear and once you put a structure on that and you can you try to sort of keep it in place um it can change kind of landscape and and the protections are in sort of adjacent regions\nSo that that's certainly one thing that uh is is um something we have to balance with regards to development versus kind of allowing these natural barriers and he's now for protection such as wetlands and barrier islands to kind of evolve naturally\nThe start to Mindy in Naples, Florida grieving ... welcome\nThank you um I learned in high school that the earth's axis or kill thing which made me wonder whether or not hurricanes are hitting harder in certain areas like Hurricane Sandy and the northeast\nAnd harder perhaps uh in the Gulf area and Louisiana uh because of the the uh over time the earth\nAtmospheres the weather's going to change in different parts of the world because some parts of the ice caps would melt and uh see these would rise 'em\nAnd all of this as it is essentially yes climate change but also because the earth's axis is art tilting All right to the doctor jak what about that\nSo the the um the main consequence of the top of the earth is to give us our seasons um if the target if there wasn't wasn't tilted we we wouldn't have or you know summer winters and fall and spring\nSo uh the the tilt of the earth does change a very very slowly over time\nBut we're we're really talking about you know hundreds of thousands of years so um it's not something that is a a main factor in terms of trying to whether the the issue bring up about climate change is certainly a much\nUh you know bigger issue a much more complex issue and there's still a lot of debate going on about how that might affect hurricanes and the future\n[noise] All right stay on the line and we will speak unfair again our guest is Dr Bryan tagging an assistant professor of the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the university at Albany State University of New York is research focuses\nOn the tropical cyclone formation intensification\nAnd interactions with the

um has considered cropping up but now he's heard about the possibility of selling it I was just wondering if you guys know much about that and it\nIs a possibility ... how old is your father mark or

the last couple of years\nYeah okay All right so in a case like that you're right if you drop that he'd get nothing for it he has no cash in it but if you were to sell it and what's called the life settlement market\nOr it's worth seven and fifty thousand you might get three hundred thousand or some huge amount because the the people are buying the policy\nThen take over paying their premiums and when he dies they get the seven fifty the reason I asked about his age has health condition as the older you are\nAnd the sick or you are the more they're going to pay because I don't think you're

kinds of money things out there it's a major part of a of our lives even if I\nWell we can keep borrowing and long as people who happen to us and there seemed to be willing to do that were the safest place around the world\nAre people are fleeing particularly emerging markets turkey South Africa Brazil Argentina so and I put their money here so [laughter] we can keep going for quite a gyms asked me this question for what's the breaking point number I'm putting out a sturdy trillion worried about twenty two trillion right now\nAs far as student loan that we talked about that a little bit we're currently at one point five trillion\nIn student loans that are already the delinquency and default rate of about twenty percent and it's going to be going higher because people just can't handle this amount of that but it doesn't go away and bankruptcy they ought to that's the way of bankruptcy or student loan debt and I are is that someone hangs over people even if they declare bankruptcy\nOr when you are I guess I'm I'm missing something here uh when you declare bankruptcy you enter into all kinds of protection is a ... or the laws regarding as the student loan debts\nAre written in such a way that it is specifically exempted from the bankruptcy law rejection\nIn the in the back of the law change of two thousand five student loan debt was made non discharge broke in bankruptcy that was correct specifically otherwise no land or whatever then everybody would default on their student loans yeah\nI I guess yeah I ... you can't very well repossessed somebody's brain I guess [laughter] yeah up in a bar is calls in from adult in Alabama the jumbo had a job in the evening\nYeah good evening in the dark tonight and I'm sitting in my car uh\nWell I'm Glad you're a you're listening to the radio and stay tuned to the station and you get you through all that is why I Can't\nGet any communication is my phone and then my car well good luck to you sir and hand right in there\nOr I had a question uh at wondering if he had heard of the book the killing of Sam by a rod ... brown\nThe killing of ...\nThat that has to do with finance does it\nA yes or it has to do with when or how the Federal Reserve was formed the how are\nThe dominant industry and South Africa or the the Cecil Rhodes that has a Rhodes Scholarship they'll with Harvard and all that yeah uh how how he gang they gained control of the uh\nThe money system of the world\nWell I don't do that as a money system of the world actually you can get control love or\nConspiratorial but I mean the the federal service for Nineteen Thirteen after the crash of Ninety seven Ninety now wait where basically J. P. Morgan said the economy from going over the cliff and they said well that's not a good idea to have one guy save us so let's have a central bank to do it\nUm it was formed an jak on islands in Georgia and there was a whole bunch of conspiracy theories about what happened there but I think it's been good to have a Federal Reserve instead of not having one\nLater this way ... if there were no Federal Reserve wouldn't there have to be some institution that does what the fed does know\nWe went a long time without a federal is there I mean until Nineteen Thirteen\nSo then how to how how are things like interest rates in the like determined\nOr just free markets supply that wasn't the bank\nKind of ... tilting the field one way or the other I mean the treasury was there but there was no ... central bank at that time and so you had a huge surges and the economy and big plunges like an Eighteen Seventy three there was a major calamity depression basically so there was no kind of a\nService that I guess you might say on the economy and that's and it crashed in Nineteen Seventy cents in their way\nAnd the whole thing was about to go in ... Morgan literally stepped up and said I'm going to save it and that's what I said maybe we should do it another way\nDo we have any statistics on just what percentage\nOf ah of student loan debt is a never paid back\nWell default rates about twenty percent something like that so it it doesn't get paid back but it it's it hangs out there it doesn't disappear like credit card that if that's written off that pretty much disappears\nBut student loan debt and it just kind of ... the one point seven one twenty five trillion it's all the accumulated that that has not been paid off which roughly twenty percent is not being paid on right now it's either delinquent er into false what\n... what ... do you pay if in fact do you just flat say uh I don't know so sue me I mean I'm not sure what these people don't pay the\nInterest rates go up as penalties they'll garnish your paycheck\nOr they'll take your iris refund uh they they they're very aggressive collecting student and that they don't just let go of so penalties interest that just really piles up and it puts people deeper and I hear that some people all timed him I say you know I I started paying and I didn't pay enough\nAnd I eat more and more and more every year and then my education was like Twenty years ago it was just pretty pathetic philosophy\nI mean you stop and think about it you know a college education\nIs is a lot of things to do a lot of people are but uh it it from a societal point of view of the important reason for a college education is to be productive citizens that if in fact you're borrowing up let's say six figures of ... in order to learn something\nThat that they're not going to pay you money for\nAnd as I like to say on the program it makes you the are the most articulate breezed at Starbucks the society has no vested interest in paying for that I mean a financial aid should be based in large part\nOn the percentage of people that are given major who within a twelve months of graduation are actually working in that field of work and it's like\nTo stick it on that Jim this twenty seven percent of the people who graduate ended up using something it remains their major twenty seven percent meaning Seventy five percent or you know three quarters do not end up working in their major field in one way or the other\nIn which case you essentially a ... from a financial point of view you've you've wasted your time you've acquired I mean it's one thing if you have a hobby\nI'd say that uh our ... literature I always you know their way okay so I'm interested in that well that's fine but but you shouldn't be paying out this kind of enormous money to finance a hobby and as I've also noted before that's why we have so many bowling leagues in this country people like to bowl\nAnd there are just simply an awful lot more people who like to bowl the people who can make a living in the professional bowling to her back and so I mean it it just always it amazes me at all these people who want to find myself or I Want to do this or that well why don't you do that in your spare time and in the meantime get a job\nYeah well I mean luckily we have a good employment situation right now and and there's a tremendous shortage of workers except the people coming out of college in many cases are not qualified or willing frankly to do the jobs that are available\nThere's something called the jokes report which is the job openings long term survey and the latest number was six point nine million jobs are unfilled employers cannot find the people\nTo do tool and dye making are plumbing or electricity or climbing electric utility poles there may be the people coming out of college don't either have the skills or the interest in doing the jobs that are actually available in the real world\nWhich raises another point is too easy to sit on your body in this society there ought to be economic pressures on people like\nIf you're ever while student loans you are under economic pressure to do something in a lot of people take jobs that are like but they've got a service those you know that's over fifty percent of the people graduating today go back and live at home because they can't services student on that and have an apartment in the car and kind of get on with their lives\nIt's pretty pathetic I mean if you wind up doing doing a job

in knowledgeable about the history of the country\nWell it would certainly seem to show up quite to the contrary just to ... mentioned some of the reports that came out of this\nAnd or what you are comment on on each one of the uh Seventy two percent of respondents in this Woodrow Wilson national fellowship foundation surveys Seventy two percent almost three quarters\nIncorrectly identified or unsure of what states were part of the Thirteen original states\nAre back in my day when I went to school the the days of your the Jurassic Era of education that was kind of drilled into us now I don't know that in fact I have a more responsible adult or or a citizen of the country\nOr by having that information drilled into my head but at the time it struck me that it was at least they base that say foundation for understanding what role about\n[noise] I agree with you and I should explain where the question came from which is to\nThat we are a random sample representative of the country\nI was in the American citizenship test which means that in order to become a citizen of the United states of the twenty questions we asked people need to pass at least twelve so they needed ... to stick to the parents that exam\nWe gave the same exam based on the simple question provided by the federal government and at the same passage rate and in general sixty four percent of all Americans failed that test in contrast the citizenship test as a passage rate of ... percent\nWow so at least we're we're teaching the people who who\nAre coming here to become citizens of the rest of us are not so much of this one here only twenty four percent of those in this survey could correctly identify one thing yeah Benjamin Franklin was famous for\nWith thirty seven percent believing he invented the light bulb seriously\n[laughter] ... faith in a Benjamin Franklin ... four choices on each of these questions he's\nWill now these were these were multiple choice questions so so random I guess it would give you a little bit about bleeds proceed\nHere we had twenty five yeah you're exactly right it is um made me very sad that the that thirty seven percent of Americans thought that Benjamin Franklin identical light bulb and that they were off by centuries\nYes now a twenty four percent of get only twenty four percent and this was a little more instructive about what this country is about only twenty four percent knew the correct answer as to why the call on the spot the British\n[noise] Mm [noise] and then when you add up all of these questions and all these answers\nWe have enough surveys every year they show Americans aren't doing well in math or there and doing well in English or they aren't doing well in\nSome other subject area where it's really important about this one is\nWe're going into an election in a month and we have some very very large issues facing\nSome more than being an embarrassment that people don't know these things more than pointing were bashing any source we really need to do is change profoundly understand the history history isn't just been the subject matter\nIt's one of those areas one of those and very few areas that we shared commonality and their time which are divide seem enormous\nAnd periods of dramatic change like the president\nHistory is an anchor it's a vehicle for seeing what happened in the past\nAnd looking at it as a laboratory to understand what could happen going into tomorrow because so many of those issues some of these issues we face well in a new guys party really knew we face problems like them in the past\nIt's also a way of building optimism in confidence we got through them once before they can probably get through them now\nOne would would certainly hope that that would be the case or some other results of this survey only Thirteen percent knew when the U.S constitution was ratified even on this multiple choice exam\nOr most incorrect you thinking it occurred in Seventeen Seventy six which of course was the date that we declared independence or the year that which we did [noise]\nSixty percent of respondents didn't know which countries the United states fought in World War two\nAnd a despite the recent media spotlight on the Supreme Court fifty seven percent of those surveyed did not know how many justices actually served\nOn the nation's highest court for those who fall into these various categories by the way a World War two we fought Germany Japan in Italy for the most part with a few other minor countries thrown in\nAnd there are nine justices on the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm Glad you didn't even ask how that is determined because of course there would be those who say well it's in the constitution when of course it is a is not a particular interest to me\nWas the poll found that those sixty five years of age and older scored the best Seventy four percent got at least six ten questions correctly those under forty five only Nineteen percent pass the exam\nAnd eighty one present scored fifty nine or lower that it's safe failing at that I think pretty much says it all there apparently was eight point at which citizenship and related courses were simply dropped from our country is a curriculum presumably a secondary curricula your cupboards\nWe don't know I assume that what you just described is correct we do know true fact it is a startling result we're going to read the survey emirate end up doing the fifty states survey a beginning after Thanksgiving\nAnd we're hoping to get more in terms of why the older population did so
