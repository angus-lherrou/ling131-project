I. A. so obviously\nAnd I was ... to each other but I don't know if you want to say they're never had one of the store though the sixty votes threshold to end debate which would force more consensus nominees no not for nominations because we never had that we have\nAnother example on federal district judges in history the United States Senate no federal district judge has ever been denied his or her seat by sixty votes requirement they've all been majority vote I don't I Know because with Mitch McConnell wanted to do that once and I stopped him by getting another enough Republicans to do it\nDo you think the what's the unintended consequences of the judiciary that is Fifteen that is made up of judges that were confirmed fifty one forty nine depending on which\nAre well if you consider the United states of America is a success then that's the right way to do it because ever since we've had the United States Senate with Thomas Jefferson judges have been approved by fifty one votes remember Clarence Thomas was fifty to two forty eight you could have required sixty votes but no one ever did\nSenator Alexander middle leave it there ... thinking and deceived joining me now from Wilmington for perspective from the other side is democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware senator Coontz welcome back to me it's presser\nThank you good to be on with you again [noise] um this morning Brett Kavanaugh as associate justice of the Supreme Court Democrats made a lot of arguments against him to try to stop them it was an election year the committee process was flawed his record was outside the mainstream he lied under oath credible allegations sexual misconduct\nThe Democrats lose all of those arguments\nThat well frankly I felt like this process was unfair from the very outset of the way that we were prevented from seeing literally millions of pages of judge Kavanaugh's record from his service in the Bush administration\nI'm to the way that the process went forward in the confirmation hearing\n'em to some of how the last week unfolded and frankly the challenge I'm focused on shock is looking forward at how it is we can heal the Senate after this bitter and divisive and very partisan weak and how we work to restore or strengthen some of the legitimacy of the Supreme Court\nAh now that we have a seat injustice who was confirmed by just fifty votes um without allegations against him having really been cleared\nWhere you ... it seems as if you were almost working as a go between uh to the undecided members um particularly obviously with Jeff Flake or were you trying to convince them to vote no\nLook going into this I knew that Jeff as a conservative or he wants to conservative Supreme Court ah and I knew that would likely be the outcome um but\nI think there are good reasons to have doubts about ah now justice Kavanaugh's candor to the committee and fitness to serve given his very partisan screen or in that last hearing or in front of the Judiciary Committee last friday\nUm so I wasn't trying to persuade Senator Flake or others are not to vote their conscience not to reflect their states and their values in advancing a conservative judge\nI was trying to help them focus on what legitimate questions there were about this particular conservative judge\nLet me get your response to something senator Collins said in her floor speech announcing her yes vote here it is\nI have been my arms and just served however ... jets and that in last judge Kavanaugh's nomination it's rejected the Senate is some how can ... saw\nNothing could be further from the true\nDo you agree with her or do you think a different message we're saying\nLook I respect senator Collins she's a great colleague uh we see this a little differently um I think the FBI investigation that Senator Flake and I worked hard together to make sure happened this past week did not go far enough I'm In only interviewing according to press reports uh ten witnesses who came forward and not\nA interviewing a dozens of corroborating witnesses who tried to get in touch with the FBI who Dr Ford offered to the FBI I I don't think this investigation went far enough\nAnd I don't think that the members of the committee and the Senate who had to make a final decision yesterday had all the facts in front of them in that regard I don't think we did enough\nBut ... I Do think one of the big things that came out of this hearing was that ... of survivors of assault who had kept to themselves for years or decades\nVery painful experiences didn't come forward and there are things we can and should do on a bipartisan basis to respect and hear an act on the oceans of pain that exist in our country from long buried a tragic experiences of assault to try and change our culture and try and change our country\nYou believe that the you're in that the initial presumption in a in a situation like this has to believe the victim at all times\nI think it's important that we change our country's culture to one where we believe\nOf victims of sexual assault to come forward and that wasn't the case for most of my life uh most\nVictims of sexual assault didn't come forward because they thought they would be ashamed or or ridiculed uh and ultimately just believed\nI think one of the biggest uh tragedies of this past week was to watch the president of the United states a publicly mocking and ridiculing Dr Ford his initial response which was to say that her testimony was credible and compelling\nUm was where he should have stopped but to instead turned it into a campaign rally event or he was mocking her I think really um brought this entire conversation down and really was a low mark in his presidency\nBut she went a little bit further than what others it said you know there are many backing now justice Kavanaugh said he ought to be treated as if these innocent until proven guilty and you disagreed you said no the burden is on him to disapprove these allegations\nIt's against them there are a lot of people that here that go whoa wait a minute right so I'm guilty until they say that right\nLet me speak to that Chuck if I can ... this is a confirmation hearing no one is entitled to his seat on the Supreme Court it's not a criminal trial it's more like a job or hearing it's more like a job interview\nThe president has a whole series of credentialed unqualified conservative judges I'm from uh from among whom he could choose\nTo put someone forward to the to the Senate or the United states\nFor confirmation so if there are credible allegations\nAgainst this particular nominee and if this particular nominee and his confirmation process conducts himself in ways that they are real questions about candor partisanship fitness then I think it's appropriate for the committee or the Senate to say perhaps a different nominees the right one\nIf you're considering someone to be say president university CEO of a company\nI'm the host of a Sunday show and there are credible allegations against them it would make sense to step back and try and investigate them to see if you can resolve them that's why I was thankful that my friends Senator Flake took a tough step last friday and asked for an FBI investigation\nLet me get you to respond to something Senator Kennedy said to me earlier this week about when he believe things changed in this whole Kavanaugh debate tickle us\nI think this process changed dramatically [noise]\nUh when Mr ... entering the picture\nI think a lot of people including many of my democratic colleagues felt like that at that point we had gotten into the foothills of preposterous\nHe was referring to a lawyer Michael ... who is a thinking about running for president who ended up representing somebody who's allegations\nI have not been seen as credible as the other two allegations do you agree with the political assessment there that that the ... entrance into their side show sort of a diluted everything\nI'd certainly like a Senator Kennedy said turns of phrase the foothills of the preposterous it's going to end up being a memorable phrase I I Do think that um he's correct that there was a widespread a response or certainly on the Republican side that these were not credible allegations\nUm I tried to focus my questioning of judge Kavanaugh on issues that were directly related uh first to his judicial philosophy his extreme views on presidential power and individual liberty and ways in which I'm convinced till overturned Justice Kennedy's most important recent decisions\nAre and then to focus on issues of fitness and candor um so I Do think what was important about the last few weeks was trying to find a bipartisan focus on facts and the larger question Chuck here is you know how do we move forward how do we heal the divisions in the Senate\nSo I take it if you're talking that way or the house Democrats are talking about re investigating cabin off they get control of the house possibly looking at impeachment uh what do you make of those pledges coming from some House Democrats\nI I think that's premature I think you know frankly we are just less than a month away from an election of folks who feel very strongly a one way or the other about the issues in front of us should get out and vote and participate um there's only ever been one justice that's been impeached and I think talking about it at this point\nI'm isn't necessarily healing us and moving forward a check the Senate's role in our in our politics is not to just reflect the country but to help heal and leave the country and that's the course we should be on All right senator Coontz Democrat from Delaware thanks to come out sharing your views as\nWell protected jak when we come back is there\nThis was the highest levels of our institution doing exactly what they have been fighting against which they came forward they told their stories in the institutions that to then you don't matter\nListen dysfunction hash pet had gone before Donald Trump got to the White House and Congress but it's reached new levels the appeal to people slower instincts now by both basis of\nCost things like violence industry demonstration on both sides like that go beyond the pale a you know as a recent book that came out about America from Eighteenth thirty two Eighteen sixties feel the blood and how that\nLed to the civil war in America I'm not sure we're not leading to a cold civil war and I'm not too sure during the Trump era that thinks well good worst so we uh we assassination need to figure this out\nI'm here to promote his book I just have a book just showed up yesterday at my house I ordered that book I don't want to read it and\nI think the problem here is the case I I I understand that there was a lot of unhappiness\nAbout the vote but the notion that one person or one spokesman speak for all women or that all women or appalled by her\nI can tell you I was appalled by this because the notion that somebody can bring down somebody's career on their word alone is the kind of license in our society\nThat I think is hugely dangerous from others who have young sons they can look at them going to school and anybody can bring them down what kind of a precedent are we sending what kind of agency or we denying women\nWhat kind what kind of action we taking against people who are survivors of sexual assault and who have been hurt by this\nBecause someone who wasn't really credible stood up and didn't have the corroborating evidence from the people she suggested she had it from\nI think that that perception from some of these women at that to Christians made this point about the job interview but you know for many women they are the essay grow up there they are sent the message that you better do it cleaner and better than that guy because if you're the one who screwed up you're going to pay the price and I think there was a sense that judge Kavanaugh never and his wife had that kind of constantly\nAll right I'm going to posit air we're actually going to get ... and other side of the

front page story about movie producer Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual assaults shortly followed by Ronan Farrow is peace in the New Yorker\nOne of the people reading about one state was the actor Alyssa mulatto she said on this week and then went to sleep\nIf you've been sexually harassed or assaulted right me too as a reply to the sweet\nWell she woke up to tens of thousands of responses and the realization she had kick started the quote me too movement\nAnd I did actually it was founded in two thousand six by the activists Toronto Burke well both mulatto and ... were at the Kavanaugh

Burke welcome to both of you thanks for coming up\nThank you so much for having us\nI'm trying to work let me start with you and you heard me play earlier the quote from Christine Blasey Ford where she talked about her fear of coming out and simply stepping in front of a train that was already headed to its destination um what are the repercussions of that\nWell I mean the repercussions are will be will remain to be seen but I think her stepping out was something that we needed to have happened in this movement it's been largely focused on Hollywood and on individual bad actors\nAnd I think her coming forward really set the stage for survivors to have a different role in this movement than we've seen over the last year a\nUs from a lot of the journalist Sally Quinn wrote in her memoir last year about an attempted rape\nBy a now deceased Senator John tower when she was a college student in the sixties when John Tower was nominated to be the defense secretary in in Nineteen eighty nine she was asked about it and she declined to talk about it with the FBI well a reporter for the New Yorker Susan Glasser asked her about it and let me play\nA let me show you what I'm Susan Glasser wrote she said I called Sally Quinn the night before Christine Blasey Ford's testimony to ask what she thought about our own experience all these years later\nAnd she goes I could have been Anita Hill she pointed out but I didn't want to I didn't want to ruin my life\nNothing has changed since Anita Hill not a damn thing she writes\nI think a lot has changed but I also think a lot hasn't changed and yesterday we we may have lost a political battle but I Do think we are winning the cultural battle and often I don't fight for the when I'm fighting so that generations\nI don't have to deal with the abuses of power that that we've had to deal with so in a in a respect I think she is right but then I Do think that there's a lot going on and I think this this this cultural shift that we're feeling this collective pain that we're feeling from survivors\nComing forward it's going to be able to be translated into a collective power or to say that we're not going to be silenced any longer\nTrying to work you know Susan Collins said that she was really angry at the leaker about this story that it put it forced Dr Ford into the public square and maybe she wasn't ready or maybe it

wouldn't say she didn't handle it right she followed the leadership on the survivor people shouldn't have to be forced out of ... to tell their story and so she acts for privacy I understand why\nAffects policies in politics here at home he's ABC world news this week Sunday evenings in nano six in the voice of turtles five eighty WC age yeah\n[noise]\nBack now and then gain in the real obsession in Washington is what kind of impact as capital cap on the mid term Senate is where would we might see it I've for Senate races that I Want to show you examples of before Kavanaugh and I asked her first Missouri before the cabin all allegations in hearings the race was tied\nThe races time let's look at Montana\nBefore desperate with about a two point lead their most recent poll since that's where the four point lead to no real change their but let me go to some darker red states Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen had a five point lead before the Kavanaugh hearings and now look the most recent poll asked Marsha Blackburn the Republican up by the big swing there and then of course North Dakota before the cabinet hearings began she was down for a margin of error race after it is now double digits ballpoint race Al Cardenas\nIs this how your party see that that that at whatever you think of it this is fired at the base\nWell out here so we see it we see it as having secure ... majority in November Eighteen for older research you've stated do you think it's done much Democrats aren't going to win the Senate\nVery much done I mean they're going to be a couple of seats that are going to go well where the other but the Democrats and eats five to seven remaining\nCompetitive seats and I just don't see it happening in the house\nYou know they're twenty three seats that Republicans hole that Hillary Clinton won I think that'll help Democrats and I you know I stood over toss up I think the majority is likely to be Democrat now sort of leading Democrat and in spite of the things that you've stated regarding you know Pennsylvania we ask very fascinating\nCase is that the new on the hill that basically yeah this is helping Republicans in the Senate and it's only making it easier for the Democrats and al\nYeah that's the emerging conventional wisdom I think particularly in a place like Tennessee I'm Talking to both senators actually from Tennessee about this that briefly and you know I think there's a sense that it really helped\nA Marsha Blackburn there um but I Do think that one thing for Democrats to to take away from this as well Mitch McConnell called the protesters a mob and he said that the mom was able to do what I couldn't do it myself\nWhich is get Republicans energized and invested so what was a clear win for Democrats on enthusiasts on it now I definitely something of a toss up but\nI Do think on that in the house you can be looking at instead of a twenty three twenty four twenty five the majority for Democrats you could be looking at much higher numbers which I think actually could have pretty significant application\nDanny we were talking about something else earlier in the in the break and I actually want to bring it here and it's how\nThe president has transformed that Justice Party its entire town everybody now conducts politics in his image fight fight fight than I did I did I just take it to your opponent whatever it takes\nI mean at the I don't think that there's a word but the ... of of of something that was pretty vulgar to start with American American politics it's ... it's really unbelievable because Donald Trump has not\nBeen isolated by his style or his manner or his antipathy towards so much of of the political landscape rather he has just he's he's taken them along with him\nThe irony here is just to come back to the midterms for quite a sort of thing the irony is I think that people even almost two years into Donald Trump's presidency don't understand what helps Donald Trump [laughter] it is to have enough stuff to help him too it helps and\nHe was the big the big winner here All right Michael I Want to transition to your book because as you pointed out you said how do we transition of what you said hey presidents got to do two things appoint Supreme Court justices to decide whether we go to war your book presidents of war\nAnd as a historian when you get a front page scoop in the New York times that's pretty darn good it sounds like you did some interesting little historical ah digging a this is about nuclear a nuclear response general Westmoreland as if to add to his legacy apparently wanted to bring nukes the Vietnam War what happened\nAnd LBJ who obviously made so many terrible mistakes in Vietnam here in this case there's this hidden story where he tells ... no I don't want nuclear weapons in South Vietnam that could quickly they could quickly they use you know this could be the end of the world get them outta here\nAnd it was all secret until decades later in the last documents came out just the last couple of years what\nShould the president brought you in to brief him on his book in and say why should I read your book what can I learn from it what could he learned from it what you hope President Trump and learn from your book\nA number one you'll get the experience the saga of two hundred years of what it's like to be a war president you know the marriages of things president you know these emotional breakdown where they live more important I think what I Would like to say to win is\nRemember no president should start a war for political reasons in President Trump's case he would send out tweets in two thousand eleven warning Americans watch out President Obama is going to start a war to win the next election not a great idea for a president to connect those two\nAlright Michael's book presidents of war congrats before we go I Want to remind everyone that today we're excited that we're taking off the second annual

guaranteed safety\nAnd total and continued liquidity it just doesn't work that way\nSo you have to dial things in and and as you point out mark generally speaking the best you can get is two out of the three so for example I might be able to get growth and liquidity by investing in a stock or an ATF\nBecause it's oriented towards the growth\nAnd its liquid in the sense that I can sell it very quickly but if I'm looking for guarantees\nNow I'm going to probably be looking more at say like a bank CD or something like that and in that instance I'm getting some safety I'm getting a little bit

once again with Mike Walters here's ... with [noise]\nWelcome back to the program we have been discussing the three corners of the investment triangle those street corners our growth\nSafety and liquidity and you might think that liquidity is always a good thing in for the most part there's a lot of benefits\nTo having liquidity inside of an investment portfolio or complete liquidity inside of investment portfolio there are probably not to better examples than the ones that will share with you here now loop pi if you don't know that name he was a\nFormer Enron executive and\nShortly before that company collapsed he liquidated somewhere in the neighborhood it's been reported of about two hundred and Seventy million dollars\nIn Enron stock now at the time part of it was to settle some financial affairs at least this is the reports of a a divorce he was going through with his wife had married an exotic dancer\nButton enormous piece of property in Colorado so that and who knows where the heck he's at now but the timing Mike of him being able to liquidate that investment was pretty fortunate the second example was that of\nApple's CEO I you know the name Gil Emilio years ago apple was struggling and their stock slumped in hit a twelve year low in Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd it's been suggested that that slumped in that stock busting down to that twelve year low was at least partially caused by a single sale of one and a half million shares of Apple's stock buying anonymous party\nIt was later confirmed that that sale was Steve Jobs if you know that name on the founders of apple\nAnd shortly after that job to convince the directors to oust Emilio in a boardroom coup and he became CEO again so he was pretty fortunate timing wise to get out when he did and so it's interesting Mike though when we look at liquidity\nBecause we talk about this in our world all the time the importance of having liquidity the importance of having access to your money this can also work against you\nYeah in that environment obviously the stock in such large chunks in those two examples\nWas liquid for those individuals it actually ends up driving the value down for everyone else's the flood the market with those shares of stock and also one could argue that depending upon what your role is\nMaybe you shouldn't necessarily have entirely free liquidity when it comes to\nShares of stock or that you are a key key role player within those companies so that that's a whole 'nother discussion that is well beyond the typical boundaries of\nFinancial and retirement planning for most Americans but it is important to realize that that liquidity\nCan come in very different structures\nSo liquidity can come in the form of a individual stock as you were just suggesting there mark but liquidity can equally come in the form of a money market or a checking account\nAnd yet in terms of what they represent throughout the remainder of the triangle the investment try and build that is they're very dramatically different investment vehicles one is geared\nTowards growth that of the individual stock and one is geared towards safety the checking account or the money market account and yet both of them\n[noise]\nLearn how to make your home safer and family fire dot org [noise] brought to you by the ad council an M family fire\nService financial planning in one place this is the usa financial radio show\nOnce again with Mike Walters Here's Mark Martin Smith [noise]\nWelcome back to the program if you invest in the stock market [noise] if you invest in ... if you invest\nPeriod my hunch I'm going to make a very ... said\nI Will make a statement that the majority of you that invest probably invested in a way that is not can grew in with how you feel about risk and the reason why I say that\nIs it's not your fault that our financial it's the financial industries fault and Mike when we talk with clients about this and then we share with them how we\nApproach their own risk awareness let's talk a little bit about the difference that we take versus what the industry has always taken\nAnd I want to first started out by talking about the fault\nThat is risk tolerance questionnaires because everybody's been through it\nIf you invest in a four one K. if you work with a financial advisor I guess it doesn't really matter you've probably gone through this process of a risk tolerance questionnaire and you've answered a handful of questions let's talk about the problem with this because this is really important as it relates to\nThe investment triangle corner that is the growth\nCorner remark to a certain degree you've you've already kind of uncovered the big looming issue kind of the elephant in the room that no one ever wants to talk about if you will and that is the idea of risk tolerance the idea of risk tolerance the way the financial industry has approached it\nFrom our opinion it is a flawed approach the concept of risk tolerance\nTakes basic information and then shoe horns someone into a slot on a sheet of paper and a computer program to identify what level of risk\nThey should be able to tolerate but the premise at its core we believe has many flaws for example if if you had to individuals that both went to work in the same company let's say Thirty years ago\nAt the age of twenty five they entered into the four o one K plan and now Thirty years later at the age of fifty five they're rolling over an IRA opening up a new investment whatever the case might be\nOver those Thirty years those two individuals have both been in that four one K. plant at their company for the exact same amount of time\nIt just so happens that one of the individuals is the CFO of the company who's very numerically oriented and the other individual was a a a manager let's say in the age our department\nThe manager and the HR department maybe once every year or two would take a look at where they were investing money in their four one K. and just make sure that we're putting in the amount of money they hoped and they just kind of hung on and hope things went the way they\nThey wanted them to go inside of that four one K.\nOn the other hand the CFO had a much more active involvement with choosing where they wanted to be invested which funds they wanted to use in the four one K. over those years and so on and now here they are at the age of fifty five and they're opening up a new investment account and they have a risk tolerance questionnaire flopped in front of them and asked them\nHow many years of investment experience do you have at this stage of the game they're both now answering Thirty years but do they have the same Thirty years\nOf investment experiences the real issue and so there is a distinct difference between risk tolerance approaches which are very cold and systematic for lack of a better way of explaining it\nVersus what I Will call risk awareness and risk awareness gets more into your psyche and your character about how you feel and how you are motivated about money how what kind of fears you have about loss\nHow you approach money and all that gets wrapped around money in terms of the potentials for gains and losses and how you can stomach battered you can't stomach that and really it comes down to\nRisk tolerance questionnaires are stacked against you I mean the truth of the matter is is like you pointed out with that example in that particular question\nIt's going to score those two individuals exactly the same way it's going to assign you know a certain waiting to that the answer to that question even though they're going to give theoretically the same answer we know\nAt that question is is a bunch of garbage and it doesn't really factory in to how much\nRisk can they truly stomach what is their real understanding and tolerance for risk and so let's talk a little bit about the approach that we use here at usa financial and all of the usa financial radio advisors use when they're working with\nClients to identify what is the right amount of risk because let's face it when when we're looking at the corner of the investment triangle that his growth\nYou have to recognize that growth and risk\nAre going to be tied together now there might be some ways to reduce some of the risk while still enjoying that growth but at the same time you have to understand that those two pieces of the puzzle are going to walk\nHand in hand together so when we look at risk when we look at identifying what is the right amount of risk\nFor our clients here at usa financial we use this this notion of risk awareness but specifically we identify your personal risk number now for a moment I'm going to I'm going to step out of the world of investments to sharing example because I think this is going to help you understand\nWhen I got married to my wife [noise]\nIt was time for us to purchase a new mattress and we went to the mattress store and if you've ever gone through this exercise it's almost comical to go through where\nThere's all these mattresses laid out on the on the showroom floor and you started hopping on them and whether or not you can really identify what's the right field for you but\nIt became very apparent that I like more of a firm mattress and my wife was more interested in a squishy mattress is what I Will say right I Believe the term is saw as unless you're being derogatory ... so we go through this exercise in and after we done that\nThe salesman says well you know there is an option that you could consider and there's this other manufacturer and they have come up with something known as a sweet number bed\nAnd the concept is that we each have our number of firmness that that mattress will have in the ... number bed fortunately\nCan allow one side to have one level of firmness and the other to not have that level of firmness now\nWe didn't end up purchasing that because I ended up convincing my wife that a firmer mattress was better for her and so we I Want out but in the end the concept of the sleep number is very akin to our concept of\nThe risk number let's let's talk about our personal risk number and how we go about determining what that is Well Mark\nWhy I really liked the example you just went through although I think you took full advantage of your way way shape or form it sounds like but I'm gonna I'm gonna let that pass for now the reason I really like the example you just gave is because a fifty year old might have the same sleeping number as a twenty five year old\nBut then might have an entirely different sleep number from another fifty year old\nAnd that's why it's so important because when you're looking at risk awareness interests number of the same thing happens I'm fifty today but I have\nA risk number that is very similar to individuals who I Know that are Thirty years old\nAnd the thirty year olds are shared interests number with a fifty year old but then other thirty year olds are sharing interests number that's\nMore likely to be with someone who is maybe a little younger that has a little more of an appetite for risk the reality is some people have an appetite for risk regardless of their age\nOther people have no appetite for risk regardless of their age and then there's this huge spectrum in between and everybody falls somewhere on this dynamic and that's how we come up with the risks number is by going through and approach to figure out where do you actually fall\nOn the spectrum so that's the only one half of the puzzle here though Mike when you think about once you've identified your personal risk number we now have to take that one step further\nAnd we have to look at your portfolio and identify what is your portfolios risk number is it in sync with the ... are they in sync is their balance between the two because if they aren't was ultimately going to happen at some point in the future whether it's going to be tomorrow or five years from now\nThat portfolio is going to react in a way that you will not be comfortable with according to your wrist number in the portfolios wrist number and as a result you will react in a manner that might be unfavorable to the long term\nSuccess in the long term result that you want to have with your portfolio so what we are offering to you today and what we do for our clients is we identify for them\nTheir personal risk number we walk them through this really deep detailed analysis to arrive at that risk number and then from there we calculate what their portfolio is to determine are you in balance are they synchronize if you want this if you want to take advantage of this opportunity\nVery real and so that's why a lot of people then look at annuities as an option to look at an annuity as an option for safety but you have to understand\nYou know maybe you're going to obtain a little bit more growth from a particular type of annuity but there is that trade off your giving something up and more often than not when you do that you're going to give up some of that full liquidity if you go the annuity\nDirection yeah so obviously an annuity doesn't have near the liquidity\nThat say a checking account or a savings account does but it has the same kind of safety in many ways that those accounts do so it shares safety but it's looking in a different direction and the triangle either towards growth or towards liquidity and the real challenge now mark is\nThat with interest rates having been so low for so long many people feel that the obvious direction that interest rates are going to be taking for a\nPeriod of time into the future is more of an upward inclined rather than a downward\nDecline and so by having interest rates are rising interest rate environment now it makes that even more difficult to tie up money seeing a bond or a bank CD\nBecause a rising interest rates don't work very well for bonds or the underlying value the bond gets eroded as interest rates rise\nBut also in a bank CD if I think interest rates are going to go up\nNow it's even harder for me to lock up my money for five years in a low bank CD rate when I think a year from now that the rates might even be higher so it's very much a balancing act in today's environment has its unique set of problems compared to previous years\nPart of our role here usa financial radios to challenge\nHow you think about money to challenge the conventional wisdom that you might be adhering to we want to share with you ideas on how to think about your money a little bit differently and when I say the letters are all lie to you\nMy hunch is that most of you your mind immediately things well our ally means\nReturn on investment and typically I mean and business terms when you when you hear that that acronym Mara why that is true I mean typically speaking are wise than for return on investment\nBut as you approach retirement as you get nearer to retirement and especially when you're in retirement how you define that acronym how you define our uh why\nNeeds to change our ought to change because it's no longer when you're thinking about the investment triangle and you're thinking about your portfolio are why should no longer stand just for return on investment\nIt needs to stand for reliability of income and this is something that we try to impress upon our clients as they're approaching retirement and and in retirement is that our uh why needs to change in how you define it it needs to change and it really all starts with\nKnowing

little over ten years later was only in debt in two thousand six and it was twenty ten before anyone it even heard of Instagram the social media platforms are second home to many of us now but unfortunately you know somebody has also become a powerful weapon\nCw singer and Emerson working I've written a new book called like war the weaponization of social media ... W singer an expert in innovation defense\nIn technology going to snap this book is is really filled with so many examples of how social media has been used in manipulated by various characters everything from ISIS to China to\nYou know those who invented click bait artificial intelligence\nI'm a social media has changed politics and the news it's changed our world are any one of these things any more troubling than the others do you think\nI think the challenge of this is that it's a network that links us all and um I probably the biggest problem that the one danger that cuts across all these issues whether you're looking at extremism click bait terrorism\nIs it's when things go bad it's a combination of arrogance and ignorance arrogance that this sanction that things can't go beyond that oh I'm you know if you remember the Facebook or the more we connect the better it gets well now we know that is what\nThe more we connected gets better and some parts of it get worse but also ignorance we are all now\nOnline we depend on the space for everything from our social lives are dating lives business\nNews and now war and yet we don't understand the very basic rules of the gang and when I say we I mean everything from or you could see this and the senators hearings was ... to ah over sixty percent of Americans don't understand how social media companies even make money so they don't understand how they're being targeted by this base\nSo the books trying to do with basically give people the tools a to better navigate this world of likes and wise\nOne of the things that they don't understand because it is so difficult to understand is the dissemination of fake news and it really was fake when it was disseminated but now the phrase fake news has been hijacked as well so how are people supposed to know what they believe on line\nOne of the challenges is um even the term had become contested\nOr even the very nature of a truth itself if you remember the phrase you know no alternative facts well that's not how that works um and this is where you see a layering between certain things that have played out in politics but also a\nRussian disinformation tactics that literally go back to the Nineteen twenties so you know there's a reason why the Russians are kicking are bought and the space because they'd been added for so much longer\nAnd it's again it's part of that notion of catching up but for you and I I'm One of the most simple things to do is basically to diversify your news sources uh goes back to the idea of um the ten blind men or an elephant\nYou know each one touching that elephant only get part of the story I mean getting part of the story that come away with something that's false\nThis is a law that says a snake as opposed to getting on multiple angles multiple perspectives with Cuba all this is not just us but it's also for example a teaching our kids how to be better digital citizens because they're equally being targeted in that space\nAnd that's one of the things that social media did it really drew like minded people together into into groups and people have talks a lot about tribalism that's going on in politics today\nBut really it was happening on line long before the contentiousness that we've seen in Washington I mean people will read what they want to read on line and even though they were told not to and that they should read other sources\nIt doesn't seem to be getting through to anybody\nAnd this is the good and the bad side of this and that you know one of the fun stories in the book because of the very first social network all the way back when the Internet was\nA originally created by the military to link scientist together and they're supposed to be doing scientific research\nThe very first social use of bringing like minded people together as they started talking to each other not just about science but science fiction and you know that's the great thing of social media moving forward as we can find other like minded people we can find people who share our interest we can exchange information with them but the danger of that\nIs that you know first it can create these little closed off community sometimes and second that can be exploited and\nThat same thing has been used in everything from terrorism extremism too I'm kind of the poisonous aspects that if I played out in our politics today a different way to think about this is a parallel I'm to the game of poker or if you sit down at a poker table this isn't you know from the movie around her ... and you don't know who the mark is\nYour the mark and that's what it is for many of us in social media we don't understand that where the ...\nPark when it comes to everything from marketing campaigns but also political campaigns and we need to catch up our understanding catch up our knowledge of the rules of the game so there were no longer being taken advantage of\nWe have a thing in the in the newsroom is that everybody has their their tweet back up and when they see that the president of the United states has treated for the first time in the morning they'll say he's on Twitter\nAnd then that person has to stand up and and read the tweet there's just this President Trump understand this really really well or is he just doing it and is he making it the divisions even wider\nThe opening of the book is Trump's very first tweet and\nHe joins social media back in two thousand and nine and when not with politics and mine is funded to go back in time he actually joins as a way to market an upcoming TV appearance that he's going to read the top ten list on the Letterman show and the purpose of going on the Letterman show is to try and plug\nThe declining ratings of uh The Apprentice crunches is going down and ratings and they're trying to figure out anything and everything to save the ratings\nAnd they turned to Twitter [laughter] and um and this actually like

like a shouting teenager and yet it drew what he wanted which was attention\nAnd then the new rule the game is attention is power and important again going back to this notion even if we do like your story illustrates another key fact here\nNinety six percent of journalists are on Twitter so even if you're not on it the journalists that you listen to on the radio or you read in the newspaper walks on the TV news\nThey're getting their ideas of what to cover based off of not just what they see online but by what is trending on line and one of the things again the Trump understood back then and carried forward through the election and even today is that he can use that attention that power\nTo change the news cycle so whenever there is a scandal that's going badly for him and and one space will create a different kind of scandal a different kind of argument another and then the press will follow and you know frankly that's continued all the way to what's playing out right now\nOkay well
