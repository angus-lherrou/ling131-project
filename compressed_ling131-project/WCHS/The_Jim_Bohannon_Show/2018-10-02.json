I'm astounded that that that we would do this ... surely ... ... ... we have a ... what you've done this a night given the number of deals you just mentioned I assume this covers democratic and Republican administrations why would you do that\nI think the idea was that a particular with master back in the in the nineties look the U.S economy is so big\nUm we like to create a free trade zone in North America but look or so big we really should help Mexico and Canada or develop their economies so even if we give them a break\nThat will help them grow and develop and we ... we should have an obligation I guess I had to help uh some of our trading partners\nNo bless ablaze are you kidding me that's not a I mean I I guess that would be nice for all of those are those uh those voters who elected us presidents from a auto was Saskatchewan and a Chihuahua but of course there are no voters they're these these were or deals worked out by administrations elected by Americans we have no\nObligation of legal certainly I'm as far as I'm concerned no moral obligation to build up their economies I mean this isn't the all the days of the Marshall Plan for Pete's sake\nThat's exactly right and ... you know and President Trump when he was running for office he says look ... everybody we're all concerned with globalism and trying to help everybody else and it's time we put America's interests first\nAnd then uh other countries of interest steals um are are just so bad that we have hundreds of billions of dollars\nFlowing out of our country every year\nBecause we allow these the deals to to have to look at the European Union same thing with cars they have a two and a half percent Tyra for cars made in Germany or France we charge a two and a half percent ... we make a car salad in Europe they charge at ten percent tariff\nSo we buy a lot of their cars money flows out of the country they buy very few of our cars very little of their money flows into the country we ended up with this huge negative balance of trade\nAnd what do you wonder how that happens [laughter] and by the way just for the record just for the record now you're talking about Europe the European Union I suppose from the moment of its formation until this very day has always had a bigger economy than the United states ...\nYeah in in total if they add up all twenty three yeah glimmers of the of the European Union yeah yeah\nSo um the idea what was it was all look at with with Canada so the the us dairy farmers\nAre extremely efficient at producing dairy products we can make a product sell it in Canada for a dollar\nThat Canadian dairy farmers cost them three dollars and fifty cents to make\nThe same product so the Canadian government said look we want to protect our dairy industry\nOr going to put a two hundred and Seventy percent tariff on dairy products [noise] something we sell for a dollar two dollars and Seventy cents tire picks it up to three Seventy that may means the Canadian dairy farmers that can make it for three fifty stay in business but it closes the U.

[noise]\n\nWelcome back to the ... one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six delighted to have you on the program tonight as we are talking about the new deal that's been were dealt with Mexico and Canada\nAnd that deal has a ... is designed to replace NAFTA with something that is a little more American friendly we'll see just how that goes over with the Congress or whichever Congress it turns out to be of course with the midterm elections coming up and keep in mind of course\nUm have by it but as you and I talked on the very beginning of the show your cat and when I said all these trade deals are skewed in favor of our trading partners you kept asking me why and I don't I couldn't come up with a real good answer\nAs though it may be have to do is follow the money um I still it looked to me like\nUh the u._s. was just trying to make these deals and I've had some\nA sense of wanting to help other countries are and that's why these deals were so a lopsided in favor of the trading partners it could have something to do with the money I don't know I Can't for the life of me figure out why everybody kept making all these deals for all these years\nOr so if somebody comes up with a good reason it may it may make\nSense but Sharon I Would I Would only add that again seriously you must understand the first of all and this was a view that as far too widely held among some ... some elite circles in this country we're only Americans number one\nAnd number two there is this this deep empathy for the the vast teaming masses of anywhere else\nAnd this notion that we have this this moral obligation to to lift them up and if it costs American workers a little bit well that's okay are they all have a relatively higher incomes and I really believe a serious that's a major motivating factor a lot of these people\nWith a lot rather have a Nobel Peace prize than they would a billion dollars Sharon\n... you know what can I think a ... not not not pulled a suspect ... thoughts that they believe that budget cuts I ever [laughter]\nOr I thoroughly agree I thoroughly agree you just you just have to understand the people with whom we're dealing here and I said ah that I've been around these people and that is an attitude maybe there's some money here maybe Sharon's on to something but\nI I think that a lot of simply has to do with the fact that that these ... you must understand that the the ... many of these people is how to make themselves morally superior to the rest of us\nAnd and if they go to night go to bed every night thinking you know I've I've made things better for the teeming mass was out there somewhere thanks of course do they're screwing over a lot of my fellow citizens in a better term by the way that they\nThey it's true that they don't believe in citizenship anyway they they're they're all part of this one world sing coup by on hold hands crowd a but but seriously that that's a major part of the motivation here\n[noise] uh but anyway thank you very much\nYeah absolutely I mean I I I really honestly do despite my questioning of a doctor busting her about that I really think that's a large part of the of the motivation and ah let's not talk to a Maggie who calls in from Alexandria, Virginia ... show hello Maggie\nThanks for taking my call sure there might be more nasty a reason for this um situation if these lopsided trade deals because we have to think this is not really trade that's coming in here either outsourced American goods coming in here from China from Mexico from ... even from Canada all those cars you know\nSingle in some cases no they're not all outsourced but some are that's go ahead and\nThe thing is so um [noise] DC oh see the problem is outsourcing American seals they should they should be made to register as foreign agents for the country\nThat the uh for production to really have a tattoo on their forehead\n[laughter] scarlet letter I like it\nOr I Would read too yeah yeah you know\nEndangering the country see if we had no steel industry here at or know anything else we can't defend this place you know see see China hit a communist government and what we should shut down your opponent or shut down your opponent and altogether to shut down the industry you don't see if if you have an industry can we can defend this place you know of course yeah\nWell I that's those are words that are worth discussing it first of all of course although officially the communist party's still runs China but uh as I've long said the the the changes taking place over there you could power Beijing off of Mao spinning in his grave with all the millionaires driving around Shanghai on there for our is\nSo it's not a communist economy although it's still partially communist\nBut he does a a a a a a communist government with a huge dose of capitalism but your thoughts that Dr butler\nYeah I I was just going to say I'm everything makes sense now now here's the argument for allowing a China to make the products instead of being made in America so let's say it cost a U.S\nA company's a hundred dollars a ton to make steel\nSuppose China can make it four eighty dollars a time and sell it to us at twenty dollars less than we can produce it ourselves that will\nResult in lower priced steel which means that the lower priced steel going in to finish goods and that should keep the price of finish good low so that all consumers\nBenefit by having the lower priced steel now some people argue well it's lower price because China subsidizes the Chinese government subsidizes the steel industry and that's true\nBut if if that's the case um many economists have argued if they subsidize their steel industry so they pay part of the costs and sell it to us for less money aren't they really subsidizing what we pay for steel\nAnd if that's the case shouldn't we take as much of the subsidies as they're willing to\nAll right let's legendary let's carry the argument a little bit further here it costs about nine million dollars to make him one a one Abrams tank\nSure the Chinese could make if we're far less than that so why don't we outsource our entire capability of making battle tax to the Chinese and well read or we could also outsource the F thirty five fighter and our modern ships in the like and that we would just make out like band is except for the fact that of course we will become the third rate world power\nYet except we don't have to I had them build the tanks in the planes but\nIf the tanks in the planes have so much steel and them we can try to steal from the Chinese are much lower cost\nThan it cost them for us to make ourselves then instead of these planes costing whenever they cost a few million dollars a piece you can reduce the cost to make the planes we don't need to give China our technology we don't need to let them make the finished product but if they can make components\nCheaper than we can make them ourselves are we better off taking it from them um and that allows us to produce it cheaper and that will be better off for us is\nWe raises another point and I only is it a dumping I'm going to bring up when we come back from the break but the point is you said that ... we\nWe shouldn't have to give the the Chinese are uh our intellectual property secrets but of course to build a plant in China Today that's exactly what the Chinese extracted from us\nAnd we'll come back we'll talk some more about uh some of the the Chinese applications that possibly this new trade agreement with Mexico and

you're saying except for the fact that uh uh I I Am not in favor of the general concept of uh why don't we all benefit a little bit\nAnd let a handful of us suffered terribly uh I don't really care for that general notion but the doctor a bus or I'll defer to you\n[noise] [noise] yeah yeah you know I'm ... that view was or what was prevalent before Donald Trump or and you know the Trump is really a free trade\nPerson he would much rather see no tariffs on anything and now that's nearly impossible to do but you may recall when the head of the European Union I came to see Trump they had a a a talk and afterwards they said we're both gonna work toward toward trying to get\nThe zero tariffs on everything now that you're not going to get there but if you work toward that that tends to benefit\nEveryone I'm so that that's what he he he's trying to do what Trump is doing with these ... you say well the one snow tires why is he putting all these terrorists and the answer is\nA Trump is a business person he's not a politician a politician would convene a summit we meet next year we'd talk some more and then you kick the can down the road from a business person a business person sees a problem\nEspecially if it's affecting your bottom line and confronts it immediately so Trump that we want to get these trade agreements resolved as soon as possible I Want to bring these people to the table right away while they're reluctant to come to the table or because they've got such a good deal\nSo what is a business person do you create a sense of urgency and how does it create a

really glad\nThat they're having this FBI a interrogation that cause I think that that probably will exonerate hand and clear the record hairs where whereas if we didn't have it but for the Democrats what are they always be crying file\nA although I I think you're you're correct in in your assessment but I think that it wouldn't matter it could go a week it could go fifty two weeks that could go the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's lifetime and it still wouldn't be enough and we should never lose sight of what is at work here and that is anything\nEverything that can be used to keep a conservative off that court that is the motivation right down to its core\nAnd apparently in some cases a motivation by those who feel that it's such a noble cause\nThat anything is worthwhile are tearing down a man's family are uncorroborated charges or who knows what will come out next I Believe there was some some thoughts brought up about his time a a coaching a youth sports and the like\nI'm not sure where this all goes but I Do know this that it does as a Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina noted\nIt does point out the extent to which are Democrats will give up their uh their power are quite grudgingly and of course they're concerned about the fact that with the Supreme Court\nYou're talking about a a president said his lifetime job and very few people ever leave that job voluntarily they die or become disabled sometimes people such as that his immediate predecessor Anthony Kennedy\nOr will retire because they feel it's time but the ... at the very least you're probably talking about\nA a thirty year tenure assuming the the usual ah actuarial tables for a person of a Brett Kavanaugh's age and and that's a long time on the on that court and it is just a against something which is apparently\nFueled in opposition to Kevin or or anybody else and in general I think we need to remember that it really doesn't matter if it's Brett Kavanaugh but it could have been anybody\nThat is true but don't you didn't beliefs are that given the fact that there is photographic evidence of it that Ruth ginsburg is going to sleep\nDuring the oral arguments she's nodding off and not being able to pay attention and iPad and and I think that\nThere should be some sort of criteria Janet in fairness to everybody and this for conservative and liberal judges that like of course for there to be asking you maybe get to be Seventy five or something\nSome sort of a mandatory examination that will determine your capability ever landing on the court\nWouldn't be opposed to that notion although of course an examination would clearly lead to all kinds of controversy about who conducts the examination et cetera and so on I think the only way that you could probably in a practical sense ever address that Charlotte would probably be with the mandatory retirement age and that of course\nWould involve a constitutional amendment\nOr but I I could easily see that the quite frankly there there comes a time when people probably should not continue in office you could probably make the same argument or Charlotte\nA for an elected members of ah the ah ah well the Congress even the White House perhaps that of course the the presidency already has a two term limit\nThere are currently no term limits on Congress' but ah I could see if you were going to let's say limits a

seventh investigation of Brett Kavanaugh the FBI is not wasting any time\nThey have talked with mark judge the high school friend of Kavanaugh's and in fact that the conversation has been done but it is not completed they've also spoken with the Yale classmate who says Kevin exposed himself to her and so there are covering the ground as the best they can\nAgain as a Joe Biden then the senator

I guess and any time that gas came on it was very low these things that they are\nAbout a cat or a favorite expressions was well hold on and then it well you know the previous caller you had was ... he didn't believe cabinet or you didn't cut him off you like he'll be\nA your guest last week or so biased against Kavanaugh it was disappointing because you're so fair and everything and there was just a departure I've never known a show or show last week\nThis is my second time that a lot of oil or here's the land where I forgot on Saturday ah anyway thank you for your ... your ...\nWell I appreciate your thoughts as I say I think that we have had guest hosts who do an exemplary job but uh certainly we are interested in the in your views and those are all others as well one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six\nFive oh five or six to six of course the the battle here is a for a court which would appear to lean\nFive for conservative that is to say we have had up till now of what are generally considered to be four liberal justices and with almost without exception they they have been and they remain of course\nFor conservative justices including of course a chief justice John Roberts who has in fairness to Roberts been a fairly conservative and fairly reliably so the Obamacare a is a tax decision to not withstanding\nI've heard some speculate that he might become the new Anthony Kennedy but I really doubt that Kennedy really had views that that frankly parrot or ... or ... if you will uh most of the conservative liberals splits in the judicial world\nAh But Kevin over certainly tilt it to five four more often than not conservative now another justice and and the list that the President Trump has put together is pretty uniformly a solidly conservative that is to say or people who believe in in the wording of the constitution not in an activist court\nOr that would converted to a likely six to three which is to say even with a surprise or two that you would have an almost uniformly conservative court and perhaps for a considerably long period of time\nA these are our times that are are perilous indeed for uh for the left in that regard in that regard to the views of the Democratic party at frankly a lot of of top Democrats are not nearly as radical as they are sounding\nA lot of them and looked at what happened to to some of uh of uh the top Democrats are like in New York ah ah where a\nA top Republican or Democratic House member was uh was expelled in a primary by an unknown and ah they they don't want that to happen to them the Dianne Feinstein of California wasn't even endorsed for reelection by our own party for Pete's sake\nOr so they're running scared of the left and the left maybe doing conservatives a great service\nYes they're saying outrageous things but I think that every time they drag the candidates further to the left\nThere making those candidates less likely to win re election I think that there are a few things that will help Republicans more in this midterm election\nThan candidates for the Democrats who have been dragged so far to the left that the moderates all lean in their direction we'll see but that would be my take on on the subject ever in Frederick County Maryland and listening to W. F. M. D. nine thirty am Dave calls and good evening Dave\nGood evening areas even I'm fine thank you\nI I just called for a couple of things I was listening to a radio station in Baltimore and um they were talking about the Montgomery County\nWhat was going on with cabbage and all and in Nineteen eighty two and that back then it was only a misdemeanor for what he would have done and there was only a year a\nLimitation statutory limitation ... uh which I found was interesting as soon as I guess now currently though it's there's no limitations on it at all [noise]\nAh well the evidence that law was changed uh after the fact and the there's one thing that it cannot be done in this country has passed what's known as an ex post facto law\nSo if you change the statute of limitations on a crime let's say you make that change in just to make up the number here you make that change in the year uh uh\nTwenty twelve okay and you're talking about an action that occurred let's say in the year uh Nineteen Ninety eight\nWell that that changing the law doesn't affect that crime or yes all crime subsequent to twenty twelve when that law was passed now suddenly have no statute of limitations but if you did a certain bad thing before twenty twelve it has no statute of limitations you cannot\nMake a law that applies to things that happened before the law was passed so that statute of limitations for a Brett Kavanaugh even assuming that he did what he's accused of doing a would would still not apply\nYeah and the other thing too that I don't know why a lot of people don't understand or surprised by this whole thing because then we see something like this happen in the United states wants before\n[noise] I well I mean there were ... there were charges that were brought against Clarence Thomas before his Supreme Court confirmation that consisted from uh from one person of course\nUh not not all of a variety of such people in and of course the the piling on goes back to the days of of Robert Bork and in fact it is even become a verb now up or a nominee to be quote ... unquote\nWell the the other thing is we had the Salem a Salem, Massachusetts where we had\nGoes away trials you know I mean it's it's been a long time but but you know we can't have people make accusations that are unsubstantiated on that\nThat have no ... while they may have merit to her that there is no truth I mean there's\nLike she'll wonder where am I going with our society who are guilty before we presumed innocent\nAgain some people to keep in mind here from a purely legal point of view Dave and that would be that the presumption\nTechnically legally only applies in a court of law or the presumption of innocence has as a matter of general practice usually applied before congressional hearings\nBut it does not apply a as a anything more than a usual practice there is no presumption of innocence\nBefore a a a congressional hearing this sort of thing and and you are you you do not have a again because we're talking about elevating someone to a privilege you you do not have a right to be able to Supreme Court is a privilege\nUh whereas the presumption of innocence goes to a removing of one's rights throughout one's property to one's freedom and in some cases one's life more to come on double ... will be back in the moment\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops into the dollar saying some experts say another crashes coming what will be left of your investments for your children are your grandchildren will you know you can't fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins in an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nDuring periods of great volatility precious metals regularly outperform stocks because there are true wealth has said that have real value\nDuring this through your recovery period after the two thousand eight crashed the Dow went up only three point five percent well gold doubled in price calling us now at eight five five eight five eight five eight or seven and learn how the IRA back my physical gold and silver can hedge against inflation and build a true legacy for your family regained control of your financial destiny\nAnd calling us are precious metals right now they'd five five eight five eight five eight oh seven to get your free gold i._r._a. guide\nCalled eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven as an investment the price of gold and silver may fluctuate over time and you could lose money checked with financial and legal advisors\nAre used to post the job boards that send me tons of resumes just\nTo find a few people who are right for my job at old process was not smart man I went to a different technologies scams resumes forms to find the right people actively invites them to apply so I get qualified candidates that smart", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "02"}
