Parkersburg Catholic against Notre Dame and Catholics still undefeated Mike\nHere there are still on a feed it but it did not come without a rama I'll just say that the I mean there'd be a state around or you know the end of the first quarter\nYou might have thought Catholic we'd go when the same having it up and they uh they got the but they've got the ball of return over who plays into the game they had to be able to work with and they were able to get a twelve year run from Jeff board\nOr the Notre Dame on their next possession drove the field got into hard work out the red zone but a gold and not convert on a four down conversion there got the ball back Catholic Catholic was able to break up another long touchdown runs ... over the fifty yard writing\nThe version good and before the first quarter was Don ... broke off pretty large run as well twenty two to nothing after one quarter\nA play that kind of a for some reason I don't know why but it seemed like it took the air out of Catholics a sales there are they actually thought they scored on a law long passing play ties term in the or a shotgun formation able to hit areas of excuse me I'm ... collie\nFor a long touchdown around but it was called back because of an ineligible receivers down field kind of kind of a you know a little bit of a woman and break it right there could very next play Notre Dame gets the interception let me tell you something Notre Dame got good quarterback\nInnate helm and he found his receivers\nOn many occasions tonight a bit of an Achilles' heel Parkersburg Catholic with their past or coverage of them before the first quarter was done it was twenty two to fourteen Catholic still had a chance to put to punch another touchdown and before half time but they got stalled at the goal line another ineligible receivers penalty\nOr to go to and a half time Catholic knew they were getting the ball back ah they broke off in a minute long drive the beginning the third quarter scored a touchdown they were pretty good place up two touchdowns a Notre Dame though was able to get a score within two plays cutting lead in half again\nA Catholic got another touchdown at the beginning part of the fourth quarter but let me tell you something this is a really really good squad or for Notre Dame a passing game working well for Nate homey hit his receivers very nicely Samara mano was a favorite target\nAnd they were actually in within one school or\nBig play close to the end of the game Brett I'm a Notre Dame with not a whole lot of time left a driving hit a gene west I think he's the younger brother to Jared west\nUm hit him into flat and he got a block or in front of them got all the way to the end zone but fumbled as he before he got to the pile on that gave Catholic back the ball touch back that would have been the least the game tying maybe with a few point or a\nA with a to point conversion very possibly a Notre Dame could have got to lead in that game that got the ball back to Catholics still a little bit of drama still all the way to the end of the game of Catholic was able to survive\nA maybe a little bit of exposed in their past events right now but they were able to survive got when on homecoming that's going to set up a huge huge huge game next week in Williamstown Parkersburg Catholic against their rivals the yellow jackets from

uh as I've heard it said many many times buddy it's All right there in front of you just one game of the time\nWell yeah we said we in the playoffs this week I mean we can't afford another ... another L. but I mean\nIt's amazing week from week to week we get Logan holders and back and we were flying again I mean it would just uh he was magnificent for touch the first and then we pulling\nA even one of their assistant said to me we're shaking hands it said it kicked amazing he's on one foot in corpus up to them I Can't imagine what it's like we don't do so a big night for him and ... and our defense coach Snyder working fetch coordinated needs a lot of credit because he it's hard to get ready for this trip on one week and\nHe showed a completely down so we're proud of them and the way you put that in game plan\nYour hawks with the wind forty six Nineteen over but cannon ups your coach you go to foreign born really seems like for about the last month has been wind loss when last for this you age esteem what's it going to take to put three wins in a row going into the playoffs or with Preston in Morgantown and qualify for the playoffs in Tripoli\nWhere you can't go back in the state of change there's the same I mean that's that's a saying in the last week I I really believe that a big mountain ridge had Logan played and unfortunately it didn't and we got beat so that put us in a real\nPickle I mean uh you know next week pressed and pressed is really struggling hopefully we'll get that way and in in a you know\nA Morgantown team which right now I'm scratching my head over because I Know they have personnel enough to feed anybody in the state and yet they're they're struggling a little bit right now so hopefully they won't get their ship right it until about two minutes after the mohawk bulbs over so\nAh you know we're probably going to have to have those two wings and a and I would think the way things are shaping up with a because some of the teams will be dog will give us a lot of bonus points so just focus this week just like I told her kids just focus so this is a playoff game have to have it and then uh you know we'll see what happens after we got this she tried to get ready for it\nRight of course next week you've got Morgantown has John Marshall so that's that's that's a little tougher um but isn't it amazing John how that last game of the season that mohawk bowl always comes down to meaning something for either one or both of the teams\nYou know that's that's great you said that for we were sitting around the office talking about that we set up you know it it's a great rivalry or something the ranks right up there with south in big red and and you know the capital and in all all the all the\nRobbers state but you know it's it's just interesting that I Know since we I guess the early nineties when both of us got pretty good and started making the playoffs regularly how many times that term and\nYou know who is going to have the home field advantage who was going to get bumped down who was going to get bumped up a you know even I've looked like this year about who's eating but it is so uh\nBut that's you know that's what makes a sport wonderful I mean you every game you go where they go by fast because here we are eight weeks or even already\nAny each game is so important and uh you know it's amazing like ten and up and down and be all over but it really comes down to a tenth game and the other big tournament in game and uh that's what makes it exciting\nYou have a division one player in the mirror Richardson is a senior year talked to me about his versatility he had a a rushing touchdown and receiving touched down in the game tonight he can really do multiple things in his own sense of debt for university [noise]\nWell I really bail us out tonight because uh you know and it was a doctor postal team doctor said to me you know\nRight at the end of the half he said let's get low there so we you know I wasn't a people don't understand thirty one several eating was not\nThat's precarious to me so I said let's let's get a mirror in there and get other score and he went and got his work so but you know he's like you said his he is just a mate\nHorseback or he just takes off these people when they receive or they have to double covering the and then you know Evan Perot had another huge night tonight three touchdowns two interceptions or whatever and he's another division one kid now\nAnd of course Logan the division one kid so you know we're we're we're blessed some a pretty good talent or even a dummy like me can win the game or two with that kind of\nA a buddy will you just keep winning and everything and take care of itself best of luck to you okay\nThanks you guys for she had she had me

in many cases is the extent to which much of the world will look the other way [noise]\nAh like they're they're only Christians\nAnd that's a a an odd attitude\nUnless of course I suppose you fall in with the identity politics kind of nonsense that well Christians tend to be a\nA rich wealthy white western countries or some such nonsense which of course by the way it is not even that can be true but if it were it still would be a beside the point\nWhere or at least it ought to be a beside the point\nIs that it is ironic indeed that uh some people in the west who\nMost express themselves with the the various freedoms that we have who make the greatest use of those freedoms are the least willing to defend them it it's ironic certainly if the forces of fundamentalist Islam or would it take

way and I'm\nA but I'm I'm very happy about pastor Brunson being released and think it's wonderful that President Trump was able to play the pressure that he did that make that happen and I also want to point out that\nAre in the beginning of Christianity turkey was of the of of Christianity I mean I'm\nYou know the um\nThat part of the world it was Christian at in the beginning in the beginning of the New Testament church it with um people in these agents were converted to Christianity\nAnd so like most people really aren't aware of that and I wanted also thank you for 'em at bringing up the statistics on up and daughters um\nThat are at that's a really good organization people went to visit that site\nAnd I just want to thank you for mentioning the things that you're dead well\nYou're more than welcome ... is the kind of thing that hey it's important\nAnd the I just don't hear much about it now and and and I think that's wrong\nIt is around yeah well I think when it just seems to

this evening Hi Maggie\nHi thank you for taking my call me I have a couple of comments here All right first what Mitch Linda was saying about turkey the territory of turkey it was known as Asia Minor it was it it became Christianized but\nThey'll get a lot of the letters that Paul wrote that they were out who to places on turkey\nBut to actually the Turkish people actually today we're not there yet they weren't near the border of China they were living with other nationalities through into a virus and some other ones and they came riding in in the ninth and tenth century ... century until the end of toning peninsula you see\nThe actual Turkish people today they were not not there yet in a in a Turkish at the end of twenty and peninsula you know not they're not yet\nThis is different different groups here different because the people involved you know but a couple a couple of cases cured illustrate what would happen if um the ISIS actually took over a post his philosophy so to speak\nSome kind of go we supported that in the territories in Iraq I think controlled by ISIS there's this um ISIS website\nWhich functions as a slave exchange it gives the names and the prices up three thousand or more Yazidi women and pushing women into the names of their owners and the price they're offered for of\nCourse yeah there's been this is the shopping list\nYeah slave exchange flea

would see nothing wrong with this or you you do you do is actually with the the infidel such as women Christian women you know whoever you know is not Muslim you know you see\nThere are a lot of

love of the Saudis event a lot of dealings with her no national level\nI I the the the the Saudi royal family as it doesn't have a dark ages as we can just having a ... a day they have on occasion allied themselves with us officially whoever things like the uh the war on terror or like the the first Gulf War\nThe altar who they are and what they represent\nSee Saudi Arabia has a small population of maybe twenty million people maybe eight million foreign workers include it why would they eat one hundred ten billion dollars worth of weaponry you know people that seem think what's behind this do they need all that weaponry or let armaments you know necessarily for what exactly you know\nWell of course of the ... they would probably say these days it would be to uh to join in the uh the uh United front against ah the ah the Iranians\nThe really ... that that would be their ads are I mean you can have your whether that's a valid answer or not but uh that would they would probably say\nUh-huh they might say something or other yeah suits them yeah\nMhm but you but your your points are are ... are well taken and there's a\nA ... again it's an area of the world about

Turkish government of today is not Turkish government when I was\nThere no no absolutely not are they ... they were completely different um\nIn fact the way I understand the constitution is written in\nSuch a way that a sort of most ... law cannot be instituted now that's the way it was written yes yeah air to one is trying to change it now\nAnd as he tried to change it officially unofficially I

get a kick out of most of among restaurants when I walked in the first time a greater demand their native language they look like I had two heads\nBecause they never had an American do that to them but you know it's a shame that a country with the history that it has and the inroads in his late into modern technology and how they have developed or cities\nIn the last uh forty years uh is going to is they're trying to pull back into the dark ages and I think that's a darn shame and I didn't know why the people of the country are standing around allowing that to happen\nThere are various
