I'm from we part so I'm I'm happy for them you know because ah he deserved it just got worse he cares about his teammates and\nFinding some before he's one of the best pitchers in the biggest\nSo its core of the manager of the red Sox talking about David Price who had those two bad starts to start the postseason ah was always nine and his postseason career as a starter then had the big winning the clincher against Houston and tonight coming up with six innings two runs a wind Boston goes up two games to none and buster you think of David Price\nYou figure the bullpen those are the big question marks and they've answer them so far\nIt's absolutely remarkable and those were the biggest concerns I told the story yesterday of no talking with a rock Holton JD Martinez and those guys asking me who did I picked during the post season and I said\nI I thought you guys are going to lose the Yankees I thought you guys are going to lose the Astros I said because I Am concerned about the bullpen I think if you gave those guys truth serum they probably had their concerns too but all of these guys have stepped up and improve their performance what a turnaround\nFor guys like a David Price for guys like Ryan ... who struggled his first acting in the postseason joke Kelly absolutely dominant in the first two games of this World Series\nWell as we uh fast forward to friday in game three in Los Angeles I Know designated hitter the national league rules will be there JD Martinez has four of his Thirteen postseason R B ... this year in in this World Series or he was limping uh during the game he can't ... what do you think's gonna happen\nIt's gonna be a fascinating situation perhaps I Will tell you that before the game when we asked Alex core about whether or not JD how his ankle was in this game he mentioned that there wasn't even a conversation with J. D. and he jokingly said he knows he's got to be in there he's the heart and soul this line up\nBut then after that we saw J. D. walking around outside he was definitely struggling some he was definitely sore and then to watch them run the bases tonight again an indication that he sore\n... you wonder if he's going to be okay to start gain three my instinct is is that he will absolutely find a way to be in the line up\nA ... and we'll see if he's a liability if he's in the outfield because he's not a healthy there's no question about that uh it sounds like that uh you know ... will be a in all likelihood in right field\nAnd then you'll see JD Martinez perhaps in left field if they just start Jackie Bradley junior or if they decided to start Andrew Benny candy then they will put ... center they'll have been attending and left and they will have JD Martinez in right field assuming he's healthy enough to play in the outfield\nAnd we'll have it all for everybody on a friday at seven eastern time buster safe travels west we'll talk to you on friday\nNight Jesse buster only from Fenway Park in Boston where the red Sox have a two games to none lead a four to win\nOver the Dodgers the twenty Eighteen World Series on ESPN Radio has been presented by auto zone auto zone has everything to get you what you need to get in the zone autos almost ten seconds for station identification you're listening to the world series on ESPN Radio and the ESPN at\nUC H.

sort of what you call your and Vietnam well you're you're familiar with charm a false flag operation on the far left ... ... ... ... they look like the Trump people look bad or it could be part of the of the Charlottesville proud of what I call them\nAll connected on different levels and it's just it's amazing to watch where we're living in the maze in times here\nWe are uh certainly uh although it's hard for me I guess to take that vast overall framework and and bring it down to what we know about these attempted bombings\nDo yeah I should say I just think it's all part of the daily outpouring from the drama that's going on it's just unfolding and I'm not saying who's involved or anybody's behind it but it's just it's just amazing to watch this thing on his old here and with the you know now with a different plane and all these\nYou know all the Trump people didn't know the Clinton people did it it's a just interesting times we live in I think a history will ah when it's written it's going to be quite an era\nUh it it certainly will be quite an era and the getting the probably the worst such era that we have seen I'm thinking since ah well the sixties about fifty years ago regularly to a Carl adult in Alabama hello Carl\n[noise] hello this is the first time caller but I just joined us don't want I Want\nYou know I'm not a truck driver I Am a security guard or whether they will go right we will have a boat [laughter] okay the reason I called is I'm I'm not sure I'm like you okay yeah I got to give me some evidence before I can tell you who did this\nOr why he did this but I'm thinking that there's a hole in the whole thing that we've got\nPeople who are really enthusiastic and not that well skills that come up with antifa over on the left and we haven't had someone extremely enthusiastic unskilled pop up on the right and that might be this guy\nMaybe yeah I mean it's certainly within the realm of the possible\nYeah and other than that uh you got him and he's got a sense of humor of the reason Debbie Wasserman Schultz keeps getting mentioned in this is the fact that ah her name was on all of the return addresses\nAnd yet she also received one\nOh she also received ... so where do I so I mean well other than that\nI'm going to go back to my little radio and listen to the rest of your program thanks for having me I Love your show\nWhere you were ... girl I thank you very much for that yeah the the show it's a connection or such as it is it's a little difficult to fathom I Would agree is Susan in Pittsburgh now good evening Susan welcome\nHi Kim thank you for taking my call it ... more of a question or comment okay ah 'cause I was gone most of the day I heard this in the morning I'm wandering and it it's just a thought it's not a comment it's not an opinion\nDo you think you personally I did think that the Saudis could be behind as\nAs you think about how many times in this country will try to\nTurn attention to something else to deflect\nAnd I'm Wondering if they are trying to make America and talk as violent as they are\nI don't think so no it doesn't strike me as a kind of thing the Saudis would do they they tend to engage in activities\nWhich would be a little more dramatic ah I I doubt it I mean it it I suppose anything is possible but it I I find it hard to believe the Saudis would be engaged in such an activity that was so uh\nSo uh yeah the athlete done I Would have to think the Saudis would at least will come up with a bomb that would go off but again I Can't to eliminate what you say I suppose anything as they say is possible Tom in Medford, Wisconsin to your next up hide\nHi Tim how're you doing there Jim Boeheim thank you that um I\n... my concern is is I Know everyone can speculate and we everyone to have a theory 'cause right now we just don't know but here's my concern I wanted to see what you thought about this and that is ... considering that all the targets of this were democratic leaders\nPeople that we see in the news and so forth [noise] ah my worry is is those that the people that we've seen out there and people who have basically taken over Portland tore up Berkeley that's her thing it is good this is the fact that this happened will this be an end to this is for them to you know upper violence even more\nWell then of course don't need an excuse to up their their violets are even more\nA number one and number two they haven't always necessarily been in league with the the active or mainstream elements of the Democratic party I mean let's face it uh the extreme elements of the Democratic party have ousted some a prominent Democrat so\nUh I don't see that this was necessarily going to be an excuse for them they don't need an excuse\n[noise] although I could see the big involved again we don't know but if you look at the only group in this country that is actively engaged in a confrontational illegal actions it would be the antifa movement their cancer and they've got to be cut out\nOh I agree totally I I just I'm just worried that this is going to you that this is gonna be something else that's going to escalate from one thing or another next time a bomb could go up because it might I'm just wondering if it's possible that this was I and I know this is my own speculation some sort of test run where it\nWas set out put out these prominent targets desire not to go out but just to see how far could get to see if it would if it was plausible\nWell maybe except of course for one thing and that is that now everybody's on the alert so if\nIt was a test run it was a test run you couldn't follow up on for several months because everybody now is a is a on the lookout but uh I guess again within the realm of the possible uh Louise in Aberdeen South Dakota good evening\nHi either right to say that I feel that the\nPeople the bone and direct ... them and satellite connection waters yet I'm a killer right\nThe ship all Eric Holder will kick them out and all that we get the sense something that's not so ... we're going to play or I\nDon't know I I Would note of the recipients I don't recall uh other than the Joe Biden's comment about taking president drop out behind the gym and the wailing on him\nA which was more tongue in cheek I don't recall a lot of the confrontational comments from Biden or Obama has that a lot of things to say about\nAbout the Trump records at a at frankly been falls like are\nThe economic recovery started on his watch but I don't recall a lot of the the confrontational type of of comments from Obama's
