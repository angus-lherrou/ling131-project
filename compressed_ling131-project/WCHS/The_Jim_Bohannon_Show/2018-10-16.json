I I don't\nI don't think are are your analogy is necessarily a a a ringing true in this particular case saline but obviously the point that she's trying to get at is\nOff why are we uh uh that willing to get involved here I must confess that I certainly am no apologies for the Saudi regime or it is a barbaric it as fast as they get his dark ages and unfortunately in this real world of hours sometimes not all the time but sometimes it can be at least\nOr it can offer the semblance of being an ally to our interests around the world and or if this were an American citizen I think that would change everything this is a person who had lived in the United states where I was not an American citizen I certainly don't\nLike the idea of a of journalists or anybody else entering a consulate and uh and never walking out again on the other hand I Am not quite sure why this happens to be a particularly strategic interest of ours Dr Gorka\nNobody's saying it is nobody's saying it is a ... just getting dressed and I really have no ... this woman is talking about a but there's there's a broader issue here about those who say that they wish to be a ...

Would call most Islamic Islamic representation in the middle East that is a close ally with us\nBut how can we square Donald Trump it seems to almost be pandering to the crown prince and agreeing that it could have been rogue agents would Saudi Arabia clearly as contradicting lived on this I mean I feel like we have to grow an ally in the middle east and unfortunately Israel can't really bring that

much to cover in the book or give me something that I have not mentioned that you'd like to point out\nYeah I think the most interesting thing about the timing of the book because of course I didn't know this was going to happen when I wrote it is the last chapter on the last hero I write about who is wicked chambers and and the comparison between wicked chambers and justice Kavanaugh's so\nI'm for those who was shocked\nBy the way this man was treated by the Democrats you shouldn't be because\nThis is not new there was a man in Nineteen forty eight who stood up for the truth who knew who the communist ... inside the U.S government work because he had been a Korea for the Soviet Union as a as a communist agents and would it get chambers who had given up communism decided to tell the truth\nAnd the Democratic party tries to destroy them they called it was sexual alcoholic they used to being responsible for the death of his ... his brother it was all lies above his mother never gave up he stood up for the truth\nAnd that was eventually vindicated when the ... the crypt the Soviet communications proved that al ... his one of the people he accused of being a communist had in fact be made\nA Soviet age and so the sad truth is this is not the first time that Democrats have done what they did to jobs justice capital\nAnd that's why the elections next month also very very important because we cannot allow the mall to take control of the house and all of the sudden\nAs per that election are you an optimist or some of the polls are not a terribly a friendly or to that point of view and of course the polls are not always right but they're not always wrong either\nWell they were very very wrong and twenty sixteen and one of the few people who knew what was going to happen then was Larry Schweikert talked in\nIn my communications with Larry he thinks that not only will we keep the Senate if things remain but keep the house as well so yes I remain cautiously optimistic because\nA lot of people who may not have voted for Donald Trump worrying sense are incredibly angry at what was done to this good man just discovered law\nAnd finally your thoughts about the Republican Congress or if there is in fact day a Republican Congress or after the November elections or why is it going to be any better than it was before\nBecause I think the Republicans are starting to understand who Donald Trump is the ... he won\nDespite the geo peace so I think if you look at the press conference that happened the day or the the the ... vote went through those Republican senators were were more angry than I've ever seen them so I think perhaps as they\nHave woken up to the reality of life in the world on the President Trump and that's a good thing for all

thirty seven eight hundred five to six fifty one thirty seven that eight hundred five to six fifty one thirty seven\nFor healthcare costs to go up because again they are acting the role of finance company and so they're not going to wake up tomorrow and say you know what I'm I'm tired of this average over two hundred percent stock price increase that we've seen since ... the portable care\nSo that really leave this up to two categories Uncle Sam and you and me\nAnd you and me are little culpable in this not specifically talking about you Jim but I'm Talking about the American assume or because when it comes to health care is the one thing we don't ask questions about\nThe average American will spend two hours researching a television for for they buy it and fourteen hours researching a car but on average spends less than Fifteen minutes researching health care and so we have to become more engaged because the system is set up to work against us\nBut we need Uncle Sam to set speed limits on the highway here\nI can go buy a car that drives two hundred miles an hour but Uncle Sam ... going to let me go drive at two hundred miles an hour down the road we need to do the same thing the fact that uh intervene IOUs bag or an IV bag cost less than a dollar to produce in the United states but it's built on average by hospitals over five hundred and forty two\nDollars that's a fifty four thousand percent markup at some point we have got capitalism in conflict with care and it's gone awry and unfortunately this is one of those areas where regulation does need to come into play\nYeah it really has to do and anybody who who is opposed to that they had better stop and consider the backlash that we don't do something about things like that we're going to go a whole hog break complete\nA Medicare for all a socialist healthcare system the public is not going to sit back and get a get taken for a ride like this I think our choices between a little bit of regulation or a tidal wave of regulation\n[noise] well we have to because you get two things working against us here so again American consumers don't think about accessing the health care system they think about accessing their health insurance which pays for the health care system\nWell health insurance for an average family of five is over twenty thousand dollars in the United states so if you're a family of five making fifty thousand dollars a year twenty thousand that go into health insurance because\nMore and more employers are paying less of that because they can't afford it\nAnd then at the same time over the past ten years but the duck doubles employees have to meet and participants have tomatoes got up over two hundred and twelve percent\nAnd so when you start to factor in these things\nIt's it's I'm paying a lot of money before I get the value of what I'm spending money on\nBecause if something catastrophic was to happen I'm Still going to have to come out a lot of money to get access and so something has to shift here and and the west is is is sounding the horn on the Medicare for all and\nAnd the challenge with that is you know it's just taking money out of one pocket and putting it into the into another until we get control of the cost within the healthcare system\nEven Medicare for all would not be as it would be insolvent there would be a little way to pay for it without significant tax burdens and again that's not solving a problem that's just taking the money from one hand and putting it into\nThe high agree I don't I don't think that's a viable option but I think many people will consider it an option\nAnd we need to keep in mind the fact that the people are going to insist on a solution and if it's not a little bit of regulation on the type of price gouging you just outlined then it's going to be the whole hog that you just described to know that's not a viable solution but if we wind up stuck with it but that would not be good\nThat's exactly right and that's the challenge and this is what what I was I was really concerned this past year when when Republicans fail to do something substantive on healthcare and this is the challenge and I was an ... I'm a conservative I called Republicans out on this to say\nYou're not coming in with a real plan of action here all the the government has looked at as focused on the health insurance premiums one is a derivative of the other until we start to look at the cost of health care\nHealth care health insurance premiums will continue to rise there is no way to manage them effectively\nWhile it's like six five oh Jim bar number one eight six six five oh five or six to six and we'll have more including some calls for ... and and he is the co founder and chief strategist at GDP advisers and will continue with that here momentarily but right now a question for you\nIf you have a loved one or someone else who gets leg cramps put crabs to sort of thing\nYou have them yourself you know how painful and disruptive they can be a I got I'm a I'm not particularly happy with the muscle cramps can the ... out of a sound asleep interrupt your daily life but please listen carefully because I recently learned about Sarah works relief\nThis was the ... the phone that's proven to relieve muscle cramps fast and reduce muscle sort us plus with daily use their own words relieve can even prevent muscle cramps before they start\nTheir work believe only takes minutes do apply it absorbs quickly and it works people loved the result you've probably seen doctor drew Pinsky on TV talking about their works believe\nOr many of my radio colleagues were also talking about their works believe another holiday season of course is just around the corner if you know someone who suffers with muscle cramps or muscle ...

I'm not a doctor I'm an analyst of the financial markets specific to health care and and\nI you know I I can understand from a perspective of physicians saying things in a hospital that ah [noise]\nAh maybe not be the most of quality that you would like to see I Will tell you the second or ... and all actually agree with you from our own studies and what we're seeing which is that oftentimes in the healthcare world today because of the way to hospitals run from a business perspective\nA there is almost a quota like structure to treating people quickly with pills that are not going to generate the highest level of revenue in other departments of hospitals for example\nWe we want to focus on treating the high dollar high reimbursement rate procedures and and run like a\nTurning system of quick\nGet them a pillow and get them out the door for anybody that can be treated that way and we we now call the doctor visits a seven minute visit that that had never leaves the door knob they want to give you a pill and get you out the door so they can move on to the next\nHopefully larger issue that they can refer within the hospital system to generate more revenue for the hospital system which by the way hospital systems now own a very large portion of the physician community\nAnd average studies are showing that the return on their investment when they're buying a physician's practice is roughly eight to one in the United states and so they need to get a return on that investment because doctors or their sales force now\nThat she's referring inside of a hospital system to drive up higher MRI costs more tests are more surgical procedures and it really needs to change\nAll right thank you by the way for your call or it's a very great that they should do I understand that your doctors practicing defensive medicine that that's part of the problem here is not a you know a\nA are we going to have male operation there oh okay I better schedule an MRI because I Want to cover my bud against the malpractice attorneys that clearly unnecessary are odd to be there has to be some measure of tort reform ear\nIn no question that tort reform needs\nTo needs to come into the conversation the what we're seeing from a um a lawsuit basis in the healthcare system is just\nOutrageous a and we've gotten to a place where research study in Washington stationed at twenty two percent of all tests are unnecessary and today's\nUm US Economy when it comes to health care and so when you look at that and you say well goodness a a a multibillion dollar system that the ... the U.S economy and twenty two percent of it is wasted because of misuse of tests now I don't buy and all of that is tort related\nBut it absolutely is a big chunk of it if I'm a doctor and I could risk my practice because I miss diagnosed the common flu and sent you home thinking it was not respiratory infection we saw that happen a lot this past year actually uh where people got very sick from the flu during this last flu season and so you know\nChest X ray CAT scans MRI's these types of things are being tested at um apps ... rate where they weren't before and highly oftentimes unnecessary and the result is and that is a direct impact of\nA need for truth tort reform but also need to drive profits\nOne eight six six by boat jumbo one eight six six Bible five or six to six on the ... with the guest said dents and is there anything about Obamacare that's worth keeping\n[noise] well so a couple of the things that I did like about the the Obamacare legislation I liked the fact that insurance companies a cannot impose preexisting conditions on\nOn people to challenge when you're when you're faced with a diagnosis of an issue or a condition and you can't get health insurance you can't get access to help you financed that um and and so if I if I were to isolate the single most beneficial piece of the Affordable CARE Act um it was that\nWas I think that there were some other pieces of the Affordable CARE Act that make sense it's just an actual practicality they were just done they were they were implement it poorly I mentioned earlier the M. L. our mandate mandating that insurance companies had to effectively\nEvery dollar they collect spun eighty five cents on claims well that sounds good in theory and and most people can get on board with the fact that we don't want to insurance companies to just who owned the market share to just collect more premiums and I have to pay him out on planes\nBut the execution of the law is just as important as the law itself and it was not written by people that understand how the system works rather was written by the health care lobby the health insurance la Brea in conjunction with Congress\nAnd so when you don't get independent mind looking at it it can go ride because while that provision could be beneficial there instead it needed to be directed more health care delivery system and when you focus on the percentage without a dollar amount tied to it\nAgain or going to see is a massive inflation to ensure that profits continue to rise\nOne eight six six by boat jumbo when eight six six by both five or six to six K calls them blow him from a color into Iowa and a good evening Kay welcome good to have you on the high\nCamp um my biggest problem with ... ...

people think that there is a in fact an account someplace with all of that uh\nThat fight go withholding when in fact there was nothing there but an I owe you so I'll I'll address that question with our guest the substance and said\nWell listen I mean yeah they say [laughter] it it definitely has been the practice of the federal government for the last goodness multiple decades um to to look to move the money around and and effectively just rack up the debt let's look at the national debt right now\nA Social Security and and\nAnd even Medicare for that matter is is\nReally insolvent if you actually look at the way it's structured now in the money that's going out while it may have cash in the coffers from a standpoint of\nWe weave the government reports that there's money to cover these things it is very true that they move money around in different ways they're barring against the defense fund and a number of other things to make sure that there's enough money to pay for one thing that they've committed to and this is again going back to the\nWell we talked about in the first segment why Medicare for all\nA would be effectively just a massive\nUh the only way to do it would be the ... late collect taxes and continue to borrow\nI'm with the baby boomer generation where they are with life expectancy doing what it is doing and that's the thing Medicare and Social Security we're not originally set up to be this ongoing thing Social Security was originally created\nTo ensure that the American citizen didn't outlive their retirement savings\nRight and so but we distorted that in a way that now because of the advancement of modern medicine which are good we're outliving the system or at least the system the way it was set up and unfortunately this is just the way that

he's co founder and chief strategist for GDP advisors and ah they're on line at the info dot G. P. advisors dot com [noise] we have a call from Chuck in Lewiston, Idaho hello Chuck\nHoliday thank you for taking my call what's on your mind I have I\nI'm old enough to older than you guys so I Want to give you some information years past are used to be that\nThe income tax or hurt me a worker pretty bad after a while so the people who owned business decided what they would do is they would give the Arab people a\nHealth care and it would go up the employers cost that it didn't cause the employee anything mhm and uh the government I guess looks that oh well let's take that too because they take care of everything else so anyhow\nIt used to be a way to\nPay less income tax by the owner\nOr I'd have to act like let's say your guest about that than the drug thank you for the Gulf and it has a change in tax laws are a big part of the problem\n[noise] not really I mean I I'm not going to necessarily just disagree with what Chuck said but there were a couple of key things that have happened you know when employer market when we started to see employers really rise in the healthcare market space and start to provide that as a benefit to employees is really after World War two\nWhen when all the boys were coming home and and there was a they did actually wage freeze\nA where the government well we'll get a wage freeze that prevented employers from going in and and trying to retain a new employees and so you just healthcare is the model to do that [noise]\nThe incentive of the tax advantages still absolutely there the challenges is it to the tax advantage\nHas been superseded by the cost of health care so no longer is the tax advantage equal to or even as much\nOr even close really to the overall premiums of healthcare system and so in some ways I guess Chuck is right because\nThe government or in the way that they're taxing the system and really driving the cost up but not regulating it appropriately is making that the cost far exceed the benefit of the taxes but employers still get the full tax advantage of writing off\nOr the health care expenses and technically for the employee and you know any premiums that they're paying for so long just run through what's called a section one twenty five plans and then all those premiums are pre tax as well\nAll right on that note we will love pause stay on the line we will speak off there again the substance of\nOur guest has tried to put things in some perspective demise we muddle our way through the entire health care debate with no immediate answers inside regrettably again the set is

law obviously there would be some uh some numbers involved so I'll I'll look into that [noise] All right Dave and fond du Lac Wisconsin on the ... and Joe hello Dave\nHour you say you were brought together by a financial situation you were making a lot of money she had money is that what we're saying\nWell no she didn't own a business he didn't have a high paying job or anything like that but we were both tenants in the building\nAnd uh but she she brag about her uh her parents who she said were millionaires uh well actually it was our mothers who is in doubt child okay she wanted she wanted a ride over to Montana it's like a desert her mom and um\nAnd that was how ... started\nAs so Aaron ... was money involved at all here I guess or was there pressure it's out I mean are we talking about just another another relationship or right\nBefore the horse you know and uh I just she said she had a trust fund and the only thing she had to do in order to get the money was to stay off of drugs and tells you idiots old uh-huh name some good get her money and she would get ... with the kids and she would buy a house\nOkay we were both\nBoth uh there were did you did you like or I mean uh\nWell she was very friendly way rash oil and she had a great sense of humor and everything seemed legit\nOkay but then what what was the end result here because so far we're just talking about a relationship but I'm not sure that we're talking about a ... a meat to type of circumstance so 'cause they'll go ahead\nYeah yeah well I think of the mother in Montana and uh she was a retired prisons that ... been working in within\nYou know I'm Twenty years and retired admiral and parents and they were very nice country folk in everything seemed kind of fit in with what she told me\nAlthough it doesn't sound like people who would have a ton of money\nWell law is just the idea that they had where they were so\nGrateful I mean they were in a while they were well read okay you know and\nAnd well this is all very interesting but at what point does visitor into the the area of a of a I guess a work related sexual harassment I Try to understand exactly how this fits into our conversation John\nWell like having a um I ended up being um charged with a felony conviction on a burglary and the other with two assaults\nOn on one on the on on those woman\nYes\nWe'll be listed is cut to the chase did you did you do these things no okay that that she was she she accused you of a of doing this\nYes why and but the thing was\nShe accused me of the nice things because I was breaking up a relationship because I was finding out that anything she told me was ally ... and she was involved in drugs and she was hanging around dangerous people okay and I was trying to protect myself I see and I ... I went to court on average right never went to court\nOr any of these charges to face face me or a jury or judge she was never there\nAt what was the uh the court outcome where you are convicted of anything\nYes I was convicted of everything I ended up losing my job in my hopes for career a I ended up losing my reputation I had a I had a person you want me to build a house there was an arrogance wall there's just lots of different things involved my life was just ... and\nOther words what you're saying is it a ... an accusation that was unsubstantiated was sufficient for all of this\nThings to happen to you right okay and what it was so bad\nThat I ended up uh having shift psychiatrist and just like her okay she was involved in the mental health ... I was a time of our relationship\nAnd a few of the law in the mental health system was employed in it as a patient and the patient as a patient okay Oregon okay\nAll right and I'm so she never addict dealing coins dead state and stick her place for her was a social worker\nAnd let me get this straight hair she this woman has as as it middle stability issues and and your defense attorney couldn't get you off on that basis you know\nIt doesn't sound like I mean I I I've I'm second guessing obviously I wasn't there but at the surface on the surface and sounds as though you didn't have a very good attorney\nExactly I well first of all I had at ten thousand dollar cash only bail and um\n... when you're in that situation um you can't you can't get it attorney you have to sit in jail to wait for a jury trial which takes three months\nWhen women do you what do you mean you can't get an attorney of course you you could get an attorney obviously everybody's entitled to an attorney if they face criminal charges that's part of your Miranda rights you have the right to an attorney if you could not afford one one will be appointed for you was this one a point where you\nWere there was a public affairs\nExactly well that was that was an attorney do do do you feel your public defender was a inadequate I mean it it sounds like it must have had an error they must have been\nYou know okay I was kind of ... that led to believe that in mind\nThat at first it was just the top and then and then later yeah that was another charge because I was on probation and then they said that there was a burglary or they never was well yeah but it was a burglary\nWell let's suffice it to say that that that you would have a serious a\nCircumstance that and again now that we we fully understand that I can understand how you would be a leery of uh of any ah entanglements even though this particular case it was one that the EU and there's really had a encouraged All right uh again a sad tale to be sure\nA one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six\nCould the me too movement lead eventually to not her hashtags not her I'm not opposed to women in the workplace but I Can't hire one as I say that certainly is not what any of this was intended to become\nAnd it is and what I Would call a constructive policy on the other hand uh since I don't hire and fire people uh I can see where they will be coming from\nIt ah it would nobody even somebody chose to go ahead and hire a woman in in one of these circumstances nobody could say that they weren't at least filled with a certain amount of trepidation\nYes I've hired this woman she's very good a perfect as an executive assistant it will require of course that we will occasionally have dinner together we will occasionally traveled together\nAnd and you could not in all honesty say and that doesn't bother me a Middle East in ... and leisure just rather naive I mean it it would have to at least occurred to you\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five or five or six to six often I pose questions here in which I have what I consider to be an answer\nAnd uh I don't in this particular case
