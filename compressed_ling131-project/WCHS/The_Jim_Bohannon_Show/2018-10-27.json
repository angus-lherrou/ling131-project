and forty four yard\nAnd you were ... [laughter] and you have to have a sloppy track out there you had rain for about three quarters\nOh it was impossible yeah absolutely it was just\nIt was America right America left to be a it was like that that's all you heard that you carry the ball the whole time nobody else had any or hotter American to touch down the at really probably one of the games of his life and you know the Dodgers they came out and a coach versus I Wonder if they gave away the first quarter\nIt was American one your key day they went up seven nothing\nAnd the jackets came right back I mean it was going to be it's just good old fashioned slug fest or twenty five and the first quarter quarter hates to attend your past Eric Brown ... seven all nothing against in Seoul America I mean this is just really ran wild Seventy seven your GD\nFourteen to seven and a it was America\nThat's what it was and I did a great job and then the Dodgers they grow up a nine to know and the jacket say finished up at eight and two they'll have a by but God I Want to ask you do have been around a long time going to have you ever seen nobody else at any other often what hunter America forty fifth very frequently for\nWell not especially against the team as good as Williams down on the other side I think that's what's really still impressive it's one thing to do it against the teams that may be struggling matured he did that against the ball club tonight on the ... Iraq who had won what a eight in a row\nYes absolutely a very tough team on defense now the big bang there were averaging over forty some with the game the jacket sell them to fourteen\nBut really it was a great game segue I absolutely fun game everybody I mean I Know I had to be a winner and loser but for ... on friday night lights guys it was a tremendous game both of them are going to be in the playoffs are going to do real well so a great game over all\nRight I Apologize I I was changing my score sheet to say hunter America fourteen Williamstown that's [laughter]\nThat's right I sell it

tell you I'll take the week and uh you know you're in the playoffs and we'll see who your match up against will go from there okay\nI got like a lot ... even when we knew hunter America was good that that's a very impressive\nMatt very joins me now boy you talk about a ballgame spring valley and point pleasant if you left in ...\nI'm not going to believe the final score or you're ...\nYou're you're you're not going to believe the bottles corporate thanks for having me\nSpring valley came up here on the\nTrip up route to employ pleasant smack them in the mouth in the first have\nSpring valley trail the big blacks twenty seven to fourteen at the end of the first half and then the triple a number one showed what they were made up they scored forty four unanswered point lead by name Ehlers running wild the game of his life from the quarterback position\nTwo hundred and twenty yards average Twenty one yard for Kerry\nScored three times in the spring valley timber wolves remain under crude it they just\nQuickly the fear that thirty four\nAnd in in that game it was like you mentioned twenty seven fourteen at the happen case and famous playing great for the big black\nOne was the change of pace that really can't seem to come out of the third quarter obviously NATO Alice Randall football well for spring valley but but defensively the timber wolves whole point was that just seven points in the second half what was the difference on the defensive side of the ball in the third and fourth quarter\nBring valley has not played\nA athlete of this caliber very often this year I Know even double lay the case and paying showed what you were made a he ran wild over spring valley spring valley made some half time a drug but it unfortunately for a big black crows didn't play much of the end of the third quarter throughout the whole court I'm unsure of its status if it was\nJust hey we're down by a couple of scores what's rafting for next week\nMany of the press box gets back after ... injured\nBut spring valley just like to see him every play in the second half and limited his running because he had your cold in the first tap you were here in New York as non tenure or a carry and ah thankfully for the\nGeneral staple they may have comic but then came away with a scary when after that first that\nNow you gotta Huntington next week and you talk about a rival game mhm that should be interesting\nYeah especially with Connie can we were keeping track upstairs Tony winning it over time over Parkersburg evidence to Huntington undefeated spring valley Huntington looking for pay back last year spring valley knocked out of the playoffs on their way to wheeling Huntington it out for word um and we do have something I Need to mention Mr everything\nKobe upon or for greenbrier is kind of a one to do for the sport and just devastating tonight for for instance\nAll right you got one more game at home that's the good news you get an over nine Brooke team making the trip down next week so something's gotta give for instance over nine broke his own nine and you know I ... it makes the year at least the off season a little sweeter if you can get that when next friday night\n[laughter] you know I mean I haven't talked to coach petted go about this yet but I'll I'll talk to him about it this coming week you know is there's only a certain amount of team tried to get that gets when their last game of the season of course the three state champion\nUp it will in Ireland and you know a handful of teams that missed the play offs but they won their final game so you know I mean I think that's got to be petted goes message to his thing this coming week is hey guys we've got a chance to go in the next season with a streak of W one beside her name winning one game\nYou know to in two thousand Eighteen so you know I'm I'm hoping Princeton and get it done next weekend\nThey had their own own struggles this year and really Princeton went five hours last year to to Bethany College where that game was played in Princeton really probably should have walked out there with a win last year it in the season so hopefully the ball bounces Princeton way to end the season next week\nI bought a a good job as always we'll talk with you then okay All right thanks for west McKinney voice in the Princeton Tigers John ... voice in the ... Parkersburg gained in ice in Huntington oh\nNo absolutely Fred that was the game was going you know back and forth it had its ebbs and flows I think ah you know the big rats got out to a good start in that ball game where they\nAre recovered the opening kick a ball game they kicked off the Huntington then recovered a tiger Mohler had the opening touched down to the big rats they got out to a seven to nothing lead Huntington came right back with a black well with the five yard run begrudge came back a county peacock was\nA fourteen Thirteen Huntington at half time than the Big Roads\nA state that way pretty much the third quarter and a big rich came back out a to point conversion to make it Twenty one fourteen but Huntington came back again at the end of the ball game or what about a minute three left tied at at Twenty one and it goes over time\nAnd you know it was just one of those things you butch Powell I talked about it it was one of those games you hate to see somebody loose and unfortunately a big red off this one and over time but you know I think the thing about the Big Roads has been the fact that as that team is played\nOver the course of the season and to have continued to improve the quality ball club a darned outright for Huntington deserves all the kudos\nOr that he gets a on his a wind play just because it's a big red could not get anything started a on the ground really throughout the whole night of the big run from scrimmage was by quarterback jak jobs and who actually broke one for\nSixty nine yards on one play a just a couple of others stabbed by Fred here in the Big Roads out gain Huntington by one yard\nThree hundred and fifty nine yards for three fifty eight however the Big Roads or a typical for the big rats had two hundred sixty five guards in the air under a hundred on the ground wall Huntington just about what they uh they had two hundred and fifty seven yards on the ground and a hundred and one yards passing\nBut uh the story of the ball game was the big rats that tonight fall in overtime twenty seven Twenty one to Huntington\nI your broadcaster so next week is not just another game it's a huge because its rivals time was Parkersburg so\nYeah exactly and and both teams you know looking to solidify their playoff spot obviously it's weak a weapon and\nYou know it's always even more exciting when there's so much riding on a game like this as well which sat stadium field so the big red still have a lot to play for and you know I kind of had a sense that the big rats even though it was a tough\nA lost tonight uh that they're going to be they're going to get over this\nAnd a play or a plan to Parkersburg south clubbing and you know just strap it on and it's going to be a it's got to be a real real tough ballgame it'll be interesting to see what's so much on the line in the final game of the season versus the patriots\nHigh but we'll look forward to it and talk with you next week okay All right we'll do thank you thank you John John ... voice in the park is bird Mike Cameron nice bounce back when I after losing last week Williamstown parties were Catholic gets a nice win tonight over him and buddy\nIs Syria you know it's kind of hoping to be kind of special tonight because we were like well the the weather conditions were so rough but I guess it was pretty much going around the whole state\nUh but uh you know it was a pretty rough field there over in hand in a I'd say the field was like a like a chocolate pudding consistency for most of the night but uh I was a very businesslike a game for Parkersburg Catholic good bounce back as you said or they were able to control the run they didn't pass it one single time the whole evening\nUh let's see I think ties term ended up with a two touchdowns and a little over a hundred and Seventy yards rushing Jeb voice a broke the hundred or a hundred yard mark as well with a couple of touchdowns to just again it was a very\nControlled when I'm uh they they they ran the ball well not that that's that was number one I ask ... vinegar beforehand how we're going to handle this one I think for all intents and purposes we kind of knew less something really catastrophic we're going to go wrong that\nThey were going to go in and win that game I was there how are you going to handle it and so we we play a part of the Catholic World ball we run the ball that's what we do here and we're not going to stop that so they did that a very effective and it was a good bounce back when I just also while I get a chance to do so I wanted to say that the folks over hand and\nAre just just splendid people I mean they\nAre very good care of us that they cut us in the in the ... and a\nGood people it was a good small town\nOf a friday night atmosphere there it was homecoming we've been to so many home companies is your bread that I feel like I'm a little bit under dress one that shows that led to a ... this is I think was the fork

from him but it would have been leaked\nA I don't I don't see any big surprises coming up in the next week and a half\nThat I don't I don't see it all he's got nothing\nHe's indicted ...

today people I got the broad brush and all you know groups of people for the actors you know one person or just a few people uh you know whether\nOr not one Democrat doing one thing like the shooting

litter and I thank you for calling and let me know\nThat a while I agree that no rational person would ever have taken such actions after listening to President Trump either candidate Trump for President Trump the fact is he has used loose rhetoric good times which is the kind of thing that would trigger a sick mind like this\nAnd yes the in the recent quote the president says he's toned down yes he has and it's about damn time that he toned down\nI think he may have finally gotten the idea that his job is to be president of the United states then to pursue certain policies not to entertain his base he's better than he was with the fact is he still engages in rhetoric that create enemies he doesn't need and in some cases\nMay have impacted a twisted mind again that does not mean that he is to blame for the\nMethodology of a sick individual but it does mean that this does not benefit President Trump the Republican Party or his viewpoints and if he has in fact toned down

that the bombs were never meant to hurt anyone and couldn't hurt anyone so uh\nAgain the he says that that was a\nThat is that that was his intent why you would bother to send out the bombs that couldn't go off\nOther than just making a big fuss and to destroy the rest of your free life isn't clear but as we noted this is not irrational individual and it's clearly somebody who should not have been running around loose\nOr the laws should reflect the fact that there are some people out there who have no damn business walking the streets\nAnd obviously you've got to have more precise language the mat and obviously this treads into areas that need to be very carefully explored with precisely written laws but nonetheless that needs to be done\nWe should not just sit back and give people every opportunity in the world to keep trying and trying and trying again and again and finally we say oh okay you've done enough damage or\nWe are lucky that this did not involve anything that was fatal Steven\nAnd you're in North Carolina on the jumbo hand and she'll get evening Steve\nThis gym but I have three little comments here ah and\n... to me what's going to be important here is I mean we had one that that is that where I'm a disturbed person was trying to kill as many\nAnd would have if it hadn't been put capital Capitol police but many Congress Senate settled there as\nPossible um which was a Bernie Sanders follower ah it would have been just that very steep but to blame that I'll ah or try to attack that al ...\nOr the ... the deal with a party or the ... that was decided to show up with a gun that day and start start proudly kill people\nExactly how I I certainly say that it will be quite fair\nA to a place blame on the like let's say of the mass and ... thugs or and or people who go round committing vandalism and attacking other individuals they certainly set an example and uh I'm happy to pass blame for something like that in that direction\nBut no Bernie Sanders no Bernie Sanders is not the kind of go goes around shooting people who would encourage people to shoot other people are engaging in the act of violence I disagree with Bernie Sanders on almost every issue of the day except that he's relatively moderate on guns\nBut ah that fact and I was standing Bernie Sanders is not a terrorist so you're right\nIn my second thing with the and this is just foods the salt and I've I've thought about this that that I'm\nHeaded banned the of course we don't know all the details of this yet so things are going to come out I Believe that had it fan or the other way around\nOne of our other way around ... you mean had it been somewhat from the left who did this\nAttacking Republicans ... ... republic as Bob where it's not very long that guy that was a the male and a lot of uh what rights than a or something that was\nPlenty out there in their head back to various incidents of a of a genuine poisons that were mailed yes\nYes but anyway if it had been the other way around that this was a\nFull fledged a left is\nThat with sending bombs to wear what the the storyline they now on the news would they go back and say that\nThat statement from Maxine Waters or Hillary Clinton about being syllable or kick them when they die out you know\n... down right at that as a reference to ah Eric Holder you're right\nYeah would that go back and take the ball I put that\nKnow how the short answer is a clear and it is obvious no they would not it is a double standard in and there's only one of scores of such a double standards that exist out there there is a blatant\nAnd a deep seated biased against Donald Trump and ... in particular and Republicans in general is reflected in the media today and that's just a fact and you can find countless examples to prove that you're exactly right\nUh that double standard would prevail without any question whatsoever\nAnd and again how many people have come out and and and uh assailed antifa from the left how many I mean I don't I don't remember ever hearing any of these principles people here that the Schumer is the pillows these the Feinstein's the Clintons anybody you know why 'cause they're scared to death\nOf the the left wing of the Democratic party that's that's why [noise] uh so I think your points are well taken Steve and yes there is a double standard time and sharing
