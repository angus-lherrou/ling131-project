{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "Better than than there Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nOkay Dave so before I found you at the beginning of this year I impulse to and purchased a ridiculous\nCar [laughter] and and as soon as I found you I was like crap [laughter] oh what'd you bought\nWe bought a two thousand ... most of the fix with all the bells and whistles\nSo we eat yeah well not for ... 'cause my pocket hurts\nYeah well I guess but I mean the cars great now okay\nOh yeah so what what do you owe on a similar thing we'll thirty five thousand mhm okay and what's your house hand them\nThis year will be making sixty sixty five maybe touching Seventy depending on my overtime oh yeah there's just saying you know\nSo that and I'm next year the beginning of the Fifteen Percent raise plus another five percent ... down the road yeah I'm so here's my age I'm calling to see if you what if you're OK with this uh me and my wife finally agreed to let it go good and sell it good it's worth Twenty one thousand\nOh God yeah see ... down into it or died that bad\nYeah and I that that it only took like three months good lord so Twenty one guy on trade in yes well I mean you know twenty three on private sale\nSomething that that's not enough says the spread on ... so you're saying this car went from thirty five thousand uh twenty three thousand and one year\nActually technically it was forty thousand two thirty five thousand I I also canceled the warranty on it\nKind of ... we had a extending warranty yeah and and we found out that it's funny how when you pay off vehicle or you reached\n... miles all of a sudden a it starts to fail on you and the aren't cheese ... you know 'cause you or did it\nThe cars one of them are old\nAnd I almost a year old yeah\nAll right so yeah when you get rid of this thing for so many reasons so so what's your plan\nFinance on me and my wife is looking around and we saw some four thousand five thousand dollar a cars I'm I could save up that money and I already have it by next income refund but what I was thinking is because our monthly payment for the throughout the whole month and it's like eight hundred dollars\nSo because I also have a student loan and assume famous I won't succeed but almost done with that only have like six thousand dollars left over\nSo what what it might just go ahead and sell this car mhm by all the difference and then go to the guy who are on the car that showing for like four or five thousand dollars and just make payments off for like a hundred bucks and the monthly payment will go down to four hundred dollars to making a mess\nMhm yeah I mean to be okay with them yeah sure but I I I'm not sure I understood how your financing your second car the ... to ... uh the five thousand dollar car that you're buying how you financing it\nThey'll just go on me it just like you know just like if you're going to go buy a car for a little down payment on it oh okay I Know where the you know what I mean\nYou know that's fine if you can just get a regular car loan on it that's fine let's do that because we're still reducing your debt by house\nYou're right\nAnd um by doing this and then you can concentrate on getting that car paid off and then getting the whole that your dog with this other car which is absolutely horrendous it's a great car I'm surprised that thing has dropped that foreign value\nUm I think real sure you got your numbers right on that 'cause I I mean I [noise] the cars are horrible as far as going down in value I get it I I'm I'm a card guy but they and they go down in value rapidly but that one is like a black hole for money on or something like that's incredible\nWhat a horrible horrible\nCar on holding his values so check that and make sure your number your numbers are a little high on terms of lost money I think you maybe you haven't lost his much I'm hoping you lost as much as you think you've lost\nSo let's dig into that a little bit further and you do not want to sell it to a dealer at wholesale you want to sell it private sales it should be in this situation about a five thousand dollar difference\nIn other words you should be able to get five or more out of the show\nAnd probably show than you would from a dealer on something that expensive um show really check those numbers I'm not sure you've got correct stuff there but wow water that gum kicking the teeth man you got hammered amazing\nGood luck with it but yes I Would get out of it for sure it's too much car it's a mess it's going down in value it's breaking them

to get very involved in policymaking to view themselves as a lifetime tenure an unelected legislature and yet on something like this they're shy about sticking their toe in the waters that's a\nA rather interesting and shall we say selective form of a of a cautionary behavior here this is why they're supposed to be ruling this is where they're supposed to step in and and the and actors government's homebuyer calling the balls and strikes this is constitutional let us not\nYeah that's exactly right actually there are there the way I look at it in the way I describe it in the book is that they're really two ways that the courts intervene one is looking at whether legislation is constitutional in the sense that it\nComports with the language of the constitution and the other way is whether the the legislation\nIs ... with the structure of the constitution and the way that does the frame or is designed our government was to separate legislative activities which were done by Congress and Congress alone\nAdministrative activities which were done by the president and the administrative agencies of\nOf the executive branch and the judiciary which was the third part and was to interpret the laws but one of the things I point out in this book that I don't think others have really noticed is that the the frame or is expected that the judiciary would act to make sure that\nThe separation of powers was observed and that Congress was continuing to make the laws\nNot the the executive branch making the laws but Congress making the laws and the executive branch was only ... acting according to laws and powers that had been granted by Congress the judiciary has failed to do that\nThey try to do that during the new deal\nIn Nineteen Seventy in Nineteen thirty five to decisions were made by the Supreme Court that pointed to cut a couple of decisions of the of the Congress at that time which seemed to give too much power to the president or they notified those decisions but\nIn Nineteen thirty six Roosevelt had a landslide victory\nAnd shortly after that he proposed that there'll be seven new justices added to the Supreme\nCourt packing game\nThe court packing scheme and I'll do it failed\nIt the ... the court and the court from that point on never again challenged a decision made by Congress or in the sense that it was violating the structure of the constitution by delegating legislative authority to the executive branch\nWell it certainly have a long memory that was eighty years ago every single one of the people involved in that controversy is dead\n[laughter] it's ... it's the fact is that this is a difficult decision for the courts and the books the title of the book is judicial fortitude and it comes from a ... a statement made by

I got to say it's about time and the thank goodness for Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute\nWho's the website intimately as their initials H. E. I. dot org somebody needs to be done about this tendency of Congress to pass the buck to the other like the bureaucrats and those three letter agencies and elsewhere but the three letters or a good place to start\nOf a centrally writing general outlines of laws and\nThe ... the agency spilling the details right the laws and a right and I'm going to be done about that uh we have a call from dark who calls in from Wilmington, Delaware to speak with our guests are Peter Wallison and to give me ... welcome\nThank you for taking my call is August ... just a one or two quick questions for his team atrocity all hell just set aside less than a course as always\nMr Austin where you see this court has under President Trump on her opportunity under us as a score such conduct Kavanaugh and if there is no justice appointed us to a second trumped or what you just wanted\nTo see this court finally turning back to the ... out of the cameras are not are you hopeful for the future outs are what are your thoughts on that sir\nYou did you have two questions that that was just that was\n... where do you see the court going on to these justices and for the future that we could turn back the tide of I Would say almost fifty years\nAll right very good at what drives you to be going in other words I yeah I Will go to Jim Cavanaugh tipped the balance and to actually show some judicial booted dude\nYeah I actually think that uh this is very very hopeful\nI at in the book I talk about the position of each of the justices but I say that with the appointment of Kavanaugh there are five justices on the court who I think are ready to modify some of the major decisions that have led us to this\nPosition I'm the one that is most important here is one called ... the Chevron case or Chevron deference where the court many years ago in Nineteen eighty four\nA declared that the lower court had to defer to the to the interpretations of various agencies of what powers they had been given by Congress that's very strange because it\nLeaves the courts out entirely and so that that\nDecision in particular has been a warrant for the agencies to increase their powers tremendously and interpret the authorities that they had gotten from Congress or to grow their powers now with Kavanaugh there\nHe's a constitutional list he's a text you list just just\nLike Gorsuch is and the other three people including especially Justice Thomas who I I dedicated the book too because he has always been concerned about this question\nLot of support from people outside the trouble is that they are not making the tough decisions they have to be forced to make the tough decisions\nAnd the way to do that I think is for the courts to say you ... you cannot pass this kind of authority to an executive agency if you want for example clean water\n'em you can't just say make the water clean you have to decide who is going to have to pay the cost of that and who is going to be allowed to use the water and for what purposes all of those things\nAre the major decisions that have to be made by Congress and to the extent that they are passed on to administrative agency it's not it isn't the way decisions should be made\nA democracy and it's easy for Congress than to ah when their constituents complain about the regulations the congressman says oh well I didn't vote for that\nRight at the administrative agency exactly why they avoid all accountability\nHas will deniability as we go to another call here let me ask you about the prospects for this article five\nConstitutional convention of the states it would seem to me that that the the things that could be taken up there aside from term limits as was mentioned by Sharon but other things that my directly address this and that is to say to a force on our various elements of government or the these are the rules and ... they will be followed\nYeah the trouble is I I'm not for a constitutional convention because I I'm afraid that these things can run away we have a wonderful system today if it is made to work\nProperly or if the reason the reason I say this is the last chance to rein in the administrative state is because um it is a chance and it is a good chance and it will work if we only get the court to take\nIt if if we only good I Would add one noticed we go to that the call and that would be ah ah the fact\nThat a a run away or a convention strikes me as highly unlikely because one ever came out I'm such a convention would not go into the constitution until thirty eight states ratified it and it's highly unlikely the thirty eight states would go along with anything too weird\n[noise] uh yeah and that it's entirely possible but we don't actually know what kinds of changes might come out and they could change that could change the constitution entirely and be a government that we would not recognize\nWell they've already said he went along with it if thirty eight states went along with it yeah\nWell yes I mean yes that is possible and maybe it'll never happen but the the the point is that if we have this convention will be spending a lot more time I'm Talking about the convention and arguing about the convention rather than doing this simple thing that\nWe could do by having the court step in and force Congress to do with\nIf if if they would uh I'm not optimistic but uh but we shall see Lowell in Longview, Texas was a low low\nHello sir and I don't care you you and your guests have made me happiest I've been in a long time well okay I Am not a not a fan\nThat means fanatic I Am an admirer and thank you I think that your guest Peter has to find something that most people don't even know the history of it and I can allow recruiters to science I can there's any body as anybody recognize\nWhere I used the words their auction and cabinet came from ... what was it again the war the very worst bureaucracy bureaus and casting\nA vote I Know I I I'm not aware of perhaps you are and what where does the words come from\nIt came from the French uh-huh mhm\nAnd and have a an end in sight and other items are\nHave been handed Raul they and they didn't know how to govern so if you're a bureau is actually a cabinet\nOr I guess I Am I missing the significance of this piece of furniture\nI Know it's a piece of furniture but why does that have any bearing other than the sum it up and I'm a logical game of um you know where the word came from I'm not sure how this scientific and we'll\nTalk about a deep state and what they did was they let that picked a bureau parental there's another girl to ... run down today we use a bureau bureaucracy in a cabin what he's saying essentially is the fact that a bureaucrat can create a new law\nAnd unfortunately in today's world\nYou could use a computer model okay well just buy them\nBy like our guest to comment on this I I'm not sure exactly what the significance of that the origin of the terms is although I'm certainly not in favor of the unelected setting policy of Peter\nWell bureaucracy really is a combination of two words the bureau that's right and then they eat the thought was not the desk but actually a un agency that a bureau and crises is mean means government\nAnd this is government by the bureau rather than government by the people and that is what we should be leery of and afraid of because that sort of thing is is it means that we no longer are in control of the laws and regulations that we have to live under\nExec Robert in night yeah go go ahead and then we'll take the call from\nRaw just wanted to mention one thing is I'm not sure people understand how many rules there are\nEvery year in the past twenty five years there had been twenty five there had been three thousand regulations coming out of the government every year it that's over a hundred and one thousand regulations just in the last twenty five years so it's out of control\nYeah and it certainly hasn't hit someone has to step in and rein it in and that can be done\nYes well it it can be if people are if people decide to or if they're forced to Robert in Burlington, Vermont hello\nGood evening or two things one of the other and I used to tell me about the constitution the you know they they left off of close to the living and changeable a document\nWell out of the comments that I made were in regard to those with that viewpoint that to the constitution a is a a document that we can make up as we go along if we don't have the like what's in it it's not a view I happened to share but the law people who follow that was ...\nI just thought they would be the fact is is yes it does it change will document the only the voters of the country are allowed to change\nWell no actually the voters of the country don't have any direct say so in changing it there are methods that involve both ah ah usually we abuse the constitution the Congress although the the the conventions can also be the method is proposing a constitutional amendments and then ratification could take place\nThere were three quarters of the state legislatures or through a a convention held at three quarters of the states the voters per se do not have a direct say so except insofar as they elect the people who do have a say so a breeder\nOr that that ... exactly right that had to have a system with ...\nUm but it it's a important just to understand we have the ... that the procedures in place the mechanism in place to govern ourselves and we are not allowing it to happen we're allowing the government to slip away\nOut of their hands into the hands of bureaucrats in Washington yeah that's the problem\nThat is the problem but of course it's a problem that will not be going away until the people who are quite happy with this system are forced to to change their ways will be back with more in just a moment\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home here dancing on the cars would be covered and talked to

because they're afraid it's going to be a runaway convention the problem is that we have a runaway federal government that spends more money than it takes in every day right and uh constantly threatens our individual rights [noise]\nUh well we yeah we we have a have sort of gone over the the pros and cons of of that particular\nSubject in a sense it's not the central to the book to Peter road I'm not sure that there's much more that we can say about that there are are differing opinions on the advise ability or they're in a uh I Would share Peters optimism regarding\nA the makeup of this court ... with one or with one copy I've to Peter and that would be that I think that there is a working majority on the court\nTo push Congress in this direction provided the rights case is brought a report can't just move on its own are there to your knowledge in the cases in the pipeline that could wind up before the court\nYes actually there was one argument on October second of this year\nUm the the ... case it was called I won't go into all the details but it was a question of whether to much authority had been granted by Congress to the attorney general in punishing people who are sexual offenders\nAnd the ... it is a is a very very narrow case but the kind of case where the Supreme Court can and after listening to the argument I think they will\nSay that the that this was a delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch that was unconstitutional\nThat opens a very narrow little niche into which the court can later expand but it would be the first time since Nineteen\nThirty five where the court has actually taken that position and you're listening to the arguments in that case it's possible we will have a five to three or six to outcome that does that well\nWe'll five to four or five to four or six to three I was not an capitals Kavanaugh was not the ... so it would be and they made the ... and I see All right Howard in North port Florida good evening Howard\n... good evening Jell O a couple of points if I lay out to be careful of it is not a I'm a constitutional convention which I have heard reference it is a convention of the states\nThat is a described under article five and to describe it as a house or she'll convention is is ...\nWell he would be accurate him so far as its purpose would be to propose amendments to the constitution and again we're getting off the medics for one thing because that is exactly what it would be a convention to propose amendments to the constitution and number two that is the central pieces of the book put forward by\nPeter Wallison we've had our discussion on the subject or we agree to disagree on the viability of the advice of building of such an action or in summary with about a a little over another minute to go here or there are other points in the book judicial fortitude that we've not touched on that you would like to mention\nUm I I think actually done a very good job of of raising the major issues I think it's just very important for people to understand that for a government to have legitimacy\nUm people the people who elect that government must believe that they have the ability to influence it and that's where I'm worried that the American people are losing losing the sense that Congress is listening to them I think that maybe the election of Donald Trump\nWas called up populist uprising I I I Believe it was but one of the reasons was I think that many people did not believe that the government in Washington was under their control and if we lose that sense if the American people lose that sense well then we become\nA a a country where the laws don't mean anything anymore because there's no moral authority for laws that are made by people who you don't elect\nTo do and and the gross national cynicism or it could be pushed right through the roof if we don't remedy this uh if you want to remedy at a great place to start with Peter Wallison book

from the helicopter law\nSo it's getting worse it's helicopter parents on steroids\n... Zachary exactly\nWow All right let's let's talk more about that in the company of among others that tonight the dog who calls him from Albany, Oregon at the weather channel and even though and a good area uh doing fine thank you\nYou're in great myself I just got to say the helicopter and a warm or parents down by the parents are we're glad they have their children grow up poor ... bubbles Tibet responsible\nWhether or not you know I don't think you're you're ... exaggerating entirely too much they're a dichotomy there are some practicalities of course involved in that but I ah Dr Huber I I think that a dog maybe closer to the literal truth and he'd like to think he is your thoughts Dr\nI I think he's exactly correct\nUnfortunately what that ... is a an adult who is dependent upon the world for things and not just the permit that completely entitled they deserve this and you know I was taught right off day one I don't deserve anything I have to earn stuff to to get anywhere in this world\nYou know what one would would certainly hope that that was the case I Would I Would like to think Russia to your your thoughts on because I I think that it probably comes close\nTo me right now uh you know I I keep I keep hearing about about people like this I'm not sure that that I Know of any of these people granted I'd I I don't ... the young people I Know my my that my my definition I'm Talking about a\nA parent's today's parents who are generally a course in their uh their their twenties and thirties and some of their forties\nOr the ones I Know which are not a a wide swath of humanity they're they're very definitely not in this category uh I mean they they do discipline their children their children are expected to do certain things and just set includes bumps grapes\nA failures are picking yourself a dusting yourself off and and the whole learning experience is there any kind of a\nOf originality about this or a geographic concentration because I don't know that I have never actually met a helicopter parent much less a lawnmower parent\n[laughter] well I don't think it's necessarily originality I mean I I taught university from Nineteen Ninety six into two thousand the Seventeen and one of the reasons why I was glad to to step away from that was probably the last four\nYears I we get calls from parents going what do you mean my travel got us thirty on their tests and I go well I Can't even confirm at your kids in my class and they would blow up and like what do you mean I go well you know there are actually federal laws against that they're they're adults I Can't disclose anything you know\nAnd you know it used to be when I got a thirty on a on a test I was in trouble today the teachers in trouble\nYes at at the university level not even at the high school level\n[noise] wow uh I had\nOne flew flew in from New Jersey to Texas to to talk with me [laughter] about their child's grade [laughter]\nWhat a good heavens it well but that that does almost daily literal helicopter or this case an airline and I guess a remarkable hour ride a Greg in Springfield, Missouri joins us on the jumbo hadn't show with\nThe clinical forensic psychologist Dr John Huber a good evening Greg\nI mean in a one\nMan here no [noise]\nNo [noise]\nIn general have a job one eight six six five oh jumbo when eight six six five oh five or six to six yeah it's\nA situation that's recognized in pop culture and uh we talk about it sometimes we think about it but are are we doing enough about this a tendency of not producing tomorrow's grownups this was a very troublesome century with all kinds of challenges that face the society\nAnd we are assuming we the grown ups that we are producing a generation prepared to follow and pick up the rains and in some cases big up the pieces of things that we've broken we expect the next generation to be able to\nSoldier on and maybe they can and maybe they can Dr John Huber is our guest teased in Austin, Texas based clinical forensic psychologist he chairs made ... mental health\nDot org and we're looking at helicopter parents now in some cases transforming into law and more parents how long would you say the helicopters slash law and more parenting\nA trend has has gone on now how many years roughly\nI Would say probably ... I started seeing at the university probably you're up for years about about Thirteen twenty Thirteen so uh it started about Eighteen years before that I Would say\nYou know when when those parents top those kids to be that way and I started my career as a school psychologist so in in the early nineties I started seeing my kids my kids would have problems in school and our classrooms\nAnd I would do my psychological assessment and say okay here's what we need to do to help this child\nLearn\nAnd by the time I was through being that I was burnt out on being a school psychologist the parents were come in and go well you know I just want them to pass I wanted to have a high GPA and right you know I'm like well we want them to learn and they're like no no no you don't understand I just want you know yeah ed and\nEd's aren't that they know somebody will put them in a in a building that has books in it and maybe by us most of the some of the knowledge will sort of under their little heads [noise] gosh that's ... that's just a salary so I guess the point I'm making your as we go to another call would be that uh it's been around long enough\nThat there are now such people who have been dumped out into the cold cruel world\nYou have to do it or they are they all living in their parents' basement unable to cope are they speaking out to those safe spaces or\nHave they acquired overnight a sudden resilience that was not taught to the dream of formative years\nYou know that that's interesting and it's interesting jam 'cause my practice down here and it's it's me and another another psychologist\nAnd the people to work with us but we're the main people and we have an actual contract with a company that that's what they do is they get these kids that they're actually calling failure to launch kids you know just like the movie that you\nKnow and we've had a forty year old who was sitting there was Seventy year old parents who won't\nGet up out of the bedroom and off the computer games and and PlayStation\nAnd won't go out and get a job and and socialize and uh we test them do psychological tests in and see whether there's a a mental health reason or cognitive reason for why they're failing and it's a surprising number of adults that\nHave come to the system that there's not a whole lot I mean it's not like the thousands of kids who go through you know the local high school every every day but it's surprisingly a large number a and I sit down with their their parents say okay what we need to do is you know cut off the Internet\nYou know do you guys you use it all know we we have cable ... will cut off the Internet part of it\nYou know [laughter] and then I but but then he'll be upset\nOh my heavens yes maybe he will\nThat is incredible we in other words we have produced a generation of parents who are apparently qualified to be parents only in the sense that they can reproduce in other words they they have the same parenting skills as an amoeba\nHere you're inside is an astounding I Love that\nYeah yeah and how sad thank you how we got a call from Linda in northeastern Ohio joins ... a good evening Lyndon welcome to the gym ... with\nDr John Huber hello\nHello lender\nYeah listen to your conversation about\nKids dealing with kids and now I was on Facebook on myself and I'm One of the guys come on he said he's a teacher\nAnd he goes I got a problem is ... ... kids that are really really upset they were upset whenever Donald Trump wine they were crying and carry on and then he gets now they're really upset because\nKavanaugh is confirmed for ... and he says I just don't know what to do with and they're also upset\nWondering if they're really upset I mean I I personally with those but I mean they ought to your they ought to do what any grown up with do okay let's organized will look will become politically active will elect people with whom we agree\nI think he was they might have been younger students in school but the thing about it is I think I told him I ... a lot of places where the problem with these kids they don't have a problem solve number two they don't know anything about elections you know somebody ... had the process\nAnd they used to teach civics them in such a moron [laughter] yeah I I had that that they do that's also part of the problem\nYeah but but what you just said was very telling Linda they don't know how to problem solve commonwealth ... hill is the point of raising a kid if you do at the end of the day produced someone who can problem solve I mean right eye as true why have them I mean no seriously why\nKids are you can't just be doing it out of cruelty let's producer a human being who will ... failed miserably who will ... life and and do all we can to to had to get them and nobody says that you know what they're doing\nThe guy the guy said it made it sound like the kids have no future now that well Republicans are running the country or\n... again I mean it's it's if you want to have that view that you're perfect right as an American so do you think about it does suck your thumb right in ... Oregon I it's I mean I I ... I Will be out there for you and I hope that I don't step on your precious little self esteem\nBut that's one of the political debates all about if you feel that way they do something about an all out\nI went into this whole still ISIS problem is that the school she took control your kids you know they became the parents\nAnd medication that but not say anything or not going to any PTA meetings the way they used to in place there you know\nWell and if they do go to complain about the about their kids on what our guest to comment of what ... does that say which I think it's a lot a doctor uber\n[noise] she she has said a lot and there's a lot of validity to that the schools\nYou know they they used to be locally controlled and now they're they're nationally controlled and just like what what they need in in their state in in California or Washington state\nIs different than what they need in Florida and Texas and Georgia and New York straight you know we need to I think my at history of the school psychologist tells me we need to go back and let the states\nStarts setting a the standards of what their kids need to learn their at because our federal government has dropped out of the picture as far as you know they don't even requires ... recommend spell any more national education agency says we don't have to worry about spelling anymore 'cause everything has spell check from them\nAnd you know no more curse of language that you don't have to learn to write in cursive well she can't write encouraged to recap reading her so so\nHow are we supposed to go back and actually individually read the magna Carter or the constitution or the bill of rights and its original format to know that that's really what our founding fathers wrote\nYeah how indeed pretty ordinary yeah more to come but at the our number again one eight six six by boat jumbo will continue adjustable but\nI used to ... let me to be overwhelmed with resume which made it easy to miss a great candidate that whole process was not smart then I went to zip recruiter gets technology find the right people and actively invite Spencer apply so I get qualified candidates fast smart\n... read it never went by employees in the U.S right now for free at ... dot com slash free that ... dot com slash free the smartest way to hire based on trust rating hiring cyber went as we get into that as racetrack [noise]\nThe program on Saturdays like every day we or your information station the voice of Charleston five eighty WC age as I\nAm I going to point five FM Charleston\nFive FM roughly West Virginia video corporation\nStation twelve o'clock\nOn ABC News\nI'm Richard Harris who was left of Michael is raining itself out over the middle of language states now\nFlash flood watches up from southern New England back through the Carolinas a lot of rain a lot of wind with is entering Virginia after midnight it gets into southern parts of New Jersey I'm heavy coastal range for eastern New England in eastern Long Island they'll get a piece of that here in the storms out a couple of dry days as they continue this very daunting cleanup and recovery effort\nABC News meteorologist Rob Marcy on all throughout Alabama Florida Georgia the Carolinas and Virginia roughly one point two million homes and businesses don't have electric power six deaths are blamed on the storm\nFor a second straight daily us stock indices last substantial ground Dow losing another five hundred and forty six points on top of Wednesday's eight hundred thirty when we lost the NASDAQ lost another Ninety three red McBride bank right dot com says hold your water\nBraces volatility use it as a buying opportunity a friday it's going to be paid a for a lot of people and that means that four one K. contribution to go do a lot further this payday than it did last pay day so you know think of it in that context if you maintain that long term perspective you know the markets effectively on sale\nThe Washington state Supreme Court unanimously struck down that state's death penalty eight condemned inmates getting their death sentences converted to life in prison governor Jay Inslee\nToday the quarter from that indeed the Washington death penalty system has been arbitrary and racially biased and its application and they have ended it immediately there'd\nBeen a governor imposed moratorium on executions in Washington since ... fourteen staying warm this whether it will be more expensive proposition heat with oil the government says you'll pay twenty percent more this winter\nA majority of the country with natural gas and those bills will be five percent higher L.

great candidate that whole process was not smart then I went to Africa it's technology find the right people tend to lean\nIt's because of it and it sounds to me that there is a whole generation not everybody in the generation but but I ate a major subset of this generation the parents engaged in such behavior as if they never thought about it\nAs I say it is difficult for me to even conceive of any parent who who thought about this for more than twenty seconds to not be able to figure out that this was a terrible thing you're doing you're setting up your children to fail\nWhy would a parent what to do that I mean\nI guess if if you're not very bright\nYou could convince yourself not me but maybe you could convince yourself that you're being compassionate my child will not ever stop there do they will learn nothing I Will see to it that they go through Eighteen years of the formative life and learn nothing yet\nBecause every chance they had to learn out getting away and make sure that they don't learn except maybe they learn that a mommy and daddy will always be there to make it all better\nNot the way it's supposed to be and again I Am sure that not every parent does this I Know a few parents in that age group not a lot but the ones I Know\nActually raise their kids with discipline and with standards of performance and with punishment for when they they've followed by the side with\nCorrective behavior all the things that are yes hassles into and sometimes even painful for the parents but that's what you signed up for when you when you reproduce don't mean yeah you're having a kid this is what you're supposed to do\nTerrible singers with their swiveling hips and their Greece back here and the like yeah yes we did survive and that's very true now but I was just loading a and of course the purpose of that song was to point out that to do a certain extent\nEvery generation of the parents abuse their kids with a rather skeptical why\nBut today we got and got a reason to view the or the parents with a skeptic alive\nOkay but it was like well I called for a little bit ...\nYes well I I I Believe this way I can I can recall vividly my days of of watching the king and uh yes at the time it did seem rather bizarre but uh you know we pretty much turned out I think okay so thanks for sharing that added the quarterly the Idaho you're on the program really like\nA good evening Jim you know your monologue was spot on and we've talked before a I'm a six year old high school teacher and I've been teaching her coaching she was like all my life\nAnd a lot of this I feel stands out of the great society and that can't be in a free the than you know I've watched it through the seventies and eighties and nineties there on it today\nWhat I see a lot of that and I have a little bit of a saying that for several generations now you've had kids having kids who have no parenting skills no ability to to you know raise kids correctly frequently the kids are conceived than an intoxicated have with the first question being\nHow that happened the second question being are you sure it's mine\nAnd these parents gay sex that they don't have the skill I see it every day\nUh you know they want to be their friends they want to be the buddies they wanna you know they don't want to be a parent whether like you say they discipline the kids when they do things wrong they show the kids right from wrong I talk to my kids in class all the time about going out and getting a job and if you make your\nYour boss is going to worry whether you like your boss or not you're not\nYou but your boss better like you say if you don't like your boss you're going out the door and you know I talked about\nEffort and behavior and the expectations and if you don't meet the expectations there's going to be consequences and they're meant to be uncomfortable and I ever read you know I have two groups of people ... won\nThe kids and parents who liked me because I Am that way\nAnd the other group ... literally hates me because they get consequences when they don't meet expectations and it is just getting worse and worse\nYeah and that's the sad part and they do seem to be getting worse and worse as if somehow you we all wish really hard life will not be difficult and the real world will somehow get by without having standards\nThe real world will suddenly started giving everybody a trophy or something I guess it's a little hard to figure out where these people are coming from\nA okay let's see here we've got a Larry in Silver Spring Maryland up next and hello Larry\nHello jumbo and I feel that doctors pain it down in Texas the forensic psychologist I enjoyed him very much I to talk of college\nI started at age fifty one in two thousand one I had my last class in twenty twelve or here in D.C district a Washington I was at a place I call one percent university where the kids were bubble wrapped\nAt adult children they uh uh I Would discuss things with a woman who is a great grandmother who I admired but a surrogate mother mind so to speak\nAnd she ... she would say what those parents what if the parents are doing the right thing and it also [noise] uh I just want the doctor and know that I had a people come into my class the parents\nWhen I first started teaching down in Florida\nAnd they would walk in and they had the kids paper to kid couldn't deliver to whatever the first thing they look at me like it was like a a rookie baseball manager with a Joe ... the great empire\nThe veteran umpire and they would look at me and ah we're not helicopter parents but here's my kids paper they would just look I was older than they were so it always felt that way but I\nHave my moments with the kids and uh I saw the decline that I don't know I'd like to hear the doctor used the term lawnmower parents that was too much and I I just say there's two types of people in the world adults and adult children\nAnd one of my friend since fifty says kid went off to college for orientation anyone with him I said what I said oh that's odd because I started for college in Nineteen sixty seven went from New England out to a Ohio\nI went alone folks gave me a plane ticket will see it a few days son off I went made my mistakes allowed to fail the stupid things not the illegal but uh I learned out and my friend who just had his kids start like four or five years ago a yes\nOr you're the only parent there no parents all the kids are there I said oh boy [noise]\nYou know it down just\nSell the man out there the good doctor the forensic psychologist in Texas I he's probably still listening and I was laughing out loud [laughter] more than I have all day I read\nI like to laugh but I I was talking with your producer Cathy issues explains she's got kids in college it sounds like it's going okay there but it was so bad and my one of my last classes at a call one percent university no names here I said to the kids I said man up woman up to the class they did not like me\nBut they were just it was you know is when you have everything given to you and you just your Google smart and that's\nWhy I mean and you are enough yeah yeah I don't blame you Larry I I think you I commend you for doing what you did it probably was an active uh courage quite frankly to do a stand up and not to go with the trend of a couch do every little\nWhim of their self esteem one eight six six five oh Jim bowl we go to John in the sea bring Florida now Hello John welcome\nOh just laugh at your last caller right there you know the women ...
