well\n[noise] I have not\nOkay and uh because ... and so what we have always suggested that I don't sell any of this I don't give a crap but here's the math on it I have found that a Fifteen to twenty year level term policy locks in and gives you less expensive term insurance\nAnd when you invest the money directly into the mutual fund you don't have the extra fees and you get a better net of fees return\nThat makes sense and plus when you die with the Wii U L they're going to pay the face and keep your investment that's the worst part of it\nSo it's a horrible plane when you die but uh it's

it cast the Paul ... a change over a presidency and I would think that that alone might be enough to get Republicans to turn out to vote\nYes and that ... that is shared I think by as many people are

get through a democratically controlled Senate or a democratically controlled house ah I'm not sure ah as far as I'm concerned ah the entire a Trump agenda is is dead until uh the ... elections\nI think that's probably true I think that for Democrats all the political incentives are lined up toward opposing President Trump to the maximum extent possible I don't really see any significant reason why Democrats from their own perspective would support President Trump\nYeah people have talked about the idea that he could reach across the aisle there was a pretty face when he was talking\nAnd quite friendly or fashion I buy a Chuck and Nancy ... to say that was pretty short lived I'm not sure I see that a atmosphere adopt our reach coming back again pretty quickly even if Democrats do take

east and the U.S global economy experiencing record growth\nThe demand for crude oil continues to soar if you're an accredited investors are looking to invest at least one hundred thousand dollars you can take advantage of these rising oil prices\nA there's an attempt to bring peace and prosperity to the whole world but but but by conquering it in and forcing a single point of view on on everybody and uh the idea of the the national states\nUh which is an idea that comes down to us actually from from the Bible rather than from Greek or Rome and\nSources um it's it's an idea that seeks the midpoint the place exactly in the middle between those two extremes and it so it it seeks to allow on the one hand\nOr a sphere of internal domestic peace and Trent tranquility\nAnd on the other on the other hand\nSelf determination that each each nation will have its its own religious and national unconstitutional traditions each nation will be an experiment in what it means for human beings to live and so it'll it'll be different from from all of the others\nAnd that means exactly as you say that it's always attacked from above by imperialists and from below by tribal is to want to break it up and turn it into tiny little pieces\nBoat problem of course uh we have today is a lot of countries especially a third world countries\nWere founded based not on anything that approach they a rational look at the constituent parts but simply on\nHow far this or that European explore managed to to go and so you have of course uh Iraq for example\nAre put together as a chunk of bill Ottoman Empire that included a a Shia and Sunni and an element of Kurds just for for a for good measure and the ... these are our our loyalties go far deeper I think until maybe ... years and then the Iraqi national consciousness\nUh maybe there's no better example no more no more virulent example the Nigeria\nWhere a British explores managed to do covered territory that included an awful lot of very hostile plans and where tens of thousands of people killed each other over the years so\nSo certainly some nation states don't seem to be a very well constituted they seemed to be a victim of borders that or shall we say we're a rather arbitrarily chosen\nYeah I'd I'd I I definitely agree with your your examples I Would I Would just say that uh I I I think it's important ... it's important to try to understand what a what a nation is in Iraq is not a nation\nOr because a ... a a nation and we have a a long history of in in western political thought of of people are important thinkers trying to understand what a nation is\nAnd as you say a country like Iraq or a or Syria or Yugoslavia or Nigeria or the Congo all of these are examples of states\nOr the ... somebody gave them a national flag you know they they were the vampires that constructed them a arbitrarily with in an arbitrary borders they got a national flag and the national anthem but uh nobody was was looking to try to understand where the border would have to be in order for\nUh to create a cohesive\nUh country cook cohesive is said Jon Stewart mills word and all it means is that that the people living in the country have to feel and mutual loyalty that holds them together and ah and and and and makes them want to fight together against against their enemies\nSo if you if you look at a place like Yugoslavia or Iraq you'll see that there simply is no internal cohesion because of the borders were not drawn on the basis of trying to figure out where the nations\nAre in fact actually just the opposite if if you wanted to take Syria and and Iraq and divide\nDivide those lands are into a into a cohesive nations you you could do it but the the imperial powers ah Britain and France when they do the borders they were they were interested in almost the opposite they they wanted divided populations to make it\nEasy too easy for them to rule as outsiders and so uh we're I I Would say that an important principle if if you are looking the world's are trying to get to\nIndependent nations that can be self determining can chart their own course is uh to understand that some countries have a have borders that really reflect\nI'm an overwhelming majority of of one kind of national\nGroup right and when when I when when I'm speaking of of a national group I'm not talking about biology or race I'm Talking about a a A N inherited a tradition characterized by language or religion and the history of mutual loyalty\nWhich is which which which allows the nation to to pursue projects together and to hold together and uh\nLike Iraq or Yugoslavia exactly the opposite it's uh people who have more reason to fear their their neighbors then to think that there are a single coherent\nUnity together with them and if we go to America\nI think it's very important to understand that the uh the what we've been seeing in recent years and in recent weeks\nIn the United states has a ... is is a a a frightening um a disintegration of the mutual loyalty that has traditionally held Americans together allowing them to see themselves as as one nation\nAnd that's probably the thing that's most uh most urgent for Americans today is to regain their nationalism which means they're national unity\nMore to come stay with us one eight six six Bible jumbo our guest is your Rob

Judy what eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six or John in Burlington, Vermont good evening\nBelieving I have a couple of comments or questions one of them are for your guest or in terms of the countries of let's say China or Iran and North Korea which of those do you think best exemplifies his theory\n[noise]\nAre you asking me yes oh yes he is the questions are addressed you yes\nWell I I I think the questions that we should look for in a world of independent nations they're not all going to be nations that you like\nTo me that that that that's what independence means when you celebrate the fourth of July in the United states if if the Americans still do celebrate what you're saying is our country can chart its own course and the ... you can't you're not going to have England or China or Russia or anybody else dictate what we do\nKnow the theory of a world like that is is that different nations will have different forms of government some of them were not going to like\nSo you you you read a lot in in the American press these days about uh about a Hungary Poland Israel Italy criticizing these countries and saying well the that they're not they're not being government the way we want them to be governed\nBut that's exactly the point the point is that\nIf if America is going to be a nation state and national state and it doesn't want others to to interfere in its elections and to tell us what to do their part partly it has to allow other countries the freedom to determine their own course and so there's a certain ah humility\nAnd that saying we don't necessarily have the the answers that we can dictate to every other country in the world invading Iraq and uh helping determined that new constitution there didn't work out so well some may may be may be America doesn't have\nPat answers for every other country should be governed\nUh obviously quite quite frankly there are some countries out there that just really aren't aren't fit for self governance and it'd be kind of a free status or culturally they are simply unprepared for that the I Wonder if some languages even have the the word compromise in them I seriously doubt an Arabic includes the words you're ...\nOr because of of of the the the way that many aspects of their culture of proceeds so\nUh I think that there was a much greater recall probably for this kind of thing back when the United nations consisted of a a lot of Western European democracies and we're willing to look the other way for the the Soviet Union and then suddenly all they had the the big\nBreak out of a of a colonial as a a areas of became nations after the Nineteen sixties and we suddenly saw the the likes of Libya leading me the United Nations Human rights council\nAnd we realize that the the total ... of of the notion quite frankly I think the the the widespread growth of independent nations is probably what do the United nations\nBecause you you have within the United nations today what may be out of a hundred and Ninety some countries you've got maybe what\nFifty or sixty that could be considered the genuinely a a fit for free self governance\nYou know most of those countries but the ones that you're saying are are fit our our countries in which there is an overwhelming majority of a ... a a single national group within the country and uh the\nThe ones that are not said are you you you're talking to a large large portions of a of a Africa and Asia\nWell look at look at the leaders higher swaths of the predominantly Arabic countries from Morocco each word and then once you leave by the Arabic countries just going predominantly Islamic countries many of those are are very model ethically of one the culture and uh the the armpit of the planet\nI mean the whereas the United states relatively pluralistic place I mean\nI'm pretty sure that that's a that that is Sunni Arab propaganda\nIf you actually take most of those countries and take a look at what's in them or you'll see that they're not at all monolithic I mean in in North Africa you have thirty million Berbers who have their own language and their own culture and our suppressed\nIn in ... countries like a ... ...

book and I'd\nLike you to just address maybe a couple of points that uh we haven't gotten to that you think are very important\nSure okay go ahead oh I said\nWell if you were to pick a couple that I didn't get to do is to say those are things that are absent from the discussion that you'd like to be sure are included\nWell I think I I think that right now it it it's really a good idea to emphasize um uh to to to look at the question of tolerance or I I think probably\nMost of your listeners like me would would be real happy if they were living in a society that was\nA bit more tolerant of opposing views than than what it is that we're seeing these days\nAnd then the question is where does that come from um I I think often often people just a assume that you know that that\nIt's kind of like a universal thing that people just\nJust think oh well what what's a reasonable person a reasonable person is somebody who tolerates other people's points of view and and and there's a link to listen to them and to accept as you said that diversity in society but I I think it isn't true I think this idea to go through um\nSometimes it's very rapid changes from being tolerant to intolerance I'm as we're seeing right now and what what intolerance is it it's it's\nIt's about it's not just about people being being selfish and nasty intolerance is about thinking that there is\nThat there's absolutely obviously one reasonable answer and it makes me angry when when other people come up with a different answer and you start you start calling them names and he started saying\nWell those people who don't agree with me they're they're a deplorable or they're they're they're ignorant they're on and light there there is a liberal always word there in in in circulation right now\nAnd a big part of the the message of of nationalism is I see it is\nThat we we need to emphasize tolerating other other countries other forms of government that are not to our liking and that when we become that kind of tolerant person that'll help us with tolerating within our own societies\nUm people who would disagree with us I I think that's something that is desperately needed right now\nOkay are there are there are limits to that for example should the world is set by and watch the poll pot of kill millions in Cambodia\nI think that I I think there are obvious limit I mean it it's very hard to find somebody who who will say well if there if there's a genocide going on\nAnd hundreds of thousands or millions of people are are are are being killed than you you're you're a

may probably\nWell I when searching for a story that was quite different from some of the things that I'd written before and I remember that old Jack Higgins novel called about how their exchange which was about\n... ... and American Soldiers fighting together at the end of the war I thought to myself well that must have happened in reality probably several times like dogs around and I saw the fine references to the limits on a white horse is a place and just about yeah I mean I saw in the end before very low I had the full story\nSo in the general outline we're approaching the end of World War two\nAnd a American and British forces close again from the west\nSoviet forces from the the the Germans are just about at the end of the line when word is received a by the American commanders\nApproaching jak and Slovakia of a of a most interesting uh the session that the the Germans have that is not that far from them what was discovered\nWhat actually happened was that gentleman said taking last for the Spanish riding school which is only the ... of course without the ... and I moved a little place called hostile in this today\nNow the Czech Republic and of course you're quite right on one side of the Americans pulling up very very quickly to the check border\nAnd mental we supposed to go any further because agreements have been made the older Czechoslovakia will be handed to style and and the Soviets the other side forty miles away the red armies coming in really fast they're doing horrible things that killing a lot of the stuff in their way including\nFamous whole says so the Germans started well really stuck and they decided to reach out to the Americans who they thought would help them uh and through a lot of shenanigans and\nThat was the food's very dangerous or a meetings eventually it was decided to somehow I'm through general Patton affects some kind of rescue of these very very precious animals\nAnd pat divorce a noted deliberate horses just immediately struck a chord with him the problem of course was a that not only a where was this in territory that was supposedly going to wind up being the Soviet sector\nBut in addition there were still some fanatic German SS troops who would oppose any kind of a combination with the allies from either side right\nThat's right ... the problem you have is the Germans started they basically veterinarians and all their offices and the German army\nOr the real interested in saving the whole assist themselves and their families and they make they see a private agreement with the Americans\nTwenty miles away the rest of the German army a following their orders to defend them to the last man and uh of course as you mentioned you do have some fatty hot and ss units than moving up from southern Germany and Austria and they do eventually pose a very very serious threat to this a peaceful outcome\nSo a small American forces I gather moves forward that how how big was this American group\nWith a very small group and date is from a cavalry reconnaissance unit driving a an eight on a cause and that will Chafee tanks and it never really amounts to more than a couple of hundred men it's really all that ... for this mission because of course the war is still going on the Americans are still fighting\nAnd they have to get on with the other uh activities so it's really risky mission lives that kinda thing patents launch before World War two\nUh the officer in charge kind of read from the second cavalry he doesn't go on the mission Betty organizes it he was basically told by patent that to you know get home and they do it\nBut if it goes wrong you know the guy is going to take the candidate for it um so he's very much a very risky operation twenty miles behind German lines with those kind of light vehicles and light weapons that was really asking for trouble\nAt the moment of contact others say once they got to the places where the worst Israel the
