it on the phone I realize you guys live and cross lines you go we go to the station I was like super it's always better when they're in the studio with me so thanks for coming in and this was great the only wants to talk about your fishing man you are a junior or senior senior and I drove a high school senior this year\nThe uh how long have you finished on the on the bass high school and they used to work at\nA this'll be my third year third year there aren't they did you fish you turn them out when you were really little like elementary middle school or do you eat in okay but then you got into the high school ranks and go more serious about it like oh yeah a lot more safe [laughter]\nThe or the high school fishing has really come on in recent years and brand your the coach I guess if his team correct yes how many are on this team\nOr just to dealing in his teammate is Devon calling for Winfield House cool\nOkay so but you represent your own school when you go then again\nI I actually I'm here when so it has a team of nature don't so me and him would it be partners so we had to join the club because Ninety to actually have a team that we make it work so it's not that\nI got you well they're probably ought to get a team because they've got the state champion [laughter] that's pretty good no team you're the state champion don't even tell me about that don't how many\nYears have you successfully completed the I mean if you want it more than once or to just just last year was your first year winning it\nOr the first year I ever did it at one point champion but I didn't win the state championship and then last year we won points and state championships\nSo let's explain a little bit to people were talking about their points or accumulated through a series of tournament you have throughout the year at the end whoever's accumulated the most points vi you're finished in each of those tournaments\nWins wins basically that's what it is and then the tournament championship ... at the tournament state tournament championship that's one it's a one time I meant yeah so it's kind of like if you win the bass master classic versus winning angler the year yeah\nPretty much that's that's kind of what it mirrors that I've always maintained that the angler the years more difficult because that's a series you had to be successful like over a series of tournaments say championship you can get\nLucky with one big fish and suddenly you want it kind of like the bass master classic but suddenly it gets all the publicity\n... so much bigger title but this year you you stepped up your game you went beyond that because there's the the high school fishing ranks and then I think they have college fishing as well\nBut something they have had within the bash federation ranks or the bass ranks for years here's the a ... is the the state championship for adults I mean that that all guys and their clubs fish\nYou wouldn't want that thing [laughter] so you're the high school state champion and you're the you're the adult state champion and all the other fish or you're gonna wanna bother and showing up where you tell me about first of all this talk about the high school championship tell me about that tournament that was back in ...\nThat was on may twenty does that sudden and\nIt wasn't bad the fish respond and at the time so it was obviously get fish and there's a lot of this Scott\nI'm a lot of people cite fish we kind of went away from everybody everybody what everybody else was the one kind of their own thing we weren't site fish and we have fish in Maine like and I'm kind of cell and everything we had to limit early and then we had a good shot at it but I only put some key fish in the boat late I really feel that so it actually turned out to be really good day that\nIs that a tournament where your fishing as a team or you individually out on your own yeah we're a team in Allen I got you so you and your partner won the state champion gather\nThis now you said that you finished the main like in may pretty much anywhere West Virginia you can catch fishy even the worst of us can catch fish in may that's a great time to be fish now that I asked because they're they're up shallow but if you want to you can get them to have you know what you're doing and apparently you guys did\nYeah we are we and catching deep it was a main like by it but um we had to catch them far back and brushes you probably get some we'd want something different that we knew nobody else has really done and it worked out\nYeah 'cause everybody like you said they're looking for fish up on the beds that are crews and then that can can sometimes can be a productive way to do it and sometimes it can be very frustrating 'cause you're looking at fish that will not by exactly so so you decided to go with the with the ones that were there in the brush\nYeah we knew they bite so we went form and it just it worked out in our favorite\nHow did you know they buy it obviously there had been some pre fishing\nOh yeah yeah there is some facing the weekend before we found them fish and we didn't go back to them because they knew you were there until tournament day and they were definitely that\nWhen you pre fish like that explain how you do that because you don't want to store lip everything in there how do you uh how do you gauge whether the fish are going to be there or not\nYou've got to really cover the whole like as much as you can in heck you don't know how much time you're going to get a few hours a day two days so you got to cover as much as you can and I'm Will shake fish if they buy them we won't even hook them what is um let them see that debate after a while and even if we got another man can catch one or two fish will get out of there as fast as we can we do soil up all the fish in there so that ...\nThat's got to be just ... you got to have a lot of discipline to\nNot catch up with this body and it's hard it's very good vision [laughter] very hard\nBut the bigger the bigger prize is you know a couple of days you got a tournament here and you can come back and then when you want to catch them\nThat Brian what's your role in all this you just drop the boat yeah pretty nice there is\nAny kind of the big motors running I have to drive that other net that Dylan and Devon they pretty much catch fish they net to fish themselves they handle the law will pretty much all I Do is a drive\nAre you allowed to offer advice or assistance to them in any way other than driving the boat\nYes during the day you're allowed eight time out and you can advise but it buys them what to do or they have questions they can ask questions\nBut what's the time out I mean you literally a rod down I mean how do you determine ... I mean you have pretty much [laughter]\nAnd and they also have to take a break or during the tournament for Fifteen minutes to eat and drink to make sure the hydrated and and uh they you know eating\nWell if you got good fishing who wants to do that when I finally had hired that Ohio man only [laughter] that's the one time I won't eat as a fissure by what you need later on the way back to the river so those are ...\nSounds like there's some pretty rigid rules in this high school format and yes you know that now you're in the boat with the two guys you brought it it I thought there was a situation and I don't know if ... ... ... where\nYou had to be with somebody you can meet with the two guys you brought you had to take somebody else and then they went with another vote or they switched everything up that is that's not the case then now so he's just whoever you fish in the boat you came in there\nYeah pretty much I got you I mean some kids will out to like ask for both coaches and they'll face with somebody random but as long as you have a coach and vote your good\nAnd ... is it a requirement that you have to have at least one voter calm or do you have guys that come that don't have anybody with a boat and they just ...\nOpposed foreign fish now you're on the idea here is to get kids to fish up right you\nHave to have a adult with you mhm and I'll tell you present guys out there that has the bass boat and has the time is a great thing that the kids are that they want to fish and it's very rewarding to be out there with ...\nSounds like you might learn something out [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nKind of interested in that must have a brain a little more here so that was that was in may which is we just discussed you can really you can get a lot of fish in may in West Virginia no matter where you're fishing even if it is it set in sudden at times can not be\nThe easiest like oh my gosh you ain't kidding yeah talking about some of those are the worst days you had there I mean sometimes it's like blowing up there\nOh my gosh we went there and I even had to buy frustrating it's hot sunny Kennedy in there and oh my gosh\nYeah but you have to um you have to adjust your tactics how big of a mind game is that what you will talk talking about how you make decisions on the water\nOff electronics are big thing nowadays I mean they can basically tell you anything you want to know which I Am I guess I guess of cheating with fishing but everybody uses them\nSo I'm sure you can go over the place now and you can tell if there's a team that there is that good so I'm right now obviously the fish are pulling back up of the banks because getting cold than the dead of summer everybody knows you got to go deep it's not a secret so you got to fight for waters and um fight the water for everybody else but it's really first come first served a lot of the times so the race\nElectronics are great and you're right they can tell you a whole lot of information that we didn't know years ago but the one thing they can't do is make that fish\nBy yeah that's absolutely you can go over Fifteen bass and they'll never buy a single\nThere you can drop that lower you can watch that lure on your electronics round right by the out if you're not working at correctly there they're not going to trigger a mind so that that that still the or the great equalizer there you know that's very true to up to the fish they want to you know what what's your favorite style of fishing as far as it finesse does it you know thrown\n... that is I'm not finished the state tournament but I have fish the qualifier you're right you get drawn the first day and you have to\nFinish with somebody you probably you probably know but no no a lot about them yeah and you ... if you're a non ... out of their boat and the way it works is both guys get to vote for half the day didn't work out that way 'cause sometimes I was so bad I was just going yeah you go ahead I'll just push back\nYour yeah but the guy has offered it to me about it and take it I was there but I don't I mean I was catching fish anyway so I was happy so like I was on ...\nLet me tell you any day that you can sit in the back and not have to run that trailer motor and you're catching fish that's a huge bonus he had a look at your water if I don't have to run that stupid drove a motor that can be a pain yes they can so tell me about your down your your two days on the water last week\nBy the first ... I Know he's pretty popular in the bass world in West Virginia He's\nA I'm a ... pound fish if you were [laughter]\nAh yeah he's a good guy and we laugh though they had a good time and we fish\nSoup Ira dealer record allows good friend of mine too so [laughter] yeah it's a really good\nGuy had a lot of fun um I did something I'm not used to I mean fifty before but not the way he did it and um we pulled up on one side and I swear we never moved we sat there the whole day and I don't like that I'm usually won the move around a lot and um\nYou learn when you get old son [laughter]\nYeah we sat there I Swear we fish thirty foot of water all day as I don't usually fish that deep but um I had a job to adapt is kind of with electronics we knew the fish were there we as um granted out and um\nWhat were you fish and what what technique where you fishing deep like the was it a drop shot or\nA all started I started off with a Josh I didn't really have a whole lot of his death on it then I put on the ... and um I caught two or three fish really quick on it and um I knew from then I had a gut feeling came that that was the right they yeah and and I never put it down the rest of the\nDay what was while doing or where did you even pay attention because that'll get you into trouble and he was the reason I ask is because you'd sit UCLA the guys fish and you may not know how to do that but you're trying something that you're not used to and suddenly you're out of your game\nAllow law had a little bit of a rough day and I felt bad for me last ... theory about everything he had his boat but I started we get goofed off I started giving crap at the end of day just messing around with orange\nDated you got a message to me a little bit you should have started the day that way that's the way I Would have done this a so the\nOne thing I was thinking though have you ever fish they Carolina rig no yeah even fish those anymore\nOh yeah they do that's still real popular but\nYeah that's that oil you don't hear a lot about the old man over here and I asked her ideas and I hate the thing but I'll throw all don't don't hate on the Carolina rigs on there's a there's a lot of fish there have been caught on and it doesn't change over time\nIt's just fisherman change mhm so second day tell me about that because apparently at a pretty good first day she felt like you might be in contention during the second day were there any nerves there was one\nYeah I was in fourth place after the first day and um we we fish deep so I kind of expected to go back and do the same thing and and I was with a guy named Steve Martin of the best man I've ever met really and um he was like All right we're going up to the rivers where the waters dirty old I was like great at the ... Clearwater all day all my fish are going to be completely different it's gonna be a different day I was nervous\nI didn't know what the protests like I'm In fourth place to get to a bunch of adults I never thought I'd even be in this position and I'm On the great I'm screwed like his now and he took us up he took me I've been there and he was a good guy he told me everything he caught fish on the first day and I mean offered me anything and I'm\nHonestly I watched him catch about two or three and um I knew from then I was not throwing the right stuff because I hadn't even had a fight and I was thrown out I was denied Jake again and I'm the water was law dirtier and I'm honestly he give props to him I didn't have ... and um he's getting fish on and he gave me one ... and um I kind of fish that they ...\nAlways curious miner but we're in for your travels carries matter by accident and even if you don't use them care oh\nYeah that was that dirty water I Swear I'm first day I caught all the fish in Clearwater and every fish the second we chase dirty water the Lakers clear and as they went on and we just followed the muddy water 'cause that's where we get that on the ... and he had to get back to be qualified for the state team too so we both had a heck of a day\nLike you said it it it's the same lake been two different to entirely different ways of fishing they're both successful\nMay exactly I don't mind then almost identical weights really it was like point three off from day one today too so um\nWhat was the reaction those are the guys when when you came in with those two big bad like holy cow this gas serious\nI don't know I kinda I didn't really know what's going on but Steve when I got in a boat he said yeah the big talk like everybody's talking about you throw in this big down here in deep water and I was like how the heck to these people not started Jake's allow right around telling them out during the day but it's okay um but um\nI like to see allows you to go around telling them that you were doing something entirely different they were throwing that deep ... [laughter] yeah but\nUm I don't know that are just like give him a hard time [laughter]\nSo so you are the state champion probably the youngest one they've ever had I Would guess that qualifies you for the state team where were you guys go and fish next year for the a camping trip\nNext September we get all the way to Maine fairly small mouth fisheries I'm excited about that a lot of small amounts that are on the lawn job and hopefully it'll be worth it\nNo longer I forget physicians okay I'm In I'm excited for any time you get more than ...\nThan you got the high school championship where's that going to be\nOh we already had it actually I that was August I'm On Kentucky like\nOh that's right okay real hot but you know and that's\nThe thing was I Can't wrap my mind around is that the high school championship run usually goes by the school year right yeah so so ... this was last year championship that you won't have you had any you've had high school tournament this year so far that they've had one so far okay where was it as it burns though emerged how'd you do in that one [laughter]\nIt was a he told me you're not sitting in the points lead African [laughter] is that what you're telling a little\nBit of a rough we lost a lot of fish that day you gonna have to have and it was probably one of the most frustrating days we've ever had on the water by a ... I got a tournament actually going to\nDo also we're hoping to turn around there and cut him while I'm paid so little can always redeeming that can can\nWell guys I sure appreciate you coming in and keep up the good work man it sounds like you've got a great a future in a in fishing and we wish you will and will keep an eye on your ... and stuff ... thank you for having me\nBrian thanks for coming in man and thanks for all you do as far as a coach and taking these gets position All right thank you All right Brian and Dylan Fitzgerald with us here on the show we got to take a break when we come back and carbon or joined us talk a little bear hunting right after the ...\nIn West Virginia wildlife it's for everyone and the west Virginia DNR works to keep it that way every year West Virginia's division of natural resources manager sounds\nOf acres of public land and water ensuring the future of our great natural resources in the mountain state our state is a haven for\nAll species of wildlife gate and not gain and draws thousands each year to enjoy are rich outdoor heritage when you buy a hunting or fishing licence or take a stroll in our forest of your life you're enjoying what the deal in our has made possible the west Virginia and are working to ensure wildlife is for everyone\nAnd we want to see what you got to ram trucks trophy photo contest is underway to kill the big bucks caught a\nMassive fish or maybe it wasn't all that bigger mess and we'd still like to see it if it's a trophy to you it's trophy to us\nSubmit your picks by clicking the contests logo at the outdoors page of WB metro news dot com each month from now through February will draw for a monthly prize pack of ram gear plus a grand prize submitted picking your in the drawing the ram trucks trophy photo contests at the outdoors page of WB metro news dot com\nHey you're listening to West Virginia outdoors presented with the Hatfield McCoys trails on metro news the voice of West Virginia\nIn most cases when you go hunting you'll have to travel some distance to get to your favorite spot now we know you'll be careful of what about the distracted drivers slams into causing injuries and that you deserve compensation you need to tighten law firms\nUnit Tom and harming their research and other sixty years of experience I mean a head start toward a successful in the heightened Laufer Tom and heart\nOnline at baking law firm dot com [noise]\nOur radio all your favorite music all your neighbors and it's all free you need a break from the world over the radio I have a bigger dog\nA playlist artists or even a pod cast doubt on sometimes just needs to know the world to the Iranian so much more than just invest radio stations from all over the country download or even free I our radiolab\nHello do you live and putting them ...

I guess the the the to\nSusan in the mountain county so they do\nThey did about three hundred and Seventy animals\nUm which was down a little bit from last year um but it's within the range of what they've had 'em yet throughout throughout the years have an early season we've had a variety season for math in the mountains over the years\nBurying from three days in some places to seven days we've been we've been set on seven days the last several years um but it's you know it's the harbors fluctuates usually between three fifty it's going three fifty to six hundred typically in that early season up there\nAnd then ah and then we've got one I guess you would during the mid south [laughter]\nReally boon fate and come on [laughter]\nYep yep and they they killed just under eighty animals there which is within ten animals or what they killed last year no I'm harvested stamp pretty stable in these early seasons do\nYou find that hunters and most of the guys that the chase these things with dogs they live up in you know the higher elevations there from up in you know grant mineral Pocahontas up in that in ... in that country because that's that that's kind of traditionally where most of my own any was done\nAre you finding that a lot of them enjoy coming down here for these three seasons and gives them three opportunities to to do some hunting\nYeah there's there's no doubt it's um it's kind of become we've been doing it so long especially in Raleigh North county said\nI've never I've never talked to hunter who hasn't participated at least one of our early seas so you know you talk to guys are going to them county for for Fifteen Years now and early ... um and and you know you talk to different got and say oh I think we're going to try that that real early season this year and\nA cause that was around Labor Day weekend was meant\nYeah starts right on on Labor Day weekend yeah and you know a lot of guys are saying well you know it's funny because we've we've actually been we've had bear hunters say you've got too many seasons now\n[laughter] so I probably have a good thing [laughter]\n... well the the other thing that I Wonder about is you know I remember Labor Day weekend I was at the w._b. you Tennessee game down in Charlotte it was stupid hot that weekend I cannot imagine\nYou know traipsing through the hills particularly and that's the country down there I mean you had to I Would have given up in the first Fifteen minutes of doing that uh and and there's got to be rough on the dogs did that it have any impact as well or or or or not merely didn't\nIt doesn't seem to you know and that was kind of what we weren't sure about what first I'm open to season that early down there but what you know we gotta figure as they've you know most most folks have been training dogs all summer and that kind of eat anyway you know the differences now you've got an animal that you got to get out of the woods quickly to get cool down so\nWell and the guys that don't these dogs I mean they the their house members more for before they're ... and they will take care of those dogs and they write most of them have enough that they can run one of them for a brief period of time and then put it in the in the trunk and give it to water in turn the other one was\nYeah that that some of the guys I talk to the hunted down there this this year said they they had to a kind of separate dogs you can rest a a group one day and ... you know so you have something to run the next because it's so demanding so steep so hot you know so rough\nYeah so and that's it and and you're in a time to when I mean we only have the leaves come off yet but you can imagine how it is in there trying to run up through the mess yup what ought to do it man you got anything else before I cut you lose\n... just just a reminder that we've got another out their season coming up next weekend it coincides with our atlas a deer season and Thirteen counties\nYeah OK

here from various people around the program you know as time made you feel any less uh panicky than than we did a week ago um\nWith this team's performance I guess where some of the explanations and the the kind of you know you\nYou are a step away and and the flight sometimes from the emotion of the game and\nUm have a chance to examine it and and look at it and try to figure out why it happened\nAnd uh in seven days or you found any answers that make you feel you know me neither\nDo I doubt I mean\nWise are still somewhat inexplicable and\nUh some of them are are remain issues that we sort of wondered about for a while specifically walking aspect of it and\nYou know so many people point to the office of mine and that's obviously a major component of the blocking but it is Dana pointed out this week and I I Do think he was right there that's not the only issue in blocking the west Virginia his head and certainly had it\nAt Iowa State run the running backs to pick up all of which is\nWell it all in academia and he even pointed to wide receivers not blocking well on running place and we know all those things can lead to issues as well it's not just the five off into line than ah than have to you know\nCertainly be strong in terms of your blocking but whatever and whoever it is West Virginia first and foremost has to get that showed up um you know\nWill ... is not been perfect the last couple of games but he's still pretty good quarterback when he has the ability to pocket when he's a you know running for his life uh obviously as he was at Iowa State\nOf a sudden he becomes less than average just like every quarterback so he needs protection and he didn't get it Iowa State and a nice ... needs to return or West Virginia's next five games are going to be real good real pretty hot\nYeah absolutely I just thought here real quickly will will jump into\nThe hearing now in terms of basketball this year with the season right around the corner but Greg of course we would be remiss if we didn't talk in the opening segment about West Virginia's major verbal commitment or not a huge shock\nOr we thought that a U.S with your boy he was a a heavy lean for West Virginia but until until it happens and really until he signs or you you are you worried but a very solid commitment for West Virginia and obviously a major yet at a uh in an area where we typically\nDon't get a lot of ah you know four or five star began\nYeah I mean ... as well as hugs has done um you know he hasn't recruited\nThis level a kid very often and that's why I think there's so much excitement because um you know West Virginia has gotten some high level recruits but\nBut they're sort of smattering here there and I think you're buying not only eat but with other top hundred kids Derrick Coleman Jordan McCain um you know others at West Virginia has gotten in recent times you see that point you know\nHow can you get to a sweet sixteen\nWith two circuits or if he can get that same kind of effort but out of four star kids what is ultimately achievable Indian we don't know until they actually get out there and perform but I think that's why you you look at Oscar should weigh in\nIn the rest of the groups of recent vintage and go yeah you know what this this has a chance to continue are really nice run and maybe even taken up a notch now\nAs you said that she now from a team as\nAbout as little surprises any recruiting announcement that I've been through because every indication was he was going it was for you but you said it perfectly until\nIt tell he actually says it\nYou know positive and I guess until he actually signed a letter\nIntent it's it's not a hundred percent Ninety nine point nine but it was probably Ninety eight going into yesterday and ah now moves up so again you know you just watch the state it's real easy to fall in love with him just like it is some of these other kids of recent recent era\nFrom West Virginia I uh you know the the one thing you don't want to do and I think sometimes we all get a a you know we all do this is the\n... you don't want to push ahead what's in front of you this year in go for the pipe dream of what's possible for next year because I I think she's got she's really good in the basketball court this year even before Oscar she gets in the damn\nAll right well we'll talk or in you and I are

a great start well you know to have to have more in depth issues are a little\nA problem for for balloon for you know\nYeah I mean if you're if you're supposed to have one of the best wide receiver for the nation I think of course I can say the whole field and say you have a place develop but I think a couple of times we had patterns called where the guy ... yards down to the up and down occur on if he was\nGet the ball he just stood there now if you're white or you're supposed to be that good I guess\nWhat is not that great of a secondary and you can't get that one and drink and Nicole light or something I mean you're just show up\nWell I've got no explanation for that one sneeze I mean I'll give a talk to you about some of the other things but I'm watching West Virginia's a wide receivers in trying to watch it you know from deep so I could see the whole thing\nThey just plain didn't get opening that inexplicable for receiving corps that I'd never seen in recent years have issues with now again you've Iowa State credit for\nA good bit of that because I thought that there just since the secondary played really really well but that that is a concern and an issue going forward that West Virginia was not able to get anything going\nIn terms of getting receivers open on you know a lot of those right either\nOption routes or you know it's not just a rundown do button hooking it stand there I mean it's you know you're playing a man you run this rowdy blaming his own inside outside leverage I mean every ... almost every better than most every pet eye glass areas options out of\nOptions route they call them but the one thing you don't do\nYou see these right with this is\nWhatever pattern you end up you know just stand there yeah once it's what's it doesn't work you stand there I mean then all of a sudden you've got to start moving in a you know there scramble options to every player at least there should have been so for\nWhatever reason that once it happened every time but I read them I saw a number of times where West Virginians receivers were signed me and just stop and stood there again\nThat one's got to be correct\nThey appreciate the call you know kind of back to the uh the thought about being flat you know that's a that's used a lot uh sometimes we do see teams come out with not a lot of emotion and just go through the motions if you will\nBut I don't think that was the case that I was in West Virginia and I was upset and nothing yeah we drove right to block the fuel returned it for a touchdown they were jumping around so I you know I don't think that theme\nNow where they flat in the fourth quarter when they were getting their tails and oh well yeah yeah I mean at that point but uh again I think sometimes that's to blanket of his name\nAs an excuse as to why he didn't play\nYeah and again I mean because I mean sometimes it is it is true but I think more often than not is it something that when you don't play well people use and that's not necessarily the case now a lotta times when you're on the road you don't feel the same kind of emotion you're not jumping around as much when you're home so\nPeople may proceed that as being a lot but I agree with you in his mid ... sometimes it seems have been everything was going to be like that point but he didn't believe that was the case against I always say you know I I I Believe him in that juncture I mean I\nI I think the effort was there it was it was more performance a technique in all those other things than actual\nWeber aren't we got a ton of tax will get to
