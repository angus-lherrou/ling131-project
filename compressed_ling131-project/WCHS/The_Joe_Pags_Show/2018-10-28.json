director of\nThe Hatfield McCoys trail system more than ... the name sponsor of our show here and this week there was some consternation about the fact that they're going to have to close the Pocahontas trail system in southern West Virginia temporarily that's in Mercer county around the brand will area\nThat's real concerning to a lot of folks around Bram well who have made a big investment down they're putting up cabins camp grounds and\nThat sort of thing to cater to riders but he said don't friends they are going to reopen it but one thing that they are concerned about and this is a little bit bigger of a problem and they don't really know what to do\nIs folks who um who or what I I guess for lack of a better term are outlaw riders where they they they might start on the head McCoy trail and then they move off to somewhere else that's trespassing\nThat's not your land and that's against the law and even in West Virginia so I'm I talked to a gym for best these about these issues this week\nWhat we're doing is you know or Pocahontas trial system which is primarily located at Mercer county it's on\nMining coal property and we have some mining operations that are expanding and as part of that expansion and gosh knows we we need and welcome those mining jobs because they're putting a lot of West Virginians to work\nWe're gonna have to move that system or to an adjacent partial or property and we'll be bringing the current system off line December third which is pretty much at the end of our riding season and this spring will be bringing a new system on line that will still be the Pocahontas trail system connecting into the town of Bram well\nThat will be further away from the the current mining operations and we do this you know for the safety of our writers you know we don't want our riders in or near these active surface operations and certainly we need to get out of their folks way because those those mining operations or economic development\nThis is not unusual I mean the way the model works is that ... part of the agreement if the if they agreed to allow you to run a trail on to their property there's always the possibility that that could be reopened to refer mining or ... or some other\nYou know mineral extraction there and that's part of the deal when that's going on the trail it becomes a secondary user\nOh absolutely and we we move a folks don't realize that that our the seven hundred and thirty miles I have felt McCoy trails we have we probably move Seventy two a hundred miles a trail around\nEach year sometimes it's a single trail sometimes it half the trail system a tampering or certainly goes on throughout all this you know our foot prints two hundred and fifty thousand acres so you you got imagine at any given time probably fifty thousand of that aid reaches as being tampered so\nA lot of times what the temperature will go back behind them after they're out you know a year year and a half later in the timber operations create an entirely new systems for us the mining takes a little longer but it's it's it's it's very planned out so we know where the moms are going and were able to sort of sequester and\nBlock those places often end to work around those operations and and this one at Mercer county is is no different than any other one it's just the first time we've had to do it on that system so I think it's new to the folks in that area but if you were talking to the folks in Gilbert or\nOr manner Logan they they're familiar with the fact that sometimes we take these off plans for you know a month or two months usually in the winter to\nTo recount figure and you know we we can't say enough about our relationship with the natural resource extraction industry the land holding companies the coal companies a timber companies the gas companies [noise] ah they work with\nI said every step of the way uh you know and and then they put a great importance on what we're doing and and our job is to get out of their way so that they can you know create jobs for West Virginians and the same time we're we're creating jobs and tourism\nThere were there was some concern however that even though that you don't actually closed off the drills that go to this active mining sign some people were still running in there on those and and you indicated that there are some did they can't control what people do on your trail is what you're saying\nOh absolutely and it and it and it's and it's a it's a problem that's that's hard to get your arms around because we we have our maps and we have our writers that really adhere to our map some follow our maps but with with the advent of technology and and when you go on line there are these\nThese digital maps out there and folks are actually somehow getting their hands on these these digital maps of these GPS maps are GIs maps of areas\nAnd what they don't understand is the people that created those actually you know sometimes are sending you end up to what it would be dangerous areas you know they're sending you into areas that are permitted and bonded an active minds sites and they're sending you into areas where there might be an active timber operation so [noise]\nYou know we would recommend that everyone that if you're here riding the ... trail system stay on the Hatfield McCoys trails use our maps are maps aren't are not going to put you in harm's way and\nAnd these these other maps that are out there these digital maps that individuals are making you know oftentimes they're they're on properties that that those rod or shouldn't be on and and and it's really problematic for us you know we try to police and help landowners with that but\nYou know it it really creates a hardship on everyone is especially the businesses that have made investments they want this property to stay open in the end the biggest threat we have to to losing this property as our inability to manage this activity in conjunction with the natural resource extraction\nYeah no I don't think a lot of people I mean you know you hear someone hears this and goes well you know who are you to tell somebody they can't read where they want well in your trespassing that's against the law so I think that's the one thing that needs to be pointed out here is if you're not on the have the ... and you have and follow the rules\nAnd you've gone off the reservation so to speak than you are trespassing illegally on somebody else's land\nA absolutely and and it's and it's you know it's not just open land it's land that has a lot of activity on it you have coal mining surface mining and underground mining you have natural gas extraction going on you ... you have timber operations going on and\nAnd all these things you know there's an expectation that they have a buffer so that that individuals private citizens are not on these active bonded sites where these sites were were an active timber operations going on\nThey're sixteen national parks of the more than four hundred\nSites in the national park system and those are places where hunting is not allowed except for as as you mentioned there at Grand tee time for very specific purpose\nOr a specific time period and one species and I think there's interest in having the re designation the cost of the national park brand\nUm their parks or for people go and expect them to be places set apart they expect their not to be on the they expect a high quality experience they expect to see native species by sitting in Yellowstone or\nMaybe even a Florida panther in the Everglades and that brand has power or the calls at ...\nSo you all have a concern that if this happened because the advocates this year in West Virginia or are dead set that ... that if they don't allow hunting in this national park if that becomes origin then that's a deal breaker\nYou all seems in ... I don't mean to put words in your mouth but it sounds to me like you all are fearful that this is the camel's nose under the dance\nWell it's um that's a concern that I'm for\nSixty years or more for for many years for decades the national parks have been a place for hunting is not a lie out now\nI'm In the other national park sites including the river gorge national river national recreation areas like Delaware water gap in Pennsylvania New Jersey hunting is allowed and it's it's actually allowed and dozens of parks where it the purpose of the\nA place that's been established is much more I'm much more broad\nI think that's one of the things that the causes confusion here is that there are different designations for all these different places but they're all under the management\nOf the U.S department of been interiors national park service that's the actual name of the organization the agency that runs these\nBut just because it has national park service and the the euro hit a logo out front\nLuggage never to gorge is not a national bart gives the national river or in ... in Maryland is a national seashore all these different designations and I think just for the average person that the the ... they see that brown area and the girl that's national park well no not not to the letter of the law is not\nRight it is there at least Nineteen\nDifferent designation and from time to time there is some attention about that of the most recent national park service director was interested in shrinking the number of designations for that very reason and the confusion is understandable\nAnd I think I mean the correct me if I'm wrong because this happened when I was in middle schooler were or will certainly was not a new position or when they designated\nThe national Park Service management of the new the new records national river they tried to get the national park designation and it was rejected because it didn't qualify and if I'm not mistaken they actually created the term national river\nIs a designation just for the new river gorge to get it under the or the national Park Service management agreement\nBack in um the seven days when this debate was happening there was one just to take a step back\nYou river gorge is really blessed with so much support for the area and recognition of its outstanding values and some controversy old developments upstream in North Carolina\nReally in the sixties and early seventies gave energy to efforts to bring some level of protection to the lower than the river in West Virginia\nAnd one of my colleagues or one of my predecessors at the national parks conservation association was involved and facilitating the discussion about what's the best way to\nProtect this place for current enjoyment as well as future generations\nAnd the national river designation was then a fairly new but it it had been used at the buffalo river national river and\nSaw um there are now I Believe five national river designations project\nFor that for a purpose to recognize the outstanding values of an area there was some interest in making it a wild in scenic river designation of the wild and scenic river system was set up around the same time\nAnd um the the problem with that is with the wild in scenic river designation only about a quarter mile river court or can be preserved and that was interests and recognition that they're you know with the gorge\nI'm as it is a as it is that that would be insufficient\nYeah there's there's several [laughter] to several dozen miles a river that are that are protected through the mid West Virginia\nRight or if when I say a quarter mile a quarter I mean a quarter along the river right now the the new river gorge extend more than fifty miles\nPure yeah we're talking to joy ... with the national parks convert conservation association they too are opposed to the idea let's say they do they are opposed to the idea\nOf the national park designation for the new river gorge here in West Virginia joined can you hang on and no one told you I was going to have you about ten minutes ... questions are you you're going on\nI'm I'm I'm great\nOkay we'll be

fantastic this has to be an upgrade for you to be in West Virginia hunting on a Saturday morning but I Want to extend that I I think I'll be have a sportsman in the states do we want to extend thanks to ah to the national Shooting Sports foundation for the work that you guys did\nTo help the help convinced the legislature to move forward but the Sunday hunting legislation I think that's something that hunters and the state really appreciated\nIt when we appreciate all support in the state I mean we started this project cry about six or seven years ago the first day we pass on their hunting in was Virginia I mean we were getting rid of glue laws are over two hundred years old\nAnd you know kind of moved on from there and did North Carolina and obviously came into West Virginia and you know I think it's great for the west Virginia sports men that they now have the ability to hunt on Sundays both on private and public land\nAnd uh you know we need more people out in the field and then we need to increase you know recruiting and retention and I think that suddenly hunting is one way to do that\n[noise] what tell me a little bit about the national Shooting Sports you are the organization that represents a firearms manufacturers and and and and those those organizations right you're the trade the training was whenever\nYou you are one hundred percent correct we are the trade association so we represent all the manufacturers\nI'm obviously large manufacturers Smith in western Remington Winchester the ... of the world as well as retailers and ranges around the country so there are many retailers here in West Virginia that are are members of ours we we visited one yesterday at mc flies um you know great retailer\nAnd um you know they we we do everything we can to try to support our members and help them through a sometimes difficult times and good times for the industry\nAnd not and I know that you all have also been one of those it's supportive and every time I get an opportunity to talk about the the pit been Robertson act was one that was created more than Seventy five years ago and that is where the firearms industry I mean there's an excise tax that we all pay\nOn the products that are produced by the firearms industry and that becomes money that helps to manage the game in a in the United states and you for the first time ever benefited from that this morning\nCorrect I mean people don't realize that hundreds of basically the number one conservationist in America they are the ones that support many of the land that people use for hiking and mountain biking of bird watching and you know the ... the taxes that we pay that go back to the federal government and get distributed to the states are key to that uh every\nEvery fire him every box of animal that somebody buys is a money going to conservation\nWhen that what you are where are you guys headquartered\n[noise] so we are headquartered we actually do have a Washington DC office and then we are headquartered in Newtown, Connecticut ... ... people always ask why are we in Connecticut and you know that he used to always be gone valley a lot of manufacturers are in the northeast there still are a lot of manufacturers in the northeast Jeff Smith in West and\nI'm river's still headquarters in Connecticut ... cold so we still have all of a fair share manufactured in the northeast as well\nYou know when you consider the way the political winds have changed in the last fifty years or ... ... it's often hard to remember history where you know the country pretty much started in that part of the world in a in that you're right that's where the firearms were made for I don't know a couple of hundred years it seemed like\nYeah we are seeing a lot of states now giving economic incentives and tax breaks to move a lot of farms many factions of the northeast I'm Marilyn and Marilyn's was one that lost Beretta or rent a move down to Tennessee for their manufacturing facility so\nYou know we do see a lot of states trying to entice the fires fires to move out of the north east because of the political environment\nAbsolutely and if you got any more out there that are looking to leave West Virginia you mean you'd be experienced we love our firearms here\nUh I I haven't experienced West Virginia the past couple of days I even went to the west Virginia football

I don't know how do they are\nAnd you know what I mean it gets ... what do we know that the team that I thought would compete for West Virginia was second in this like very well may be the worst team right now in the league I mean if you're losing the Kansas as his TCU did yesterday\nYou very well maybe if you if not worse you're right down there near the bottom right and then they can understand one kid gets kicked author or they're starting quarterback gets injured and he's out for the years they're dealing with things but\nUh that's football right I mean that's why you just never know I thought TCU is going to be a team that we can ... for very much top half a not for second in his legs and obviously they're not it was hard to watch the last thirty seconds is I Can't see the game for a couple of reasons I've never\nSeen Gary passion so panicky 'cause he can sense it coming but one has got to fight the ants in case Kansas screwed up in the\nChest nervousness on the Kansas sideline to not screw up the final Fifteen or twenty seconds when it took a time out to come up that played a run and throw it out then they tell they weren't in a situation very often or just snap at NYU and you take it out about them in a ball he's so it was like please don't mess this opportunity of\n[noise] yeah I think it's ah honestly I think it comes down to challenges for both defense was 'cause those defenses statistically are right there close to each other in a West Virginia a that was a great defensive performance on Thursday night\nIowa State was was not great but you know a lot of that I I I tend to put on the office of defense was just out on the field so long and you know we we've gone a long way and\nA noted the are the injuries that this is a patchwork defense or from West Virginia and hopefully getting healthier but ah you know I I find that interesting that you know that this will be another you know through the course of the season there's always those are kind of semester exams and I think for West Virginia's defenses another\nNow I don't see how much you know how much improvement they have made her how far they've come\nYeah I agree with it not that they'd been perfect but they're number one of the big twelve in scoring defense or number two in the big urban both passing orders in rushing or did you allowed to leave the league and tackles for law yeah so I mean we've gotten to the\nPoint now seven games and it's not like you've got just a small sample and you've played enough of the good teams in his league\nAgain admittedly you still have Oklahoma State Oklahoma some of the better off fences still the calm but you've seen enough of the good often says you know where your defenses and then I'm I'm not sure it's the best defense West Virginia's ever had this may be performing better than\nA or at least above their head more than any of the others give me his head because I don't know if this one is as talented as the Carl Joseph groups some of those it turned out you know four or five NFL players I'm just it's just a lot of kids playing pretty hard yeah you\nProbably don't have that top talent you know your ten and eleven guys aren't making mistakes and embarrassing you and getting shoved around and a lot of that comes down to the fact that you finally have the linemen who can hold their water and air and all that you know and then that's you're exactly right you you can't game plan around that and we saw that last year so\nEven if those guys aren't the ts all guys and they're they're doing enough that David long can be David ... yeah and that the guys in the back in aren't getting exposed you know from a quarterback hold in about\nFive six seconds yeah you're exactly right 'cause yeah 'cause ... that's what an area where you can't hide guys no defense\nYou know loss and even a few years ago when I thought there they're starting three were pretty good with noble walk and chew and engineering Howard and Christian brown they didn't have a four or five or six and so those guys were just worn down by the second half and then\nThe second half of the season we're completely worn out where I'm now you know you're able to roll more um you have fortunately for them all the injuries you've had you haven't really sustained many that have taken somebody out for extended periods of time in the defense of wind knock on wood I mean is\nThis I'm back in court probably could have been just as deep\nIf you had the four guys who are now I'll sit now but I you know you you start going through those injuries and it and it takes its toll but fortunately you're right I think the decency of mine has been a huge part of why this defense overall has been statistically more than a touchdown better per game than it was last year or\nText or will grab a couple of days and then we'll take a break and hit some phone calls in our next segment four oh five area code\nTexture says can we get Ron ... back after this season the ability of five three hundred pound men to move three others blows my mind [laughter] ... a little more on the on the line and where uh where you see\nSome of the issues you know I I remember there was one particular play in the game on on Thursday night West Virginia doubled\nThe wrong guy you know so there's still some miscommunication you you double the wrong guy and you're left Baylor's best defensive lineman scot free to come in and pressure the corn\nYeah things like that that they're middle and I hate to just be blunt but I Will there's there's center in that regard regard has not been very good and obviously they've got a couple of others that they think\nI'm can't be better 'cause they've got guys there we thought chicken ... across the would play this year a he's not played a whole lot even when that Jones has struggles and um you know chiefs parent played some against Baylor and we talk about some of this which is that happened there but\nI thought he would be the right guard when Joe Brown you know you'd be he either here Joe Brown Joe Brown hasn't been a you know healthy enough or in a in a month and\nHeard he keeps going out there at least to start games now the one thing they did do against Baylor that I thought actually was relatively affected well hardly still got most of the saps they ended up flipping their guards in in terms of flipping\nJosh a silk who's normally the starting left guard moves over he plays right guard\nAnd chase bank goes in employees left we were sitting by each other and the press box maybe it's just people were were seeing the the openings on the right it right garden just put your best guard in that position and let him try to clocks and things up which I thought that worked fairly well but they they eventually went back to Marty so they\nThey still see something with Isaiah hearty that I Would miss\nSometimes I don't see\nIs the biggest of them you know I mean he's a ... and still raw which is not the thing you want to say about a senior [laughter]\nIf you're wrong the savior [laughter] I guess what you're not going to get right I mean you know um but yeah I thought maybe they're trying to steal a series or two and make Baylor adjusted the fact that you build your game plan around the fact that the right guard is vulnerable and then well at least for a couple of plays\nThey got to get it radio down and get things in Munich hated and if you go in tempo they don't have time to call a twist or a doubt the blitz and so you know I think I think there's ways of western you can try to mitigate that um\nYou know when they tried to ... guard that game and it was it was it was almost catastrophic from that and the hits that that will take off of that um because again centered on guard is is a big shift versus Iraq it onto a guy versus passing along so\nI don't know man I feel good about sixty percent of the line and really maybe Seventy cars don't half the time\nYeah I'd say fair and again you know we were that was with you we were told before the game that they thought Joe Brown would potentially\nPlay he didn't ultimately didn't even dress yeah um so you know obviously that that turned out not to happen but again you hope that he can get back in there but again now you're putting so much of your hope on the guy that played to football games for your three football games\nAnd his only been in the program a few months so you know is maybe he's better but I'm not I don't think anybody could promise that it's this humongous upgrade\nYeah and um they're worried about his conditioning earlier in the hour we'll be haven't played in the last five six weeks\nAre we supposed to believe that he's getting in football shaped during the week yeah and not not on Saturday I come from yeah we'll see a again you know\nThere's some things you can do to help yourself along I mean there's no miracle cure all of a sudden you're going to be this great power run game um because you've got some issues there but\nThe script fifty eight points against Baylor so obviously you can put points up and do some things some of the football uh to cover up some of those weaknesses keep pulling those tax yep you know\nBefore we get the barrage of injury questions are loaded brown came back we saw sink field came back\nAh we've touched on a on Joe Brown let's um what about have you seen the line backers did you see the line backers around on the field Thursday night and any updates from uh from either you too on on a jury pits\nUm time to start with Dylann ... he was a game time decision they tried to see if he would be able to go on Thursday he's got a growing poll I'm\nObviously he didn't go Campbell play pretty well and his dad but intercept but he was close this past week you would like to think with a little bit more time\nYou know in in the extended time off on that deal and will be pretty close to being able to go on in Austin I you know I haven't talked to anybody about pits ah that said anything that gives me indication he's going to be ready for a couple of more weeks yeah you can almost read between the lines of mundane assess things like that and\nIt's not long term but it's clearly not day to day either so ah we we got there today on a sink filled for about four weeks and we haven't gotten day to day on the rig or we saw that knee up there yeah dropped in the Iowa State training room so he might be in late November now you know maybe the good\nNews is an endangered and maybe he won't answer it well I'll ask them again ah on on Tuesday but he's talked about the line backers who'd been injured in the spring\nWith calls and ferns coming back in November well you know we're not getting to November and I see friends around a lot I mean we don't get a good practice so I Can't I haven't seen what he what he can do and nobody will answer that question but a theme around a lot\nHe's moving without any issues whatsoever so again I don't even know if he's practicing it probably gotta practice for a couple of weeks before you can actually get back into a game but\nHe's the one that I think out of those um could potentially be back in a couple of weeks you get any yeah I mean if you think about if you get ten snap\nSide of him yeah in a in the right package or to save a guy from getting gas uh you know on the series where you're getting pushed around a little bit that that helps a lot going back to your shake Campbell thing I'm not sure that\nTaxes is a bad match for him I don't want to see him on the field against Oklahoma eh goodbye axis yeah\nRon game him in the Mike against taxes\nMaybe yeah downhill guy yeah and you know unfortunately her friends probably won't be back but you probably could play the Mike and Adam Hensley also now out for the rest of the season with the practice injury as well so uh that's your that was your backup my\n... yeah exactly so I really didn't have the backup back its back on track of the last I heard so far back as I I guess sandwiches the the ... if if if darker you still can't goes uh I don't know the X ray low I thought played pretty well in a backup ruled behind Giovanni Stewart so", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "28"}
