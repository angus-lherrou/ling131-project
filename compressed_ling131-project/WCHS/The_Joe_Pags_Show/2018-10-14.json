{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "But now here in America it has morphed into something called the knockout game it became popular a few years ago when young teenagers would pick out in adult to attack I didn't casually walk up to them and sucker punch them in the face\nThe goal was to render them unconscious with one punch\nIn some cases they would even kick the unconscious victim as they lay on the sidewalk and even take selfies of them while standing over the victim quite a few people had been seriously injured but in comas and several have actually died as a result of these types of attacks\nBut how can you defend against crazy acts of violence like this here a few handy self defense tips you can follow to minimize the danger of becoming a knockout victim\nOne when you were around people you don't know especially when in transitional spaces like parking lots and sidewalks always operate at a heightened state of awareness check people out from a distance and if you see anything that makes you feel threatened or uneasy leave the area\nToo when you walk past people keep them in your peripheral vision many times attackers will glance over at you and then look around the area to ensure no one is watching before the launch the attack\nThese non verbal cues and respond appropriately when you see people with various intent\nAnd three when walking past people on the sidewalk or a hallway or in a parking lot give them a little space don't let them get close enough to play the knockout game and for\nDon't be afraid to make a brief I contact just so people know you are aware of their presence you are sending the message I see you and I hold you accountable many times this is all it takes to ward off an attack\nI understand that we shouldn't

I'm an okey I grew up ah I grew up just outside of them is it a little town called Wagner just outside of Muskogee, Oklahoma and I still live in a in the Tulsa areas\nI Gotcha okay well I was looking on YouTube and some of your videos and it it it really is quite the this seemed to see a man playing a role model of a was Eighteen deer heads staring at him as an audience that's a pretty cool visual\n... well you know if I make a mistake they can't complain so [laughter] it's a captive audience captive audience\nHow did you how did you become a concert pianist and because they're being a concert pianist near accomplished it is and you're an accomplished deer hunter generally those two circles don't don't collide how in the world did you wind up in both of those\nAround you know I was just a a lucky I guess and I started taking lessons when I was five I was always captivated by piano and although the lead the one rule was once you start taking less you're not stop and so she you know many a time with a little we'll we'll a switch hitter hand\nShe'd sit there and I had to practice thirty minutes every day [laughter] [laughter]\nYeah and uh but anyway I ... I went actually went to college it got\nScholarships for a music in\nAnd did all that kind of stuff but uh but my love of hunt and fish start you know what I was very young as well but my dad who was eat up fishing and hunting and all all my relatives were hunters and fishermen and and I would just one of those kids that it just got on me and I never got off and how to this day I just think it's a\n... you know the outdoors and being out there and and uh hurting the critters you know the wild animals I think it's the greatest thing in the\nWell in the ... your daddy didn't have to use the will to switch to get you go hunting and fishing [laughter] not like ... [laughter]\nThat's true no that's true that's true\n... now you're also describe as a humorist now that is not to say that you're a comedian don't we people should not come to the show expecting to see a a standup act\nBut you're able to I think first of all you're able to laugh at yourself which is a great asset but at the same time you've got loads of really funny stories just from hunting and fishing trips for so many years\nWell you know my dad was a quite a character to say the least and uh\nAnd I think I got a little bit of that from him over the years of his ability to they were active in politics and and he was just good at getting up in front of people and kind of putting on a show for lack of better words and\nAnd it just kind of stuck with me at that I did a lot of public speaking and\nAs a young man was in the ministry that a lot of you know speaking at church I still speak and a lot of churches and I have found that you know we're going to you you can interject here over to what you're doing\nUp people seem to sit there and enjoy a little bit more so I uh uh yeah it's a I'll put it this way at a at one of my when I Do a little seminar in it and that's not the right word but when I when I get up speak nobody ever\nGoes to sleep [laughter] that's that's that's for sure\nAnd I loved I Love hunting elements stories and and now and I guess it's just a little bit of a gift from below that I had the ability to hold people tension and\nThen we'll have a good time at you know the the the evening ... I'm I'm really excited about it and it'll be it'll be a couple of hours that uh whoever its hands gets a chance to come and I'll bet you know who I Hope everybody can come if they can\nIf you like to hunt and fish and like a little bit of music here and there and want to be entertained I think you're going to uh it's well worth the money\nSo to speak you know you are you you talked about the fact that you know your roots are are based both in music from your mother's influence and none of vision from your dad's influence when did it become the the the hunting hunting shows that you have done in the videos that you've done when did it evolve into that became your way to make a living how did that how that well\nWell I went to school forever and I and I kind of laugh a standing joke ... uh was uh when I got out of college that I was the smartest painter in Tulsa a guy and you'll have for college degrees\nI have two master's degrees I have a graduate degree from Duke University holy down up and I decided to just I was going to do a PHD\nAt Vanderbilt and I thought I was going to take a little bit of time off and I asked and I came back to pulse and I start painting painting houses\nAnd I found out if if I didn't make a lot of money but I'm a little bit of money and what a great profession if you like to hug fish because you're busy in the summer\nBut when the the snow starts to fly or it gets colder I was free to do a lot of hot and uh and then you know I ended up getting married and started having kids and you don't have that this is never going back to school and just on a whim\nJust an absolute who am\nI got the idea I I'd I'd never even seen her video I didn't even know the late ... videos I didn't own a VCR you know my wife or newlyweds I think we didn't have any money and the guy winch there'd be about auto because it's about sent out by video and I went to the blockbuster store they'll ... and I rented\nA VCR ever rented a couple of hunting videos\nAnd it took it home and watch them both and I thought I don't know nothing about this but I think I could make\nOne of them [laughter] and they just yeah and that's how it started\nMy first one was a grand slam up here and uh you know spent every time I rode late in my life it was expensive endeavor to make a hub video and my wife said you're crazy and she probably was but by the third year\nUh I had four or five titles and and the demand got fairly great and I told my wife and I you know I think I can make more money making videos that I can even paint and then she was behind it and that's where it started and uh and they ... from their while\nNow ... ... have you have you just made videos or do you actually have a show that runs regularly on the on TV\nWell for for the first Fifteen Years of my career I just made the hunting video because back in those days that was the outdoor entertainment sportsman videos would go into rental stores\nAnd then they will ramp the videos\nBut his that started to phase out television became more prominent and in the early to thousands I I got a show on the outdoor channel and I have been there ever since so uh uh the days of the video and you know now actually I have a set of six that I Would\nBe these I'd be glad to sell somebody they make great coasters\n[laughter] uh uh\nYou know now now it has evolved into television and of course now even bad is evolving industry video too but all that it's it's a never ending of all I but I it just you know I'm sixty four years old now and the people you know occasionally ask where are you getting ready to retire as a retired from what I could go hunt\nMore you know that's a great point a great\nYeah but I I don't you know I'm kind of like the you know I I was kind of a dog Rickles banned the comedian Don Rickles\nAnd who you know recently died and he was about ... but his his goal in life was to work until they died and uh 'cause he loved doing what he did not said I Love doing what I Do I plan on doing this until it's over with for me I just enjoy going in\nSo this is a like a set a line in the sand we would never ever allow that to happen\nI think a lot of people here Dave are confused because\nThere are various prescription that that go with national park in and like you just you just made the same as like a lot of us didn't use it on the part well it's not a bargain to national river but it's run by the Park Service and I think that distinction is what confuses a lot of people because when\nWhen it came out that they were going to name the new river gorge national park everybody's like well I thought it already was you know yeah so there's a there's a lot of confusion there but there are various prescriptions and each one of those carries\nVarious regulations and rules\nYes now let me tell you that this there they'll give you a little more facts so there was a little more than four hundred parks and they may be they may be a national monument\nThey may be a national seashore they may be in our case a national river they earn minister by the national Park Service so you go to the river and you see the Smokey Bear at the park ranger\nAnd you see the arrowhead logo\nI'm allowing clear on the trucks bought out of the four hundred parks minister by the ... plus four hundred plus minister by the national Park Service only about sixty of them are true national parks\nExactly that's what I was getting it yeah\nYeah so this brings me to answer your original question why would you want to park well ... ... out of the four hundred only sixty ... of something that's really really special in America and that's why we want a national park um you know\nWe take hundreds of thousands of people on the river and they are blown away they see a special sometimes I think when you were ...\nSo close to if you don't really understand how special it is so to me the question is is that ... of a national park and I think after forty years of being the national river it is time that we have knowledge it's a national treasure now again\nCongress Trump's all there is no rule and regulation that Congress can't override so if you want to park that has hunting and as a hunter I'm telling you I see it as a biased towards hunter's meaning\nHunting is clearly tourism I mean I spend to its amount of money traveling by ... by bows\nNo argument there I mean I ... I agree with you hunt honey on is a tourist attraction mine so my biggest concern here Dave and and you know not necessarily now because the guy running the department of interior lord knows he's a hunter and the guy who who previously was the superintendent at new river gorge national river who's now in Alaska\nDenali I Can't remember his name but he was a fantastic so he was a hunter\nBut you're not always guaranteed that you're going to have those kind of people in charge and you and I both heard the stories from various people past and present in the D you know or who have\nBut it heads with a lot of people within the Park Service bureaucracy trying to get things accomplished even when it comes to Beijing\nJust doing your work going managing the fishery that is the new river in trying to uh do various things that they they end up butting heads with a lot of people who aren't necessarily from here who are assigned here from somewhere else they come with a different set of\nAttitudes ... a different set of a a a different looking at it through a different reason they're very much preservation is which is what part do is we talked about\nRather than conservation is in a lot of times those do\nYou know you know they they don't always\nGet along they usually conflict in\nYou know normally in those cases the Park Service gets the upper hand\nThat that's my theory is that down the road suddenly you know that that conflict is going to be detrimental to sports men who want to hunt and even fish in the new river new river area\nWell again Congress Trump's all sort of Congress passes a bill just like\nIt did with the ... national river congressman or a whole Senator Byrd\nPut language in the Nineteen Seventy eight legislation that said hunting and fishing will be eleven and they were gorge will even though some of these people in the national park come from places like let's say California parks they have a culture towards preservation\nBut they cannot disobey the law they can't do it so it's a loss it doesn't matter you could have the most conservative\nPark superintendent in the world and he's just at a national park if the law says hunting and fishing shall be they have to I mean I go to jail if they do\n[laughter] so I don't know if we'll go bad extreme but yeah I Know what you're saying there so\nSo the question is it's a cultural question what you're talking about your right and you then you are correct they do have a culture that is more towards preservation no question\nHasn't always been that way though I mean you know fifty years ago this is not your dad's mark service lived yeah let's let's admit that\nYeah well now here's the irony of all of what we're talking about so um\nWhat's for example the largest um group that helps parks and national parks conservation association\nIt's I it's ironic that they would be fighting us and and you know why they don't want it because they're afraid if it's the camel's nose under the tempting they're afraid that if we get this passed\nThat it could spread to other parks and you know what my answer to them is\nHallelujah you know I think there are parks that you should be able to haunt him I don't want somebody in Yellowstone taken out of buffalo you know was walking down the road but you know\nTake take Denali for example you've got some place that only four people have been in the last year in somebody's allowed to go in there\nAnd taken out of there you know it's just good conservation\nYeah I mean there's a key conservation it has to be properly regulated there can be proper permits three there needs to be\nA proper balance a balance dumb but yeah just to prohibit hunting in a place which is what I fear will happen here then you've you've created a you've created a mess and you've robs sportsmen in West Virginia of a lot of that comes to ever comes to that and again I'm not necessarily against is but that's my concern is\nI guess it comes down to I don't necessarily trust people in power especially these days\nWell here's the bottom line it'll come down to three choices and there may be something that's that I'm not aware of right now the first one is is that nothing happens\nAnd we stay where we are for forty years what's bad about that what's bad about that as we acknowledge is West Virginia is that we're not ... national park I think we are the second thing that can happen is is that the bill passes and all of a sudden\nA national park has sportsmen hunting right now we do allow hunting than the national parks but it's more Colleen that's more\nYou know overpopulation kind of stuff but so the ... the second option we change something in my opinion should have been changed fifty years ago I'm actually amazed the Teddy Roosevelt\nDid not allow some hunting in some parks the third thing that can happen is that there's some kind of a compromise and that's a very good possibility so if you have a compromise for example we talked about the knowledge and this becomes a parking per se or\nIf that compromise happens the good news is that some of the concerns culturally that you're talking about we'll change you know I mean culturally hunting is known in a national park of course are the only thing I don't like about that is that we gave up in other words [noise]\nAgain then you come to the point is West Virginia murders is new river gorge murders of being special\nLet me ask you let me ask you something else about this and and and this is something that has been saying I don't necessarily know business case or not\nYou would ... does it is there something in this for the rafting industry in that you feel like you can attract more people do a national park than national river because people don't have a clue what a national river means okay I've heard that argument is that because they've got room\nYes this brings back the original question your question is where your question was why\nI prefer if you looked at it as tourism instead of rafting in other words what happens when a national park comes there there have been studies and it's there will be growth no question\nWell yes rafting will grow a little bit so there is a personal interest although as you know I've sold the company and ... still own a little bit of it and I stood on the board but it's no longer like it used to be but it's less about rafting more about tourism\nThink about every national park you've ever been to think about Jackson Hole think about\nUm tendency going into the Smokey the entrance cities um think about um even going into Denali or Livingston, Montana going in to Yellowstone\nWhat happens is the entrance towns like ... like Fayetteville like oak hill they see the growth that's what happens so\nThis the reason the answer to why is that we have seen tremendous growth and tourism but it's called in and West Virginia for the last\nOr so the groundwater starts increasing and the temperature starts dropping we start start getting colder nights are with us from that perspective or it helps a lot of we also are a lot of times I have a difficult time if if the bridge talk a starch bonding a little later\nA again

five last night I think we all thought was really good not now you I'll admit there are a lot of concerns\nA couple of observations first let me give you the or the tax law and you can ah Texas a thrill for talk three or four three oh four talk three or four or call into the show the eight hundred seven six five eight to five five one eight hundred seven six five talk so we're all again take phone calls or tax coming up\nWe'll note how historic this performance was for West Virginia last night and I will get into some of those are unfortunately I'm a very\nSad numbers but I don't know observation and you were there so you could see better outside of the TV screen seemed to me like West Virginia had a very difficult time maintaining their footing on that surface wisely secular David filled it seemed like he was\nRunning on ice most of the time I saw him\nOn the ground more than he was up right on some of those ... yeah and it didn't rain throughout the day it was actually pretty nice a fifty five the kickoff got down to maybe forty eight by the time the game was over a cloudy skies at times but no\nRain but throughout the last couple of weeks they've had extensive rain in that area of violent ... is a matter of fact\nThey had closed all they've got a lot of parking lots around the area a lot of them are grass they closed off all the grass lots because the grass lots were so saturated they didn't want cars in there so while the field wasn't necessarily swampy in him being on it in pre game\nWasn't sloppy but you could see already in pre game warm ups it was starting to junk up pretty good\nAt that point so yeah there was an issue there again that's an excuse for West Virginia performance because I Would say it had to play in the same thing they slipped a few times as well but not to the extent of West Virginia but you are that was an observation you made it that is correct there was there was some footing issues that at jak steady\nWell and of course we'll find out over time it unfortunately may across West Virginia defensive back for an extended amount of time with this because he just simply slipped\nThat how he got under the headline that I eat a lot of yeah it was an on contact and so yeah and he would off on a cart um\nHaven't heard\nThe extent that injury but I'll admit him leaving stadium\nDid not look good and um you know there were a couple of guys today I don't know if you don't come bright spots but I thought\nPlayed well certainly during pits are not eating not just the scoop and score on the field goal block but but other points I thought played a fairly well also but you know the injury situation for West Virginia is well you know talking to Tony Gibson after the game he was first\nGosh I Can't use and skews we've got tons of other issues with the injuries are have become a factor for this football team um they didn't play well enough last night that you know if if they were all healthy\nThey win that game but it is you move forward or unless guys start coming back from injuries pretty quickly I'm just going to be an issue West Virginia is going to have to deal with and\nIt's hard to deal with because I said it before you know Dylan talker who didn't play yesterday I thought actually shake Campbell played really well in in his dad but\nOut of your top five line backers uh come in spring practice you're now down to one with David long so for others are are no longer available now Dillon I don't think his long term like\nThe other three but again that just shows you where you're at you're starting to get in and the secondary because of some of the injuries and some of the movement you had a we talked about the alternative line issues with some of that because of injuries and that\nThat places well Joe Brown ... gotten a lot of talk all for not playing because of his injuries situation in recent weeks get dressed yesterday but I never saw him play snap I got a you know what just thinking of it I didn't look on the participation was but\nI'm Ninety nine percent certain he did not play at all either so ah Isaiah hearty got to start again that that position\nOr God and so you know I get this team that this is off we come really good for West Virginia they need to get healthy badly\nYeah comes comes with a good time comes however after a very unfortunate performance you got a you've got to sit on now for two weeks or a less than two weeks or for West Virginia I'm you bet you shake Campbell twelve a taco holes in his first start six\nSolo six assist and also to track was for law so a shake Campbell plays a pretty well as Josh Norwood a out of the the secondary for West Virginia\nLast night All right so coming up tax phone calls will get into the historic numbers of where that ranked in terms of poor opposites performances from West Virginia we'll talk\nA deep bench to the mountaineers or did enough to hang out in the game but um\nThat's bought their blitz the ton never got
