I have the west Virginia commissioner of agriculture across the table ... good morning good morning Chris glad to be either I just have to know the historic perspective of having the two of you\nAre in the same room together in the last Twenty years I've done the show there probably never would have happened so\nYou're probably right 'cause I mean when I wrote in your office there was that there was an animosity but Steven I we hit it off right off the bat and we've agreed to uh\nIf we agree on most issues of rigid disagree on one we vote on the one issue that we move on to the next issue well the real work closely together on like on the issues and things of that nature we've looked worked very closely together\nThe reason I have you guys in the morning though is because it's something that has always been very special to me and that is the hunters helping hungry program which since its inception has been a fantastic opportunity for hunters you get extra time in the woods to get to harvest additional deer even if they don't need them they can direct them to people who do\nAnd the biggest ... and I think even the mound you're food banks says this was the biggest red meat donation they get every year is from this program when general hunters donate their mate\nThe biggest problem we've always run into with this program is there just aren't enough processors around the state geographically in some areas to make it you know worthwhile\nIn a state or you can talk a little bit about this program I Know it's something the dean ours always found to be very special\nWe it it it's very special to the dean or you know it was started in Nineteen Ninety two and sits in since its inception in West Virginia we've had over twenty five thousand deer donate almost a million pounds of venison and we provide at one point three million meals in Nineteen Ninety to to the needy in West Virginia\nOr one of the things that I noticed in a in a tending our our herself into Hungary program is exactly what you said there are plenty of dear to be donated we just don't have the processors\nSo after two or three meetings I said hey wait a minute let me call my good friend can't land heart overt department a bag he he can help us here and he graciously has we actually have someone from his office sitting on our part board now\nAnd we're starting to see new processors come on line and that's the important thing we can use as many donated dear as we can get\n... ... you're ... you're the commissioner of agriculture you know all the guys are cutting meat out there what are you done to try and up the number of people participating\nWell actually it's been a communications issue really on we actually go out and we're talking to the meat processors we the first meeting\nI had a areas of greatest need and then we went out and we look for the uh processing facilities and now uh you know Glenn Adrian\nWho is actually the director of the one shot that does the fun ways that governors one shot incorporate is does the fundraising is actually going out and talking to these processor to show how it how it works obviously there's I think there's going to be fourteen processors probably in the program this year\nFor USDA inspected and the other nine or or the other\nUh ten will be inspected by the west Virginia Department of agriculture meat inspection program so uh we're out there making sure that uh\nThe processors understand the rules and the and everything else and working with them because they have to follow certain rules for the safety of the meat for that is going to be redistributed to the citizens\nOne of the things that has always been hard to overcome is in places like the eastern panhandle or in the northern panhandle you have processes that serve\nBerkeley county or or Hancock county but they're in another state there in Ohio there in Pennsylvania there in Virginia those guys don't want to participate in West Virginia is hundreds up in the hunger program because their own state has won how hard it hasn't been defined in state processors to be part of this a particularly in those areas\nI think it's getting a little bit easier as we work collaboratively to educate the processor on what this is doing and the program has to be a little bit flexible because the process or has to ...\nThis they're mature and managing property and just being patient ah but but yeah yeah it it all came together the first day of\nOpening a season here in West Virginia two thousand Eighteen yeah your job is here in Boone county great ideas how did yeah which is which is sometimes difficult to do defining maturity or in the ... counties that yeah yeah\nYou do me a little bit about how long you said you've been watching this here for five years how many different encounters have you had with him over the over the course of the five year period\n... something funny Chris uh you know last year last season opening day I took my wife out it was that um it was the first time we had the property and five years I took my wife out and opening day season last year that thought came in Pittsburgh ... yards\nHe was a he was four and a half year old at that time and I told my life as\nI said and if you take him out so you take him in Haiti and she said no let's wait on the old mature but that was in the area he was eight and a half year old eight point on our thoughts for that if if he if we let him both of them\nTogether on the property that that old buck would be more mature and would run that\nYounger bug with the larger Iraq run him off of the property but um she said no she wanted to wait on that big at the old eight point and\nThirty seconds after she said that the old eight point came in and she was able to take him and ... them and uh but but the process was you know we uh we were able to uh to get this land five years ago and I said to myself I\nDon't know if there's going to be possible where it's a rifle county but I Want to give up my best shot so I started to manage the property we didn't ... we did not set foot\nIn the woods did not pressure that's that is the key to this that to the success I think of the of the whole story is we did not pressure\nOr we did not pressure of the day or or uh any at all we didn't go into the woods we we made our presence very minimal or\nWe I put together a a a ... feet up food plan nutrition playing for the deer where our plant food plots in spring and a late summer um to help carry the deer and help them sustain him to to increase the carrying capacity of the land that the more deer could have\nA good consistent nutrition um and then I started I have to cut it to ... some areas um ... where there was a lot of mature chamber there needed to be some more early succession of growth\nSo uh uh uh optimize the habitat and under growth and um and just over the whole process I started I watched this bike as a as a three and a half year old critic who he was about a hundred and teenage eight point and the top man that's a cool looking here because he had really get\nA base is really good at math\nAnd man from three and a half to four and a half he went from you know about a hundred and ten eight point somewhere in that ballpark to about a hundred and fifty five two hundred and sixty eight ... last year\nAnd I was like oh my gosh this year has great potential and um where this track lands just a hundred and eighty acres it's not a massive\nPiece of land by any means ah you know he was travelling during the ... he would travel off of the property and I was concerned about him being taken you know on on another property or during rifles safer\nAnd all that kinda got now somebody else my buddy told Mitchell has found one in one of the sheds\nA on a on a a a piece of public land and uh adjacent towers and being a\nAnd then another fellow at found another one of the sheds and work to kinda got out and I was like you know this is this is the I'm not seeing him you know a I'd seen or been watching him and I was like you know this is probably the year I made to I Need to make it happen yeah\nTell me about opening your ... and how did how did they come to believe that he he was right there at the right time\nOh I you know I had been ah I've been watching and what about spotting scopes I have\nOurs is a a footage of him he you know those those box until\nIt's usually until the acre in soccer is\nThey won't be pretty patterned the ball um but usually when I heard this fall man there they will change their patterns and go to go to the acorns um but he was on a consistent pattern and where I had played in some uh some really optimal a spin\nShe's a plant that they they really like\nUm he was ... just staying on that track\nNow say this he was starting to tell me in a little lighter or you know as the days get shorter and they become more wary uh uh you know the\nThe more the season goes in and and even when the foliage balls\nThey become more wary but I I had I had just been watching his pattern and just staying consistent trail cameras play a big role I had several ... cameras out and I was watching and the area I thought he would be of course\nHe never came [laughter] I thought I really thought he would change switches pattern to come to\nThis other region a that was a little more secluded a but he he never did I but but just watching him and staying consistent with that\nIs how ... and the day you're Johnny Mae what time of day was it in and did it take long for him to get resumes\nOh let's say what I thought it was going to be you know it it's never clock or you know [laughter] you can never cancer or captured the eggs before the pet because man I'm telling\nYou what I'm man that buck\nHe came in the same way all these tens of thinking about the same time but you know the wind\nThe when I was watching it all the evening and and you know Scott ... is a really good at the ... to to monitor the wind and the and to watch the wind direction but now it was it was not it was not correct that die for some reason\nBecause it was blowing in in um it was bowling almost in the direction he knew that he was coming from an almost ... because I didn't want to risk that I thought\nIf I get high enough in the tree um uh if I get high enough industry that will hopefully take my wind over top of him but he knew something was not right man the video that we got out of it coming in my wife she was a help make sale\nVideo we got up and have had his nose in the whole time was when they and they said was the same moon and but then it kind of ... at forty six yard and\nI had a whole I had a opening and I thought man I'm\nI'm a need to take the shot because he's wary but I thought no I'm not going to do I'm gonna wait just a little bit um I was I had my ... and I was confident out Seventy yard but I\nI wanted to try to get him in for forty yard during and uh just just to be a hundred percent cost that to be you know what I mean to make sure that I put a good ethical shot on it\nAnd he came to forty six yards locked up I'm like oh no You're Joking well he went in and he's going back and forth and [noise] there's some other fear in the field as well there there are a little wary but he they're not as where you see it so\nHe packs at back and kind of walks back and walk back into the chamber for a while I thought it's over this at this time this is five Fifteen I thought it's over and uh I was watching some other dear we were failed and then and then\nAbout five forty five\nI look back and he he's coming in and go out below me and about thirty five yard or through the trees I couldn't seem for the foliage killing that close and I was like oh man\nAnd he stepped out in the corner that field where the edge of the timber met the field and started walking that field edge walk that feel that he got he finally the first holy popped out there and he was Eighteen yards from me\nAnd I just I was patient and waited until he was a quarter ing away\nAnd um he took a step and I I I granted with my mouth just stopping settled the pan squeezed off and uh he uh after after my shot he he ran probably\nMaybe a hundred and fifty yards\nAnd a ... and expired\nThat's ... how big the estimate is rocky is now\nYou know without this is a rough rough green score that we just\nDid a out here in the yard or with a with a a flexible tape measure but it was a it was what we got was a hundred and Seventy eight and ...\nMy mom on\nI don't work that then yeah and that's the gross that's ...

com\nTomorrow is Columbus Day but the nation's largest city named for the explorer will not observe\nI thought I'm from a defensive standpoint you could take away\nThe run defense because this team gassed your last year and so you know I there was marked improvement there you saw the fact that you asked your last year and then you saw you know the freshman or this year so little one two punch that was a little worrisome going into how West Virginia would be able to defend\nIt and that did show a very well twenty six carries eighty yards three point one yours for Kerry or for Kansas so you know as you said Kansas still juggling three quarterbacks\nAlthough they may have found you know at least the guy for next week on Saturday or with the performances they saw but uh I don't know how much you could gather you're going to see a much better quarterback this coming Saturday than you saw this past and how to receive\nWell certainly in in that area in a you know I I I guess they'll start to president again I mean he certainly if you if you win at Oklahoma State I guess you deserve to be the start of the next week but\nThey've gone through three themselves this is this is the third or in a way you perform yesterday I'm surprised he wasn't the first ... ... that's somewhat shocking but he was a highly recruited kids coming out Arizona I did not realize that prior but uh he had major offers in moving the\nAlabama Crimson Tide who turns on the groups who died\nSo I Wonder if you actually had a solid offer from Alabama can you\nWait was candidate yeah exactly but but you played very well in in all of a sudden for a Iowa State often that has been anemic through the first five weeks when the seasons are all of a sudden became really really good in six\nYeah you don't expect you to lose a home twice in the span of a three weeks and they did and did not look good he's doing it\nReally did not think about let's go back to the red zone problems with real career a little bit and\nLet me throw something out and get your guys' opinion do you think\nAnd it comes back a little bit I Know some of these are our PTOs so it's it's not so we'll do you think there is a low number pattern going on here that maybe West Virginia maybe even subconsciously West Virginia is trying to force some things down on the red zone to run wills passing touchdown numbers up instead of trying to run the ball down\nI think it'd be very subconscious if it is because you're West Virginia has been so good in the red zone and we've talked just two weeks ago but how that was almost an unstoppable play well obviously Kansas figured out a way to stop it\nI mean that was his official says anything West Virginia had been in the red zone Fifteen times prior to yesterday they scored every time they'd been in the red zone and twelve or more touchdown mhm so again they I think they just said you know what we're doing what works we're going to go back to it\nKansas and smart enough to figure out a way to to combat that\nYou know watched one of those sequences yesterday where he had an interception and he literally made the wrong decision on back to that place he handed off into a seven or eight man bought it and then he threw into a three man rushed down on the go on when they were dropping eight instead\nOf just bodies everywhere so I really feel like it was a situation where they use the word is populated where he'd guess wrong once and then he went back to what should have work and\nYou just you know your your step behind all yesterday and some days you know you can you can get ten straight quarter flips and you're glad you did that you can't get one and I think he was in that mode where he started pressing and he saw him at his worst really yesterday and yet it's just for like a zillion hours and ... down to sort of off that all those mistakes\nYeah that that are PO is not always just a free snap fried I mean a lot of the hosts nap read and you got to think on the line in ... been really really good at that\nBut I Do think he made some assumptions\nThey're based on what he had seen before maybe even what he saw pre snap and didn't adjust had he as he is just it's so well and other times with a couple of times at least one of those maybe a receiver could've helped him out\nI mean again he's thrown into covered so you can't take away his mistakes part of it but I don't think his receivers necessarily helped him out at least one of those times as well\nAnd I've never seen David Sills quite as animated before halftime and I don't think he was\nChewing on well I think he recognized that will was in a funk like he hadn't seen and it was more of an encouraging fist pump and kind of thing but it was it was fun to watch those two guys interact in the you know what do you do your buddy when he's in a funk and he's getting all down south\nTo be honest with you it's the fans enjoy it I Know I think the fans get\nToo caught up in every single play in terms of as high as ... I'm In you know people ready to jump off ledges after yesterday's game that uh you know I even saw a newspaper article headlined was just focused on\nA wills Heisman Trophy candidate seats I say it takes a hit plus\nHe didn't lose the Heisman yesterday you know you lose the ... when when you lose\nThat is when you start to lose the highs and we saw with Gina Smith I mean when you start to lose football games here's the other problem you're going to have with him\nComing down the stretch in until a jewel has about game of Alabama he's got Eighteen touchdowns know intercept yeah ten completion yesterday for three hundred and thirty four yard\nSo it it's still Alabama loses you're behind him and uh you know all of a sudden you know the White House has twenty five passing touchdowns behind state buckeyes and if you look at their remaining schedule [laughter] they're probably going to be the playoffs\nSo you know\nThe joy the season that's my point enjoy the seasons\nDon't worry about every single series whether or not we'll ... until I hate\nTo ... when his football shouldn't be an individual game yeah and you're talking about hydrogen in your first of October or yeah or you know it's a little bit\nYou know what it should be worried about when it will\nRears good enough at the end of the year that he needs to be on the conversation Soviet at that time of the week week going well stocked up his stocks down that to me that that's the antithesis of of football in my opinion West Virginia you got to win Wilker didn't play great but as you said at the end of the year\nUh what's his name is undefeated you'll have some opportunities gets my vote or he didn't do anything to kill himself yesterday certainly didn't help himself but\nUh that West Virginia has a lot bigger issues right now than whether we're second third fourth on high as a reluctant highland voter I Will not consider my top three until the end of the regular theater and I live in\nLive in make or an assumption on something that could change the next week and yes I'm On there with you and I vote on it as well as they have in the past I guess I'll see this year I got a ballot honey you know we've talked about Fort Smith and the thing one in ... at the end of September a thousand as well Ben I'm by the end of the season he's on the top down\nHow about the bag on a ... it's it you know that yeah yeah I Wonder if that wasn't hurt on the SAT\nOr whether that was on the after the chased out hey it most athletic\nPlay you said in a while and it it certainly it at that point important because if you didn't chasing down that pick six in the in that game the\nFeel of it probably changing events gotta stop or actually didn't get to stop that an interception used to play or two later so that didn't end up being the death or would have been are certainly a hard blow would have been if he doesn't chase down that\nThat absolute defense I don't even remember even said to the interceptions for oh yeah he had to and then at Avon Ferguson yet or I don't remember which which are the three it was that he chased down or what he was playing defense on ...\nFortunately it's it was it was easy to to you know to the mix up there were a lot to choose from\nAre coming up we'll talk with you eight hundred seven six five eight to five five one eight hundred seven six five talk to us a call in or we've also got a as you would imagine a lot of tech starting to roll where you can touch the show at three or four talk thrill for as well\nI was with us until the top of the hour we'll take phone calls in reaction to yesterday's game a run through the polls and lots more still coming up so stay with us\nWell here's the green turtle now you can tell if you're watching the video place is packed Sunday football\nLate games underway and we've got 'em all here on the big screens throughout the green turtle including or we get to watch the raiders for the second week in a row\nAs they are taking all the chargers twenty to three I hate the raiders here's the other guys know rivalries over a long [laughter] long forgotten used to be the one yep long sets up and then\nThere will be replaced by the by the ravens and the banks are Vikings lay the eagles twenty three and that is ah six thirty eight to play in the third quarter so the defending Super Bowl champions try to avoid a two and three so we'll take a break we'll be back more from the green turtle coming up on ...\nThere are some like for us to imagine a world without ... bases interested then okay then that would that would look like in without coal they used to power plants we wouldn't have reliable electricity electricity prices\nRise local communities would lose jobs and our national economy would suffer so yes we can you imagine a world without cool and it's pretty scary at least to me as I say we need\nCode based electricity\nFor reliable or\nThrown jobs that contribute to a strong us and\nGlobal competitiveness\nThat's why Kobe's too interested in such a potent our energy solution now and for many years to come\nTo a\nA\nI went off in a Van Allen and I were\nSitting by each other and in the press box and after the first went looking for I haven't seen a somebody you know defense of a you know snap infraction penalty in years and lo and behold there is another one and then the one and the ... the data thought there should have been a third on the fake fun\nI don't know if that's a that one number the defense of snap infraction but he thought it was new legal snap\nOr they're so yeah that that was ... unusual market I admit but a currently both both defenses are making single golf\nI don't know where it will I think to in my career Twenty years\nAnd I think three in the first half yesterday and I wonder if one team started doing it because the other team was sort of getting away with it you know are\nBoth the match Jones poor snaps were blamed rightly or wrongly on the fact that he heard something in quickly went with it or I think a hearty jumped off thought once I Believe in the red zone and immediately pointed and the defense like you know the yelling hug so yeah I worked in the backyard and I guess it used to work in college football until yesterday\nNow the ... is the house now the right guy to twist and actually there were only two that played there yesterday I'm as they already\nGot to start first views freer play the majority of it are admittedly struggle they brought in their backup center who for the first time in his career I mean he's only put a few games as a backup center in terms of Jacob ...\nBrought him in in a guard first his first play they'd run to the stone at him and he gives up the sack so you know welcome to the new position\nUm but yeah I mean that's the problem now again you're you're talking about your third year for a start you hope that Shakespeare and Joe Brown get healthy and you can return to\nWhere you were earlier in your own things seem fairly solid at that position but ah right now they're they're dealing with it until the until they get some guys health is uh they're going to have to fight your way through it I don't know if there's any other other option there\nWell after the tendency game we heard from a couple of ... is that Joe Brown is the guy he just has to get in game shape to be able to sustain when if they run tempo if they you know have a nine or ten play drive and then lo and behold the next week case\nThere is a starter and that doesn't jibe with what we hurting from one and then a bronze been injured last couple of weeks but even yesterday Hogan says it's his job that he can take it and that's really weird thing for me to say\nAfter game with the guy didn't play he's usually they hey we'll go with his available and I don't care about anything else but yesterday he emphasized\nThat it's still around spot if he can season so\nIt's a matter of getting healthy and and getting in good shape that you haven't played football\nIn a couple of yeah that and that's somewhat a word that was his biggest issue early in the season how much can he be in shape when he's done very little because of injury in the last couple of weeks ago maybe he could do some some conditioning stuff and they've got the old new training room with\nWith under water you know a treadmills and now that can happen to waving yeah exactly so they could you know he probably stay in a little bit of shape or that way but then again game shape when you're not really playing ... that that could be a concern\nI'm looking and I say I you know big bodied guy I think he's actually probably down ten or Fifteen pounds and last year when he didn't know to do anything except lunch forward and try to make contact with somebody but still a lot of a lot of coming off yesterday and then not stand engage with guys and sort of looking around\nFeeling like he's lost like not picking up things he's definitely a stopgap measure for now and they would still like to read certain but I Believe yesterday was that not as four games I Believe so I mean if you place another one he's yeah he's done because this will be his honor you\nHeartbreak jak we've got more phone calls coming up more checks rolling in eight hundred seven six five eight to five five or you can touch just three or four top three or four
