J. but I don't think I've ever seen anybody have the kind of moves at very Sanders had when he played for Detroit but\nHis his career was a a limited Gail Sayers also was just a a superb running back there's been a ton of good running backs up there I don't think anybody had the power of what what differentiated Jim Brown was\nHe just had the power go back and watch some of the old films of Jim Brown I mean walking over ... over linebackers bigger than him mhm and\nAnd just having incredibly ... power but he had great balance didn't have the speed I don't believe we're the acceleration of an OJ or very Sanders and but he had the power nobody I I don't think anybody ever came close to the power that he had bought\nThat being said Jim Brown sold Jim Brown is not a part of popular culture today\nA you ask the average or a a thirty year old and if they know who Jim Brown isn't bearing on what you're talking about that the the the old guy that you know they might remember the fact that you know he has worked with gangs before mhm uh you know Jim Brown comes into the substance\nShoot huge for anybody who is paid attention over the last Thirty years as to what he's been involved with a Jim Brown is not part of popular culture today with the youth and millennials like Kanye West is the leftist scared to death of Kanye West because he\nSmack in the middle of the the culture that is expected by the elite liberals to be a liberal supporter mhm\nHe cannot have a different opinion and if he does have a different opinion than Trump is exploiting the mental issues\nThat Kanye West had nobody was talking about mental issues a county was when he when you know he was up the award show where they know on the let no no no uh nobody in Aleppo was talking about his ah you know his mental state when I he said that uh George Bush a hates all black people because of Katrina didn't hang right\nThat that that that's not a because it again that's not a threat it's something at that time politically they could use a not so much the Taylor Swift award show moment but the the uh George Bush comment\nAnd it was notable to the left but they didn't they didn't label him as insane it if you\nThink about his demeanor because I I don't know by the way I don't know what uh uh uh what what do you call it the the hero voyage or or what whatever Trump is on right now\nI'm [laughter] I'm not sure what I mean [laughter]\nAh I I really don't know uh uh\nWell I think you can you sometimes you can go through a lot of Cairo journey is what he said yeah you're you're there you go through a ... a lot of Kanye West lurks go OK I understand this one I don't understand the sense at All right up there and I do I have no idea what this means yeah get back kind of get back\nTo you know I mean look look to the Beatles for inspiration she loves you yeah yeah yeah she loves you yeah yeah yeah well no I disagree with you if you're looking\nFor complete and total accuracy in a song tax man\nMhm yeah oh sure also from the Beatles yes\nYes I mean that's accuracy is yes I mean that that was come you understood that exactly wasn't one for me was that when they had the Ninety percent tax like was nine for you and one for me it was on yeah which was actually the ... right at the time\nYou know and I think the but\nIf you look at his demeanor in the way ... is actually taught I think he was on Kimmel things where he said a couple of things\nAnd listening to them it's like I was like if you don't look at the video you like it was that ... talking because his demeanor was calm and straight to the point\nIt wasn't the Taylor Swift moment it wasn't that it wasn't the moment after Katrina the George Bush um it wasn't that it was something that the content of the comment\nAnd how to use Google

six Ninety Rhode Island to go to Jay in Michigan Jay welcome on Kanye West Jay Hi you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show\nAre you doing where I just suck it up by not the fact that nobody is talking about the fact that kind of a West is from Chicago which is a one of the places that in Iran very poorly by the Democrats right now\nAnd that may be a motivation or its point of view um I also want to make the point that I think they're upset with the fact that\nI'm like you said he is irrelevant figure in today's society with the younger crowd yeah especially those in the range that they cannot reach which are those people that are right at the age of being able to vote\nBut don't care enough to pay attention to the politics or the man show was really dark out right now I'm is able to reach these people in ways that they will listen to his able to\nLike you guys are talking about as lyrics I'm a young African American man and I'm I've grown up around a lot of African American people who\nHave grown up with a mentality that Democrats are good and Republicans are bad and um myself I like to take things from\nWhatever point of view I see as right I Know the difference between right and wrong for me that's the most logical way to go and I think that it's the same thing with Kanye West teach these things that are right it's these things that are wrong\nAnd he's able to articulate and ways that people who are not listening are going to pay attention to this these socialist who are on social media constantly are going to pay attention to this so uh the leftist just upset because Trump is when\nAh you know thanks so much I think you bring up a some really great points yeah you're talking about a ... one of the things that is terrifying to the the Democrats and uh again you know there we've said this before\nThey believe that the people to both of them are stupid mhm that they don't pay attention to the issues Jonathan Gruber set it on health care well so the whole ... story early ... earlier this week\nThe left basically promoting the daylights out of that we know it was on a drudge and Fox News and everything else but really the left loves that kind of behavior when someone you know like a Taylor Swift comes up and tells people to vote\nDemocrat but that's further proof that you need Taylor Swift to tell you how to vote and [noise]\nIf she had said Trump [noise]\nThey would have shredded her [noise]\nOh yeah and so that you know that's what this if if if you say the other side [noise] there's something mentally wrong with you if you said

hundred to nine five ten forty six eight hundred to nine five ten forty six\nFrom what I Know unless they have made exceptions to the ... in some of those cases still\nRemain with Canada and\nMexico so you know we stayed in that when we looked at the you know when when we looked at the the trade deal formerly known as NAFTA for the most part they're really much isn't much of a difference\nAh you you know the I saw especially on social media Trump promised to rewrite NAFTA yeah he did a little bit\nBut he didn't do anything that he planned that he\nSaid he was going to do which was I'm going to reduce one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit right that this ... this isn't going to do it there were little winds here or there the problem with the the new trade deal as we said that will be a long term problem is\nAnd the president views it as a victory is raising the cost or to buy a car in Mexico the United states and Canada making it more expensive to produce the car therefore making it more expensive to buy a car\nAnd making it less likely that the president one of the president's number one goal which is to be able to produce products here and sell them overseas\nHas just been flushed down the toilet because it's going to be more expensive to manufacture vehicles here which is exactly the opposite if you wish to sell them overseas\nRight it's the one thing they're ... they're a couple of things but it's really the one major thing where I've no idea where the president stands on it as we know he's changed his mind on he'll change his mind on on trade in a week they'll go from as he did one for me and a complete protection is\nJust sounded like a total free trader I've no idea where he really stands\nI Do know though that in this in the the uh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA\nThat he viewed what he did to raise the price of buying a car and producing a car in North America\nHe put that as as his number one victory mhm which we have said that's what drives us crazy that's why we're tariffs babies [laughter] the original therapy but the original Tara babies as the president said now you know something we you know we laughed at it I Wonder how many farmers were laughing\nAt that comment though well because the ... you know he talks about protecting the farmers in the move on ethanol which was not a mandate and likely will have little if any impact because the the the the the fuel producers don't ... don't want it they don't want the higher blend\nThe it it may sound like a good deal to be able to uh sell a Fifteen in the summer first of all here comes the lawsuit here comes the lawsuit here comes a lawsuit\nUm but it will but even because at the refinery level you don't have to do the special summer blend but when there's no market for it\nThen there would be a ... a glut of the product\nAnd for the consumer that temporarily ... might be a good thing but the point is we're not going to get to eat Fifteen with out a mandate and he knows politically outside of the corn belt\nYou can't get that done it too so but appeasing farmers and and using that politically on on the ah on the tariffs\nAnd then they came back and said well we're going to give you billions of dollars to help you which you just admitted it's hurting them to that extent and they came back and said that's a tiny number compared to what\nWe're ... we're losing and the fact that we're losing the ability to be in that supply chain and once we lose that and we're not dependable in that world supply chain they're going to go somewhere else so it's not just the tariffs hurt us until they're lifted it's the fact that we may never get back in those markets again because\nThese countries don't know when you'll use national emergency or trade deal\nYou know or or the the the fact of\nOf ah the we need to get a you know a new trade deal or whatever to to uh to to terrify\nYou're not an double anymore you're not a consistent supply chain exactly and that is a problem that the you have but ah you know we noticed that you know it was obvious that President used the greatest victory and that's the weird thing on trade to begin with countries always talk about their trade victories\nAnd their trade victories were always when their citizens have to pay more money for goods and services right we don't know how that's a victory\nRight we can figure that one out here's one thing or to media asked that question mhm\nYeah I mean as and when when you look at it and you know you you talk about the supply chain Canada saying you know or or Mexico saying they're going to go to Canada and work out a deal you know for pork or as we call it Canadian Bacon and the when they set up that supply chain if they're happy with that agreement why do they go back to us for\n\nWhat would they are with any of those products from a domestic producer if you believe that the government is going to step in and disrupt that process\nThen you're going to make another long term deal elsewhere with someone else but we said this during the you know the um during the permit tore them after the\nUh when when the Gulf spill happened the BP thing that\nThat whole thing where you had companies are producers\nFrom uh the U.S saying well we can you know go somewhere else if we're going to do offshore drilling\nAnd you're not going to give us our permit back you know we can go somewhere else you don't just make that decision short term right and so\nYou're you're gonna have to make long term plans because you can't deal with you know the the shift in policy or you know on a ... at the snap of finger\nAnd and frankly\nThe ethanol thing has become you know the for the ethanol farmers\nThat's one thing but you look at the entire farming community and I'm Talking to political you know support if they're hurt going into and and this is what we haven't been able to gauge\nYou go to Iowa I mean and\nFor those people that the New York times I'm listening when you go to Iowa let me describe before Iowa is is this state in the middle of the country\nBut when you go there it is\nAll connected to farm it just like Texas has oil directly or indirectly\nI mean that is\nThe driver there when you go to the to the the farm belt\nThat's everything what's the impact right now of terrorists politically votes\nFor Republicans and in twenty twenty ... at the mid term this year and in twenty twenty\nFor the president and his reelection because keep in mind they may support Republicans who are on board for terrorists this time than twenty Eighteen at the midterms are they going to support the president who owns it completely if it's still ongoing in twenty twenty\nNot surprised by what happened the last couple of days you know you and I talked about it but\nAnd we said look the big terrorists were hit on September twenty eight mhm so I'm not surprised that when you look at you know steel and aluminum and how they have skyrocketed since the beginning of the year right and we said look eventually it's going to be a point where the market's going to say look you're raising prices too uh too much and when the terrorists went into effect on September twenty eight\nOr when the president is trying to get a ran a you know the sanctions on Iran which means the world oil market is going to increase the cost of oil even though we are producing\nA more when steel aluminum or up when we uh we had been told the fourth quarter could be hit because of the two hundred billion dollars in tariffs at ten percent that went in\nLots of ... September twenty eight eventually the market's going to react to that you can't raise raising the cost of doing business is never a positive for the economy right but everything that we've talked about and everything that every financial magazine has talked about about why the stock market has been hit is dumb and due to what\nGovernment action mhm regulation tech companies right or tariffs the the the the fed our our national debt and the bond interest rates going up\nAll of its related to what government intervention\nIn some way eight six six Ninety red eye\nTips from Jay Jay Keller and associates incorporated on customer service does your motor carrier provides uniforms for you to wear on the job\nDoes your company require drivers to adhere to a dress code if the answer to both questions is no that it might be a good idea to Institute a self imposed dress code\nOf parents can say plenty about a person the driver who shows up at a delivery dressed in a professional manner gives the customer a better impression of the company and the individuals they're working with if you're in the middle of a long run be sure to pack enough clean clothes for the journey driving can be grueling and demanding as the old saying goes close make demands\nAnd fresh clothing can help you feel more comfortable while on the road and when taking breaks for a meal this ship was brought to you by Jay Jay killer and associates incorporated visit us on Jay Jay Keller dot com\nThis has been the merits or drive a report Roger you buy pilots flying J shell real jealous and merits war after market run with the bowl [noise]\nBucks more readily ready to do with a record ...

S. continue for the most part even with the terrorists in place they say they're still moderately strong\nWell it doesn't change the the uh trade deficit\nRight a scenario is is not likely to change it wasn't going to change with the new NAFTA you know so that that thing is kind of off the table\nBut with China you have a couple of concerns the the very valid concern is the intellectual property consider mhm that's the real thing that the president has to address I mean the tariffs thing is going to have to be remedied but it's going to they're going to have to there was going to have to be\nAnd it's not just pressure from the U.S when the ... when the president announced that he was going to or it was announced that the\nPresident would be going to try to sit down with a G n China well\nThat's we need everybody at that table on our side of the table the rest of the world\nNeeds to be in China's face saying this can't happen anymore you got to play by the rules the because the\n... if you look at the the steel and aluminum tariffs if those are in place long term you're going to see you're going to see an adjustment on the stock market in the stock market is the least of your concerns ... the reason it's adjusting as because things are becoming more expensive like you mentioned uh the fed with interest rates\nAre the the you know I agree or disagree the sanctions on Iran is is\nCausing a lot of the global uh oil prices\nTo to go up or the Saudis have some play in that too yes and we'll see if they ramp up production and and and er and able and it has changed and it is an incentive a a again\nBecause it makes it more profitable for American producers yes and and were eventually going to get to that point I Believe I well\nIt depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we\n... really one of the most underreported stories of the entire year ... is that the United states is now on it happened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of oil in\nThe world mhm yeah um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of that that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did by the way I think\nThat's the number one reason a communist supporting a or the or the the president his tax bill went way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter] that'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the line to you that right\nSo the but but you put in place all those dynamics for great economy and all it's working up until what the ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like\nIf the cost of raw materials is still high and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly controlled by the government that is something that is policy put in place\nThat doesn't need to be there what\nHave you don't win and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property yeah we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even a for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a few things different in in TPP but remember the great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the ...\nCandle I had already agreed to that yes I'm a you know ... before so that was a lot of great victory and uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided\nYou know not to uh to take that you and I went through and and and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old NAFTA the biggest victory that the president has claimed\nThat he claimed was the fact that the terrorists worked\nTo get what he wanted with the automobile industry right all all he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile in Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah\nNobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that's viewed as a victory well if I remember\nTwo of the president's major goals\nHis goals his stated goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit I don't see how this does it because the majority\nOf the new NAFTA does is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent mhm\nUh and uh\nThe rest is still the same right\nSo you ask okay what were the what were the because that the president tried to make the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted an automobiles what did you get

have consequences denying science has consequences were reaping what we saw the sub had re reads\nAll right so we've heard that we've heard because you've elected Republicans and you were like the Trump that these hurricanes are happening\n\nAh Los Angeles times wrote that quote\nThe reporter the un report serves as a stark reminder of President Trump's status as a global outlier in terms of climate change Trump has rejected the twenty Fifteen Paris Agreement signed by a hundred and Ninety five nations to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions\nExposing skepticism about human caused climate change and vowed to increase coal burning end up quote but\nAs the more rights in an op ed piece of the New York post who is the political party who is the country and who under what President\n\nHas reduced greenhouse gas emissions but most when it comes to the substance who has actually reduced greenhouse gas emissions who is number one\nWas in Canada nope no nope Germany nope Australia nope France no\nThe one country that pulled out all the phony Paris climate accord reduced as carbon emissions by ... percent the most of all major countries in the world the\nSo the rest of the ah the rest of the countries are joining groups the United states has not we're not going to join the groups because they're signing a thing that they are because there's got to there's they're signing

away\nThe people that actually do the job and get the job done that\nAre viewed as the people that are destroying the world where all the scientific evidence shows you that they are not\n\nThat's where we're at today\nBy the way the number two nation in the world and not a a big nation but the number two nation in terms of reducing uh they're they're a greenhouse gases and ah and such Venezuela\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter] [laughter] so there you go\nAnd um it it's a it is but but that really is the insanity here's here's what I Wonder are they are they getting through to the generations beyond this\nWe know that the loudest of the left to the far left and the in your face\nLeft or the um the protest or the go direct approach by the left\nWe know that they're you know not only buying the hype helping create the hype but I mean on on all these issues that the left has been trying to sell\nLike global warming the generation behind them\n\nAre ... you see sometimes indications that they're greater critical thinkers\nAnecdotally mhm my my granddaughter's\nUm and and I I Try and step back and take my bias away you know and look at the facts you know in that situation as I assessed their generation the oldest of which\nIs a is Thirteen ah and then there I have to twelve year olds as well so you know those those early teens that's when you start forming right opinions but you're very curious about how the world works and all of that\nAnd and so I I ask them questions about their friends you know it just about behavior okay so you know I like social media is not is very different for that Twitter and Facebook not even on the radar not even\nBut also how things are presented to them\nYou don't want one of my granddaughters a few years ago\nIt was a it was they were they were showing a video on nine eleven\nAnd they had put sad music to it\nAnd then she asked me that following weekend when she was at the house but what do you think of that and I said well I don't know\nShe goes to have you ever heard the song and she named the song they were using and I said yeah yeah yeah she said I said she goes I don't know why they did that I said well why do you think they did that she goes to manipulate my feelings\n\nIn something that was already said\nThat just one observation again forget the fact that it's my granddaughter ... it was a it was a critical thinking but it was critical thinking about manipulation and and the left has been all about manipulation and politically both sides are but\nIs that next generation we've seen it we've seen their studies that show well the the generation basically behind a the the college age or college graduates now is showing more critical thinking and and not that they would be conservative\nBut if they are assessing things for what they are instead of the fantasy that the left promotes\nAre they the future of the oil we talked about during lumber who is the uh the uh uh a climate a professor that believes that yeah probably a a you know the greenhouse gases are causing global warming but leaves at everything the left is doing is actually doing the opposite\nSide of the opposite effect right it's actually producing and we've talked about this before but you just pointed out however ... ways the rest of the world is doing the opposite when you when your solutions are making the problem worse but you're signing an agreement\nTo make it better mhm that's considered better than if you're actually don't sign the agreement to do things that will make it worse\nAnd you go out on your own and you do the things that will number one get your cheaper energy and reduce greenhouse gases you're considered the devil right because you won't get along with the\nUh international community and sign an agreement all pretending to do something but if you actually do the things that you wish to do or you claim they're going to do you're actually going to do the opposite of what your original goal was\nWell because we've had a lot more valid and we've been talking about for a long time the scientific community should be having this discussion not to find who is going ... going to win the debate\nBut to find out if we can actually predict what kinds of cycles coming because that can affect a that can that can affect crops and everything else which can be devastating and also watch it if if man is causing it\nEr which by the way hasn't been proven or\nIf something's happening happening that we can react to ahead of time and protect a the population I had a

I don't know if there will be a bigger issue\nThat that will come out in the in in the next few weeks in popular culture that will reach everybody Kanye West I [laughter] I'm Sorry just throw that out I I just I don't know\nUh you know the the the president the president tweeting and the president coming out with outrageous comments to me doesn't drive anything anymore I don't I don't think it it I don't think it\nIn flames anybody knew or pleases anybody new\nIt's going to one plane the same people and it's going to make the people that love what he'd ... when he does that still love him but it's not going to change what's it think about it who gets to this day and age how can tend to twelve percent possibly be undecided and debt and and most definitely be going to the polls\nIn November\nYeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just\nOne small indicator it's a small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sleepy and the map for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats and one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now\nYou will for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the toss up districts still remains at thirty two already too yes I Would love to see which district that was that that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you what you do look at those thirty to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number or for a majority right so right now\nOnly Nineteen dubose thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nSo\nIt will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls are and we and we will more and more\nAre in the coming weeks that's going to be at the I think by the time we get back a week from Monday\nThings will start shaping up because those undecideds more and more of them will start making up their mind and that that's where a shift happens and what is the impact of the capital and that entire\nThing and really me and my look at the ... for example in Montana isn't a toss up state right with test or you know up or the last one was done not you know nine twenty two which had test her up for the one before and uh with the margin of error three point seven five and the one before that was tester up just to\nWhy isn't that a toss up state why is that definitely yeah on the on the Senate race yeah unemployment rate right and and ... my point is so yeah is the legitimacy of\nThe R. C. P. average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell ... and\nI guess historically can shift happened ah with ... if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done by the recent polls that were done in that race or the the uh you know test her up by by four\nAnd the grab us a margin of error is three point seven so that you know that right there could be neck and neck or they call like a toss up because of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error what's ... ... it's not a toss up that's my point ...\nMy point is that it's our sleepy has it has definitely blew\n'em\nUh applied the left believes that they apply their feelings directly to their feelings sleep that is the case for some\nBut most Americans look at it practically speaking and going you know this is a big deal to vote to be able to vote was a big deal and if they are to the point where they are you know in that likely voter category this is why those polls start to shape up the way they do and that's why likely voter gives you a better read but\nThey look at that and go you know it's a big deal on election day to get up and go cast my vote\nYou know I Know people show up and they're driven by\nYou know a slogan they're driven by whatever imagery but we can't forget the people that take it very serious they consider things they may not be immersed in it every day like we are for whatever reason\nBut they will show up and they make an informed decision and often it is a reaction Chuck Todd on uh with ... and and Chuck Todd who say well why do people get it wrong in and say twenty sixteen was a referendum on Trump but it really was a referendum on Hillary\nThat was a small part of it what what Chuck Todd as we're getting here because they are discussing the polls in the mid term is is about you know the house and Senate and not a presidential election and his point what he was implying is that Hillary's not here to be the the bad guy right\nWell what Chuck is forgetting is the real facts of how the Republicans in districts all over America outperformed Trump and that it wasn't a referendum on Hillary it was a referendum on the left\n... you know that that's a great point of the other point brought by the color of their ... and I think you can't underestimate this is that Americans may not know the three branches of government right\nUh you know and and that's what the poll shows Seventy five percent of Americans roughly could not tell you all three branches of government they might know one or two or they do zero but they couldn't tell you all three as you said you need to know all three to understand how the government actually works they may not be able to tell you the freedoms and the first amendment\nBut think about when it comes to due process\nThink about since Perry Mason let's go through all the lawyer shows that have been that had been on T.

S. P. S. that has not publicly disclosed Amazon declined to comment on the price hikes and the postal service declined to answer questions\nAny potential impact on the company the increases for partial select were steeper than in previous as a previous years us BS of the new rates are result of a regular review process and are set to take effect on January twenty seventh subject to approval from the postal Regulatory Commission alright\nA Trump has repeatedly allege that Amazon is to blame for the postal services financial woes and accuses the e commerce giant of ripping off the agency and treating it like a delivery boy the president created a special task force in April to examine the postal services business model sparking speculation that he would use it\nTo raise shipping rates on Amazon\nThe Trump equates Amazon with the Washington Post which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and as a target of Trump's anger about media coverage\nSo there you go that far from this is from political talk just a [noise] then again they have a long term deal with them they are not affected by it\nRight if that if that you know the pricing deal is in place and and look at what these us has done not ah I I mean just in general if you talk about or his\nA supply chain his delivery each a chain a from\nA to B a to Z I guess it was clear that that when he\nStarted making large purchases on his freight company that he was going to be doing more of his own delivery and so while he can't do it all\nBecause you have I don't know I don't know what the even what the numbers in terms of overall numbers of sellers on Amazon\nThe point being is that there are things coming from all over the world that are sold on Amazon and so it would be impossible for although because those has done other things [laughter] that people didn't see coming or I don't think any time soon he will have he will control completely his own his own ...\nUh but he is doing that more and more and that was to shut out more and more the the the um FedEx and UPS\nDelivery that was costing him more and more good costing the consumer more and more and he said this is not about shutting out the little guy is in fact is about creating more opportunity for the little guy and now they they you could go out and get your own local delivery uh buy your own local delivery a set up for\nA for Amazon and by the bands and everything else\nAnd be a part of that and and there's opportunity there it was about creating\nA a ... basically\nThe the ability or more and more to control pricing to keep prices low on Amazon according to these shows he\nThe U.
