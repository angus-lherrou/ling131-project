Bush and Karl Rove saying things like boy we can get this vote George W. Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas wonderful\nI'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\nOh a loss in politics by the way politics in particular a loss of sixty percent of forty percent is huge and that is based on an optimistic assumption most illegal immigrants come here for jobs but they also take advantage of government hand that says we know that the rest of us are paying for\nAnd by the way the Republican Party can never out do the Democrats and offering benefits\nI uh I think I use this phrase years ago when a ever voters given a choice between Democrats and Democrats meeting larger Democrats they choose the original ones they need us\nSo who these people don't vote for it's not that hard to figure out and if left unchecked the Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even on a purely selfish basis it is clear that we need to control the border not to mention fairness what do you say to the people around the world who have been waiting many years I've heard of people waiting a decade to get here but I have to undergo long waits an incessant paperwork to even have a hope of getting here\nSo they have to follow the rules but those who dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools is not the only thing but it's one of the tools so one color of this week and if you didn't hear him suggest that border walls don't work in the long run\nI said but even if that were true I bet they work in the short run while we try to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure coming to our country\nIt's to me it's the same ridiculous logic that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent America's like Americans like hates finally use\nAnd I you know I pointed Geraldo Rivera 'cause I watch them do a time and time again saying oh illegals commit crimes percentage wise in lower numbers the Native Americans as if\nThat matters who cares even if that's true if an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrant that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry no matter what the percentage is in that office and that wall by the way in Israel preventing Hamas from hurting Israel's Israelis is working to shore room\nA lot of these arguments is baffling to me unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms\nI more to say to you but I Know we have to go to the break surely let me give you the numbers and I'll go on a little bit more eight six six Ninety red eyes and that's the same as eight six six nine o seven three three three nine\nSo example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities were criminal illegals or given safe harbor if you come up with phony arguments like illegals will not go you've heard that they won't cooperate with the authorities if they know they can be apprehended or sent home so that's why it's important that you know we have sanctuary for them\nBut how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to care if they cooperated with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that they these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through reading schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free healthcare and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail usually in the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and they'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun the actually had a right to use the wrong language self deport there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no benefits I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be saying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government sending out the wrong message message with actions like ball legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United by language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language art history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed

that's eight six six nine seven thirty three thirty nine getting your take on illegal immigration and by the way I don't blame the illegal immigrants you may not have thought about this before\nI put myself in their place what would I Do if I was living in a country where there was little hope little opportunity and tyrannical government let alone violence like Salvador or the drug cartels in Mexico I don't blame them and I did television show years ago I had a TV show\nAnd I have people from all over on the opposite side of me saying yeah we agree that's the government they've given us a signal to come on over\nA or a mixed messages or it's not clear I don't blame them for trying to seek a better life\nAnd I blame us and the government and this idea of compromise George W. Bush he did the same thing as the wall to Wall Street journal\nOr he would you know talk about immigration how great immigration is no no one's arguing that people aren't ancestors are relatives came and landed in Ellis Island and they share our values and and what they wanted to make a difference and they want them to get freedom\nBut it was illegal immigration and by the way if you had a bad disease my knowledge is they didn't let you in\nThat's coming here legally that's a huge difference\nSo don't tell them call me in Iowa list every country has a right to have borders well unless you believe in open borders one world and you know good luck it could be Venezuelan a large scale or Cuba no let me know what you think and let's go I said I'd go to calls in let's go to\nSteve and I'm In a whole Virginia Steve you're on with mark\nOn it yeah I was thinking about that for some time and I'm One of ... you know ... why don't we start looking for every ... or ...\nAnd with all the aid of a though the money but we normally would throw in the end of the year we got him out of that we are on a daily basis\nSo why I like your idea by the way it's an interesting idea why do you use the phrase on document\nWell at that point it do you call it whatever you want it all up illegal what that's what I think lately but if you want to call it my dog that's fine you get Bill Bernie I'm lucky but not only that when we ship them or whatever on the\nBus or train whatever we look for that as well and or any children that are separated for nine in\n... in some ways you're harder than me but it it does yeah talking about a mile from the amount of aid\nThat's assuming you're giving it to every one of those countries which is the case for the most part of our writing\nOn state aid but they're stolen but don't well mania quite true me I said we don't give\nYou you don't mean in the United states you mean in the center\nOf the world I mean the world do we get eight\nYeah well we don't give a to the Soviet Union I mean you might say on now Russia there are certain countries you know you might say we get paid like the China you might say we give them aid because they take an unfair advantage of\nUs but there are a lot of countries where are we going to have a ... actually the\nActually the Russians are helping us more with the satellites right now than we may be helping them financially but that's not your point your point is it is a good one which is we ought to charge the country's um for their illegals coming here I I I kind of like that idea\nEven though oh\nNo no it's a it's an interesting idea\nFor them to monitor their own people at that point\nYeah and as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us their porn right a lot of especially Mexico writes I send us send us the poor and his ... not our problem right and there's your problem ...\n... ... and then you can also add on to the health care bill of\nHealth care Gillum totally whipped L. M. that eventually it will stop or stops and you know living but\nYeah I yeah there's nothing like the right in the Senate and that's the point right now it's been the wrong incentive you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get to have free hospital care right and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and this is terrific by you you you know I I Would come here to that's why you sit\nThere and charge interest and we can make money interest then you know what\nYeah you should have given this idea that President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for the wall\nYou know any better than I Do only about\n[laughter] I don't think that's a great coal thing Steve appreciate it very much they\nActually I I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be a way up there in the department of education but as a person I send to then I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's the head of communications for I think the department of health\nUh and so yeah it does happen and you know some people but you know what a ... it's tough and and that's one of the news stories that the I think they were heading someone else's leaving the administration it's tough to work there\nEspecially if you're conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want it's tough it's tough and a lot of your points that I just think that President Trump has given up a lot to become prison the United states you could say well it's an ego trip this power all that kind of stuff I don't think he needed that\nI think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power and that's another thing I mentioned this last couple of days if they can power not only hearings and subpoenas but you know they're going to go after taxes because they they're sure they're going to find something there\nThat though oh probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of the all the Russians but even if they don't what business is it um there's\nWhat his tax returns are it's just not their business I Know certain presidents have done hot I don't think they should it's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's none of your business Democrats or Republicans I don't\nI wouldn't want them to know what I don't I I pay what I'm supposed to pay and do my share but it's not anybody else's business by the way after Kevin hearings and all this other stuff as they go after taxes\nWhy to good people exactly why good people want to serve ... especially people that sense why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider\nDemocrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you how to live your life\nYeah they're the ... party that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those said hey I Can't wait to get home\nAnd that's going to be a real struggle and I had a lot of them are going to resist ride with a force\nAbsolutely absolutely yeah\nWe well it was you know when and thanks for your call when we meddle in other countries I don't mean coming to their aid in defense but like we did so after you've gotta be careful what you get I ... and all this talk of makes me think Egypt bride we we helped them over and throw a\nWhat's his name Mubarak and I asked of the time I was doing national radio and I said wait a second the what they called the springs something what was the term anybody out there can tell me I've forgotten her for a second I'm\n... now and Brian was helping me and not their spring there was some something when spring but anyway a defect as we got where she got to ask that question what's what's after this so you got rid of Mubarak and you got the Brotherhood Muslim Brotherhood which was tyrannical and certainly not on our side\nAnd then eventually ... took it over there we were saying maybe it was the Arab Spring I may you may be right Brian I think you are now that I think of it ... producer Brian so you know when I'm mentioning\nThe fact is that you you can't just do the spine when we did that in South Africa right you overthrow which you have and then you don't ask what's next is going to be attorney right open the best example might be Iran\nWe were so thrilled with Jimmy Carter to overthrow the shock yeah but they didn't ask goes next are you happy looking back and seeing what you've gotten instead of the shah\nI ... the biggest enemy maybe or at least our enemy that you might say Russia China but certainly the biggest immediate threat in terms of what they're doing to our citizens\nSo it's very important that you not just act emotionally I'm thinking it Gadhafi in Libya right Hillary was for that Obama was for that what is your place Libya with weren't didn't they killed Americans right\n[laughter] you ... you you just can't operate let me get myself in trouble with some of your now in Saudi Arabia we got a real problem there what they did was horrendous in my opinion the stone assassinate people like that and go inside and chop them up and some people picked on me for that is that it's none of our business\nBut the other side in President Trump's got a huge problem now is they're our biggest supporters in ... you know besides Israel in trying to work against Iran cause Iran's their threat to\nWorld is very complicated and their offer no easy solutions or maybe you don't know this historically we had a war there was a war or not we between Iran and Iraq\nAnd you know you got to choose sides sometimes they may both be terrible we worked with the Soviet Union during the more I think about this we work with the Soviet Union during World War two because we had a bigger enemy and Hitler\nSo a lot of left us and liberal say well you work with these people what how do you respond to lead well life is not easy you're faced with difficult choices and you got to figure out what makes the most sense\nThis stuff is not easy\nAnd that the same thing with illegal

sense so if you don't contribute to your country I think that's the highest sense which is what our military\nAnd most of our people who serve this country at the highest level can say\nThat they do um it's nothing they immigrate King County um so I Would say that I as a ... you should feel that um you come into this country to contribute to the absolute most\nIf you don't think you can do that then I don't know what your contribution to this country is I'm\nJust being here it's not enough to know what I mean\nYeah I Do in fact I think you're hinting at something many of them come here and they wind up with an entitlement mentality right they're entitled to serve as the hospitals schools whatever you want to say\nAnd and that you know what here's another great point what you give away for free I called the great point 'cause it's mind when you give away for free is usually not value\nWhat you know you give free schools and they don't value the school year give free medical care they after a while people think it's coming to them so we even hurting them the the illegals because we're not making them value what we're giving them\nRight right so I think I have one final point you might find the owner is that uh if if you take away a oil given for free and what do you have you know and if you come here with nothing and they expect the most\nUm you really can you would think so you should take at least a ... in my in my expectations of what I can give and what I can take it always has to do with what my contributions are like comedy and I gave the least then I Will be\nDoing the worst if I come here and give most I Will be doing the best there or are you counting to anything whether it's a job\nWhether it's a service position whether it's anything at all or

out now I teach adults you know what the kids would do with the free lunch you have any idea what they would do that they would throw in and they would take the ... they would take the green peas and toss them all over the cafeteria because they got it for free and they place no value on it\nSo in any sense yeah in in a funny sense\nEven with the illegals they they not only is an entitlement mentality but we're not even helping them because they didn't earn any if this were just giving it away for nothing and then we're surprised when they don't even value being an American and they don't share you stake in the community and give it a values in fact\nWe've made it so easy that there are now communities where people don't even learn to speak English because everything's done for them in

Gurley Margot Adler\nMark back with you again taking your calls let's go to Sylvia in San Diego Sylvia around with mark\nHi Hi I'm a kind of late for me but I just ah someone call it a while you were trying to heal while ago is talking about a century city in century state and about the people voting for them\nAnd I just wanted to say that I I live here where we vote on that\nCertainly not Governor Brown name and the whole state of sanctuary state which I don't I don't know how many of the city's pay attention to him I Know some of them have actually voted against a following his directions but I don't recall ever hearing any load about sanctuary cities out here and I you know the ones that I think as we\nKnow it wasn't so they were on it it's just that the Democrats in office a very liberal extremely leftist a Democrat as an office and he just decided that's a good idea does it and I from what I understand San Francisco's kind of a dump now just partly\nWhat it is when I was there a few months ago and I'm using it was amazing when I was walking the streets with\nMy kids are so many other just now look at this hand this hand as a weapon and then another time something ... someone says something about a knife that doesn't count how dirty it is now I didn't see this but they were needles all over certain sections I think they said market street\nAnd of course the problem with the trash and the and the homelessness is a problem but that's true yes you know everywhere in California right\nYes uh-huh but I think uh I I live in San Francisco in a long time I don't really go up there that much I mean it's quite far from San Diego and I've I've just never been into their way of thinking so um yeah it's\nIt's it's ... it's the only thing we voted on and I like to ask you one other thing I didn't mention is two fellows I spoke with first but but you have you heard the thing about the the\nI'm birth tourism it was on earth person that gets mentioned just a few people and they have not heard of it and actually it was on television some some time ago on twenty twenty dateline or one of those where they fly on these Chinese women that are pregnant\nAnd they have this place all set up and they go there and they have the babies get their little American citizenship for the baby and leave\nAnd then leave yeah no I actually I did hear that pregnant women going into hospitals yep they've got to figure it out and look people take advantage of the weaknesses in anything right especially your in laws source we of course we call that anchor babies right to so they come here and they have a baby and then they're they have all the\nRights and wrongs of course is wrong and an awful\nLot of people have not heard about that because I've I've told that she likes the politicians here and they well they are people that work for them and they had heard of that so I'm I'm Glad to get to see it on national radio so people can know what's going on it's we're very close to the border here so if I mean people come over here and dumped the baby's all the time I came down from I mean they have them\nAnd I and I just I don't think it's right I don't think a lot of the country and the other countries in the world do that\n... somebody had a major in Italy I said the baby out deals citizenship and they said no he was born in an air force us air force base so I don't know why we're handing out citizenship like if I can do it you know it's it's it's the parents\nThey're actually yeah glad\nThe actual do Sylvia there was a reason for it which is a ... with with the slavery issue we want to make sure that they weren't taking advantage of in any way but of course if you pass a law every every law by the way this is a phrase I've heard was at one time a solution every problem wasn't one time\nA solution to something else so you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing\nI Lived in say in Asia and I kept my kid to have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have the baby yeah of course they could go wrong with the babies late I guess very late\nWhat did they figure out how to take advantage of you are dumb laws that that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville or Jeremiah smart\nYes sir hey I'm\nYou're on the market you know well\nGreat I'm well I'm I recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant um well\nI wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married and then she ... she left she's gone and it's the fast track to a green card\nNow the way they have you ever heard of the way they act and I'm just not just touching up from what the previous the\nPrevious speaker was talking about um you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here illegally have a have a you know get pregnant\nAnd then just totally disregard everything and then live off of the government um you can't get deported you can't um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever no I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this is this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and\nThen they want to just stay here and and uh it\nIt it's an amazing thing I'll I'll go on my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience um I met her to live with it you know with a lawyer feet\nEverything I guess you don't ... you don't see your child in\nNo no um they do restraining orders\nI'm under the way they act as the women against violence um act um so if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are serious the fast track to a green card and\n... and you know um I Would probably I'll run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on talking about father's rights and what happens is the court system in in the

the admiration he wanted to be loved and I don't think he was his principles were strong as a bomber who's announced a leftist who believes what he says right trained by ... and ... and all that kinda stuff\nAnd I trained by al ... certainly was there and that was totally different Obama really believe this stuff\nAnd was the maybe the first left this well maybe not the first I'm thinking of even

wasn't about that with Bill Clinton let's go to a ... in Pittsburgh your honor was mark\nWhat thank you for taking my call\nI'm calling because when it gets um comment about the illegal aliens getting ... children in this country their children are not automatic citizens because their parents\nWas not under the solvent tree of the American government so these people from China that fly over and give birch their children aren't citizens and that and they\nProbably are that are ... my ... my understanding is they are\nNow they're not that kind of misunderstanding because their parent is not an American citizen they weren't\nI Know they don't have any other yet to be if\nI well I I don't want to argue that you may be right but my understanding is if their child is born here and that's one of the calls an anchor baby and those anchor babies are American citizens\nWell that's a ... a propaganda that wants you to think that way that the ... the parent has to be on the sovereignty of the American government and gets to give you another example\nOften Americans ... does analytics many many decades in another country and has children their children aren't automatically says ... because they have some kind of lengths that residents say in the United states before they had yet\nBut that's not true Frank or babies they don't have to they don't have to the parents don't have to have a ... as you say you find the citizens of sovereignty\nAnd ... and the color skin let us know if we're wrong but that's not my understanding that if if they're born here and that's why you see the people come here all the time he we talked about that a pregnancy in the hospital that people come here from other countries and tried to time and so the baby can be born here\nI if I'm wrong call me
