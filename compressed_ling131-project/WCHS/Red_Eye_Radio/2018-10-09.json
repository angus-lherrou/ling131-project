I. B. L. E.\nUh the packs that he promised to or not ah except uh in terms of that and and and not he well he promised to reject the the the pac money I guess in in earnest but you really can't reject pac money pac money uh ultimately I guess\nWhat the the point being is there's a ton of a liberal money coming from out of the state a ton of liberal press from out of the state\nUm and of course uh the the make up the demographics in those those areas that we talked about a bear county in San Antonio\nUh same thing so you've got all these are blue counties and these metro areas and and that's that's kind of the breakdown of it and he'll do well and and likely win and those that were that were mentioned uh\nSome other counties in or districts in the state but ultimately it comes down to the broader state\nAs it always does and uh right now it's got an according to our sleepy leaning Republican\nAnd looking at a tendency of of for example you know as as we look at how did the cabinet thing and uh how might it have you know change the way that that people are looking and you look at the CNN the Tennessee race\nAh Marsha Blackburn against a a Phil Bredesen or British it was up by five ... democratic challenger back\nFrom the poll taken just from the eleventh of the September to the Fifteen\nHe was up by five and a from the twenty ninth to the second Blackburn up by five ... from the second to the fifth which took us to Saturday and write a note tickets to friday friday yeah black burn up eight ... that's a third team point movement\nIn a matter of a a matter of a month and that's why we've always said we don't really\nWhen you see plus or minus ... or you know five or even six or even seven ... it doesn't give you an indication\nAs to you know how the polls may tightened and this is the time right now I mean I'm Talking about right now in the election right is when you get a much better idea we always hear from our listeners that polls are never right mhm that is incorrect analysis\nA you know\nPresidential elections for example you and I really paid attention\nA front in two thousand eight two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen ... after the election saying how many polls were close and normally you find\nUsually a a three or four of the polls were probably one or two we're almost dead on and three or four pretty close then you have the you know some of the outliers out there and we always bring that to you after a presidential election but the polls actually do do a good reading in the ... there were a couple of polls that were\nDead on they didn't have Trump winning ... because they just do the popular vote they don't do the electoral vote\nOr but they were dead on us to the Bo mhm what the Hillary won by what two percentage points for a and so there were a couple of polls that were dead on but they didn't figure out the electoral college so they didn't figure out in those states in those particular states because they weren't doing the electoral electoral college\nAnalysis right so uh but they had the the actual vote count which again we come to a presidential elections from now on if the Democrats if a case you're Cortez doesn't succeed in getting rid of the electoral college on the side of a you know a ...\nOr ... will will they start trying to figure out are doing more detailed analysis and uh because you've had a you know a a Trump you know have this had his victory so right it'll be interesting to see what what happens there will go be going over some of the polls but yeah the un says that we're doomed\nUnless we pay the amount by twenty Twenty one hundred\n... two hundred and forty dollars\nTax on a gallon of gas okay\n... no I Know I here's what I Will commit you what you I Am willing\nTo die I cannot speak my children grandchildren great grandchildren or anyone else in my family that is president now or will be present in the future I if I Am I live in a year Twenty one hundred will will pay that tax\nYou know it's going to happen don't drink some scientist is totally totally going to mess it up for me\nHey we found a way to make your lives six hundred years oh yeah yeah yeah well oh ... oh okay I thought you might come up with a new energy form like the movie the St ... with with ... ... well no she hears something by Twenty one hundred\nIf we're not transporting if [laughter] if if I Can't\nJust sit there and the ... just something ... which I'm giving up no but you're forgetting word where does the energy come from robots to disassemble and the Adams of a person and then put them back together that's got to be\nYou know it may take the energy that that a nuclear bomb would create in order to do that for human beings we're assuming that the energy source is there for beaming oh it is I mean it could be tremendously because it may beaming may\nLeave a huge carbon footprint or a black hole [laughter]\n\nSomebody's just came in like in the last minute you listen to the show going what the hell are they going to today man they've just totally lost their mind also coming up hurricane I'm Michael a could hit Florida as\nHurricane three well three and you know a hundred and ten miles an hour you look at the analysis a and and apparently from the flyovers as as you and I are following it and we are not meteorologist although John trout is with us of\nCourse every hour um and we we look at that and but you when you read the discussions the the discussions changed drastically and those reports from the national Hurricane Center on Monday morning and it started to show signs of that and that ah Michael strengthening\nA and having potential to strengthen greatly\nLate Sunday and Monday morning but then they saw there's apparently a sheer that's involved here that they said typically would mean that it's not going to be such a powerful storm but they said despite that share and I I read the ten pm central discussion on it and it said it defies all logic\nThat the sheer still in place or this this element essentially that would diminish the strength or keep the strength from growing I guess\nI'm despite that\nAnd they think maybe it's because of the size of the I'm thirty five mile high a it is it is showing great potential for strengthening so for our friends there\nUh in in the Gulf Coast in on the panhandle of Florida listen to the authorities listen uh to keep your radios on uh make sure you were up to date on the information because this storm\nAgain has the potential to be and most are calling it now or that they're saying there's a likelihood of a a major hurricane hitting the panhandle of Florida I Lived there for three years and nothing yeah I was I was I was lucky but I have a lot of friends\nAnd that area so uh we'll we'll have the latest uh on that on the latest updates when the hurricane center or gives or update which would be another hour yeah you know not to central does it yes so yeah there's a Tucson\nAnd I know there's one at or central well so we'll we'll we'll hire the well look at that as soon as we get updates and they may by the way it's I guess it's possible they make a issue a more information on in fact I'm certainly will uh if it warrants that based on a a a watch turning into a warning ... items like that will keep you posted\nA case you're Cortez makes no sense of this from a couple of days ago but there are things we just couldn't get to because of the capital right here in ... and some of the things we weren't able to get to because of the capital here in ... like the whole Russian collusion that people have been emailing me all the time saying\nHey what's going on what's going on to write drop it or they drop it no it's still going on ... just on that coming up here last Robert Redford says he feels out of place in this country and\nJamie Lee Curtis likens justice Kevin off to Michael Meyers to Halloween killer\nAll right that are

you you you've got to listen to her answer it's while she says nothing here we go\nRight are you going to get along with these people Washington I mean I think they're going to win a that's a ... a ... [laughter]\nI don't know I mean you have to kill the bell rings but here in a very heavily democratic district you're going there I mean there's people are talked about how it's broken and it's so polarized both of which I think are true um and you're also coming really as an outsider at a moment where I think people like for watching what happened today and want to storm the gates and you're going to actually do that\nThat's what's what's your plan here well I think\nA lot of it how they were changing our strategy around ... you know there's a lot of inside baseball and inside the beltway here you know you can only say that term thrown around but\nThere are very ... organizers when Congress and I think that organizers operate differently if for different kind of strategy and what it is really about organizing fall\nAnd and really thinking about that word organizing sacramental people ... action and we're in bringing together at ... strategy of putting pressure on the shoulder instead of only focus on the pressure is in fact that's that's really interesting thought [laughter]\nIt is [laughter] I ... I did [laughter] and\nSo this was on social media over the weekend and you know what the response was\nFrom almost ... almost universal huh no no no no I'm a firm yes from conservatives yeah it was like why are from the Democrats\nAnd stop stop ...\nOver analyzing what she says she's not the leader of the Democrats she's not the leader she's only going to be in a small district\nYou're right because of her performance she isn't going to be right now the probably the leader of the Democrats until she gets in the Congress\nAnd she starts actually saying what she believes instead of the mumbo jumbos up because I don't know why she going to win the she gonna winter\nYou know in that heavily democratic district she's gonna win anyway but you know her her you know she she set it up I mean we know what she is she's a true socialist ... admits uses social issues and she calls it a democratic show socialist\nAnd you have to because first thought I was a democratic socialist before you become an authoritarian socialist and then moving to a authoritarian dictatorial communist\nLike come a long and yet you know you gotta you gotta ... she got an oriental during that you've got to earn the merit badges [laughter] but\nBut that was the the beauty over the weekend is universally was huh Mm oh what a Cheech not saying anything and and and I just love Chris Hayes on MSNBC oh that's very yes\nYou seem you didn't say an interesting yeah if I knew what it meant it would be more interesting yeah that's it is that you know just kind of\n... look ... if you look if you go back to the history of ah of Brock Obama's political career\nWho he was as a political operative and and there was a lot of jokes made about community organizer right\nBut the community organizer especially in the Chicago area oh the convening a number of things but politically it means getting people to the polls that's actually what it means a you know for politically or for any area not just Chicago but getting people to the polls\nThey they what they did is they grew that they nurtured that and they owned that\nBetter than the Republicans in fact the Republicans didn't know how to do it in two thousand eight and in two thousand twelve\nThey beat Romney's team Romney was if you you and I were following the post debate polls the the polls that happened right after the debates between Mitt Romney and rock Obama or President Obama at that time and the polls showed that Mitt Romney or on the issues\nLandslide numbers even the exit polls yes and so massive massive numbers the difference was the organization that's what happened in twenty sixteen\nThe orange she had been working and that the DNC didn't see this because they were busy with you know the whole fusion GPS and you know 'cause we're still Russians and all that ah but the orange the where they were putting their efforts was much like they in fact\nUh some say that as they designed it ah after that model of getting people to the polls that's what it's all about you can call it what you want but at the end of the day it is getting people to get out and vote and\nThat's what happened with those states that that Trump ended up winning that nobody saw and it was that you know boots on the ground type you know community organizing\nThe organization you know that she's trying to speak of it it really doesn't apply internally I mean\nWhipping the vote is one thing the Democrats though have had a playbook for a long long time and will long after a Casio Cortez is gone you and I kind of touched on the other day\nOf kind of dismissing things being able to turn their head on a a Joe mansion you know and and not you know to look the other way with a Joe mansion in certain cases\nAnd and not really worry about things like that when they can they know they can use Joe mansion for other things so\nThe\nThe entire equation is not going to change in fact I don't think the Democrats are the party would wanted to change because on many issues ah they'll do what they have done in the past which includes the kind of behavior we saw with Obamacare we need to pass it so you can see what's in it\nWhich includes lying to the American people about what's what it's going to do\nWell and she was saying that we need to organize with the pressure's not within\nA you know the the the body which would mean the pressure doesn't come from you know whipping up the votes at the pressure comes from\nThe outside electorate will that happens all the time will tell you that that that ... that that's dating a are nothing new the other thing is when\nNow you have the excuses\nNo she's not a leader of the party she's not a leader of the party you well you may not believe that she is and she isn't right now but the mainstream media believes that she is that's why she gets on precedent did television time from the mainstream media\nAs a a candidate for Congress ... who has one nothing yet who was a bartender a year ago\nOn the Capitol cougars free game at seven kick off at seven thirty all boys school football in the ... ... what do you see a jazz [noise]\nAss radio ... is our hunting and uh I'm

the stock market noted economists are warning of a stock market crash that time is now to secure your wealth with precious metals by calling the gold silver group today and eight hundred five to six fifty one thirty seven the gold silver group is here for you would low prices\nAnd fast shipping an all precious metals delivered to your doorstep don't wait for politicians to decide your future\nSafeguard your wealth from Wall street big banks and corrupt officials whether you want to precious metals IRA or a private investment don't wait for another collapse like two thousand eight\nThe world is changing are you ready called a gold silver group now for free information\nAt eight hundred five to six fifty one thirty seven that's eight hundred and five to six fifty one thirty seven eight hundred five to six fifty one thirty seven that's eight hundred five to six fifty one thirty seven if you ever\nSo that is the strategy that I found appalling are watching these these past couple of months so of the two parties who is more energized frying going into the midterms [noise]\nI think we have a horse race I think it's neck and neck I I think that's a real question uh for November is going to be where do these independents fall so what's really interesting is that the polling shows the independents are leaning ever ... ever so slightly rather to uh to Trump and to the Republicans\nOut and this is especially true of men a white man Hispanic man and those folks who do not have a college education\nAnd other words that is the Trump coalition and so if the fact that could have happened that's that's really the coalition coming home for November So really benzene the strategy that they are Democrats employed\nYou know the ... and here's another thing that the women and and I've talked about there's five or six\nWoman that I Know that I've been close to for a long long time ... all of them at least over a decade all professional women when I first met them ... you know and and I was ten to Fifteen Years ago\nNot that political the majority I think one in their mid to late thirties the other in their forties and fifties early fifties ... and all professionals okay all executives and professionals\nAnd when I first met them none of them really political and they knew that when I first met them that I was a talk show host and it was ... now when I talk to them total interest in what's going on in politics all of them over the course of ten to Fifteen Years not because of my influence\nUh want to make that clear a are extremely conservative they\nAre a whole but not if the Republicans there appalled at the Democrats and so\nThere is this mainstream media narrative that women naturally\nUh are attracted to the side of Dr Ford and feel sympathy and hate the Republicans for what has happened well the woman that I've talked to and again uh you know I've been I've explain you know what what their background is\nEvery one of them know the fact that Dianne Feinstein could've kept a secret they look at it and they say the Democrats lose across the board here the Democrats lose because they could have kept quiet\nThey could have kept that she was she claimed she wanted now they're suspicious as to who's telling the truth here but they said even if you believe Dr Ford and that she really truly wish to keep it quiet\nThen the Democrats completely betrayed her Dianne Feinstein completely portrayed her\nBecause as he just said and he's a democratic strategist\nThe Democrats had the chance to keep it all quiet\nTo fulfill her wishes and still do an investigation and they said no we don't care about the woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted and wishes to have her anonymity we are going to use her as a political football we say to that earlier\nAnd I'm sure there were Democrats dating down on a there is a democratic strategist saying the exact same thing that's what will hurt the Democrats is because that's what he as a Democrat believes that they have done\nWell and that's the damage that's his job is to assess essentially damage what works for them what doesn't work for them\nAnd it is not it did not work for them on any level\nBut not only did you have that situation where they clearly leaked it to the media then beyond that you had the overreach with the two additional accusers coming forward and ultimately the nail on the proverbial coughing and that\nThe sweating the allegation that came across from her by their hands through her lawyer ... that was not only overreach but it was clearly a tactic by Abernathy who clearly has it out for this current president\nSo I have to ask this question because you know after on on Saturday on on on Saturday when I heard it okay\nWe're going to you know but you're Jerrold Nadler okay if we take Congress we're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to a beach\nAnd I thought that would die out because I thought to myself well that's a pretty bread a bad strategy you have lost in a variety of ways here I don't think this is a win for you so why would you go out and attempt to motivate\nThe right unless you believe you would motivate the left but still if you could impeach them you're not going to he's not going to leave\nYou know the his Supreme Court seat you would need to go to\nThe Senate now ... and this is a question I was asking does the house or\nThe Democrats who believe that they would be part of the house leadership and ... would be the head of the house Judiciary Committee\nOr you know under under you know uh what would go on it if if the Democrats won a the the the house um are they saying that because they believe that the people to both of them are idiots and they believe that they believe that impeachment means we can take them off the seat\nOr do they believe that this will just motivate their base and then they'll completely drop\nIt if they win that they have no intention of of going after impeachment and hold him they'll scream obstruction by the the Republicans that that we wanted to get it done but the Republicans wouldn't let us get it done 'em and that we still want to get it done a it is one of those campaign promises\nThat is definitely going to fall short rolled over to Americans if they had the if they had the the the majority of Republicans couldn't stop an investigation of an ... well not an investigation\nThe investigation may happen but it's not going to be an impeachment there's there's the thing is it's the promise ultimately what that you'll remove him from the bench\nAnd that and not only what happened that that's not going to have and what are you gonna do Dr Ford said she she's done or he doesn't want to be part of it are are you going to subpoena all these women and bring them back again right so that would be my question is democratic strategist are out there stating you've done damage to your own party drop this well\nBecause here's a question when you start moving in that direction how did you move in that direction and go through the entire process without learning who leaked the media is not gonna tell you because they don't have to reveal their source\nBut the investigation if you look at an investigation were would go and it will be public I mean there's nothing here in terms of classified material\nThat is going to be in place this will be a very public investigation how do you do that without revealing who leaked and we know who leaked it\nSo the problem is they don't want that\nOn ... the Democrats who leaked it don't want it on record\nBecause that has to be a part of the process and just below sea as you said just she really want to see the second background check from the FBI mhm by the way you would a bunch of Republicans who saw it and said release it released it released it and they do it because they don't want to break protocol\nRight or the next judge right right at the Republicans are saying we wish we could release this thing yeah it's an empty it this is an empty promise that\nIsn't going to happen um they can hold their investigation they can call for the investigation they can hold their investigation but a complete investigation must include who leaked it to the media\nEight six six Ninety red eye looking to

it okay the only thing I can get his he's trying to please both sides yes without pleasing anybody\nWith no matter what the president will announce later today Tuesday and then oh he'll go to Iowa after he announced this um and he'll talk about it or you know no doubt while he's in Iowa the you know that it is the corn state\nWhat he's proposing is raising it not amend it on the blend but raising an allowance on the blend Fifteen Percent and then allowing wanting to change the credit\nFor uh those blends so uh this is essentially would be kind of a cap and trade means ... approach well there are credits though that they that the oil companies\nCan buy okay oh they don't want to put like right now if they don't want to\nA a blend at ten percent they can buy credits from other companies and then get the exemption so if they have those credits\nThey're still compliant even if they're not blending up to ten percent he wants to allow them to blend it Fifteen Percent and to sell it year round\nThe pushback on selling it year round has been for eight Fifteen\nHas been that or eat ten even is that especially with the Fifteen while the more ethanol you have in the blend the more smog there is which is why you don't see a Fifteen\nA guy's widespread and even the ten blend um but the they want a Fifteen to be able to be sold year round voluntarily and incentivized through changing the credit situation with those lenders\nWith okay company so does it take to complete mandate offer you still mandated very ten percent there the ... the mandate is still ten percent so then it would be Fifteen Percent but the credits would give you the the incentive to do it even though I don't see\nThe oil companies are not ... they're not responding to this a proposed a it is just a proposal now but they're not they're not responding at all they they don't does care for this idea does does this increased the taxpayer subsidies for ethanol\nA ... I have not seen that changing the only numbers change in terms of uh I guess dollars are changing hands is the credit now\nYou would have to go through of course a Congress to get those subsidies and everything else the president may say I will push for greater subsidies what is pushing for a year on the surface really is selling more ethical\nWhy yeah this is sold job it doesn't well it doesn't have a mandate attached to it and the oil companies don't\nCare about the credits they don't care about the credits\nThat's not something that helps them it's a government forces a mandate and that's what was being proposed the even President Trump has talked about it in the past raising the mandate right ... percent right well if you do that that becomes a that becomes a big problem politically\n... outside of Iowa but I just I've read like three different articles on it and that's what I thought it was was okay you're trying to please both sides but you're not really pleased anybody well because you're not mandating it the oil companies aren't going to do it right it's not a mandate on it so you're simply saying I'm going to allow them I'm going to allow I'm going to allow the industry to do what the industry doesn't wish to do\nRight and sell it year round well I think you're probably going to see pushback ... first of all\nI guess we'd have to see what the participation rate is ... ... the the largest cities like Houston in LA they don't want more smog\nWhat gas stations going to be the first to put want to put a Fifteen in when you know as well as I Do on the Internet is going to be fine you could damage your car you know of of a faster you could damage your lawn mower faster if you use e Fifteen mhm\nRight that it should just be ten percent should be the max and putting Fifteen Percent is is just ridiculous so nobody's going to do it\nSo it was just the way the president's just trying to appease people without doing anything\nIt's trying to appease the farm\nBut you can't get there from here because there is no great motivator there really is no incentive\nEven with changing how the credits work even with changing because changing it to ... year round how does that ... the benefit those that are blending it well okay you could blend it year round\nAnd you wouldn't have to change up at the refinery level as often that does not that's not promising to them because ultimately it ultimately comes back down to the consumer\nRight so the mandate is on the blend\nHere's my question if the mandate is on the blend right at ten percent but the mandate isn't there for Fifteen Percent but those companies the the the the oil companies that are putting it out let's say they responded to\nThe incentive of of changing the credits\nAnd we went to I don't know sixty Seventy percent of the ethanol or or the gasoline so would\nWould have a Fifteen Percent or ethanol concept on the market what would happen with the consumer many of the consumers would be driven to look for the ten percent seek out the temp right\nWhen that happens and you have a glut of the eight Fifteen on the market then what happens then there's pushback from the retail is that's why the retailers don't want her to have the time this is why it is destined to fail\nYou're handing you believe you're handing something to the farmers and the corn states but it really doesn't fly without the mandate and he knows politically outside of Iowa you can't get any Fifteen mandate done right now\nYou can't\nI mean you might get Chuck Grassley on board [laughter] help your wife [laughter] and he's a farmer himself [laughter] so\n[laughter] wait a minute\nHe's only trying to scratch grass lazy back [laughter] that's right you don't even I everybody's paying out on our debt now well I don't know I didn't even think about at MSNBC leader story tomorrow or is he dropped out trying to I'm paying ...

see folks with a coastal interests uh with uh the maritime industry and folks with homes along the region affected\nSo will definitely see some storm surge effect and I don't believe we have a full

S. C. fight we're what out of control in the fight and everything else that was oh I I didn't see that part I don't want to see neither do I but no but it just it filtered right it's filtered into my world\nAnd the Lady Gaga and a star or wait a minute actually it would be could be coming into my world or yeah just\nI I did see some of these things it was a ten second clip that involved a\nIn the ring after fight yes question by Joe Rogan and I can't repeat the answer\n[laughter]\nBut there are other things that that we've gotten emails on ... a lot of people very very concerned a lot of our listeners are very concerned saying you know ... ... what's going on with the Pfizer worn thing it just disappeared\nWhat happened\nAnd what we did cover it a couple of times ... ah you know over the last couple of weeks but just to just to go over it again so everybody knows and maybe do it in a little bit more detail here where we can spend a little bit more time on it\nOr the the the president ah was going to declassify or roughly Twenty one pages including the ... application and at the last minute before releasing it he decided not to\nAnd he didn't release it because he said uh there were some of our allies to did not wish us to release it\nSo he wasn't going to do with yet when we read it we thought OK they what are they trying to do figure out some of the classified information should stay out\nYou know ... or ... should than they need to read that more and that's was I think our original thought and then the president said I'm going to give it to further review to the inspector general of the department of justice Michael Horowitz\nWell we immediately said wait a minute and even ... noon is like the day after said you know I I don't know why they won't release it and then we thought\nTo ourselves well wait a minute and this is the least covered story in America right now I think mhm the least\nThe the lady made hunger I read I read her radio exclusively [laughter] have the but he's covered about possibly\nThe most important story there in all of this over the last two years\nIs that the president because\nHe said and we were at and what a couple of stories said it was Great Britain because of Christopher steals involvement in it but some of our allies did not want us to a release sitting there were a couple of other things that needed to go over so he was going to give it to the inspector general for further review\nNow we were initially for the first day little dumbfounded go we couldn't understand why it was going to him\nAnd on the air this is going back ten or eleven days as you and I were discussing why were to go to the inspector general an off the subject was\nData that's the role of the inspector general is to do what\nIs to investigate corruption there it's the you don't give it to the inspector general to stay review this and tell me what I can release and what I can uh you know what I can unwritten pact you use that for that you use\nYour a director of national intelligence your CIA director and uh your your uh a secretary of state it was a former CIA director those are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director ... you know the secretary of defense those are the people you would go to\nTo to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassify it or not and I say you're secretary of state former CIA director because they claim that some allies or didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was wait a minute what are the allies no they don't know what's in their right how how do they know that\nAnd we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to ah the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nThey were they ... that it went whoa look at\nBut yeah the conclusion we came to was that if you are looking if you're looking to give this to the inspector general the department of justice then you're basically asking\nHim to do an investigation and to issue a report they said the expert at they asked for an expedited process here from Mr Horwitz and\nThe only reason you do that is because of the role of a Michael Horowitz the inspector general's office in in overall is to do what to look at possible fraud or misdeeds done within the ... of justice fraud or a rousing option and all of that\nWould be and if you think about it because I I'm thinking of a a a ... and in the room with the president and also or his chief of staff or Kelly as well looking at that and saying\nIf you come out and make a conclusion or draw conclusions from this information or by de classifying it and we see the on redacted information here\nIf we jumped to the conclusion well first of all\nThe executive branch is not really that there is no prosecutorial power there you would have to go through a the the department of justice itself but where would you start at the department of justice if you believe that people that are either they're in place or were there before\nCommitted a you know a crime possibly or there was fraud and corruption or any of those items that would be on the plate of the inspector general's office for you would start with Michael Horowitz it's the only way because beyond that you're looking at just a political move that's all the way it would be played\nIt would be well the president saying this\nThat's not what we think if you take that off the out of the political arena\nAnd that's exactly what you do hear think about the fact that you're not sending it to the attorney general even that could be seen as a political move because he's an appointee by the president right while or are they are supposed to be a ton of us\nAnd you know ... or which is someone that's been in place since before he was appointed by Obama he was appointed by Obama but more importantly I that's that's a key to opening the door and ending the discussion about whether it's politically motivated more importantly\nNetwork the HGF network dot com [noise]\nInching ever changing world and you must stay informed ABC Radio news provides the top stories from around the globe

fighting it out to the bitter end you mean November ninth\nOkay wanting sixteenth [laughter] the day after the election because let's let's talk about better\nLet's talk about the reaction that started a actually late that night but I mean if you think about the election wasn't cold until November night or so technically it started [laughter] November night\nBut you could see the faces being made among the evening of November rate will split those hairs later but the whole bitter rent thing\nSay what you will about this current president and I'm sure he has Mr Redford but the whole thing with pretty much every day since he was elected and not on the issues but on something that no one can identify\nThere hasn't been one crime identified\nIn connection with Trump his campaign anyone in his campaign and the ... the Russians on the twenty sixteen election not one event we have a\nBig growing pile of evidence that that shows us and no one debate\nThat the Democrats and the Hillary campaign through their law firm\nHired fusion GPS to get on verified salacious information from the Russians\nAnd then used that to petition for and ultimately got in October of twenty sixteen a warrant on a member of the Trump campaign let's discuss bitter end Mr Redford\nWell I I just I get a kick out of it because I I Do believe people lack courage\nWhen they they try to sell you the propaganda\nThat I'm rise above all of this and I'm call calling for love for between everybody and to stop all of the ... and the anger and the the the bitterness without directly addressing an issue to me\nThat is the heights of limping is is not willing to actually look stand up for what you believe in if you believe it's right and just defended and get specific about it but don't throw me this crap and not get it all the time I Know a couple of a a Facebook friends would do it I'm going to rise above all of this oh you're not\nWell you're simply let me ask you Mr Redford I'm ah was it rising above when the Democrats out at Dr Ford or was it rising above when chairman Grassley decided that they were going to delay the process\nAnd give Dr Ford in front of the American people or even behind closed doors that was her choice\nTo issue her concerns and make her claim officially was it bitter\nWas it divisive when the president himself decided he would order an additional background check on Kavanaugh delaying it even further was that divisive\nA when Bernard Goldberg wrote the book by us he talked about the elites uh in in the media in Hollywood and everything else that believe they're not part of either side they just believe that they are part of the absolute right ... you know that they just believe that they're right in everything then their opinion\nIs above everyone else that in essence while you called them the elite\nBecause they believe they're on a higher plane of consciousness\nWhere oh we just call for civility and the way that we think and just follow what we do and everything will be okay so they don't for ride Redford here for example doesn't have to get specific\nHe just puts out this general statement we know where he stands\nEverything where he dances is addressed you know is meant for the Republicans and he's not insulting the Democrats here and everybody knows that\nBut he doesn't have the guts to say it right\nWell because he talks in these generalities that are straight from Hollywood script\nWithout without going on detail by detail a mission to say what was done wrong in this process I can tell you what was done wrong in this process and it's by the side that you support\nBut you aren't big enough to actually stand up and say it Robert Redford in this instance Taylor Swift has more guts than you could do well I Am right now [laughter]\nUm that little a speech you gave an statement that you made Mr Redford or we just made sure that a river runs through it\nAnd it's very clear now that it didn't even hold up to the

sustained wins at the Knight Ninety miles per hour moment north northwest at twelve miles per hour still expected to hit\nA the pan handle a coast of uh of Florida right now as a a hurricane strength or three over a hundred and ten mile an hour wins a and probably some time ... ... uh eight nine ten am tomorrow morning as what\nThey're talking about yeah Wednesday morning yeah\nSo uh it's a there are a number of things here ah that we're following of course on uh the the locals and the officials ah they're all all along uh the Big Bend area of the Florida a Gulf Coast\nAre and what's going on plenty of uh of information are pouring out of that area\nBut also the updates from the national Hurricane Center another update on the way in less than twenty five minutes and we'll bring you the latest as we get at our meteorologist or John proud is on that\nStory of course and we'll be following the storm or in the coming days so I'm again or advice please heed the warnings of follow the advice and instructions by\nLocal authorities in state authorities there in Florida as this is a very dangerous storm life threatening in terms of ah all elements of this storm storm surge flooding from rains and wins a all combined expecting over twelve inches in those areas where the\nWhere the hurricane or when it moves overland right yeah yes and and and and then later in the week bringing\nA some rain that they don't need to areas that are still recovering from from Florence because the ground as John pointed out earlier John trout are pointed out earlier that it is already saturated there in those areas that were affected by Florence\nAnd any rain or is just going to create problems so uh not just over the next ah twenty four to thirty six hours but of course\nAs Michael moves inland more a flooding and other threats along a that a storm path\nOr will certainly be something that people need to pay attention to\nA head of Michael's landed a\nYou know you and I talked about yesterday which was like wow a after this you know after the last really over two weeks of the judge a cabin on the the hearings and\nAnd the the ... the confirmation and everything that has gone out in the ... all the different ah allegations\nAll of a sudden we got to Monday yesterday and I woke up and it was there was nothing it was almost like a big exhale where it's like okay and where do we go next we need a day to figure out where the news goes because it wasn't really a big news day right a a a\nYesterday and it's when I came to the thought where I said what's the issue for Democrats with everything that I've discussed over the last two years I actually woke up yesterday thinking\nWhat are the Democrats have right\nWhat are they going to you besides impeachment you know what is ... you know what is the issue thinking about this or we went through and and even just just before we got to the cabinet nomination it was still a mall or investigation Trump illusion you and I I I remember ah the ah\n\nWas it the the the Thursday of the ... the Thursday or friday when when Chuck Todd said you better not miss work tomorrow that had to be like what was\nThat ... right around Labor Day yeah it was the friday had to buy into Labor Day when and and that was because you know Mueller's going to let the investigation nobody's even talking about rushing collusion now it's gone on anybody's radar it seems like that was\nTen years ago and that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds and so when I woke up yesterday I started thinking what are Democrats thinking the issue is what's the issue that they can go after Trump out what's the issue that will even grab\nDemocrats right now to say oh yeah okay that's the issue you and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our ...\nAre doomed to update because of global warming\nAnd we're thinking of the Democrat's gonna jump on that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the Obama administration that and raised on a consistent basis\nAnd so I was looking at your earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting to start some time by the end of the week because it's been their old standbys is what they've always used now even though at the same time the American people have said they don't care yeah we don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations\nOr the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well are you folks in Washington may not and you people that belong to certain groups or or you know or or may not but for the most part we get along and global warming well you have a major case\nTo the vast majority of America let me go get a burger ... I was I mean seriously that's words that but you know and we ... we actually stay to during the Obama administration I'll never forget where we said\nAre they doing this on purpose\nBecause I actually think that if we don't talk about the issues of the day if we don't talk about the economy 'cause remember the economy never had three percent growth the entire time the Obama administration and you and I would talk about this all the time saying there seems to be no interest in talking about making the economy better\nNo it wasn't even a story that was being discussed\nAnd and they just went back to global warming and and race\nSo I really find it interesting as to as we are now just a little under a month from uh from election time that you watch what's the Democrats issue what are they actually going to use besides impeachment if they think that's going to work which brings me to this article Wall Street journal Bobby Jindal\nFormer a former governor of of\nAh Louisiana ... two thousand two thousand sixty Democrats try some self restraint now I I like Bobby Jindal but this may be a little bit delusional\n[laughter] it was up to a straight [laughter] F\nA it's not certain the Democrats I'm just wondering parts of it because I actually started laughing during it or it's not certain but that's okay he's trying to be an optimist mhm I'm being a complete and total sitting here at this moment but I think justifiable\nI can justify it it's not certain the Democrats will retake the house but if they do they will likely ignore\nTheir leaders preferences and push to impeach President Trump or perhaps justice cabin up\nIn the swap with Clinton their opposition's Democrats now lecture the nation that unseemly personal behavior makes the president unfit for office while Republicans and says his private morality has no impact on those whose public duties this is more a\nThan a interesting irony impeachment would undoubtedly energize Mr Trump's base and make these voters even more loyal to him as it did with Bill Clinton", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Charleston", "day": "09"}
