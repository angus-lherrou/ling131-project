Afghan officials and wounding two Americans the commander of us and NATO forces was asked to see\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms is really bad they get to this set the debate and the terms of the debate when the media's on their side because no one's questioning them with comments like I'm throwing out there and that you would\nNever mind that when anyone does something illegal and they're hauled off to jail their children do not go with them to jail boys that a big one\nThat's a huge one you'll never see it when you know in the in the last time this happened and it's going to happen again with these Honduras or Honduras refugees coming you know seeking asylum that's going to happen to very shortly whenever they get here\nYou get to stay with your kid who hid you can use the same phrase oh she was found guilty of robbery first degree robbery and put our child was ripped out of her\nYou never hear the media say that but that's what happens in effect\nThere also and so to speak torn away from them why isn't it said and I was just indicated the latest reincarnation of this conflict is is the news hundreds of Hondurans are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nSo again President Trump and the Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media will again show crime children and distraught mothers you know what's gonna happen\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right to decide who gets to enter our house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right this is pretty obvious to it seems to me to protect the American people from harm where the from terrorism or disease we don't know the terrorists aren't coming through our\nOpen border or disease or we checking for diseases like we used to know or ... well you can't if they come here and Russian or even fat matter this was important people don't talk about this\nTo make sure that people who come here share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south of Mexico good try the same thing down there\nSome of us think this is also obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense\nThe Democrats won more votes they won't tell you that they they know illegal immigrants vote for them in huge numbers and the country club Republicans for lack of a better name they want cheap labor so you have or newspapers like the wall Street Journal I I stopped subscribing to it when they would have their editorials and it would talk about immigration in the title\nAnd then I mean they say illegal immigration the title and somewhere in the middle they would just sit switched immigration oh immigration has been a great for America over the years how could you you were in Iowa list right how could you oppose this this is insane what they would switch on us even though they pretend to talk about illegal immigration in the title\nOf course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party saying like knowledge during that so you have people like George W. Bush and Karl Rove saying things like boy we can get this vote George W. Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas wonderful\nI'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\nAll Lawson politics by the way politics in particular a loss of sixty percent of forty percent is huge and that is based on an optimistic assumption most illegal immigrants come here for jobs but they also take advantage of government hand that says we know that the rest of us are paying for\nAnd by the way the Republican Party can never out do the Democrats in offering benefits\nI uh I think I use this phrase years ago when a ever voters given a choice between Democrats and Democrats meeting logic Democrats they choose the original ones they don't need us\nSo who these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out and if left unchecked the Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even on a purely selfish basis it is clear that we need to control the border not to mention fairness what do you say to the people around the world who have been waiting many years I've heard of people waiting a decade to get here but it has to undergo long waits on and says some paperwork to even have a hope of getting here\nSo they have to follow the rules but those who dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools not the only thing but it's one of the tools so one caller and this week and if you didn't hear him suggest that border walls don't work in the long run\nAnd I said but even if that were true I bet they work in the short run while we try to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure coming to our country\nIt's to me it's the same ridiculous logic that defenders of illegals murdering innocent America's like Americans like hates finally use\nAnd I you know I pointed Geraldo Rivera because I watch them do a time and time again saying oh illegals commit crimes percentage wise in lower numbers the Native Americans as if\nThat matters who cares even if that's true if an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrant that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry no matter what the percentages and that obvious and that wall by the way in Israel preventing Hamas from hurting Israel's Israelis is working the room\nA lot of these arguments is baffling to me unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms\nI more to say to you but I Know we have to go to the break surely let me give you the numbers and I'll go on a little bit more eight six six Ninety red eye and that's the same as eight six six nine o seven three three three nine\nSo example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities were criminal illegals or given safe harbor if you come up with phony arguments like illegals will not you've heard that they won't cooperate with the authorities if they know they can be apprehended or sent home so that's why it's important that you know we have sanctuary for them\nBut how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to care if they cooperated with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that said these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through reading schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free healthcare and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail usually in the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and it'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRomney actually had a right to use the wrong language self deport there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take 'em back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be things in the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government sending out the wrong message message with actions like legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United bites language and it's shared values\nEnglish is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values\nOur ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at Alice island they were so happy to have landed at the land of freedom so let's build that wall and do everything to end dilute legal immigration and take our country back tell me what

[noise]\nYeah it's Mark I'm back with you again I should say yes\nRetreat eight six six Ninety red\nEye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine getting your take\nOn illegal immigration and by the way I don't blame the illegal immigrants you may not have thought about this before I put myself in their place what would I Do if I was living in a country where there was little hope little opportunity and tyrannical government let alone violence like you know Salvador\nOr the drug cartels in Mexico I don't blame them\nAnd I did television show years ago I had a TV show and I have people from all over on the opposite side of me saying yeah we agree that's the government they given a signal to come on over\n... or mixed messages or it's not clear I don't blame them for trying to seek a better life\nAnd I blame us and the government and this idea comprehend the George W. Bush did the same thing as the wall to Wall Street journal\nOr he would you know talk about immigration how great immigration has no no one's arguing that people aren't ancestors are relatives came and landed in Ellis Island and they share our values and uh what they wanted to make a difference and they want them to get freedom\nBut it was legal immigration and by the way if you had a bad disease my knowledge they didn't let you in\nThat's coming here legally that's a huge difference\nSo don't tell them call me in Iowa list every country has a right to have borders unless you believe in open borders one world and you know good luck it could be Venezuelan a large scale or Cuba\nNo let me know what you think and let's go I said I'd go to calls in let's go to Steve and I'm In a whole Virginia Steve you're on with mark\nHey yeah I Love it for some time and I'm One of ... ... you know ... ... why don't we start talking for every dot org\nAnd with all the aid of\nA though the money that we're going to come out of town but we are on a daily basis\nSo why I like your idea about the way it's an interesting idea why do you use the phrase and document\nWell at that point it do you call it whatever you want to all of illegal what that's what I think lately but if you want to call it ... you get ill or any I'm not only that when we ship them back\nOr whatever on the\nOr train whatever we are looking for that as well and or any children that are separate on their ... their family\nIn some ways you're harder than me but it yeah just to let them out on the amount of them and\nThat's assuming you're giving it to every one of those countries which is the case for the most part now writing\nOn state aid or stolen but don't [noise] well mania quite true we don't give\nYou you don't mean in the United states you mean in\nThe center of the world I mean in the world we don't we get eight\nYeah well we don't give any to the Soviet Union I mean you might say on now Russia there are certain countries you know you might say we get paid like the China you might say we give them aid because they take an unfair advantage of\nUs but there are a lot of countries are are we going to have those endeavors actually they were\nActually the Russians are helping us more with the satellites right now than we may be helping them financially but that's not your point your point is it is a good one which is we ought to charge the country's um for their illegals coming here I I I kinda liked that idea\nEven though oh\nNo no it's a it's an idea\nOr the amount of people at that point\nYou know and as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us they're poor right a lot of especially Mexico writes I send this sentence the poor and his ... not our problem right and it's your problem ...\nAnd ... and then you can also add on to the health care\nPhilip Philip well where do we stop or something you know let me but\nI yeah there's nothing like the right in the center and that's the point with right now it's been the wrong incentive you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get to have free hospital care right and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and this is true for you you you know I I Would come here to that's why I said\nThe insurance interest and we can make money interest then you know what\nYeah you should have given this idea that President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for the wall\nYou know any better than I Do oh really [laughter] I don't think\nThat's a great call thing Steve appreciate it very much actually I I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be a way up there in the department of education but uh the person I send to than I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's the head of communications for I think the department of health\nUh and so yeah it does happen and you know some people but you know what a it it's tough and and that's one of the news stories that the I think they were heading someone else's leaving the administration it's tough to work there\nEspecially if you're a conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you're certainly it's not the connections you want it's tough it's tough and a lot of your point that out yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot to become president United States you could say well to New York trip this power all that kind of stuff I don't think he needed that\nI think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing I mentioned this last couple of days if they can power not only hearings and subpoenas but you know they're going to go after taxes\nBecause they're they're sure they're going to find something there that though oh probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of the all the Russians but even if they don't what business is it um there's\nWhat his tax returns are it's just not their business I Know certain presidents have done odd I don't think they should\nIt's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's none of your business Democrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know my I don't I pay what I'm supposed to pay and do my share but it's not anybody else's business by the way after the Kavanaugh hearings and all this other stuff if they go after taxes\nWhy to good people exactly why do people want to serve\n... especially people that sense why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider Democrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you how to live your life\nYeah they're the party that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those that hey I Can't wait to get home\nAbsolutely absolutely yeah\nYeah we well it was you know when I recall when we meddle in other countries I don't mean coming to their aid in defense but like we did in South Africa you gotta be careful what you get\nI ... and all this talk of makes me think Egypt bride we we helped them over and throw a what's his name Mubarak and I asked them at the time I was doing national radio and I said wait a second the what they called the springs something what was the term anybody out there can tell me I've forgotten her for a second I'm\n... now and Brian was helping me and not their spring there was some something when spring but anyway uh the fact is we got where she got to ask that question what's what's after this so you got rid of Mubarak and you got the Brotherhood Muslim Brotherhood which was tyrannical and certainly not on our side\nAnd then eventually ... took it over there we were saying maybe it was the Arab Spring I may you may be right Brian I think you are now that I think of it um producer Brian so you know I'm I'm mentioning\nThe fact is that you you can't just do the spine when we did that in South Africa right you overthrow which you have and then you don't ask what's next is going to be attorney right open the best example might be Iran\nWe were so thrilled with Jimmy Carter to overthrow the shock yeah but they didn't ask well was next are you happy looking back and seeing what you've gotten instead of the shah\nI ... the biggest enemy maybe or at least our enemy that you might say Russia China but certainly the biggest immediate threat in terms of what they're doing to our citizens\nSo it's very important that you not just act emotionally I'm thinking it cut off in Libya right Hillary was for that Obama was for that\nWhat is your place Libya with weren't didn't they killed Americans right\n[laughter] in Benghazi is you just can't operate let me get myself in trouble with somebody you're now\nIn Saudi Arabia we got a real problem there what they did was horrendous in my opinion the stone assassinate people like that and go inside and drop 'em up and some people picked on me for that is that it's none of our business\nBut the other side and President Trump's got a huge problem now is they're our biggest supporters in ... you know besides Israel in trying to work against Iran cause Iran's than a threat to\nThis world is very complicated and their offer no easy solutions or maybe you don't notice historically we had a war there was a war or not we between Iran and Iraq\nAnd you know you got to choose sides sometimes they may both be terrible we worked with the Soviet Union during the more I think about this we work with the Soviet Union during World War two because we had a bigger enemy and Hitler\nSo a lot of left is liberal say why do you work with these people ... how do you respond to lead well life is not easy you're faced with difficult choices and you got to figure out what makes the most sense\nThis stuff is not easy [noise]\nAnd that same thing with illegal immigrants coming in right now it's not it's a tough challenge

of your background and then help us understand what Laufer is\nSo I Am an attorney I was actually born and raised in Canada but my mother and the New Yorker so I've always had good will citizenship I came to practice law here in the United states I really started off in the entertainment business and I went into filmmaking\nAnd then I worked as an ... for a brilliant man named gang of heights who runs a think tank called the middle east forum and that's where I first encountered what we called la la la fair a walk there is a term of art is met and didn't know any use of the law as they went in for normally go\nTo court there used to cover for harm or to pursue justice we're talking about when legal systems are being manipulated when they're being and she'll come from terrorism to compliment asymmetric warfare so\nI first came across this whole phenomenon is when I was working at the little warmer than health council and we were running a legal Defense Fund which basically was there just naturally support members of the counter terrorism community\nThere were being for no way to ... and it had to violence that when they were publishing speaking publicly about terror friends organization charity to what really piling money to terrorism or Islam is tearing general and those two they were targeting\nSure they're riding through their thinking when they were trying to raise awareness that post nine eleven the world\nAbout the very real threat of terrorism and financial and other support it started getting hit by the very painful that they were they at of course the law suits were frivolous and they were designed to intimidate them and filed family\nAnd so they really forum project came to their defense and die after working with Louis for my ... my first book\nCalled law law failed the war against tree they try argued that the legal intimidation through law there coupled with my eyes even intimidation of like an actual physical violence attacks

...\nIf they think about this issue has resulted in a tremendous effect on our free speech and the great country\nSo warfare\nIs basically you're terminated you among other things by law suits you cannot continue to afford to fight against even if they're frivolous so therefore you could silent that's a word that right\nOne aspect that that's what we called libel law fair and another aspect is really in in the global arena what we're seeing now is\nHugo systems being used by terrorist group okay western legal system is being used by terrorist groups and buy their supporters to compliment their activities on the asymmetric battlefields so what do I get you have a group like Hamas\nA specially designated foreign terrorist group that uses children as human shields that hides its rocket in hospitals and children's a school that uses civilians as human shields routinely\nAnd then when they targeting Israel was terrorist attack in Israel obviously respond there is a civilian casualty because that is the whole\nPoint of their tactics they turn around and you know states filed war crimes charges has to have claiming that you know Israel is responsible for the civilian casualties when the law to bomb costs like actually clearly said\nThat he who put another intentionally in harm's way is therefore liable for the foreseeable result so\nThere's that and there's obviously the misinterpretation and misuse of different legal terminology like terrorism apartheid genocide proportionally it's a forceful is terms of legal definitions but they're misused and his supplied by the

that's that's one of those games that hey this everybody play tried and uh for as we look at it and re capital a little bit it was beautiful Santa Clara California the\nSan Francisco forty niners and

the army de France which are limited fan of the state to only one hundred and Seventy one yard to hold law France\nAnd in doing so only allow thirty six yard on the ground show again it was a complete team victory when we look at the stacks of the game army totally out gained San jose state three hundred and Ninety five to one Seventy one\nTurned over they force for current overt and did not commit any turnover and the wind and of course they can use that for our search academy teams this time of progression army progress a ball\nThirty seven minutes to San jose state twenty three almost\nFifteen minutes which is a quarter\nOf the game longer so\nWhen we talk about star of the game on off parents\nWe've got to start with the quarterback from Charlotte North Carolina Calvin ... eat only through by five times completing two of them for fifty four yard touchdown but added Ninety nine yards and re touched down on the ground and only Eighteen carries\nAnd secondly would be Jordan as buried senior\nI'd receiver hailing from Cincinnati, Ohio\nHad one catch forty one yards but guess what that one was a touchdown so Jordan as bad as one of the stars of the game on the

Malcolm Perry lined up ... slot back when the navy all kinds of took the field due to from injuries\nAgainst temple Louis that an outstanding job in the first half as he distributed the ball very nicely but the second half things fell apart for navy and uh they just couldn't quite get as much going for temple\nAnthony Russo through fall off for three hundred yards and a game winning touchdown into fourth quarter\nAs temple one for the for a common five gangs or if we recap the game navy had two long second quarter try\nFirst ended at a field goal and the second with ... Lewis one yard touchdown rotten and in between there however temple found the ... film but navy was up at the half tend to seven\nIn the third quarter a it was tough but a temple out scored\nThe mid

time's possession game thirty three miners who panned for twenty seven when I look at the stars of the game now from the south more pullback from Baton Rouge Louisiana\nHeadache to carries for a

tighter margin at San Diego state they lost Twenty one to Seventeen that well\nIt's a parent that uh uh San Diego state has their forces number as they are now the man force for the eight straight

more fun when we talk about three wins and hopefully next week we'll be able to get three went from a service academy tea\nThat's right armies hosting Miami of Ohio navy hosts Houston and there are forces that un Elvie\nAnd let's hope and they're all wins thank you for your comments him for being on the team I really appreciate your pal\nAre I think that a\nDisgruntled enter your next up it's time for our weekly mailbag within US military history\nYou reported for duty from us if we\nDidn't get a bench as a good way to my mother's house by now Seventy five bench presses I once in a combat ready since then [noise]\nThanks colonel in this particular scenario I like to focus on firearms storage especially in light of the Seattle law that requires firearms to be locked up when the news\nOf course all us responsible gun owners already known practice that concept so there's really no need to legislate it however for those few out there who do not already like up their guns would not in use let's go over some other ways to secure your firearm\nFirst of all when they got us on your person either in a holster or some other carrying device it is considered secure and in use whether that's a holster are fanny pack doesn't really matter we're talking about an on body carry method where you are in complete control of the guns simply because there is attached to you and follows you wherever you go\nHere some requirements I levy on all my gun safe\nNumber one it must be secure the whole idea of locking the gun up is to keep it out of unauthorized hands if the safest is dirty enough to keep a kid from breaking into it and get something different you should buy the best quality gun safe you can afford\nI've seen people run out and buy a twelve hundred dollar Kimber pistol and then lock it in a tent cash box from Walmart they constantly nine Ninety five votes don't do this\nNumber two the gun safe must be in a location that makes it readily accessible to all authorized users I staged my gun safe and guns on all levels of my home simply because you never know when the bad guy will invade you or where he will break into your home it could be on the main floor second floor or even in the basement\nAnd last you must be able to open your gun safe quickly and easily while under extreme stress having to remember a long digital combination or use a dialed open it is simply unacceptable\nEven worse yet is needing a key to access to safe first you have to find the key then you have to insert it and it just takes way too much time\nStick with a ... digital keypad or RFID technology or even biometric fingerprint opening methods and you'll not be disappointed the bottom line is you are responsible for the security of your gun so get the best you can afford and keep it simple and keep it safe\nGee that makes sense even from a marine [laughter]\nTroops listen up on veterans' day we're going to start a new program thanks to the input you all have Senate and I need more input our goal was on the show to honor the cease military person not the superstars but the average soldier sailor marine or ... they don't have to have served in combat they do have to have

not only in our own polling\nBut also anecdotally when we're out in the state how often the issue of health care comes up everything from the rising cost of prescription drugs to confusion over the healthcare market frustrations that premiums are still up and and a lot of distrust that Washington is actually doing anything that making those issues better\nWhen you talk about health care whether it is those things you mentioned or younger people who are going from job to job that is something that we in the media just don't talk about is it\nNo it's it's not as flashy it's not as simple as sort of interesting viral video is these are complicated question health insurance markets and what makes them go up or down how you protect someone with preexisting conditions how insurance company can\nRate or charge people differently based on age or gender those are complicated wonky issues that are hard to talk about but they really impact people's lives right now when wages have still felt stagnant for a lot of people\nA few hundred dollars increased every month or over a year in their health insurance can really make or break the bank\nOkay so final question if the Democrats do take the house has a lot of people are thinking that they might how come the the prediction is that we won't be talking about health care from twenty Nineteen we'll be talking about subpoenas for the Trump campaign\n[noise] that's interesting I think Democrats are going to have to find a way to to walk and chew gum if they want to govern ... there are a lot of Democrats both here in Washington and around the country\nThat are interested in some of those subpoenas interested in in in running proper investigations I'm at about\n... administration running very aggressive investigations against

and they had a trained avalanche that I don't know I mean to this day okay to the scene has complicated there was a lot of people on scene but I the answer I got wasn't good enough and I don't know if
