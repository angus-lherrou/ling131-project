it's done in the British or right it's not it's not a person\nAnd and I explained to missing sources say and it means nobody will go on the record and tell you what it is so they use the source of it that's what a source story is where you don't have a name you just simply say sources in the White House say\nUh but uh the report a again a Wall Street journal had it was where I saw the first uh that uh the uh a background check on cabin on no cooperation of sexual misconduct allegations was the cloture vote still are set for friday\nOkay except for friday and uh they could have a now some report saying a a a a broad vote could come as soon as Saturday\nBut I think uh at least a couple of organizations were reporting that uh it's more likely that it would have either late Saturday or Sunday they could actually do a vote on Sunday I'm guessing they're going to want to get this done as soon as possible so I Would look if I were if [laughter] if I were Chuck Todd\nI Would not miss work on Saturday [laughter] so the the entire ah I I think this entire thing it's it's interesting because it's a confirmation happens the cloture vote will on friday will tell them essentially the headcount\nWill tell them if they've got the fifty and with fifty they can the vice president could be the the fifty one to break the tie if they've got fifty on friday they're not going to wait a

greatly\nOver the last few days as you can possibly imagine the ... you know right now the protestors are very active which there's enough itself that's not a problem peaceful protests hey I encourage that whatever it is you may be wrong but that's your right to go out and peacefully protest\nAs long as you're not a trespassing a and you're you know legally in that place than it's okay for you to carry on a good sign but that's not the concern that concern is that people are talking and and there's a lot of chatter on social media\nYou know about again the whole get in your face or as they call it going direct approach\nAnd you you can't you can't have that\nIf you want to have a group if you want to go out and protest if you want to have a voice no problem but running up to senators in a hallway right now is likely not going to be tolerated by Capitol Hill security\n\nUh you know the I was telling you are in our pre show meaning about uh ice or that the uh the uh apparently it's the the union mhm the ice union is asking the mayor of Portland, Oregon to give up control the city's police department\nSent letters Wednesday morning requesting federal and state investigations over his handling of the Occupy ice protests uh this uh summer you remember they lasted for weeks or sea ice office in the city to shut down the national ice council union that represents ice officers says the mayor\nFueled the confrontations by expressing support for the protesters and in public and private statements made clear to police it they were to stand down ignoring some nine one one calls from agency employees being ... by protesters\nCouncil told attorney general Jeff Sessions that Mr wheelers directives violated those employees civil rights\nLeaving them without protections he is required to provide in separate letter to the Oregon attorney general the ice council attorney said the mayor broke state laws against official misconduct by telling police to ignore ongoing crimes among the protestors\nSo I mean that's that's the point where it's getting you know right now mhm that old you know that the the belief is ice believes in\nAnd and they're going to have to you know the uh of course ... you know make their points solve it I mean they're asking ah the the the the mayor to what to do it we'll see you you know we'll see where this this whole thing goes but that's what they believe is happening that now you got politicians stating\nWell look if you disagree with me on us at a particular issue well then we're not going to protect you\nWere going to remove right the police were going to tell the police to stand on we're going to tell them no you protect those protesters you don't protect these protesters were going to protect your you're going to protect those protesters and those people that are actually committing crimes against other government entities\nAnd are in in in timid dating and uh uh ...\nUh uh the people trespassing doing the wrong thing and we're going to tell them to stand down and rented tell them not to do their job you ask where it's going that's where it's going to access\nWe'll get to that and a more plus your calls and comments got a great show I I had a what is coming up next a we'd just told you the cloture vote the\nA set of well it's supposed to happen on a friday we'll see what happens tomorrow it's going to be a crazy\nDay we're being told that the uh being reported I should say that that the Senate or has the three ... and it's going over them as we speak um keep in mind this is all behind closed doors we won't see the thrill to well the reports\nRemember you don't ... nobody really I don't think anybody gets a cop you know\nWhy they they don't get an electronic copy they get a paper copyright only\nBut they're not supposed to ... when I read the staff is supposed to see it only the members of yes\nOnly right Senate members yet only the stuff that they're ... they're going over that right now the committee are also has it but really well committed by the end it's not it's it's not going to affect of like it's\nIt's not going to do all that well the entire point is is is to make sure there's not a leak bought a here's the question\nIf you don't get out if you don't make it public\nDo you end up\nHanding it right or another great opportunity for the Democrats to say you're hiding from the people whether the normal process is to keep it quiet as we all know well and I was at\nThe rules are on the Rio too because it because that's an official for and so and and I really don't know it is there any kind of penalty for leaking something any information that was directly from with real too\n\nThat would be a good point because if that is the case then we'll never see it and the the ... you're right the Democrats complained just writing a story that at our CPA about what this could help Democrats or Republicans in November either way that it goes\nSo you know if the Democrats get there when we're there is no domination or it's not no confirmation then let's keep the momentum going and then the Republicans of course would you do with much much demonstrate or let's keep pushing a the fact that this is how the\nUh the left in the media is going to behave in situations like this which is why you know we need to maintain power\nWhich means we'll look at all the

directly from NPR up on the critical elections across the country\nThe wide democratic enthusiasm advantage that has defined twenty Eighteen campaign at this point has disappeared\nAccording to a new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll in July there was a ten point gap between the number of Democrats and Republicans saying the ... a November election we're very we're very important\nNow that's down to two points a statistical tie\n\nDemocrats advantage on which party's candidates are more likely to support has been cut in half since the last month\n\nOr the results come amid the pitched in hotly partisan confirmation battle over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court All right so that's one story there mhm and we've talked about you know\nThe way the enthusiasm gap you and I stayed and it's all a again anecdotal\nFor us but well ... not really in a way I mean I I Can't I Can't tell you how it might change an election but it's not anecdotal because we said her everyday but the

remember anything that matches this no no no I I in my lifetime I can big because look the passion was there in in twenty six team but it wasn't unified no I'm from Ohio public and and it wasn't\nA it was a different type of motivation I guess I should say even the Tea Party\nIf you go back to the uh the early ... I guess the early part of the momentum for the modern day Tea Party\nIn two thousand nine you know as you as a around it a\nTax day in two thousand nine and then enter the summer when the rally started happening and everything else\nI still even at its height I still can't say that it was this kind of one\nDirectional motivating\nPassion because there were a number of things being kind of been worked out and the Tea Party along the way and then then it you know you had some Tea Party candidates and everything else but at its height at its peak\nI Can't say for certain that it was\nThis kind of motivation across the board\nI think it was big but this is what this is different because of the culture that's being created by the left and the media on the left this is this is different than an objection to high taxes and and things that are very real\nHere this is a a behavior\nA pattern of behavior by the left that's being very clearly demonstrated over and over again\nAnd I remember uh other you know intense times that were based on a particular issue and uh for example after the twenty sixteen election\nWhen when uh a W was talking about uh you know the bridge loan mhm uh and you had and and and even before that right or before the election or you had the the the passion when they talked about a bailout and you know in ... but that wasn't unification\nThere were people there was an intensity there that existed McCain fined gold you and I were working together or knock McCain Feingold\nMcCain Kennedy right right uh the immigration bill ... that was a that was a that is when they you know blue the phones out of the ... of Capitol Hill you remember that one I read that was on a specific topic yeah I ... the\nSame thing heart bright that's powered are short lived yeah sure sure like this this is different because it is about Kavanaugh ... but it isn't just about Kavanaugh right this this this isn't about ... this isn't really about Trump\nAnd and reading right here it says but rather than a Wall Street journal\nOr interesting that they write this the same day that you know you're the same week that you know you and I are having the same thought going while those the never conservatives the capping off fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now\nAh and it says you look at you know talks about the cabinet is part of you know a isn't part of the whole Trump ism thing\nWhen I was ... he suffered from that can believe that we talked about how many never Trump or as we mentioned this last week how boom I said ooh wow all of a sudden they are absolutely\nIn in support of of a cabinet and furious and I haven't talked about the never Trump or is that I Know that had built alliances with Democrats because of their hatred towards Trump yeah and now they're fighting with each other\nBecause when it comes down to it well except maybe for Bill Kristol\n[laughter] the one the one old out [laughter] except for except for Bill crust and I haven't seen anything from Georgia and it's like ... yeah exactly so you know if they're not part of the ... he he's not some of the right and he's done some Steve Bannon insurgent and\nThe judge is the epitome of the GOP legal establishment a Supreme Court nominee from central casting\nAnd it and you know and it's a great point spent twenty six years in public service and the hope what what and that's why it's not about him what I think it would I think it is and I think it's bigger than just Cavanaugh I think it's the realization\nFrom\n... from ...

S. underscores how vastly different the military's role is in each country\nIt also suggests the challenge German politicians faced increasing defense expenditures to NATO spending guidelines a sharp point of contention between Berlin and the Trump Administration\nIn Germany shortfalls and military manpower has some political factions flirting with the idea of recruiting other European nationals into the German army\nI guess these will be mercenaries who are not typically reliable 'cause their loyalties for sale while nearly a third of Germans withhold their hero designation for all their fighters only five percent of those in America I said no troops are heroes and twelve percent said they didn't know\nThe numbers demonstrate a tendency in the U.S military members on a pedestal a two thousand Seventeen Gallup poll found that Seventy two percent of Americans had confidence in our military the highest marks for any public institution\nHowever uh two thousand sifting book ended by current defense secretary Jim Mattis and Kori Schake entitled warriors and citizens American views of our military found that few Americans we're very familiar with our military or how it functions under civil authority\nIn Great Britain only six percent of those polled said soldiers should ever be described as heroes but Britain's were more likely to reserve high praise for troops who performed heroic acts with thirty two percent saying that demonstrated bravery should factor into the equation\nThere are many ways to start a fire but one sure way to put it out learn how you can do your part

to any hard and fast conclusions Lulu struck the conversation\nI expect we'll have future interviews on these topics I Can't imagine that we wouldn't\nThe topics are the warrior what is the role of the warrior and water the requirements should be an effective one\nAnd the proper roles for women in our military she is going to be excited and there's no way we're going to get out of this one without some jobs in some laughs in some other things but this is a conversation that's not going on in the Pentagon is not going on in the military right now formally at least\nJoining me for this conversation is air force vet autumn ... an army that Matt Hayes both have been on the show before and argue and you know I'm certified characters crushed me on that will go back autumn\nOh thank you for having me and Matt glad you could make it as a Christian and colonel okay autumn start off with a quick review of your time in the military in the air force I Believe\nThat's correct I joined in two thousand and cute little after high school I started out as a aircraft mechanic and their weapon specialist so my ... weapons on airplanes and I did that for about ten years\nSince gain any injury that was in a career killer at the time so I had changed jobs and to do a manpower analyst but just kind of like the Airforce version of human resources and I did that for about four years before I decided just separated in ... other than er than sound area\nOkay Matt you went to West Point like I did find that\nI did a few years later than you or your ... just a kid I yeah I mean I started at West point in the summer of Nineteen eighty one\nFortunately it was on the four year plan didn't have to do the four and a half shows armor got my assignment in Europe I always wanted to go back to Germany after doing my leadership training from West Point there in Germany\nOr ... squadron there for\nThree years it was the cat squadron for the third Armored Division and when I came back I went to Fort Stewart Georgia and an arm or a company that was in the Eighteen ... we were mobilized for Desert Storm in August of Ninety One and then Laurie is nine months so we're there sitting in the desert\nAnd then I got out shortly after I came back from ...\nOkay so you saw the Cold War and a little bit of the new war through okay there's no doubt\nIn anybody's mind should be that women have served honorably in well in our military for generations and we can go back to Mali pressure in the revolutionary war but the whole girls most people don't know this ran the tire phone communication system for our military in Europe during World War one\nThere didn't have enough men they knew how to run telephone so the women came in they were not in uniform officially but they sure served our military\nIn World War two even more so particularly the medical areas but normally they started taking other positions\nAnd since then they moved into virtually every position in our military and done so very effectively however towards the end of the Obama administration women were permitted to move into the final and most dangerous of all combat positions that are close combat let's face to face stuff the tip of the spear infantry armor special ops\nNow we're dealing with the close combat were that's what I Want to talk about today the close combat warrior\nAnd that's the issue should women be their women are being allowed in\nAnd there are those who say that there are some women who can do things that they should be allowed to others who say well not so sure well let's talk about women's roles I don't think we have to talk about all the administrative a military police in maintenance type rolls because they've been doing it for years very effectively but we do need to start by acknowledging that\nAnyway Matt\nLet's start this off what is it close combat warrior how do you find one what does he he or she has to be able to do what's the checklist or something\nColonel yelling that is maybe a little bit difficult to answer because this kind of a broad question but I think basically what you need to do\nIt I guess it depends on whether you're a leader or just a fighter but really in terms of close combat you need to be able to speak clearly even when chaos is breaking all around you and you need to be able to use your resources because when we talk about close combat the American army should never be within\nMore than a hundred yards hopefully of the enemy because you want to use close air support you wanna use artillery you want to use hand grenades from your him two or three so you really want to use all the resources to be the enemy\nBut when it comes right down to it it takes someone who has a healthy disregard for their own safety because most combat warriors they're going to get hurt they're going to get shot and you have to really be able to commit yourself fully to the battle in if it does come down to a personal struggle hand to hand you've got to be physically wrong and willing to\nSome and all of your inner ferocity I say\nAnd overcome the enemy so there are some very specific things that are needed\nWell that is true this is going to get on the front lines of freedom we're discussing warriors or a military with automatic weapons of\nMass faced autumn that was match approach what are your insights on this\nI completely agree I think it's just a matter of perception because you know to be fourteen years and I moved to every two years I change stations every two years\nAnd to be that new person it'd be the new female on site\nI felt like I had to prove myself and there's no heavy curved filled that they didn't have to carry my way to have to do anything and so\nI'm the kind of do that over and over again had really kind of built up that mental strength and that goes for a lot of women who are veterans did you have to be you're right you have to be strong at some point\nIt's just the approach like women are a lot more strategic so they put a lot of thought into what they're doing it might not be something physical but at the same time look at what happens in the news when you hear about mothers having the adrenalin rush to\nSave their kids or to do things that women can be extremely strong when it comes down to that fight or flight mentality in the military is no exception whatsoever\nI think that the idea that women doing these combat jobs should be a ... America does business because that's our men and women are doing things to protect this country other countries don't do it we do and it says a lot that when they can step up to the plate because women are built in all shapes and sizes but if they're determined to do it\nAt the kind of fall back that men worry about is like their sense to be protective over women and that's just something that men are programmed to do is to be protective of women but\nPart of the culture right exactly but you got to let us do it you gotta let us prove that we can do it just so much because the outcome is all the saying we're still serving protecting our country were still\nShowing that men and women can do great things working together and you're talking about two half of the coin if he got the way they think and the way that women think and he put together something positive you have some or something so much stronger and using both men and women to advantage\nBut what you're saying I think is there's a real benefit to diversity exactly with different people from different backgrounds weather is gender or anything else from together you can do better stinking right venue where what if you're not in\nJune and what I Want our listeners to think about is think about the leadership they had if they've had women leadership how did they act differently than males who are in a leadership role I had great leaders that were women they saw what but they lead differently than males superiors but\nIt's still worked and so I mean that says and account something I think about that a potential is there you just gotta give it a chance and be open minded to it\nYou know in the leadership role I completely agree because I have\nWell sort of run my cage who I'm very traditional male or we can all basically all male army very my service but I've interacted with email generals of all the services since then and very good as the man I mean the bedrooms and everywhere of jerks everywhere they're great people everywhere\nI haven't seen a difference between men and women as a general officer level however if it came down to you in math be with me and me being attacked by a squad of the enemy and we had to go face to face\nI really appreciate your time but I think I'd rather a mat with me because among other things I wouldn't worry about what happened to him if he got ... I wouldn't worry about what would happen to you you got great is that makes sense\nYeah absolutely and then living with another veteran I asked them that question is more and 'cause he was a ranger and I said hey\nHow do you feel about women being rangers\nAnd he said the same thing it's just it felt like it the quality of strength and the hard things you have to go through because they take a very select few but if I feel that you know a woman can pass the same requirements and qualifications as the guy why not the proof is there the proof is in the testing\nAnd there's more to discuss about warriors and women are our military and autumn and matter to me stay with us discriminated going frontlines freedom group you have to push up time I want you to a hundred and three pushups someone I Do every day and take a break we see in the area we'll be right back [noise]\nUnited American patriots the sends us service members who are wrongfully accused of a crime in combat\nAnd she kinda backtrack and said well not necessarily but if you don't like it you should tell them I said I completely agree but you know so there's there's such a disconnect these days in what's considered appropriate and what's not appropriate and most twenty year olds have no idea that line where the line I'm\nLet me get back on that real good or right ahead\nPlay that other part so working in and they'll have the ... luckily I grew up in our first responder family so I already had skin knowing that was only possible effects are harassed Matt and Matt's with all those kind of things and I'm you know I was always told\nAs long as they don't put their hands on yeah it's just words so I always had that like they were trying to say 'cause if I was offended by everything it would have really made a bad work environment survey so I let them just say whatever they had to say and not think anything but I think the silver line there too with\nWomen have a hard time this constraint kindness for flirting yes\nAnd so I kind of want to remind our female listeners too that if someone says something if\nWe always tend to like make our judgment on how attractive we are to that person uh-huh so that's another thing is just take the compliment it's okay as long as they're not doing anything to invade your space they put their hands on you just it's OK\nWell item I Love the fact that you have that mentality in all honesty I Try to get into the air force first and I guess I was an air force material but the army was glad to take me to I think we would have served very very well together have you been in the same time\nThat the little things bother me like that just I got to remember who I Am working with and what's going on in their mind and I hate to say that that it's almost want to have the upper hand to where they can set the tone of the environment if I can tell someone straight theater vase versus let it get to me because their word I don't know how I Would never would have made fourteen years\nVery well put well obviously this conversation is not over it is for today but we need to pursue this because this is a direction our nation is moving and we need to be thinking about it\nOnce and for sure if we conclude and if our nation concludes that women can serve anywhere Houdini and for three or march over the next time we have a war all women will be drafted and most of them will end up in the country 'cause that's where most of the need is because if we don't do that there'll be lawsuit\nIs that where we want to go to that for our next discussion\nSo thank you out on the map for taking the time to join us today thank you for your service to our nation I appreciate you oughta\nWell thank you for having me I really enjoy the mask I joined me today

flies a it was a great time to be in Colorado Springs Colorado was beautiful weather warmed up to about eighty two as we look over a where able to look at pikes peak and watch a pretty good game as well even though the falcons did not prevail\nWell as we were talking before their second half was a whole lot better than the first time was\nIt really was standing in the first pass a playing the Nevada wolf pack where they sell twenty to twenty five the first half was really I really a catastrophe was bad foot about it is no sugar coating it no way around that\nArea and worth meant just could not get anything going for the ... the defense Everytime you looked up from talking to my buddy's there was another past going in the end zone at at the half\nThe wolf pack had a Twenty one that's seven lead and truthfully air force was fortunate that it wasn't any worse at that time\nBut the second half of the shows from resolve and they show something they they really going to need next week they change quarterbacks\nAnd in the second half a they started off with a forty three year if you go from Jake ... than there was another touchdown sprinkled in there from Nevada but a mark has been it then hauled Anna to your past from\n... third who replaced Erian worth men as the quarterback\nSo that was a twelve play fifty eight yard drive than in the fourth quarter Hammond scored on a ... yard run\nEleven place sixty seven yards and those aren't the familiar types of drive that we like to hear from our academy teams towards the end of the game Airforce made it close to defense held and Nevada ran out of the back of the end zone for an intentional safety\nMake the score twenty twenty five and cake to air force with\nSeventeen Seconds left to go and air force they had about two plays one which they completed a pass and the second where they threw it into the and they're trying to win it at the last play the game but the past failed incomplete but when we look at the tail of the tape is evident why they lost\nNevada out game there for four hundred and thirty six yards to two fifty air force is titled possession was only twenty eight minutes to Nevada is thirty one and in the turnover battle it was dead even so\nYou know with the air force are struggling with right now is really the running game they had fifty one attempts only averaging three yards rush and you just can't make a living like that on the ground you got to get more out of the running game than that\nAnd of course they're not going to be a passing team that's not who they are they never have been so ... was only a meter two hundred and fifty yards and that's just not going to win it many games so\nThe falcons fail twenty eight twenty five hopefully they found a quarterback hopefully they found a quarterback who can get the team rushing for more than a hundred and fifty four yard that figure needs to be closer to three hundred or more for them to really have a good chance\nWell I played a little bit of football I always thought that you didn't average for yards per running blood you were going to lose\nAs her identity that's that's the magic number either because of four times three he at twelve yards away ... universe down you know and at three or to a pop and you can see is just not going to get it done so in a deep sense then gets put in bad situations at all and uh\nUh teams the sense is just a really\nBuilt to withstand that much of a a barrage and you give other teams enough chances and they're ... they're going to break through at some point\nThey sure the Sunni going from under freedom or just 'cause he was going to be football with when Roberts will need you had to buy the army during during last week\nFor identity they played buffalo and the bulls came in on defeat it looking to really score big land against army army of course coming off that narrow defeat\nAgainst the Oklahoma sooner and licking their wounds just a bit but I tell you what I did not sit army back but so much with the bulls came out on top and first quarter scoring on fifty three are pass from tire rejection that kj Osborne go up seven zero\nBut it was the again another great drive a good army Dr eleven place Seventy four yards five minutes at forty four seconds some Caitlin hold to get in on a five yard touchdown run\nMoving to the second quarter was all army uh is Conor ... three are brown on another twelve plate driving many lives are Riley I had an eighty yard return of a block field goal so special teams played a big part in that as well\nMoving into the second half and the third quarter buffalo broke through with a twelve play drive of their own to cut the score to Twenty one at\nThirteen but Jordan as barrier hauled in a guess what a pass from quarterback held at Hopkins to score touchdown passes ten a path\nThrew the ball [laughter] ten place Seventy five an hour drive and then the fourth quarter they was all army ... folk scored a touchdown as well as ... than to fill it with a forty two over ... forty two to Thirteen\nThe score over the Buffalo Bills and when we look at the tail of the tape\nArmies total yards three Seventy two to buffalo to fifty five time of possession thirty seven minutes to twenty two\nFor styles twenty five to buffalo fourteen and even though army had won turn over they could still overcome that so you know again when you look at those kinds of stats are winning stats\nWhen you see that army ran the ball for two hundred and eighty one yet to remember what the Airforce I say that you want to have it closer to three hundred\nAnd but they held buffalo to rushing for only one hundred and three yards so they're planning winning football the defense is playing well they're controlling the clock\nThey're getting the running game going and getting some big plays in there and surprisingly this year a covert Hopkins has shown that he's a better passer\nAnd the previous quarter back and go to mark and as allowing him to throw a ball now and I forgot to be mistaken for running shoe pain okay let's not let's not get\nAhead of ourselves but I'll come to complete it four out of five passes for a touchdown and Eighteen point two yards per completion tall and Ninety One yards and total so\nYou know when you look at that that's a game winning football yeah back to their two hundred and eighty one on the ground and now you you see why\nThe officers operating at a highly efficient level and the defense is really planned good ball as well holding buffalo it all the two hundred and fifty five yards total yard one fifty to passing on one of three underground\nAny way you like it so that's a great game for one of our service academy football we want to do it is a game\nThat's right and the army now moved to three and two there are only two lawsuits being against power five teams Duke who've having a good season this year and of course Oklahoma so so army look strong and I tell you if you look at the record their schedule\nIt really looked favorable for that I could honestly see them running the table are men and women want to get ahead of ourselves at all but\nIt could honestly see them doing that good as they don't have another power five team on a schedule\n... off well ... plays air force\nIt's a big navy we get a [laughter] is this is the one week at you and I really have a lot in common with all
