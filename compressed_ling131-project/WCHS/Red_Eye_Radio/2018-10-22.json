moments that make up our everyday somewhat good others not so much\nIt's when you experience and moment of uncertainty something someone's behavior attendance inclined to\nThese are the moments take a ...\nBecause if something doesn't feel right\nIt's not about paranoia or being a free\nStanding up and protecting our communities one detail on time because a lot of little details can they come up that\nWay in the rain we we trust our instinct just like you should because only you know we're not supposed to be in your everyday so protect her every day\nIf you see something suspicious say something to local authorities\nEighty UCA chess\nFrom ABC News I'm Sherry ...\nThey want to buy a house but he is now the right time John Hancock kind of device innovation the doorbell Gary ... about how big banks are offering that'll tell people budget long term investment and new home\nThe vast majority of people do in fact want to be homeowners you know fifty one percent of people think that owning a home is the best investment you can make Seventy three percent agree that it's an important financial milestone\nThe first step is not down payment and that is a major road block for a lot of people the champion and it can be\nReally daunting because you know for somebody who is you know relatively young and there's just getting started with their financial life it would be the largest single sum of money that they probably put into anything on their own their education obviously costs money but it gets spread out and their parents or ... or they take out loans so\nTo think about coming up with ten twenty thirty forty thousand dollars and gas little loan if the if you live in a coastal city it's even multiples of that as a down payment can be daunting but yet not on achievable\nWhat do you do if if you know you need to you want to buy a home you know when they take that step it but but you just look at that down payment and you say that is just on achievable unattainable what do you do\nWant to you know the first thing that I Would suggest is just doing a research understanding what it is that you do need it you know maybe\nIn your head you think you need fifty thousand dollars but maybe there's a way to get into a house with twenty thousand dollars you know I put eight thousand dollars out of my first call so there are opportunities and there are more good programs that you could potentially take advantage of it\nAnd thinking about you know not just taking a rule of thumb from a national average but think about where you live and what the cost of living in your area is to make sure that you're identifying the right amount\nThat you need and then it starts to get into just budgeting and getting started one of the themes we always cautious part of our efforts is to say there's no time like the president to just get started the only guarantee you that if you don't start you won't get\nThere how long that normally take for people to come up with that ten percent minimum that they need people\nAre realizing that they have to play it out for it they\nDon't expect to sort of have this thing the overnight\nBut don't want to necessarily have it be a gold is going to happen in ten or Twenty years so we really do try to give them a tool and and we've built into trying a calculator that that helps people to understand given\nThe amount of money that you can set aside on a weekly or monthly basis and given the target goal that you have whether it is ten twenty thirty thousand dollars how long will that and then we also give them a sense of is there a benefit\nIs there a pro and con to taking in and if it is a five to seven year time period maybe thinking about investing the money and and seeing if there's a a benefit to doing that in the middle a in a conservative investment portfolio but even if it helped to save you six months than we think there might be is a work at least ...\nAre there other things that you should do before you make that down payment like say you have credit card debt save other kinds of debt you should get that cleared up first strike\nYou know it all comes down to each couples unique goals in life how important is\nHomeownership to you and your family\nYou know self concept it could be that if you waited till the quote unquote perfect moment it might never us and so for some families it is worth it to say you know we have a growing family we need to move into a house and we're willing to spend a little bit longer to pay all this other debt in order to achieve this financial dream for ourselves and for other people they might feel like they need to have a little bit more\nA level of comfort in order to be able to take on that type of obligation because as we know there is paying for the house and then there's maintained to the house so there's always more to go\nAbsolutely I Need you mentioned that there is no perfect a moment in and if you wait for that perfect moment you're going to be waiting for as for how easy is it to get a mortgage these days I Know that the economy has improved credits loosened up on the edge but not a lot but that working pretty hard to obtain for a lot of people\nIt can be and certainly I think it goes without saying that it's harder than it was ten years ago but I think it is something that if you do your research and if you do you're planning and if you've taken positive steps in your financial life to have good credit than is something that has already achievable for most families\nSteve door of all the head of advice and innovation for John

give you freedom from death going now for your free consultation and it was this easy I Would call ... years ago\n... to sixty seven let's eat hundred bucks a month to sixty seven fifty eight hundred five five to sixty seven fifty\nDecided when it comes to sort of send them to see someone with some more and more and more frequently when I'm going for them so much of the MIT organ damage eagles eagles one licensed by the corporation commission license number D.C thirty two\nCultural appropriation ... right now right sure I'll throw appropriations she's\nShe's a appropriating a culture and the thing I liked his when he even came up with a one sixty fourth well she could be one sixty fourth or it could be won over five hundred and twenty or one over one thousand two hundred and twenty four\nAnd it was like yeah but the one or even if it's the one over sixty four and I don't even know whether this is true or not but somebody pointed out they said well no the average American is one point eight percent Native American so it doesn't even meet with the average American\nIs that that particular point so without question this is ... ... you know cultural appropriation right the the the second thing was\nYou want white privilege white privilege as a white person claiming that they can be whatever they wish to be whatever minority they wish to be that they can be whatever minority they wish to being the other thing was the median jumping on this is it as if this legitimize\n[laughter] yeah that would be like you know that that that we did but yeah that that ...\nThat was it because there were some here's what was I think great about the whole scenario I don't know that was planning on the part of the president I don't think it was it was just basic basically it was his rhetoric on his side right\nBut remember back in twenty sixteen we were saying okay when you're on a stage with Hillary and you're you're debating\nJust throw the facts that are you know she lied about being ... she you know uh the she broke the law when it came to her email server all these things as throw the facts out and have them fact check well they ended up back checking Elizabeth [laughter] with warm people basically doing that and then they come back as if it's legitimate\nRight but then they remember they kept changing it that well the ... the ... was the Boston Globe are way out yeah we made us take care of and we made a mistake again\nAnd again it just got to the point of being the most was saying yeah right and I'm thinking to myself wow how bad are ... seriously now you and I need to reconsider ... we need to get out of this radio thing and get into political consulting\nOh yeah I Would totally do that and just say you idiot yeah what do you think that they're not going to war [laughter]\n... well if you're going to waste your money waste your money on us give us a million dollars and we can be a lot better political consultants for whoever you're using right because remember this means that Elizabeth Warren got together with all of her aides and they sat in a room and said okay here's our plan to counter Trump mhm yeah and everybody shook their heads going\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha that's re go was that was that you think there was one guy or gal in the room that said no no [laughter] they all they all there was an overriding vote as sorry we all voted you were deciding to go with it because [laughter]\nWe're just a tactic become a good idea and and but this is not this is the mainstream remember when you had the Kavanaugh hearings the first capital hearings\nAnd it was the first day and remember that whole weekend the Democrats on the committee had decided whether or not they were going to do a full on walk out or just do the ... thing right and they thought that has struck disruptive thing you know with Grassley a basically would be the tactic they would use that's what they went with\nAnd it was like they had that meaning they met all weekend about it okay would get up and walk out [laughter] which ultimately they did\nOr during the a committee vote on on on Capitol you know that you had come out Harris going outside and doing the ... thing and all that but it wasn't that wasn't so much the ... that was like the protest after the fact they still voted yet and they still voted\nSo there wasn't affected really anything you know it it will show about it but they had the meeting that first weekend they had that meeting will just get up and walk out this is this is the ... this is the mainstream Democrats today\nThis this is not the protesters and we talked about how the protestors the lead the party they lead the party they lead the call for the party but how many groups how many different causes and\nFor protest groups are there this is why they have no direction because they're in every direction\nAnd it's it's it's crazy and then then I guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren then does DNA matter quite right does this does this destroying transgender isn't mhm if DNA matters\nBecause remember the the the next thing is as as we all know uh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing the ... just starting to embrace ... remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter] before this one of the leading liberal icons [noise]\nYou know socialist icons social justice warrior ... who broke a ton of social justice warrior winds and regulations ... number one you were saying that DNA matters does in this so DNA matters across the board then and then it matters for uh your your sexuality it matters for your gender huh\nThat writers for your race huh right is is that the\nIs that the whole point or or does it not in okay what's the determining factor of what you are then what is the what is the day [laughter] where does the decimal point go what is the what is the fraction that indicates that you are a particular ethnicity just great stuff\nWell and if I were doing a debate with her on stage I Would say a former President Obama said race is just a social construct yes do you agree\n[laughter] and people don't forget about that because again what you know it that when a President Obama\n... just before he left office I Believe that was the was the Atlanta for a New Yorker I forgot what I think it was ... he did a a an interview with\nAnd they asked him you know why do you say that you're black ... when you know your ... right next mixed race and he said because I've come to know I've I've come to realize that race is a social construct ... it's what you think you are ... or so\nIs that it it now is that done now has the left moved on because when when you look at it\nThere were so many rules of the social justice warrior that Elizabeth Warren broke and they were completely quiet mhm totally silent mhm everything from cultural appropriation\nTo the fact that race apparently is no longer a social construct it has something to do with DNA that's\nWhy are you using science [laughter] for him [laughter] remember when Ben Shapiro brought up the science on a on the doctor drew show he was threatened with violence\nSo you can't bring up science that's wrong but see this is this is the madness of the left because there are so many different directions how do you know which one is the row\nHere's here's the thing when Trump says something the majority of what Trump says that they criticize in fact check this off the cuff mhm right it's it's an opinion or just the thought that he just boom roller it's out right and and and the insanity of the left\nAnd one of the Ron Paul plan\nAll right you have a great weekend and make sure he joined us for the next ... we come your way weekdays agenda sex writer

so again Dumbo [laughter]\nI'm\nLike ... it's it because\nI ... I went to agree with the exact with 'em but you know the ... you go back to the polls and and there's some frustrating things going on right now in in the house pools and I know there's a lot of ah like in those districts there a lot of the uh local news agencies that do their own polls and TV stations and papers\nAnd everything else and they make that may not make necessarily a an R.

squaring off against old bishops\nWell because then we warned in fact if you look at the what happened in two thousand eight a than your for you that was there after that ah the inauguration and two thousand nine\nAnd then you saw what the Tea Party the birth of the the modern day Tea Party or or the gain I guess in terms of the the momentum of that Tea Party and ... and early about two thousand nine and ... and it kind of carried over\nBut ultimately the rock star thing was over and we warned between election day two thousand eight and a ... day two thousand nine\nFor Obama we said okay for people that wanted the rock star keep in mind he's going to have to do things that are presidential\nAnd those things are not going to work for you by the way that\nWas so [laughter] [noise] so and years ago [laughter] because [laughter] come ... off the charts now\nAh to the fact that you know to the point that in fact or Beethoven does not need the former presidents of campaigning in Texas um but but\nThe that that didn't carry over the ... the Trump\nMomentum is built on a number of things and real things it's not rock stardom but if you want to talk about a political rock star and that would be somebody in my opinion that that that performs gets things done on his agenda\nNot not that Obama didn't get things done on his agenda they got Obama carried through you know they had to lie about it but they got it through\nA this president got affected things done on the economy this\nPresident got in and created more jobs is president got in and work with Republicans to bring taxes down\nAnd I don't think we've had this conversation we don't think he could have that anyone else could have done that Republicans are alone could have gotten the down on the corporate rate to Twenty one percent\nBut you look at those accomplishments that's where the following that's where the ... it's that's where it's built and then as you mentioned\nThe Kavanaugh thing is something new to the water to do it woke up conservatives it woke up the\nMaybe some of the rhinos who had a band in too many conservative principles\nAnd have them re look\nI guess we examine the threat to democracy the constitution in everything our entire system and process in place during that Kavanaugh debacle that whole thing so that threat became real\nThis is not some kind of rock stardom oh we think looks great or we think he's cool or we like the way he tweets\nIt's based on real things there's a big difference\nBetween skate boarding throw water burger parking lot and getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one percent\nWhile you know ... you know we're talking about this said that if there is a\nIs there and we had mentioned you know but they don't work here in uh in in Texas that that is viewed as the rock star mhm\nWell uh Bud Kennedy of the star telegram and waited out the other day and I just read the article that he wrote based on the tweet yeah there's a place called the originally theater molds like three to five hundred people that's it couldn't fill it couldn't fill\nUp\nThat that it was three quarters cornered Bud Kennedy was three ... you know three quarters full and did an article\nIs titled burnout already here and so when you talk about it ever existed or the I've ever really right did did it ever really exist or was it hype just what was it was it hype and the rank and file or hide in the media right right right is you know is it is the point so\nIf you look at the excitement factor a and again I don't look at crowds just going to visit a candidate a you know you see a candidate\nAs the the be all end all as as to whether people will go out and vote or not\nAll I Know is this that on the issues right now on the economy it's a plus for the Republicans\nOn on exposing what the Democrats really really want and and what they really believe when it comes to this country and they do they even believe in the constitution do they believe in free speech that they believe in\nSecond Amendment do they believe in due process under the law and we're finding out no they don't actually don't believe in the tenets of this country right right and those are pretty simple things to understand\nMaybe the separation of powers you don't understand maybe exactly what the role of Supreme Court you don't understand but you do understand due process\nYeah you need and you do understand the second amendment\nAnd most people do understand free speech and maybe not\nEverything that's in the first amendment but they do understand the free speech everything that the Democrats now do not believe in and are bragging that they don't believe in in those particular things and then you have a caravan of illegal immigrants\nThat are promoting it and the media's giving them as much publicity as possible but we're going to show up Trump's they're coming to the border to crash the border has the mid term elections\nAre just Fifteen days away and it would take them I read one thing that to go what is it the eight hundred miles right I've heard you would take them five hundred and forty seven hours\nWhich means okay so should they should be closing in on the border come election day ... probably not something the Democrats want to be promoting as much as are promoting it right or the media is promoting as much as they are going to promote it\nUntil I think Kavanaugh illegal immigration was still the number one issue of concern for Americans and as you said if there's a conspiracy out there in our priest show meeting Trump did it in order to get\nBuild the wall right Trump is under this whole thing because if I Want a conspiracy theory that just because boom\nIt worked for him if there's if there's anything that that could get get it back on track in terms of the funding for for the wall but he wants the motivation right now go ahead keep promoting the care of and right up to election day\nDo it and let's see what happens let's see what happens on election day because even if the Republicans took the house\nWhat kind of solid victory is that I mean long lines ... I I mean Democrats took the house and you know by by just you know what ten Fifteen\nMargin right two or three margin best ability so even if they did that what kind of long lasting ... if if you think about the promise of what they've got to deliver\nWhat is it\nFree stuff well they'll the house at all the funded while they were they would still have to be ...\nAgain you would you would you would still have to be the resistance how can you be the resistance and govern\nThere's there's no way you can't it's all about obstruction nothing else so what\nDo you do that that delivers numbers where people\nAre the president's working and and getting results than unemployment in taxes and real things that people seeing their bank accounts and in their lives every day what you're doing is

star to uh know that yeah that yeah rock star right here Roger you really are no you really are a rock star I just\nUh yeah you're not a senator and and won't be when you're a rush [laughter]\nThat would have been a burn\nWell thank you very much I mean you're not going to be a senator but you're a rock star\nOh my gosh uh we were just looking at the polls I'd I we haven't seen one from last week\nA which is interesting in that in that Senate race between Ted Cruz and a Robert Francis O'Rourke in Texas but in those latest a couple of polls are Ted Cruz is about fifty and has a pretty good lead so we're not\nReady to call it just yeah that was interesting because he said over the weekend [noise] apparently that he's not going to run for the presidency and twenty twenty mhm yeah I was interesting about Wall Street journal wrote who I loved her editor from last week we are all Native Americans and\nUh now who are on the American style but they said that they believe that killed any chance she has a running for the presidency ... because she would just be she will be over there are more in general be she will be for ever\nUh mocked for that so right when you hear the fact that people talking about by and I thought about this uh\nI own some time over vacation because you know you're you know wow Biden's too old he's still says he won't run but by and probably if you look at the polling still Democrats won by more than anybody\nMhm Mm well then Hillary naturally would think well why not me again\nRight and that thought from whatever age talking about that she's you know hasn't ruled it out yet\nI mean that just send the social media severe\nUh yeah it just exploded and white world thinking oh the Trump at a gum at least [laughter] please make that happen please happen again and it just I just want while she just won't disappear and now you know her and bill\n... weeks you know ... you know before the midterms going out and yeah you know they want to get their ... you know they're going to be out there and and sharing the Democrats on me while the Democrats\nAre going well I mean what did\nYou have there just fresh out of a whole a cabinet thing right we're just a couple of weeks out of that and remember what you had you had some of the hash tag me too movement a leaders\nAnd celebrities coming out saying no we should've repeating we should have called bill out then of course they don't say that\nBecause she didn't win if she were president now they wouldn't say that Twenty years later than you know ... ... exactly what Twenty years that we should get an a time machine and then go back and then remove him from office\nBut here's my question they go out on you know what the cause of what they're doing they're testing the waters right how much influence does she have where she can't go out with out\nBill so what are you going to do and even if she did\nShe can't go out without a million questions about bill from her own party not from Republicans we've been asking the questions for decades\nSo what do you do\nPlease jump in the water's fine Hillary twenty twenty let's see a rematch good luck because here's the first thing well she's not going to be the only one\nRight\nUh so now we know the DNC will be working to make sure that of course she's ushered in you know make it seem like Bernie's really catching fire but not really [laughter]\nLike we learned in what he's sixteen so as she's in well don't count Bernie out well then Jones thinking the same thing in the opposite you know well wait a minute if she's in well maybe\nI Am in so then you've got your Kamala Harris you've got are\nProbably not what was the war [noise]\n[noise] now but you've got you're going to have a field that is going to be greater than it was what did they have three three and a half candidates going against Trump\nNo but if you in their primary\nAh [laughter] Mm well build me a heck of a lot more I I I well I don't know I I I'm not going to\nYou know you you have to and you said earlier it's going to be either who hates Trump more than a combination of who hates Trump more and we're going to give you everything right and so right now the base level for the Democrats have\nBeen ... over the weekend or last week\nWhen she came up again with her guaranteed in or any of them and yeah of six thousand dollars was one of the figures that was thrown out so now it's\nGet will on race income yeah versus get rid of the the tax cuts right they act taxes would have to go up there in order to pay for it even though they ... it wouldn't pay for the six thousand dollars and but six thousand dollars what any American the mix under a hundred thousand something like that what it was\nUm uh but the ... six thousand they're free healthcare completely Medicare for all where you pay nothing\n... there's no deductible there is nothing mhm which ah by the way uh I thought the president had the best response for that before we went on vacation when he said\nOh good screw people than that right because what's going to happen right you you you you think you're going to Medicare for all you can just going to enter a screen old people because there's not enough money for the old people that have put in for Medicare that we can't pay we had to ... right\nAh but ah you know so you have you have that and free college free college free health care free money mhm\nAnd we hate Trump and really if you want to look at it there was nowhere else for them to go that route it we already know what twenty twenty is going to be\nYeah yep I age because there has to be again the that battle on stage to you know who hates Trump more poor or now will just kind of ushering this this thought to entertain this for a moment okay maybe it is Hillary or maybe it is Joe\nJust anyone that can beat Trump\nExcept there has to be more than that there really has to be more than that because what you're looking at at the end of the day or on election day is\nOh what's going on with the economy and and what are they really promising in and do I have ... I Know a lot of people have trumpet I didn't vote for the guy I may not ever vote for the guy but\nAm I motivated to go out and vote for this person what are they gonna do for me\nYou're talking about other sports were just talking about rank and file voters rank and file voters right because what did you see Wall Street journal going through Harlem and then the day after the election and twenty sixteen why do you think he was just ... you know random\nJudge and he was appointed by a liberal a precedent um do you think that those in the media who are on the left and those in the media on the white and the\nLiberal and conservative politicians would have taken the exact same position had everything been reversed except but everything else is to say just wondering what what\nYou well I I I I Know this that Republicans I mean you had you had people like us that criticized showed him my your ... and and criticized Elena Kagan but it was on the specifics of how she would rule as a judge\nBut they got Republican votes they weren't demonized the way the cabin all was demonized right\nIt did I mean so I Would say no it it would not be it would not be exactly the same based on the history of what happened to them they were criticized and they were severely criticized by\nConstruction is like us to believe that you should follow the rule of law we went back and looked at showed him I your\nDisorder Meyer Yahoo who talked about\nUh the fact that uh oh sorry I'm not supposed to really talk about the fact that we legislate from the bench right right uh we had to lay in a cake and when she couldn't answer the question about uh which was she was asked by a senator whether the government should be able to tell you what food\nYou know you have to you have to buy and she didn't answer the question because it got down to what she believes the Supreme Court is actually you know ... about how you're supposed to rule as a judge but uh no I I don't think it would have been if it would have been a ... number one it wouldn't have happened you're not going to have a liberal justice\nUh then again with Trump's you never know but you're good you could have early for you and I asked him\nTo the point from the color if it was a a liberal president who appointed a liberal justice and there was accused you're like\nA you have a doctor for it but if you but then will fully reverse it be it being Dr Ford had a right leaning affiliation as opposed to left leaning affiliations\nI'm no that wouldn't have that it wouldn't have played out the same way because the media wouldn't have done the same thing that they did here I mean the behavior would be different yeah I mean it would be quite the opposite\nOr use you see it all you you see it already whether it's you know senator brown of Ohio mhm they're not pounding him for stating that the unfounded allegation against a him is a political hit job or not covering him not covering up the same way I won't\nNo no no no I don't know I I don't believe it would be the same no color\nAnd and I think we've seen it like you said we've seen that demonstrated I don't know how many times now along the way\nUm I don't know that that I don't know that anybody would expect it to be the same ... especially any critical thinkers that's watching the entire process play out and then you give them scenario would expect that to be the same but now if that was ... if all of those items were reverse\nWhat you saw from Kavanaugh was the first there's nothing to drive or that you\nKnow that's right that's right great point there's no there's no way to you know that was a precedent that was set by the lab and by the way that's the new normal for them this is kind of behavior [noise]\n\n\n\n... radio on Westwood

been saluting drivers will surpass the million mile mark with preventable\nOn trade when he was talking about when he ran for office and what he actually got were two totally different ballgames completely yeah and what he was talking about on the campaign compared to what he was what he actually got and promoted the good at what he got was completely different\nThan when he was running for his campaign as we've said if his most loyal if the always Trump voters want to support it and go with it we're fine with that because all we care about\nIs the actual substance what did you actually get and does it promote more free trade to promote\nA more more good things but the ultimate thing that he promoted was actually a negative it raises the cost of cars in the United states Canada and Mexico and that's a bad thing mhm and\nNow I think the average person who understands economics who was in caught up in the political I dollar tree will admit that's a bad part of the deal the always Trump or just ignore it ignored as if it doesn't exist\nWere not just going to go there he got the deal he said he was going to redo NAFTA he did after what was in that I don't care don't want to know and that's fine that's part of a demographic that's going to vote for every president that exists sure but that's not the only demographic they voted for Trump we broke it down to eight different demographics\nAbout six months after the election and there's a ton of people that in that age demographics is more now more United and you can even add an ninth and there which are the never Trump ers which have now come aboard mhm so Trump\nFor all of the good in the bad has United with the help of Kavanaugh and the help of the Democrats and then speaking bluntly about what they want this country to\nBecome a have United around Trump and they do look at Trump he is that I think your head that isn't\nThem right and and I think\nYou look at the end and you said this earlier if you want to look at the ... the the real rock star look at the terms in terms of performance\nIn terms of getting things done Trump over they come on I'm close because one thing that that is going to always resonate with American people is a good economy\nIt's going to be a man I'm uh doing okay everybody in my family seems to be doing okay a job status doing OK and or getting better\nYou look at the unemployment numbers in and these kittens were the liberal media can't argue any of those points anymore they can't break it down because you you just simply can't those numbers now they can be manipulated but in breaking them down in terms of the performance as\nAs long as we've used the same standard standard\nWith the same standard of approach basically on those numbers\nYou cannot have a debate about the unemployment or the GDP or anything else because\nThe last president was judged by the same exact standards all of this basically wraps up into one thing what is it that the other side wants to do and is that a threat to this existing ... you know economy right now in other words\nA you know I'm really I'm I Am doing a little bit better you know my jobs doing better or making a little more whatever it might be I'm I'm checking home a little more taxes are lower [noise]\nNot only that but I remember you know we said this and I don't know if anybody's ever used the exact same words that we used and I think we use to probably uh I think this was early in the primaries and we continue to say it all the way through the election\nAnd we and and the media has completely missed is totally ... but it's not just that the analysis that I was telling you that I read yesterday the Trump is the average ... an average person the average person looks at them as the average person what does that entail the average person if you cause that to me doesn't describe\nThe the the substance at just that's labeling people I use an average person therefore he likes Trump's because Trump relates to the average person because they believe he's like the average person what does that mean\nAnd you and I actually use the L Word back way back in the in in the campaign I Believe that and and I believe this too but I Believe the Trump loves America mhm and I believe\nHe loves Americans and he loves Americans first\nUm\nBut he loves Americans and I think the people that support him I think part of the political I dollar tree which is different than Obama's political I dollar tree\nRight is that they look at him and they say here's a guy that truly loves America and he loves to me he cares about me yeah he's rude and yeah he's crude but when it gets down to with a law that comes from the anger that we believe that he shares with us that these other people don't love America\nMhm and we love America and how do we love it and now the left to lead me to get insulted we love America no you don't you don't believe in due process yeah well Cuomo America's never been great right but ... ... exactly mhm that you you really you really don't you don't really believe in the first amendment you don't really believe in the second amendment\nYou don't believe in due process you don't believe in a presumption of innocence what do you really love about America you and I had brought this up\nFor over ten years when we've gone through certain issues and said women if you don't care about this and you don't care about the constitution 'cause what makes us Americans do we live in the same geographical placed oh no\nIt's we share\nAn idea and what is that idea that the ideas the constitution and the United state us and when you have a group of people are political party were\nChecked that this isn't bubble thought 'cause that's what the Democrats will try or just a bunch of others out there oh Trump Globes America we love America or\nWhat I mean I Love America to actually if you don't believe in the constitution you don't love America you may love the concept of what you as a group all think America should be\nBut you don't love America the way that it exists under the current constitution and the rules and regulations that we have\nYou and I've talked about it when you talk about the fact now there's they're talking about well the president needs to remember the president's seat is no longer effective or that needs to go yeah the the the electoral college needs to go to the Senate needs to go from what they don't understand what those are key words that you don't believe in individual liberty\nBecause we are not a direct democracy we are a constitutional republic and the reason we are as to protect the rights of the minority yes to protect the individual rights and the rights of the minority exactly what they claim that they believe the Democrats claimed that they they think about\nSo we look at all that and that's all part of loving America so when you hear when I say that I I've always gotten response old it's above the thing that he loves American we don't know based on\nThe actual specifics of what the Democratic Party is promoting ... were calling for which is anti constitutional mindset and an anti constitution well yeah and we can make that point and you and I said for the longest time\nBut it's still left that doesn't believe in the first amendment oh for them yeah mhm but for others they don't and we have broken that down before\nThey don't believe in the second amendment and now they don't believe in due process under the law when it's inconvenient for them there was not a presumption of innocence that mindset is wrong and we've talked about that you know the support of the judges\nWhen the judge has become activist judges\nAnd how that is on American and unconstitutional and how they promote that mhm and so the average person I think she's at and Trump is anything they look at Trump and I look at Trump and you look at Trump is anything but an authoritarian and a fascist\nEven at times though his words me like I don't say that\nYeah I when you look at what he actually doesn't what he promotes in the long run it's all constitutional\nYes it's all part of the process\nThat was put in place hundreds of years ago\nI mean it it's but this is this is what we have to this is what it has to come down to if we're not going to win the Senate when did you get rid of it that we're not going to win the electoral college vote\nThan to really get rid of it we need to get rid of the constitution wanted Dustin when it doesn't ... me when we don't win the White House we need to get rid of the presidency that's anti American\nYes\nNo it's not well what America for ... it's not America we don't like it but on the constitution if we don't have the form of government that we have that it's no longer America\nWhat do you believe in besides the Fifth Amendment [laughter]\nBesides exactly an eight six six Ninety read I [noise]\nWas buck for red are ready to do with a record ...\n[noise]\nBe a

completely different ... in this narrow it\nKevin on that so just came up to my attention okay and then let's say was completely different so\nWhat group of conservatives or Republicans would be like ... like scratch or way and it will be playing or share of it like\nI didn't understand who will go on our side will be going a little ...\nThat nobody knows who served as you're\nIf you're talking about the behavior of the the uh the uh interrupted though disruptive kind of and we're getting some interference on your costs will let you go\nUm if you're talking about the disruptive type of behavior or the after the the committee vote on Kavanaugh the Kamala Harris and and uh and others walking out that kind of behavior who on the right would do that\nI don't know of anybody that would do that our point was that it would have been a different scenario based on the media treatment of\nA set individual had everything but that's really more about the media to treat 'em and ... what we do and we did go back and talk about the working down of the um\nUh you know what how they have acted or behaved a as a judge\nDuring the confirmation process we're sort of my or or for early in the Kagan and what they might do in a in a certain scenario but that was based on their behavior as a judge\nYou still had Republicans vote for them you still hot and that was their treatment of them was based on again how they would be have as a judge that was part of a what Lindsey Graham and say\nYou know he voted for Alina Kagan and sort of my ... and so ... what the behavior be you know I'm a a a ... well a Lindsey Graham getting up and walking out likely not no\nBecause I think what you saw and Lindsey Graham and\nUh his uh emotional or the you know statement that day during that hearing when Kavanaugh was there was based on the ...\nThe behavior of those on the left and how would they were treating this and essentially a shredding the process\n\nAnd and I think that's what that's what that was\nIf it had\nYou know a liberal president and it was a a liberal justice or liberal judge a that had been appointed and during this process there was a conservative leaning or a you know a woman that using him of doing something with the behavior be different by the media would have been treated the same\nLikely not no but it was kind of a you know with all due respect to well the answer I think we all know that any critical thinkers do so I don't expect a\nLindsey Graham or or another conservative on the committee or or Republican on the committed to get up and do what come out with Harris did you know after the committee will get up and storm out\nThat wasn't ...\nYou know but I Would have been ... and again you can't make the case he was trying to make the case that it was the same and I'm like no it was on President what happened right mhm and you you can look at Justice Thomas you know that goes back you know twenty five\nOr ... that goes back twenty five years ago and and uh you know he those hearings were held and then but then but then he was he was you know confirmed and I believe some Democrats even cross the line and voted for him yes they did I Believe that yes they did well\nI Believe that was a Democrat said it at the time ... yeah\nUh so yeah so you know they they ... but this was unprecedented nothing nothing we have ever seen a it in our lifetime or in modern times has has been like this so to even question that\nTo me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity it means a lack of knowledge ah on on history and that's why we brought up and said that didn't happen with sort of minor and that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe\nThat sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn the\nCell tower right to cell tower case or the cell tower that they agreed with ... they you know that ah they use the in their writings they used 'em\nA prior judgment or by opinion written by ... majority opinion written by Scalia is ... exactly that was the press and the right to use\nBut in many of their many of their answers and many of their their decisions we believe they legislate which is not their role which is why we were against their nomination but it was\nBased on traditionally what they would do not by what we want each and every day mhm mhm but what the job of the judges and that's the difference and that's something that we brought up with the whole cabinet hearings that we should look ... you know conservatives and Republicans stop have to stop arguing\nThe same premise that Democrats are arguing right Republican I keep arguing most conservative versus liberal justice no it's not ... I'm not voting for a conservative judge I'm voting for a construction is an originalist\nI'm voting for a judge irrespective of what they wish the government to be each and every day understand\nThat their role is not to make law either left or right\nThere their job under the constitution is to interpret what the law says\nYou know it's interesting too is that as we got to the uh the the closer to the the ultimate vote on\nOn a cabin on you know I made the point that even the liberal justices respect the process in my opinion based on experience and I think one thing you can look at one judgment you can look at from SCOTUS\nWas recess appointments which was the anonymous yeah against all by him against Obama yeah because if you look at that that really was something that was very clear on what the process [noise] yes and so\nRespecting not only the process of how you know the confirmation process of of of how that's done but also again the process at the highest court I Do believe and you know you can say what you will about the opinions written by a Ginsburg or or whether they're descending or majority opinion\nYou can we can turtles apart and say well they're wrong about this or the wrong about that or we disagree with this or that but in terms of the process I think\nSimilar to what they are a lot of the left criticizes him for his words in his\nTalk and it's not so much the job that he's done\nYou know they may pick apart you know whatever it is in the chair of babies [laughter] by the way we're the original ... babies um but but but they may become part of the things that the sort of that but ultimately if you got down and you were to ask the never Trump or is it conservative never droppers\nUh well okay the corporate tax rate Twenty one percent did you think that was going to happen or your part that you agree with that um the unemployment rate the GDP where we are right now uh do you think we're moving in a good direction in the president's done a good job on a number of items\nI don't know how you would do that even as a never\nTrying and ... I I Believe the president should fight more when it comes to to debt he's taking little victories I'm cutting the federal government this much but it's doing nothing to solve the budget problem yachts Rite Aid throws you throw that out but\nThe fact is he knows he's not the legislative branch and yes he knows he the one power ... this isn't this isn't the precedent alone that has you know created this deficit spending these other Republicans in Congress including a significant portion of conservative or formerly conservative\n[laughter] drink right also who wants to identify conservative Republican\nCongressional members that are also wanting to spend my eight eight a ton of money well\nWell how did they get tax has done Roy Moore last yeah and they realized oh my gosh we got to get things done because we may lose the Senate at some point we got this slim you know victory here are slim margin now and it they didn't ... the Republicans and the Senate\nDidn't get it done until after that lost the president had been working toward that but again this answer tight if they're not going to do anything right\nI think the president should still work harder and still talk about more which he does not ... you probably at the end I I'm thinking that probably the White House says look we can't win this mhm because our own party doesn't\nCare any more about the debt well you know what's what's really disappointing I guess the downside of the capital of the thing or what may have motivated a lot of people or whether it's the never Trump or his or or the the moderate Republicans or who now are standing up and for conservative principles again\nIt could be too little too late not not in the Senate but in the house and the president and the Republicans if the just

early voting starts for us here today in Texas I don't know when it starts across the nation for other ah states but just Fifteen days away from election day in so much talk about us we've been doing throughout the morning back to you we go let's talk to Mike in Washington state Mike Hi you're on the radio I might\nThank you this whole meal or the thing is just like it's just so frustrating for the voters because it drags on and on his coming up with nothing it's false accusations and it's I think we're going to win the house because of it because people are sick and tired of it\n... it's interesting because there there was a report that was out last week my dad said ah that expect mall or a ... to issue his the core of his report after the midterm and I'm Wondering why after the midterm and\nAnd what's going on why is the media\nThey've just abandon this story and I mean they've banned in this story completely there's really nothing going on like what you saw up until a I don't know what a couple of months ago maybe\nAnd then when the house I well I I don't know that we will but it's interesting Mike\nThere what I don't believe was is this uh like the FiveThirtyEight thing saying that you know they an eighty five percent chance that the Democrats will take the house\nBecause you have to get into all the different polls and all these districts and I mean there's a ton of but then we can break it down much easier into those thirty one tossup states right that that right now according to our sleepy there are thirty one tossup seats\nThere are things like ah Texas thirty two\nUh Pete Sessions and his Democratic challenger is someone who was in the last poll which was twenty eight days ago\nToday a was within a point now we know because we live here in in this area we know that that district is a north of Dallas County uh and so there has been a they're a demographic shift that's been going on\nThat shift has been happening really over the last uh probably\nA three to five years but really over the last few years especially because so much growth in this area brings individuals and for jobs right so there's a the the demographics change\nSo that could be an accurate ... we don't know my question is why aren't we seeing those big posters in these\nA toss up districts and why are we seeing these new polls come out especially a couple of weeks out because if you're looking at the house you would think that there was some interest there by the media in order to hire these pollsters these major pollsters are to do a more in depth polls we maybe we'll see some starting this morning\nAnd into next week a and over the next couple of weeks as election days one week from tomorrow but my question is\nReally not if five thirty eight or any of them or wrong or because um who was it that had the basically the the it was like a fifty fifty on the houses that NPR a couple of weeks ago they thought that it was just go\nYeah yeah so and and it came out to eat yesterday that in what is it likely of voters or the Republicans are moving closer right okay that that came out just yesterday I think I have writers somewhere yeah the the the story here\nBut it's so much tougher to tell on those house seats I just I I Wonder that if we're going to gain\nIn the in the in the Senate mhm and so that's you know that's looking at a populations across the state and right here or that\nYou know I just wonder how they extrapolated out to so many of these races where if they're using the public polls out there there are so few of them\nSo few and far between how the if there's no if you're going to the internal polling polling which I'm sure as being done by the campaigns right and you would have the better you know a better guess at that\nRight yeah it it gets here\nIt is a a a dentist mid term advantage narrows among registered voters yeah I knew national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances of a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the GOP these seven point gap is narrowing from a ... point gap that Democrats had in September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters ... we've got to talk of likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day and it's we've been talking about this it has changed since the Kavanaugh's confirmation leading up to ... which\nI don't know to what extent I Can't tell you it's motivated the left or the right more we do know there's no doubt the right is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nNow I I watch it on the Mike called before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I\nThat because Mike was not driven to call based on what we had said and therefore he\nYou know became passionate about giving his point of view across my called with that passion about the Russian collusion investigation and his anger and his feeling that this could possibly changed the election you know and and move it to the Republicans before we started talking about I think that's important\nBecause I don't find many people like Mike mhm I don't think honestly\nNow we've covered everything when it comes to the whole Russian collusion from day one and we've asked every question known to mankind and we do think that we have looked at more\nOr as investigators and partisan\nAnd we believe that hey that with everything going on and with the Pfizer warranted and and everything there that we are going to find out\nThat probably the Democrats were up to a lot more hijackings than the Republicans ever dreamed and of actually doing it as we know already the only evidence of colluding with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly would be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to\nGiving the money to uh Perkins gave it to a fusion GPS gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who said he got his information his salacious on verified information\nOr against Donald Trump from people close to the Kremlin right so the only people that colluded in any way with the Russians were the Democrats from the information that we have\nAt this particular point but I don't think right now that's driving anybody to go to the polls\nNo it really isn't um it it could it is it an\nUnderlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives are based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who\nReally brought to light so many things in this thing if you really followed it but could it be there again is that underlying motivator that's I don't think that's the big push right now I don't think that's the big emotion nothing right now um I Do think there's something to the the the fact that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Charleston", "day": "22"}
