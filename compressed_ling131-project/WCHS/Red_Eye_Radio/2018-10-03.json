her today was the right to the Senate\nIf there were any thing or that she anything else she wanted to introduce introduced\nTo this scenario to this a process she ... she can do right now she could what she could still do it right and uh she and she had the opportunity to do it last Thursday but the great point you just made she still has the opportunity it's still open right\nAnd so what they don't have is they didn't have\nWe didn't have witnesses making statements so she's the one making the allegations so they're checking out her story mhm and if she doesn't update it with the Judiciary Committee\nThe FBI maybe looking at this and saying well there's ... look to see the allegations she made here some people she mentioned we talked to those people we give you a report\nWell because here's what the people said we don't need to interview her her statement is on record we need to interview all the other people that she made the allegations against or claimed that they were witnesses she has made her statement right we have that and then she wishes to change and she can go back to that she can write a letter to to the judiciary\nCommittee stating a here's more information and then the FBI can go check that but they're not doing a here's the point they're not doing a background check on Dr for no they're not they're doing the background check a on the allegations that she made against Kavanaugh that we've\nTalked in recent days about the the possibility of her perjuring herself\nBy telling a different story to the FBI but really when you think about it and you're back away from the whole thing and you look at the\nThe entire forest and not just the the you know the trees here\nThan you or ... you very quickly come to the conclusion that there's likely zero political will to go after her for perjury unless she came out and said everything I said was false\nAnd my testimony right and I I admit that I was lying about that they they would then but but any kind of you know variants in a story to the FBI likely is not going to be pursued a by the chairman a Grassley or by anyone in\nThe house I Know and I you you see Grassley saying they want to investigate the fact that her boyfriend says something is something else because she was asked the specific question have you ever helped anybody a you know two calls from them about you know how to take a polygraph test and she said no and her boyfriend is said yes but I view that\nAs putting pressure on her credibility politically in order to get the votes look once the votes on ... vote has made if he is if he is confirmed it's done it's over ... writes I'm ... this is this won't even be a topic next week we'll be back on we'll be back on the Russian collusion\nYeah yeah yeah it is not a ... and and I guess this is it is it\nThe whole I on the ball thing this has to be the process\nIs is really to determine you know uh whether the those handful of senators actually um believe he should be seated or not and that that's it that's actually the only question here the media and the and the left in the media and social media want you to believe\nIt's about Kavanaugh and you know and and you must think\nThat he is you know a rapist or whatever they want to label him as now that's how you build political pressure but actually just what a five weeks out from the mid term election\nIt's it is it's different\nBecause they're going to look at the polls if the polls that build that pressure and I mean the polls on the candidates themselves\nNot whether they believe you brought us the poll the other night of while at when you introduced the facts to the case more people believe in fact it was a majority yeah fifth or if he's you know you see that\nYeah fifty fifty seven percent than a change what they think and then when asked well if the FBI comes back with a report this once ... once they were told that the three witnesses to cooperating witnesses that she named\nDidn't cooperated they said oh OK than than he should be confirmed and then right there was fifty seven percent than they said well if the FBI does the background check and finds out no new information was sixty percent of Americans believe that he should be confirmed\nA at a you know at that point of course you're going to forty percent of America as we said you know roughly it's forty percent Republican forty percent Democrats and the rest of her into the other twenty percent is roughly independence and that's who you're trying to\nUh you know that that's who you're trying to convince those in the middle what'd you go right those are the senators were looking at it as well right and so uh that will that that you know who knows that that poll probably was looked at by a lot of those\nAre a lot of those or a senator so I'm a you know I I think the whole thing of the doctor for commit\nPerjury ... on that will remain a you know will remain an issue I don't know whether they would I doubt I'd be surprised if they if they confirmed him this weekend ... I think it's all done yet either go to another and then they and they will do anything they they move on they move on\nTo the uh the the next thing they move on to promoting the fact or if I was the Republicans I Would promote the fact that\nYou know we you know the ... the we you know the Supreme Court you know we've got we've got the Supreme Court going up to the ... election\nAnd it'd be promoting math to irks me NAFTA or whatever it is now us MCA [laughter] yeah I'd I'd be promoting the the the the trade deal and Republicans you know do you know uh you know we're going to be voting on a that before the term\nI'd be talking about all the positives and that I'd be talking about also what your political enemy spouses and you would reflect on what has happened you know in the campaign\nAnd I think that's what they would focus on at that point uh I just don't think that they would look backwards who knows I mean whether they could have a a a separate committee of you know continuing investigation as to whether she did commit perjury and and and not make it high profile because there would be no hearings it would just be an investigation and down the road\nA as a warning shot to anybody who might do it to a a you know a future nominee with you know ... come in and and commit perjury if they could prove it was perjury right you know they might they might do that as long as it was low key yet I don't you're not going to hearings on that or\nA big to do on that because once they confirmed him\nThe battle is over we must callers could well they shouldn't go after every Democrat no ... is you can you get him\nA on the Supreme Court yep after that that's the victory that's the super bowl\nYeah that's it uh and and I think Republicans too\nUh you you also campaign on look uh this this this kind of battle may not be\nBehind us necessarily while it is specifically with cabinet or there's a real possibility that this president whether in this term or maybe in his second term would not would have the opportunity to see another\nJustice and\nThat's a big deal we know how now we know what level the ... to which the left is willing to go and we need people to vote\nEight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nBucks on board with are ready to do with a record ...

being here this morning so much\nTo talk about ah I\nI got a ... is is just so many things and and I got a huge pilot [laughter] I'm I'm a huge pile here each pilots stuff there and of course it's going to be I I can guarantee this will be the last piece of paper and there it is it's the last piece of paper that\nThe bottom of the pipe yeah ah got this from Stanley\nUh yesterday you send us an email saying the president declassified certain Pfizer documents and emails it's been over two weeks a will that info be made public what do you think is going on ... Danley thanks so much we appreciate it\nUh and he sent that to us the yesterday and ah we had talked about briefly last week I mean the capital thing has just dominated the news but\nIt's when you and I actually on the air because there were so many of the things going on and we're just having the conversation on it\nWhen we went oh yeah and uh the the the president a ...\nOn Twitter and this goes back to what is the twenty first ...\nI met with the department of justice concerning the classification of various on redacted documents they agreed to release them but state of the doing so may have they perceived negative impact on the Russia\nProbe Trump wrote on Twitter also\nA key allies asked us not to release or for the inspector general\nHas been asked to review these documents on an expedited basis I Believe he will move quickly on this and hopefully other things which she is looking at in the end I can always declassified that proves necessary speed is very important to me and every one\nSo the story came out and it just sort of died and ... you and I and this has to maybe it was probably the very beginning of of of last week\n\nAnd we said a few days have gone by and the Kavanaugh thing was just huge and we just went\nWait a minute inspector general\nIf the if he allies are saying you know that you know we believe that some of the information is too sensitive well then you go back to your director of national intelligence mhm and you may go back to the department of justice and you say okay what do you think should were released is or you talk\nYou talk to a palm pale\nRight\nFormer CIA director who's now secretary of state and you and you say okay the you know should we release just how would this affect what we're doing you know because what they came out was it was Great Britain that said they didn't want information coming out and Christopher\nSteele apparently where it was one report and Christopher Steele is is the former British I'm a spy who was part of the Democrats colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election to Christopher Steele ah ah well just\nTo lay it out again the DNC and Hillary Clinton camp a campaign gave money to the law firm ... who gave it\nTo the opposition research firm I'm fusion GPS who then gave the money to Christopher Steele who got the information uh from people he claims inside the Kremlin the unverified dirt on Donald Trump and we know it was done with that on verified dirt\nSo that's where the Christopher Steele you know the whole thing comes comes in a to this uh\nAnd so and one of the key players they're fusion GPS or was married to still is married but at the time her husband was a high ranking a department of Justice Marshall Bruce Bruce or and\nAnd we know what they used you know the the ... and ... and all that ... well so we wanted well wait a minute just doesn't make sense you you don't give it to the inspector general the inspector general only looks at corruption and\nOh a\nAnd by the way that's almost a replay of what happened\nAnd I think maybe it was a ... a week ago Monday arrives down and we brought it up yeah because there were just other things and we just started going over it and we went we don't understand why would you give it to the inspector general of the inspector general ... you know you get this information at some redacted you're looking at it and and and\nAh all of a sudden oh the light bulb goes off it would be an internal matter which would be in a scenario like this if it is a fact that people at the Justice Department are under in the Obama administration\nWere more working\nTo get information and use that false information that ...\nAh to get a warrant knowingly using it to get a ... a warrant then that would be corruption that would be abuse of power that would be a massive\nWell it it leads to the the the claim a from Rudy Giuliani mhm\nThat ah the he believes they committed perjury right yes that they that they they ... they sign documents stating that this information is intelligence mhm when in reality it was simply you know a opposition research and I was and they knew that it was an intelligence and they\nVowed for it's often too often to study our credibility ... and and you know again that's what Giuliani upset we don't know but\nIt only goes to the inspector general\nIf they believe people there because I where would you get that ... that was what happened right there than it would start inside the Justice Department with American people reaching out to in this case you know Christopher Steele a an impossible you know we don't know if there was anybody else involved we do know he was involved but\nBut if if you if you do the unwritten action and and they're saying well it's too sensitive well that would be again\nThe director of national intelligence your ah your attorney general in the head of the FBI a foreign powers and so you would be going in that particular direction and probably\nYou will be discussing it especially with my palm pale secretary of state former CIA director and say okay you need to talk to the British are because we need to get this a release\nYou know what do they want to keep quiet and not that that may not be that that could be being done right now we don't know or could have been done already\nBut to say I'm giving it to the inspector general to look at it look at why\nInspector general only looks at corruption right they look at corruption in the department he's looking for corruption in the department of justice that's what his job is his job is not to declassify it's not just job is not to look at\nA a document say wow I don't think you should declassify and and that was the impression that you got when the story first came out\nIt's like well wait a minute he's inspector general under that right\nOh mhm\nSo after they on redacted it apparently\nSomeone in the administration looked at it and said this is corruption\nDoesn't it seem that everybody either owns a car has a car story of course and that's why we're here I'm damn boots\nAnd I'm Randy and we invite you to join us every weekend here on the

you bring it up again yup you re nominate Brett Kavanaugh you re nominate Brett Kavanaugh again and you go through the whole process you go through the cycle again\nAnd you use it as and we've talked about the the races out there right now\nThat it's still possible that there won't be a blue wave and you can actually have we talked about how you and I'm doing this to get an appreciable meeting ... we're still waiting for the polls to come out here right uh probably next week from from this week post hearing and everything that's been going on right now\nA but in some of these states are right now I mean you really look at New Jersey New Jersey the Senate race is still close between Menendez and the Republican challenger so I mean you look at you know you look at everything that's going on right now you make it an election issue for Republicans yeah\nIf you have a few stragglers and you can't get the votes you do the vote any way right and you use that and by the way that everybody goes home [laughter] well that's what it will be don't don't use any other issue that right you should that you use right\nAnd and you know we we have to keep in mind that Republicans but I think you could include Senator Lindsey Graham as a part of the mentality in the past that Republicans would eat their own if they saw something that was insurmountable that there was an issue of scandals surrounding

I think ... I think you can retire or harm backing off ... ... people that come out ... ... ... ... ... not ... to ... not\n... well no no no no I don't I don't care whether it's Trump is Trump doesn't it doesn't even come into the discussion here uh this is about his performance in his performance\nWhen you have the the mainstream Democrats in the Senate on the United states\nCome out and make the claim the due process doesn't matter than an allegation enough\nIs enough for them to charge you and believed that you committed a sexual assault upon someone without any evidence I Believe it is totally justified in that manner to get angry\nHis crying started not because of him\nHis crime started because of his compassion for his wife his daughters\nAnd when he really got emotional it was of the women that has stood by him knowing that in the atmosphere the highly charged atmosphere that we live in today\nWere Democrats and liberals will do anything to destroy your life that these women stood behind him for him to get emotional\nI thought was extremely appropriate based on the unfounded accusations against him\nAnd the certainty of one side of the Senate that he committed this crime these crimes with all the evidence there is no\n\nI I Love it it's ... ... as a judge you should you should never ... never show emotion you should never be human I disagree I think judges should understand compassion well if if if\nHe had been very clear calm and directing the response he would've been cold they would have been said that they would have been said by the left this guy doesn't have feelings right\nI I disagree professional has nothing to do you can be emotional if you believe that you are being unfairly charged I on the rare cases\n[laughter] and I believe you probably have to in our professional lives have shown the anger\nOr [laughter]\nAt a I Will say is I have shown [noise] anger at management and I believe when I've shown anger\nAnd sometimes you're not at this management by the way I Want to make this clear current management her mattress growing up to now there are no or will know severed do when they ... was no seriously I mean that there's never been with the people that we that we ... it is not with it's never been but but in my career there have been people that it you know it has gotten\nYou know in your face I Believe it was completely inappropriate\nFor the situation at that time ... anger or compassion for people is something that is considered unprofessional I Would disagree with everything depends on the scenario at that time what are the allegations against you\nWell how deeply personal it has become the jak has become person not not just in that room on that day last Thursday\nBut in his home\nAnd and and dealing with his children and the people suggesting that he has no place in working with children as a volunteer right that's deeply personal and frankly I'd be concerned if he didn't get upset about it but\nThe the things that I Know I got angry about were strictly professional ... they weren't personal attacks on me and still professionally\nI I I Believe right if you look at him professionally professionally when it came to asking him questions about anything he was ... about his job ... and his decision he was calm and he was a cool and he answered all of those\nAre questions with a with a great sense of of humor we're talking about the first hearing mhm and he answered all the questions there was no anger it was the personal attacks\nCame his way the unfounded in his mind personal attacks came his way that he again by the time we got to that particular point of the the uh the the the hearings a you know it was certainty that you would committed sexual assault ...\nYes\nAnd it was labeled with others especially by Democrats as a gang rape but\n\nThis is that's how far they were willing to go right\nSo\nIt was personal and it was personal from and and people take that personal and and I believe that is how I Would expect someone who believes that they are innocent how they would respond I Know it's how I Would respond yes and if you think the judges are a few\nAnd and they don't get angry even when they're on the bench presiding over a case then you know ... you ... you know very little about courtrooms\nIt's just and we understand that the last caller Shannon we understand your your allegations are falling apart around you and so you're reaching for something we understand that yeah you don't want capital but it likely has nothing to do with his demeanor

a letter to Dr ... were requesting more information specifically Grassley wants the therapists notes all audio or video recordings produce during the course of the polygraph examination of Dr Ford all written audio visual\nOr um\nAny information given to a reporter or anybody else at a media organization\nA\nAnd has said that some of the material has been passed on to a national circulated newspaper or not provided to the Senate and he proposes a proposes to suggest to let a lack of candor\nAdjacent to those request as a curious paragraph this National Review the full details of Dr force polygraph or ... ... important because the Senate Judiciary committee has received a sworn statement from a long time boyfriend of Dr forge a sworn statement he's been under oath now\n... stadium that he personally witness Dr Ford coaching a friend on polygraph examinations when asked under oath in the hearing whether she'd ever given any tips for advice to someone who was planning on taking a polygraph\nDr Ford replied never the statement racist specific concerns about the reliability of her polygraph examination results he continued the Senate therefore needs this information it'll be interesting well they give it to or a is\nGrassley using this as the defense that when they don't\n\nThen they can expect to send it to delay it any further right right and or make any other choice in terms of the vote because I think this is clearly by the chairman yeah I think this is well it works in in on both levels they handed over a new review it or they don't hand it over and\nYou essentially look at the you you send it on to the Senate majority leader and say well we've done our due diligence\nBecause if you're looking for and looking at evidence and and you can't get any other witnesses to back up what she's saying then what you want to see is All right what was the process especially with the uh any video or audio that was recorded during the polygraph\nThe you know they they asked for that before the hearing they asked for that ah\nThe weekend before the ... the hearing a couple of weekends ago and her attorney basically said no it's not relevant of course that's relevant because you say that she took and passed a polygraph test\nWell we need to see the methodology and the polygraph test\nTo see that you know what questions were asked\nUm and and again how the how the process on that level of work I think that's fair\nYou know the thing is when you make an allegation you have to be willing to provide all the evidence that you have used to cooperate if you're allegation to begin which which is a lie detector test right if you don't and and nobody above it I'm sure somebody's brought that up but\nThat has to be brought up because just like the fact that when you use and said these are the witnesses these people witness it and they say no and then you say I took a polygraph a test will have you ever helped anybody else take a polygraph test you know and\nYou know trying to beat is what they're trying to say no I never did well when you get a sworn witness dating\nNope I Know she I I you know I Know she did well then you want all relevant notes because she is using the she is using the polygraph\nAs cooperation that there is credibility to our accusation therefore she should be willing to give everything over to the Senate Judiciary committee so they can verify\n\nThat the lie detector test was done in a legit way\nRight and and and that's again part of the process because if you believe it was legit you're promoting it as a legitimate\nThen you have no problem you're telling the truth right and the process that part of the process was done thoroughly thoughtfully\nAnd in order to get the results that it was always going to get because she was always telling the truth right\nHer attorneys on Tuesday implored the FBI to interview her and act on investigative leaves leads they have provided for its inquiry into sexual misconduct\nAllegations against Brett Kavanaugh quoted is inconceivable that the FBI would conduct a thorough investigation of Dr Ford's allegations without interviewing her\nJudge Kavanaugh or the witnesses we have identified in the letters to you attorneys are Deborah cats and Michael Brown which wrote to top FBI officials in her letter obtained by political\nUh again it's not an investigation no this is the whole point in and look I even said that the other day I said well now that they're doing this you know they'll probably talked with the end\nAnd also ... wait a minute when I saw the story yesterday said wait a minute no they won't they well they if they don't understand why they would not because it's not they're not investigating the crime they're doing a background check on Kavanaugh\nAnd so what they're doing is they're not going after they're not from they may not be going to her or tapping ought to get their statements because they have their statements\nBy the way there is they don't get to know the the the attorneys for attorneys don't get to know who the who the FBI interviews or who they don't including people that they say they told\nThe FBI they directed they say they directed the FBI to interview other people associated with is the FBI may be doing that\nBut the FBI doesn't have to contact her lawyers and confirmed that they're doing that right that this is not about her this is a background check on Capitol it's about her claim\nBut she is not this is not about getting her any kind of justice she does there there is a no there is no way for them to be a part of the process\n\nFor them to be included or directing the process I Know they\nThink that because they were able to manipulate Capitol Hill into giving them their day in front of the camera but that's not how it works with the background check process you may we may not ever know\nOr or read I let us go to Dan in San Diego Dan welcome you're on TALK radio walk into the show\nThe good yeah\nYeah I just wanted to make a point with the with this was before lady\nYou know I think maybe the FBI doesn't really want to talk to her because if she says anything more I mean everything she said right now it's been a big\nIf she says anymore and exposing yourself to perjury or perjury and herself I mean one that's not going to be a good look for the FBI I mean they don't want to be\nPicking on someone that obviously has mental problems but I think there are attorneys trying to push her to actually try and talk more isn't in her best interest I'd say a kind of obviously shows where their agenda is not in her ... her interest on\nWell I I I actually there and and I'll add to that I'm questioning whether or not they're being genuine in that in that situation oh yeah whether they already knew that the FBI would not be talking to her and it and now they're going to be able to label this as an unfair\nUh interview process because the person may not even the person making the claim was interviewed and that's how the ...\nAnd when the FBI or you know again when you call it an investigation you would have ... they need to interview they need to investigate you know everything that's going on here well it's not an investigation into background jak they have her statement they have his statement all under oath\nAnd so what do they do they go and talk to all the witnesses or that they that they have or that they had mentioned while being under oath mhm that's what you would do with a background check up and I you know and and I don't know and\nNow there's no investigation yeah right the minute it becomes an investigation is she opens yourself up to having committed a crime along with a few other people but I think she's lucky this just this is just an inquiry into his background\nA well look I you know it's they don't want to give you know the ... the boat one piece of cooperating evidence that we happen to examine is the polygraph test\nAnd they're not at all and and and the therapist note and they're not willing to give any of that to the Judiciary Committee right why not why not\nBecause they they are going to tell a completely different story than what she said\nAnd there ended that have well I I think that's they they know that it's going to likely destroy a further destroy the roadway that her credibility\nAnd by the way it is as I said earlier if she has if she has something else to say to the Judiciary Committee under road ... can put it in a letter and and state any corrections look I Want to ... I mean I Want to correct this I was thinking this but I I met you know any of the possible perjury trap she could have her lawyer write a letter back to the underworld St look\nHere's what I meant but this is an orange statement ... another sworn statement or she could add anything to the Senate Judiciary committee under oath any a witness just what whatever else you wanted to do she could do wonder real to them yes [noise]\nAnd she can ... and the FBI they've given information about witnesses or whatever for the FBI than they've done their due diligence\nWhere I'm Talking about for journeys and the FBI we'll check and from there and they have are complete statement right they do you have any ...

Vegas shooting\nYou know you ... it was it took place at a country music festival mhm but my my neighbor Aaron and told me about the ... I mean we talked about this years ago that Vegas was kind of building out these venues you know all over town to have\nThe the music festivals because those music festivals of all different genres we're drawing huge crowds\nThe eighties festivals do do really well\nAh when I was on vacation recently I saw um a an ad at one of the local venues for a like an oldies festival it was a the the Motown stuff and and older use and they were all going to be on stage and one night and so those things do really really well\nAh some of the artists don't like it because according to my friend then they feel like they don't get enough states time you'll you may only get a thirty or forty minutes that yeah you know and the ideas come out and play your hits right and which is exactly why the people there they don't really want to hear your new album\n[laughter] I really don't\nHere's my new stuff now and they go you go to sleep and and I had it because they the the eighties towards doing it they had like\nSix or seven Vance right like well how can they are six or seven in bed 'cause they all get out and play thirty forty five minutes one after another yes every once I hit and you're sitting there and you you walk you walk in and every moment of it is enjoyable which brings you back the next year to ... to see it again and unless you have a catalog\nLike an iron maiden or a metallic or or this summer a journey and death leopard oh yea for I mean they had about ... string of hits like they have an entire catalogue of music ... where each\nBan can go out and do a full set but it's it's sort of going back to like in the fifties early sixties when they used to do that they used to take the artist out they only play their heads no that's exactly where ... sometimes you know if you've ever what that thing you do if you ever saw that movie and it used to be that way you do a lot they would highly yeah when\nWhen he was first doing shows the people first of all were surprised that he was white when he showed up on 'em and you had a very diverse crowd that would show up for his music but\nA lot of those places that he played it was almost like a festival kind of scenario because you had so many artist that was his early days played on on on a tour with um\nA Hank Snow a Johnny Horton yep and Elvis was the opener yeah\nAnd you know your your worst you'd probably two or three songs and air force songs and you're done\nYeah I mean next one comes up then and now it's yeah that that's kind of the way it was it was almost like an American bandstand kind of approach of multiple artists you know like the festival sub up today\nAnd this whole conversation started because of the whole Brett Kavanaugh story being in the bar and the ice and they'd come

goal of removing the book\nAnd Eric early review and he's now Gary eight six six Ninety\nOr read I was buying we were just talking to yeah by the way he's Eric I'm Gary ... a just a a couple of things quickly here that that I respectfully disagree with him a on when he the one of the first things you said was that the\nThe these these Democrats are saying all this that you know they're not a Democrat or does it they're not on the credit wiping rhinos or Ronald ... while he's harbors probably can he said conservatives or they should get he said conservative okay well then you're talking about something different button but these are mainstream Democrats\nOr that they these are the Democrats up today and they may not be a my grandfather who was who was a ... by my grandfather and my dad's side today who was a the Democrat he helped form\nThe Democrat Party in the town that I grew up in in New York because it was a Republican town or early early part of the twentieth century\nAnd when he came there he he immigrated from Canada and the ... because of the but the prejudice against a Irish Catholics in Ontario mhm is family came in ... and so when he came\nSalt was one party Tony sort of I Want to ... among another party my grandfather today would be considered an absolute right wing conservative ... of\nUh so uh you know to just sit there and but but when you look at the Democratic party today\nWhich are seen as the mainstream means I find signs of mainstream of the Democrats ... ... this is the Senate Judiciary committee that you're talking about right this is a mainstream Democrat as you can get\nAnd so I Would disagree with you when you say the the the ... what's going on to that today's Democrats today's Democrat right uh uh rhinos aren't conservative but rhinos or our Republican\nThey're the they're they're brought out if you look at at at how many are right now on Capitol Hill the Republicans have you do the headcount and and and do the put the real test in terms of being a real conservative well that many of them are in fact most of them failed that test\nWhat we forget were rhinos came from because everything by the way the swamp as involved as about everything of all from what the original meaning watch and rhinos used to be those Republicans who would spend like Democrats ... well that's all almost all the Republicans today including the president ...\n... they're not talking about the debts right nobody's talking about the debt anymore one of the reasons Trump got elected\nBecause when Paul Ryan was what are you know after John Bain or exit stage left and Paul Ryan came aboard\nAnd Republicans were furious that were screaming good truck truck was talking about it about how you know if they could they came in and he said nope the budget the rubber rank him in the budget it's been done has done or we're going to move on and people were furious and Paul Ryan became the rhino\nThey they they've got to care about spending that help motivate\nMhm\nYou know to where he became you know a Trump than we need to get this budget down we need to you know do these things now the Republican Party they don't care about spending\nNo so yeah rhino rhinos may not be conservative but rhinos are the mainstream of the Republican Party right today they are and even the administration\nMhm it would not have been acceptable it would not have been acceptable\nFrom any previous Republican administration before this one\nAs we talked about yesterday we talked about the trade deal to do the trade deal with Canada and Mexico and had the stipulation not an automobile companies like we had that would've been absolutely unacceptable and ... and and the debt and then what the project to the deficit yes a is somewhere around\nA trillion or ... or more you know when you look at that are over the is it over the next year I think in the next fiscal year um that wouldn't have been acceptable in fact I remember\nWhen Obama came in to to power came into the presidency he was talking about well I inherited that huge deficit remember that mhm which by the way we had to point out well you were actually a part of it 'cause you voted for that\nSeven hundred billion dollar package so you were part of that you didn't inherited you helped to make it happen it wouldn't have happened\nOr without the Democrats voting for it as well including him but the point being is that\nBack in two thousand this would have been you know early two thousand nine but two thousand nine they were talking about it even the Democrats were talking about it or the you know the now they were talking about it because they wanted to put that on\nOn George W. Bush and they wanted to you know they wanted him to own it completely because everything was Bush's fault remember\nBut Robert Reich rhinos rentals started before that but then ... rhinos became the swamp yes but rhinos in the swamp was\nWhen all we're really came to the fruition especially when McConnell invading her they were saying we're tough enough and the budgets when you look at you know twenty ... twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen the Republicans were furious and conservatives still had a solid hold of the Republican Party that's gone when I was at that ah that\nThat that uh Paul Ryan proposed the balancing the budget and it would have taken until twenty thirty\nOh that that was a that would have been a ... that all that well that right now it would have been the it was the the summer of the the whole camp it was the summer when\nYou know a of of ah twenty twelve okay it was the summer spring southern only get so it was before this one and two of election right yeah All right so you have that scenario and he was called a radical\n\nYou know for wanting to balance the budget by twenty thirty right I mean that was oh no no no that's that's unacceptable now we give the the president credit or in fact I I think that falls on his shoulders the credit for getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one because\nYou and I thought that was never going to have right based on the rhinos on Capitol Hill and the fact that they couldn't get it\nDone right but but that tax cuts have never been the it's always been the spending ... rhino when the swamp had was always directed at the out of control spending and Washington\nNot necessarily the belief in tax cuts and that was really I'm In my opinion drove the anger and created the rhino when the swamps the spending spending ... from the the campaigning on twenty sixteen\n... no ... even earlier than that remember you know you and I sitting here late at night when painter came out and they were trying to shut down the government uh uh again in the shutdown shutdowns have never been about tax cuts the shutdowns within about\nSpending and and when the Republicans wouldn't stand up to the Democrats you're right they were called ... recalled the swamp Trump was coming in to get rid of the swamp just stopped spending to stop this yeah and even going out to the\nThe uh the school lunch program you know in the rhinos back then going oh no we can't cut anything\n... and so when you're that goes back he's so much for when he got twenty Fifteen\nAnd you know and and a banner was leaving an and Ryan was coming in debate or didn't like messy so he went to work for a tobacco company right and so Ryan came in and and ... remember that but the thing was that everybody expected Ryan Republicans\n\nA threat I radio he user friendly and I'm Mary McNamara eight six six Ninety a red eye the presidential alert system\nAh we'll talk about that coming up on the top of the hour because uh you and I were just getting into some of the discussion on there's a lot lawsuit been filed on that and uh they're supposed to test it I think this afternoon\nTwo hundred and twenty five million smartphones will get the uh we'll we'll get the text or an ... and the funny thing is\nPeople have been thinking because the way it's been promoted we're getting to touch from the president will look terrible he can control our phones no no all part of the emergency alert system that's all it would it right but I've noticed that the way they've been covering it is you know because it's called the presidential alert system\nUm you know that it's going to be Trump mhm\nThat's going to be texting you know no he's not going to be nothing you know not going to be from the president so we'll get to that story coming up here in a just a little bit eight six six Ninety or red eyes were talking about Kavanaugh the FBI investigation and a whole bunch of other stuff we go to Dustin in Decatur, Alabama Dustin Hi you're on a Radio Welcome I dusted\nMorning Joe how are you very good\nI that's what I Want to put a thought are you guys let's just talk about alleged I'll I'll hang up after that and you got to go and talk about it but I've heard him say that America is a nation of all and not of men and what I've seen what this whole process is that\nRepublicans are living out that statement making America a nation of laws not men and delivers during the exact opposite\nUh by baking is a personal thing you're a thought\nWell you know we let you go okay thank you so much just said well look we started talking about this as soon as Trump was elected in the people started calling him a fascist\nAnd then ... see we were calling them we we'd recognize antifa before most people ... and nobody had pronounce the name so we were calling them ... wonder why\nWe say that so before the correct pronunciation if that's even the correct pronunciation came out I don't I don't I just read called the ... and they came out and said that they were anti fascist we said builder actually fashion so if you look at what they they uh uh you know what they believe if you look at a lot of what\nA you know Trump was criticized for the travel ban uh no we need to stop him from his dictatorial wasn't dictatorial it was the exact opposite the judges actually getting involved in that was\nA dictatorial yeah well you know we agree that we're a nation of laws we believe that there are things\nThat we should cherish we believe that a presumption of innocence whether in a political trial a civil trial or a criminal trial now in a criminal trial it is an apt to loot requirement\nAnd same with the civil trial but it's still should apply to anything that we do in our lives there should be a presumption of innocence until the evidence exist and an allegation itself should not destroy somebody's life most Americans\nBelieve that the only Americans don't believe that the Americans to believe what they

then we'll get back to your calls and comments or it's we we've been nominated for the last couple of weeks on the cabin on the thing and and we continue to talk about it we'll have more to say and more of your calls and comments are coming up the story\nOr Amazon now to pay Fifteen dollars an hour minimum wage and now after they announced that there are now going to promote\nThat the government raised the minimum wage for seven fifty an hour yeah it's like oh you're doing it now that you've raised it yeah right\nOr not unexpected tight labor market that we have today mhm well and there was a lot of flak\nOn a as the especially early on as they were setting up the distribution centers for Amazon or receiving a lot of negative press on the the uh the workers being overworked underpaid and that kind of thing you set a new standard which goes above I think even the Cosco\nA starting or or maybe it's the same as Costco I I Can't remember we're Costco went a Wal Mart what's ten dollars an hour a few years ago on starting wage\nAnd the starting wage now you will be Fifteen dollars an hour by the way private sector companies can do that if they wish but it is about and here's what happened at Walmart\nUm it you know they were clearly they were changing not just the pay that that's there's a a public relations point to be made there no no problem but it's also to attract a people who might stay with the end and retain\nPeople\nA much longer period or they did the same thing with our college which uh they're they're offering college if you work part time or fulltime at Wal Mart for roughly a dollar a day they basically take it out of your check and you go to an online courses to universities\nAnd but you have to do a business a business degree or a degree in a in a logistics uh but but either way a logistics management I think it is but what they're trying to do is get people trained people\nIn the new trade deal which means what there's less of a chance we can build automobiles here and sell them overseas which is exactly what the president wanted and now he's implemented a program that does exactly the opposite of what he claimed he wanted to begin with ... that's the frustrating pardon well keep in mind in\nTwo thousand eight when the domestic auto makers were bleeding cash their their foreign arms their foreign business was what was\nKeeping them alive you you've you've now encouraged the foreign arms to say okay we're going to make them all over here ...\nAnd that was one of the president's number one complaints and so we implement something that will have the opposite effect mhm based on economics which is how people respond when sentiment disincentive ... not my opinion how people respond yeah right eight six six Ninety red eye\nIn

Harris Poll on\nKavanaugh nomination and the other things ... and this post testimony yep a after the testimony and ... majority of voters eighty nine percent has watched or heard about the Kavanaugh hearings\nWashed her her wow right up right those two groups though\nAre the\nMajority of voters agreed with the Senate decision to lay the vote by a week and involved the FBI just search for cooperating evidence at the FBI review finds do cooperate in evidence sixty percent of voters support the confirmation of Kavanaugh\n...\nUh when it came to ah you see\nThe\nAh Dianne Feinstein here was Seventy five percent of Americans ... disagreed with the fact that she kept the letter yeah right she should have given it to the so they she's not winning that one at all\nNo not at all but you know because for Democrats are liberals\nThey would see that as look you could have done something early on about this and it would have been a bigger story a potentially if you would have done something about that and then him for uh the conservatives or or Republicans\nAnd maybe even people in the middle she violated she violated essentially the process and the rules\n\nAnd and I think you you know them easily you can move on to the who leaked did about Ford because the Democrats claiming you know they wanted to help protect her but yet it's clear now that they're the ones who leaked it to the media in order to out her\n\nIn order to make the story public\nIs Seventy five percent of voters believe that Senator Dianne Feinstein should have immediately turned over the letter a from Christine forward to the Senate Judiciary committee in July ... when she received it which means Republicans have made their point they're ...\n\nOn other issues are ... a Russian investigation ...\nAmericans want transparency when it comes to how and why the investigation was launched yeah sixty five percent of Americans this polls just done by the way\nSixty five percent of Americans say it's important to turnover evidence from the FBI and the Justice Department to clear the air in how the investigation was started\n\nTwo thirds of American voters want an investigation into potential abuses at the FBI although voters\nAre split and on whether or not biased played a role in launching the investigation fifty two percent said buys played a role forty eight percent say biased didn't play a role but two thirds of Americans believe\n\nAnd I would say that if you say forty eight percent said there was no bias or in the role in fifty two percent said there was biased the fact that you have sixty six percent of American voters favor an investigation that means many that believe biased didn't play a role believe it should be investigated anyway\nYou're talking about again the independence there those are independence under saying okay I'm not sure maybe I don't think so but yeah I think an investigation should be done\nRight\nSo that sixty five percent of American voters favor or that an investigation where we are right now\n\nThe FBI report could be released only to the Senate it will not be made public unless it's leaked uh [laughter] yeah excuse me it won't be made public until it leaks\nAnd then liberals will be screaming for transparency\nThe first time they've screamed transparency ah regarding the FBI and oh I don't know roughly I'm just taking a gas the last couple of years or so\n\nOr you know it's interesting that seems like a after a two years Americans are paying attention to probably do the Russian investigation to sixty five percent of Americans mold\nOr a you know believe that the investigation or you know into the FBI and department of justice\nOr to see how the investigation started mhm uh is uh is warranted hey maybe there's a couple of Democrats and they're like we said that believe that Trump committed collusion and they want to find out and they're willing to release it to ... that he committed maybe there's a\nCouple of people in there that actually believe that well I mean if you look at the number I mean that would go or you know beyond that to that typical party line number of just ... you know of the people in the center being roughly wanting a the independence and then Republicans being the other forty so\nThat goes to sixty five which means there's likely a cup a few Democrats are liberals mixed in that and who knows why they want it but yeah maybe they think\nThat it's going to show that he's guilty but we but we've been saying this it doesn't matter who's guilty of what what was done was done so somebody needs to be brought to justice there needs to be justice in this case but there can't be without transparent\nAnd by the way we pointed out again today because we haven't been able to uh we talked about it earlier because we received an email we talked about it we believe it was early last week\nAnd and this is the because we've been getting some questions say what happened to the whole
