{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "The metro news point after rolls on now back to a friend of the crew\nVital few minutes of the program this morning and of course a mountain ears will play again a week from Saturday\nOn the road at Texas and uh again don't know the time for sure but as soon as we do a that was certainly let you know by various means and a\nJeff when we look at this we're looking at the scheduled during the spinal break this weekend and the big twelve and of course the big game as eight o'clock on Saturday Night with Texas at Oklahoma State for various reasons and Texas is\nThe next opponents some other interesting games though this weekend in the big twelve I mean when you look at Kansas State at Oklahoma or to see you at Kansas I think that's the one that\nLooks at me because TCU three and four over all one in three big twelve conference play you think you can just get who knows I mean at home\nMom now I remember you got a backup quarterback for ... Turpin their big play maker off the team now\nMhm come All right so there's not buying it he's not drinking or the ... Kansas has played TCU tough most years since they've been in the big twelve mhm that again go\nCome on come on let's off might\nNot take them and they'll know you crazy they're going to bet on what what what what what what\nLine I haven't heard a I can tell your yet is it's a Thirteen and a half DC you which that tells you something 'cause yeah they're not you did that to be no but for kids\nThe only be Thirteen point under dog I mean that's ... lately that\nNot happen you know something that is a little surprising to me is the Texas Oklahoma State in Texas only a modest three I agree with you I think that's another one\nLike I kept saying all week about this Baylor line that it felt like just based on the numbers that should be closer and it wasn't so you ride with West Virginia\nThere was a good chance they roll they end up rolling that's when I look at the other way why is that thing only three and a half now again the quarterback on certainty for Texas as part of that and that's a totally different longhorn team when Sam Ellen gr doesn't play so that could be part of it as well the boy Oklahoma states had some struggles this year\nAnd a and it and we talked about this during the the show that tonight as well ... he may be one good hit away if he does play for missing the west Virginia get yeah absolutely with the soldiers Israelis shoulder do you do you believe it is okay so that's even more because I couldn't remember for the throwing children ...\nSo you know again but their situation they need they they can't overlook anybody either you certainly can't overlook Oklahoma State with even with West Virginia coming down so it's not like they're Kansas or something\n[laughter] come on [laughter] if you want me to leave you with a number of a number I Love you know I Wanna loves others\nSo that Tom Herman thing is fascinating twenty three in one against the spread as a head coach or offensive\nCoordinator going back to his days even that I always stays dolphins recorded but as the favorite he's just born fourteen against the spread so you look at that close number there I mean that was almost a pick 'em game at three I operate so foreign fourteen as the favorite going in so he's\nGreat underdog but ... yeah yeah that's a given the number and that's not necessarily straight up both are against the number but it's still something even though there are at one point favorite you know that's what you want to see so you want them to win against Oklahoma State then come in is the favorite against West Virginia and the trend is in your favor so what do you take away from the Knight Jeff\nI you know what I ... I'm pleasantly surprised away which didn't play I didn't I didn't know if they would play this will uh and I came out with a lot of energy and ah and I think you know just from hearing from\nDavid fills this was a lot in coaches obviously did a good job in in preparing a game plan but I think there's a lot of player generated here tonight in it sounded like it to me a good point you know in player generating they come out and they and they executed and uh they they they didn't want it they wanted to get that I Wish they taste out\nAs quickly as possible and have a race do that and now they've landed back up so credit to them\nAlmost like they had a players only meeting yeah which they did there you go [laughter]\nBut you know we talk about so often that that you know you never know about a team's chemistry until you've you face some adverse Detroit well obviously West Virginia fit a lot of diversity in Ames you know twelve days ago I I think we see a lot about their team chemistry and their leadership on how they bounce back\nTake some credit the gear gives some credit to the coaching staff you David still mentioned the aggressive play calling that was one of the complaints coming out of the state game is there weren't any adjustments made they didn't try anything different they did to nights and different set different motion different ... different areas of the field that we're being attacked so\nThe coaching staff did a great job to gain planning and getting these guys ready to go\nNumber of catches but tight in six six huh\nI'm On a whole number of you looked at I got to look at that we're going to get into thirty ma ways to go but six was a monster effort out of the ...\nThat was like four seasons hotel now and it wasn't just one guy no that was the great thing about it it was it was some good and and but again when you have a quarterback like a will Greer he can put it on the money a lot of times he did and\nAnd that was good to see them attacked the middle of the field I mean that's that was one of the question marks coming out of Iowa State is why didn't that happen more you saw the field available you saw big place it was back looking like the west Virginia ... we saw early in the year\nI think a lot more confidence from the players to after a game like tonight should have right\nYeah it really work you put a fifty some you're always going to feel pretty good about yourself\nYeah when when my Seventy one that will take it that you know what I thought it was just the way it goes well one thing for a certain amount nears now six in one on the season\nSecond place in the big twelve conference their next gain a week from Saturday we don't know the time just yet we do know it will be in Austin against the longhorns of Texas and we'll let you know the time as soon as we know the time final score again\nMountaineers get the win fifty eight to Fort dean for Brett how Greg Hunter for Jeff Jenkins regime marshals Steve done laugh and for\nHow the church of listening\nTo the metro news void after presented by mind when\nWe're delivering better health run better West Virginia it's our job is our mission and follow the mountaineers twenty four seven on our website manual for ... and you're in the entire crew thanks for listening to the point after on metro new voice of West Virginia\nWrites W.

simply by handling the package itself it wouldn't be necessarily a dangerous in the way that a live bomb would be but but but again\nAh you know that this is something where you know not not hearing at all ah it has been\nAnd and there's nothing wrong with an over abundance of caution by anyone in you know in this scenario except for the fact that you don't have something for I guess that the public if they were armed\nOr those bombs were ready to go off in transit that's something I think that would be warnings all over from authorities saying that you wherever you might be anyone could potentially and counter one of these devices\nAnd that kind of warning I'm not I'm not hearing\nSo and I thought when you get to the press coverage them calling them bombs yeah which is it you know if the Saudis have not said that they were alive bombs why are we calling them bombs right what is the purpose of of doing that is that\nAccurate reporting if they are not bombs were telling you when the real time the frustration that we have right right and we think it's important to point out the frustration unless there's a reason for you know unless there's eight investigative reason\nFor for doing so accept the fact is the people that\nThe person or people that mailed the bomb they know whether they were alive or not and they know the authorities already know right so what what would be the investigative purpose for doing it is beyond\nIs is beyond me and so when I finally saw some frustration because it got to be a little frustrating yesterday when you're trying to figure it out or they live bombs or not and would they have gone off was it just some explosive material but they wouldn't have gone off right because that that one of the reasons that the leaks are happening and they give out information\nBecause you see it all over the place I saw the the the ... people were tweeting that if you know anything about it and now here's some of the information some of the information we believe you know it's it's the authorities now are being directed to Florida well leaks come out for a reason leaks from investigative agencies come out for a reason\nSo why are all these other things leaking and being told that the public by the media but not the one question but I think most people would want to know it was ... or they live where they live or would they not lie bomb right\nSo there's are we are so we'll get to that like a more of that coming up here I Chelsea Clinton I consider running for office\nMhm I just had to throw that in there yeah it's a friday why not anybody shocked no\nWell you know she has experience at NBC so\n[laughter] [noise] [noise] who was it who\nWasn't on NBC I Can't remember who was the I think it was Brian Williams was it Brian Williams okay she's well traveled\nThat's how he described her ... ... ... the you mean she's been on a plane I that was the first daughter of course she's well traveled you and I will never forget him that night we I Know we played it on the air yeah\nBut that was just unbelievable yeah it was like gosh in over the fact right the Chelsea Clinton was not working for NBC ... and\nThey do is that when when when George Bush's daughter went to work for NBC not so much yeah there are a couple of articles you know but yeah but but not\nNo gushing no you're not getting as what I was referring to you did you just pause the news ... no that's why I said it was like OK we'll let her in for now\n[laughter] [noise] um did a great job but it's like Megan Kelly exits stage left but once the entire contract and I looked at you and I during an appreciable meeting and said and does it seem like that NBC\nWent oh wait a minute oh\nWe can make this cause it not ... uh she's already making too much from she hasn't made that kind of money she hasn't pulled in that kind of revenue yeah or so this was an opportunity to get rid of her now right\nWell because the ratings I'm I'm guessing weren't stellar\nUm and ... and any good excuse right I yeah we're going to let you go\nSo uh Megan Kelly and who knows will she be back on friday but that looks like she's going to be off the air for at least a while and she lost so here's here's how it went down she made the blackface comment I I don't know when that was Monday or Tuesday\nAnd then by Wednesday she had lost her agent yes they parted ways\nAnd now it's basically it looks like there won't be any any you know coming back to to say goodbye or or sign off or anything else that looks like it's pretty much done and you wonder if you you just wonder okay that was the old saying that escalated quickly\nUm she came out on Wednesday and did some kind of apology and they said the audience you know that was their gave her a standing ovation I I'm not sure why an apology\nIt deserves a standing ovation [laughter] [laughter] it's not like some kind of great performance that social side of the ... well yeah\nYeah uh but they gave her a standing ovation\nUh and then later on that day it just kind of went down from there and that's when the agency that she was with atomic agency\nI decided to part ways with her there was some celebrities that we're going to appear on the show that after the comments on black face\nThey weren't going to appear and they decided you know the cancelled so ah and but the likely comes down to the fact that the ratings weren't great you know is that the worst things anybody has ever said\nAh no\nNo but ... but ask Roseanne Barr how much you have to say ... probably Roseanne Barr that situation was much more serious in terms of of how it was viewed in Hollywood than what Megan Kelly said I I don't know I might I don't know my my two my two conspiracy theories and\nThe one you know initially they weren't going to\nInitially they weren't going to fire that wasn't in their plans with initially just for that for what she said they weren't going to do it\nAs you said in our personal meaning you figure it out it's just better till after Halloween yeah come back after Halloween but but then they went on wait a minute hold it she's not producing yeah don't wait a minute rating we can get out of his contract we can we wow one of the lawyer said you know this could be caused and if we get it for cause we don't have to pay off or contract\nThat's one side of it the other side of it as\nPart of the conspiracy theories making Kelly was thinking I don't want to be doing this is just totally sucks but I don't want to be able to collect my contract let me say something that's maybe a little bit controversial but not far enough\nFor them to justify all the fire me for cause [laughter]\nWell I mean and if they try I can still collect here's the difference\nMegan Kelly's saying that on her own show on Fox News would have just been another night of Megan Kelly\nYou wouldn't have heard complaints maybe I mean on social media you would've yes but it wouldn't have been treated the same\nI mean she may have had to follow up and say you know hey that's not what I meant it's not okay or whatever but it wouldn't have been what it is that NBC for a morning show there's a big difference and and and the type of\nA audience that you have there so who knows what will happen but ah yeah maybe maybe\nIt was amicable by both parties\nAlso coming up Chuck Grassley referring Michael ... sweat next to the department of justice for possible criminal action ... for making false statements about cabinet ... that would be interesting to see where that goes yeah the ...\nThe caravan eight hundred troops or will be heading apparently to the border will get to that Chuck Todd I fear the Russians could be behind the mail bomb scare in New York Times publishing that Trump assassination fantasy heard about that yeah yeah that's a yeah that's bizarre and it's okay to publish that\nEspecially with what's going on huh yeah All right but it was a fantasy world is ... it's

[laughter] well you know my hair Eric you were talking about what's at the tweet was a Donald Trump junior the pointed out earlier yeah Donald Trump\nJunior making some a very good points on social media uh yesterday Thursday and and I think on Wednesday as well saying well where was the call for civility when someone sent fake rice in to his residence and\nAnd it was you know that got ultimately close to to his wife it was intended for him Donald Trump junior and the same thing happened to his brother he was asking uh I forget who was he was asking\nUh in in that tweet or he was responding to somebody else's tweet um but that's that's the whole thing is that there was no call for civility when that happened I mean you see a number of things that happened uh that and with any president or presidential family but especially this one\nYou've had how much you know that has happened had been said\nUm and we have to point out\nBecause Gary laid it out a and thank you my\nThe call a this was several months ago but you're talking about when you call someone Hitler\nWhat the threat is then we were talking about civility then that was the setting yes and the media was you know talking about well civility and civility we'll wait a minute when you compare to this\nAnd one to a arguably one of the worst mass murderers in history pure evil\nYou're saying the threat to someone is that guy is capable this person is just like Adolf Hitler and his capable of doing the same heinous thing\nAnd when you do that that becomes a threat that that you're saying that this person in this case the president is the same kind of threat that Hitler was\nAnd that's the ultimate\nThreats\nSo the call for civility and the media pretending like this is all on the president you got to give me a break rhetoric is one thing comparing him to a mass murderer that one of the most evil people to ever exist on earth\nThat's very different\n[noise] uh not only Hitler but when they combine Hitler with fascist and the or Terry in mindset yeah Donald Trump which has to be a dictator as we said nothing indicates set in anything that he has done in any of his executive orders anything that he has fought from the court's everything\nHas in in my opinion well let me All right let me say that Ninety nine point nine percent of what he has has of what he was promoted maybe somebody can find one percent and make an argument that that will be willing to listen to so I don't want to say one hundred percent ... so Ninety nine point nine percent of what Donald Trump is has promoted\nOr his rhetoric may offend you mhm uh his provocative nature may uh offend you but what does he actually does\nDoes she desert is it fair to relate him to one of the worst mass murderers\nGenocidal mass murderers in the history of the world right is that even close to any type of accurate portrayal\nNo it's just pure demonization and inflammatory rhetoric and what is it designed to do it is designed to create range in the people that will believe you fear and right it is not an attempt to have a discussion on the policies of the president\nRaise your space in science IQ every Sunday night with planetary radio on five eighty WC H.

I I the reality is I I voted for her [noise] um I supported her but she does things that um she tripped over herself and she makes a big mistakes eloquent\nSo there you go [laughter] [noise]\nSo what you're saying is cheap believe shouldn't run\nIn twenty [laughter] forget about Gillum we're clear on that what about twenty twenty\nYou know because here's the thing you know the bubble that the Clintons have always lived in ... many people live in\nInside the beltway or inside of the ... beltway\nUm the ... they they when they when they go on the you know a speech to or or you know um if they if they go out and just do some rallies right or it is the case for any of them right or left\nThat those rallies are filled with Friendly's for the most part I mean except for outside on the sidewalk\nThey're filled with Friendly's\nIn other words the Clintons have been surrounded by people who have been telling them they're the greatest for a long long time\nWhen you step outside that you step away from it a bit\nI think Hillary got some of this even when she was running and twenty sixteen remember the reporters that approached her during that campaign season and started asking questions about bill then they had to pretty much at that point\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz was hiding Hillary [laughter]\nWhere's Hillary was the question and you know the ... they had to create that well they had to build a wall around Hillary so that they you know she was not approachable\nSo she's been told by a lot of people oh you should run again you should run again you should run again but it really will be their own internal that will tell them you know our millennials on board\nNow that's a very different question as to whether or not she should go on and endorse or she could she helped Dylan more any other candidate right now in the left\nIt is a very different question in terms of what she run or or should she run or would you vote for her and wanting twenty many of those same people that just criticized for maybe a few of them might vote for her but I don't know that for sure because by the time we get to twenty twenty\nI don't know that you're millennials going to look at that and go\nYeah she's just not the proud and we need somebody you knew in fresh or gentleman besides her\nJust you know because I was actually watching the the the video over here so you didn't have access you weren't looking at the video but the woman who said\nThat uh she should be there just for fundraising and she was older I'm gonna get she yeah she was fifty plus I'm guessing she was the same woman or who said we don't trust her right that she's not trustworthy and that's interesting because that somebody who is experience Hillary Clinton\nThe other two were younger there they were probably in their thirties so they probably don't go all the way back to\nAs many of us do Hillary Clinton and Hillary care way back when\nWhen uh you know she was in charge of of putting together a you know some type of single payer health care system in America in the early nineties\nUh so I thought that was really interesting you actually can raise money but then we don't want to hear from or we don't want to emerge around we don't want her people don't people don't trust her and what she means as Democrats don't trust her she didn't trust her\nRight and I when I found that just to be I I found that\nTo be really really really interesting one other point that I Want to make her because we hear this all the time and we've addressed it before\nBut it came up again the media this week is at Trump's rallies when they talk about Hillary in lock her up that that is it that's it you know instability that that is look you're talking about a political rally and you're also talking about you know why why are they saying lock her up you have to go back to you know what's it about just because she exist\nAnd she opposed you lock her up no that goes back to what that goes back to the whole email scandal where people can identify what the crime was you could look at the law and say this is a crime that she broke and many other people who did this anybody else who did this\nAny normal person who allowed top secrets you know to be so accessible and broke the law and she did would end up in jail that's what that's based on not just based on the on what the left is attempting to portray as just\nPure incivility that don't like her so they want to put her in jail no it's based\nOn her behavior what she did and the fact that Republicans have looked at it and said ... and many have looked at it even not just Republicans conservatives without libertarians and say well actually broke the law right she put the server and her house that's breaking the law she knew\nThat people were going to have you know at that at that level as secretary of state that every foreign government is every\nAh unfriendly and probably friendly foreign government is looking to tap into anything they possibly can to find out what you're doing as secretary of the state by you doing that\nI'm friendly is where we were able to get into some of our top secret you knew it and you did it\nSo you could hide emails from the freedom of Information Act that's a crime yup there's two crimes they're the Espionage Act and trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act that's what it's about\nNow you might say well but she never went to court it doesn't take away the fact that nobody disagrees with what the law is or what she actually did\nWell it's different than the chant by Rosie O'Donnell\nOn the white or in front of the White House you know that is based on nothing it's based on false which you know saying that this the current president is an agent of the of of Russia a and that uh and you know again implying\nOr that and sang in some cases that he got there or to the White House illegally in the ... in the case of lock her up it's based on a crime\nThat nobody debates was broken by her\nOr that that was a law that was broken by her a crime that was committed we know it we can point to it now again it is rhetoric but it's it's the people what they're what the point that they're making is she should be in jail she's not above the law\nRight and it's also the fact that the system you know lock her up is also an attack of the system and the and the department of justice at all that time for not following the law right\nSo that isn't that isn't a a again\nThe same as in any way justifying violence\nThat's what is being portrayed I just wanted to hit the\nWe'd hit that before when when the uh the you know they were being criticized at the rallies were saying that and when you would read the articles that would say it was horrible they they didn't even understand what the point was that even a wide that people were saying right they didn't even addressed that particular point\nSo if you just you're lock her up lock her up and you have no clue\nAs the majority of Americans don't understand the constitution if you have no clue what happened in twenty sixteen and its millennial said we don't even care about that right anymore well then you look at it and so yeah it's unfair what they're saying about ... was not unfair know you want to if you want to get in we do have a line open your calls and comments coming up eight six six Ninety

address something\nThat you that you had said during the bottom of the hour and it was you know when we were talking a ... from an earlier conversation and talking about that you know the heated rhetoric of you know calling a Trump Hitler that you know and and going back in because we'd brought this up months and months and months ago\nI I don't even know it might have been after the school shooting much I'm not really sure but when we talked about look heated rhetoric out there and what it means you know what you're communicating now we've never been one that have drawn the heated rhetoric\nAnd blame the people of heated rhetoric for somebody who's out and kill somebody we didn't blame Bernie Sanders or anybody else no when ... after the ... shooting we didn't we didn't do that but uh we brought up you know just\nHow inflammatory that kind of rhetoric is because what you're saying as Trump is the same as a guy who committed you know a genocide of six million Jews ... which of course is just the most bizarre statement you could ever make and the only reason you do that\nIs to inflame a rage in people that's why you do it mhm because you believe that they'll actually by that and they'll be in theory aided\nOr with it and then you got him you've completed the brainwashing by doing that\nYou and I remember that during the Obama administration you brought this up uh uh to me just now when he was being called\nDictator right we had to get on the air and say guy stopped that right went on the issues is not a dictator he won he won he was voted in by the people the United states conservatives and Republicans might have found distasteful but he's not a dictator well\nAnd they would talk about the you know they want the the idea of right the idea of a him acting uh you know again using the er an executive Penn\nInstead of going to Congress every president has that power we don't agree with that method right but every president has that power um and and you know it was about you know cap and trade and things like that that that he was essentially implemented implementing a through ah the EPA\nEvery president has that power didn't have the power for a recess appointment\nWill lead to court stopped he lost and right I I think you can find every president\nEventually you know when they served their their terms have been rejected by the courts in some executive order that they have ... up you know a put out do they try to stretch the power that they have yeah you have to make 'em dictators no no ... would be somebody who was not elected and was\nDuly elected and and the other part of that as we need to remind you that that's how people vote whether it's two thousand eight two thousand twelve this is how the people voted uh you don't but the Democrats want you to believe that it's not how the people who voted um or there or we shouldn't have the ... like they met every excuse from the book it was the Russians\nAre we got to get rid of the electoral college that's the problem um the uh the the majority of the people didn't vote for him if what if this is what it comes down to this is the process we have in place we have it for a reason and we respect the constitution\nAnd that process but I think it's very important as we talked about before for a ... and we we spent quite a bit of time on this this week\nIs for us not to be that don't argue like them right right they have lost because of the way that they have argued mhm so even though it may satisfy your primal urge or instinct\nTo rage out to somebody\nLike they're doing to you and you get a moment of satisfaction out of it\nIt's one of the reasons that they're losing but you and I said this\nMany times only need is true mhm and when you look at the things that we believe they work mhm that's why we promote them that's why we do the kind of show that we do we spend a lot of time talking about this yesterday that's why we break down everything that's why we get down\nTo the issues at hand and we get pushback from people on the right when we do that by the way mhm there are some not all but there are some of the right\nThey'd want to believe the rhetoric they want to believe\nHi\nYou know you and I and and that's why we you talked about dictator\nRemember when uh we'd we'd sit here Obama's Muslim and we said where's the evidence right while his father now where's the evidence that that's what he believes in if you look at what he believes\nWhat does he believe he believes more in the church of Jeremiah Wright mhm which wasn't preaching you know Islam but was preaching hey\n[laughter] and not Christianity but was preaching a radical hate him or hate America or a\n\nMessage message and thank you very much and [laughter] it's a friday or hate America message and as we said come on\nIf you look at Obama certainly not religious why don't you think\nThat if somebody like Obama worships anybody else out there do you really really think that you really think he's a devoted that there is I got up there that tells him what to do ... please and so we had some fun with it but we said no the evidence doesn't show that at all evidence batters across the board and we've pushed back because we've done that\nUh one of the biggest push back so we had was when we made fun of jade helm Fifteen remembering ... Fifteen ... or the number of people that called us and were furious at us\nBecause we were a mock and it was ridiculous\nOh the government's secret they're going to be in Texas and it's these a secret raids that are going on and and remember the tunnels and Walmart and everything else and people are jumping aboard\nThis crap mhm and it's pure crap and you buy into it separate yourself from those idiots over their deal with the truth that's all you need to do is deal with the true not being fantasy bizarro conspiracy theory world because everyone knows the tunnels were under target exactly [laughter]\nWell I mean we're we're just going to start investing I'm never forget the I'll never forget that moment in\nA jade helm ...

had already figured out the economic benefit to their county right by [laughter] [laughter]\nYeah the monies that was going to be spent on any of those things are going to be they'd be spent that's house secreted was right that the chamber of commerce had done it I mean they spent over two million on the tunnels under Walmart alone [laughter] you know we we dealt with it we we dealt with it after the nine eleven conspiracy thrives remember we had to go to\nWe actually had to go on the show to Popular Mechanics and these are people that listen to our show yes so it for us it's a constant fight and\nYou know with the nine eleven conspiracy theories that people were buying into I remember we had to read portions of Popular Mechanics number Popular Mechanics said look\nI'm we do

hands up don't shoot was ally when the FBI did the investigation or are there and they talked about the conspiracy in the neighborhood to keep the truth from coming out hands up don't shoot is still used today mhm\nWhen either side does that it's wrong we shouldn't be based in our opinions on facts not speculation but we don't do that there is something I don't know what it is maybe it's social media where people believe that okay I have an audience now\nAnd so just like the media there's this third that I'm going to be first\nAnd then if I get the right conspiracy theory if I can guess what happened before the facts comes out somehow that gives me some type of journalistic legitimacy\nYeah it's um you know it it because it would be one thing if you had sources right then you were putting together a puzzle but then\nThat's not what this says it's speculation\nPure speculation pure speculation based on zero evidence based on nothing you know if I'm Catherine heritage or says look what is it possible based on the leaks that are coming out\nA that it is but that somebody who would put pieces of a puzzle together\nA I think she's done some selling work on a number of stories or over the years but what are you doing you're going to people that have something for you\nAnd then ultimately you see if that peace that send to the puzzle\nOr how the narrative starts to build out or how the how the truth I guess starts to come together that's all that is called journalists for those under sixty\nJournalism was very important years to go to our nation and its rarely practice true journalism today because what you have is people wanting to\n'em and they believe they're right in doing so having a ... and have their work justify their opinion\nOr their behavior their words they believe that they're right we talked about this earlier this week about how the the biased media you know operates\nBecause they believe they're right they don't believe that they're biased they believe it's the right thing to do\nActivism in place of journalism is what we see today more often\nThan not and you when you look at a story especially one like this is still unfolding and and the public we don't we simply don't know all we know is what has been found\nThat's it we have no idea\nAnd ... and what the mode and we're still not sure what has been found\nAnd we're still not sure whether the nature of what's been found\n\nLet's how do you go to George in New York George welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show Hi George\nHow's it going guys good show um yeah I was calling about um\n[noise] it seems like there's a lot of uh [noise] that are are going around about um\n[noise] the damage sleeping in the mid term or last I heard from Newt Gingrich I think there's a report I charge report I've got where it gets on a panel some news network I don't know which [noise]\nSaying that the Democrats had two or three chance of winning the house in terms I'm just wondering if\nThere's a build up the scale way independent voters now maybe a scam away by this hard and then there were just say well it's you know the law so why\nAre you saying that's why you've used and that's why Newt Gingrich did that\nFor sure I'm not sure about him specifically 'cause you know but in general I mean I think a policy was first of\nAll why or how do you know that that would scare independence from voting if independence right now are leaning more conservative as the whole sense that they do that would actually encourage independence who leave conservative to me to actually go out and vote\nMaybe well that can be a to point to maybe that was as you point 'cause\nShe I look I when when you're talking about political operatives who you know you'd have to ask them what their motivation was and they'd probably be more willing to tell you after election you know why they why they did what they what they did and again we have looked at some of the polls out there and we of question you don't need silver for example we still question\nYou know how how legitimate you know how you can look at all these house races and make these determinations we still have a ton\nOf up questions but when you look at it overall I think the consensus is more that the republic or the Democrats have a chance of taking back the house in a greater chance than Republicans keeping it but in the Senate\nI think you almost have universal agreement that the Senate is going to stay with with republic\nIn fact I saw something today uh that that basically just had you know that everyone all but it was it was the headline was directed more at the Republican candidates in those races or republic Republicans in in general\nBelieving that they were going to keep the Senate or where the houses going I think that's still up in the air because there are some things that we can't misery even through pools but if you do it strictly by the polls\nRight now than there is a better than decent chance that the Democrats would take the house that would not be shocking um when you talk about a first term president\nUh often that first midterm is is something we're the\nThat shift of power happens that happened with a ... bomber in two thousand ... right and so you could look at at at history that dictates has now do we look at all anomalies that didn't exist before yet trend in that area yeah Trump cabinet and that's\nWhat I was saying about the polls have you go by the polls in history than than you could look out and go okay about Democrats take the house and and the Republicans keep the Senate\nAnd then you look in Nineteen Ninety four and say I did that happen right I was only a talk show host for a couple of years I still remember it how shocked everybody was\nAnd said whoa really except for his albino ... nobody really got that one did that and I wouldn't really came out of nowhere how did the Republicans take so many seats ... well there was this underline you know a underline passion that existed and voting excitement from Republicans to go out\nThat somehow nobody saw now with the technology today\nAnd with the way that we do polling today have we improved it I don't know well and we'll know a little over a\nLittle under two weeks from now call outs is the only way you're going to get an answer for I'm a Republican or conservative in many cases you're not going to see them at protests\nYou're not going to see the ads you might see them at a presidential or the ... the president's rallies but you're not going to see them doing these grassroots rallies but the weapons doing right now but the whole get out the vote make sure you out that kind of thing\nOr a independent Bob yesterday and had a post about wow that ... are really putting up a fight against Trump and a lot of people\nYou know and and I of course had to add to it you've been drinking today not know and and trying to find them and I I was just kidding with him I was just having fun I don't really argued that much\nOn social media and uh but other people calling us what are you basing this on a goes the number of signs a number of signs\nThere I don't

that\nYou want to run for you you jump in and you compete with others and you convince the people of that a state\nOr I think wow do you think he would run for president here's a quote I think if someone were to step down to retire and I\nThought I could do a good job at a match my talents I'd have to think if it's the right choice for me so Chelsea\nClinton's interview with the journal news was one of her latest stopped in the ongoing promotional tour for her new book quote dark now you can make a difference\n[laughter] you want to hear something interesting [laughter] I don't know if I'm surprised by this or not I didn't know the answer to this\nBut if\nChelsea work to run in twenty twenty\n\nBy the time the primaries rover she'd be forty she'd be forty imagine she ran for president in twenty twenty she'd be almost forty one just weeks away from our forty first birthday\n\nFor some reason I was thinking she was a I don't know maybe a a a few years younger I don't know I didn't know the answer to it but she'd be by the time she took office she'll be nearly forty one\n\nWith all these people that write books ... is there money there maybe we should write one\n...\nI mean if people are stupid enough to buy her books they'd be stupid enough to buy our book\n\n[noise] see here's the thing or wouldn't they be no no our audience is different the people who would be

no see that's where we're trapped okay stupid\nCritical thing only call me wrote a book she's writing a book ... every Joe and Jane six pack out while they're really they're really have nothing to say

right\n... okay kids said some employers are near I did did did bill and Hillary completely taint any possibility shouts you ever have enough well career which is why she would only agree to do it if she would be appointed if somebody's stepped down a retired and she was appointed to that position imagine she\nRan and twenty twenty imagine that she just sweat\nAnd I mean it was just in a while and I think that I got her mom's standing on background going what\nReally my husband my daughter [laughter] but not me\n[laughter] [laughter] ah [laughter]\nIt's okay you get to be first mom [laughter] ...\n[laughter] [laughter] uh\nYeah we'll we'll appoint you secretary of making pies\nYeah\nOr it's this out yesterday Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley announced that he is referring Julie sweat Nick and her loyal a lawyer excuse me Michael ... to the Justice Department for a potential criminal investigation as to whether they made false statements to Congress about Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh ...\nGrassley said that in addition to making false statements he is asking the Justice Department to look into whether the two sought\nTo obstruct his panels investigation of the allegations of cabin on well the law prohibits such false statements to Congress\nAnd obstruction of congressional committee investigations for the law to work we can't just brushed aside potential violations I don't take lightly making a referral of this nature but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future Grassley said in a statement and\nHaving any quickly fired back in a tweet saying it was ironic that Senator Grassley has now interested in investigations\n\n... that would be interesting to see where a case like that would go right\n\nYeah um you know you have a number of things there that honestly at that that warrants an investigation I think\n\n... here's here's the question what if anything happens to it after the midterm assuming like the house takes control does it does an investigation like this go anywhere I guess\n\nBecause no reasonable prosecutor [laughter] with would pursue a a a a refer\nI I Would have to look at everything the Grassley has but here's what he writes here in light of ... and Mr ... own statements to the media information obtained from committee interviews of her associates and publicly reported information about her and Mr ...\nIt has become a parent that the statements Mr ...\nSubmitted to the Kennedy likely contain material false claims rationally wrote him a letter grasses across does not guaranteed Justice Department will open an investigation\n\nIs the last part of that well send he sent a letter to attorney general Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray right\n\nBecause if the if the committee work to do I mean if they do an investigation then what would happen to them if they found that there was wrongdoing you essentially send the Senate you send a a referral to the Justice

seen I Would love to see mhm where somebody has made the same points that we have oh wow\nWhy did you give it to the inspector general there's only ... the whole thing was trained the story was initially framed that uh we had foreign allies that didn't want us to release just information\nWell we heard one story said it was the British Government because of Christopher Steele and we said well wait a minute why would you pay attention to them they don't know what the top secret information is I don't know what the president had I don't know what you have they don't know what's in the Pfizer warned so why would you pay attention to them\nAnd if you were going to not really should because things were top secret\nYou would have gone to probably your secretary of state who would be dealing with those governments and and there's also an ex director of the CIA and you'd be going to Dan Coats your own director of national intelligence you wouldn't be giving it to the inspector general\nWho only looks for one thing\nAnd that's corruption and therefore once it was declassified\nAnd people saw what was declassified in the White House they loved and said there are probably possible crimes here\nAnd before we released is we need to first give it to the inspector general of the United states to go after the corruption that we see how come nobody has written that story right and if somebody has I haven't seen it I've not seen any major publication right the possibility of that story and why\nThis all went to the inspector general why would you give it to the inspector general you saw something\nThat you believe warranted his offices action\nAnd what his office deals with is corruption so you're giving him the only the only path that you can go down is you're giving him evidence of corruption in the FBI and the department of justice there is no other pass to go down right\nAnd nothing on the story right\nBecause if you didn't believe if if the president looked at that and didn't believe there was some kind of wrongdoing\nThan there would be no reason to contact or would it would be only if you believe if you saw it and said wow this looks like there's a possible wrongdoing within the department of justice that's up to ... to write the report\nWas handed over because that's what the inspector general Dutch\nAnd by the way we'd be bringing this up and thanks to many of our listeners who I get a few a week\n... people running the emails saying what's going on right what's your guys around thing you hear anything I mean we haven't seen any stories on it either of what's going on I mean that should be one of the biggest stories right now and and who should be reporting this biggest story who should be encouraging it Republicans are they no\nNo no no\nAnd I would think that that the media would be curious I Would think that uh Katherine heritage or\nOr someone else like that would be curious you know anyone that that is a not in the mainstream media but ... but you know someone who has done some really great work in\nAll I I Would think Katherine heritage Fox News would be on a consistently I Would think the wall Street Journal would be on it consistently I Would think the Daily Caller would bionic consistently ...\n\nOut of the things that are I Would think that Andrew McCarthy that's one of the you know and the cars running other articles I really ... and we've been paying attention to it I really haven't seen him right any type of in depth article on that at all and he's been covering it in a separate cars there are a Carter right and and I just wonder why is everybody quiet on it\n\nAnd you're telling me there's no leaks on this one at all [noise] zero\n\nWhen everything else it seems like in the world has been linked El Al many how many important\nItems politically would be ...\nWell it and so there's there's a I guess a couple of possibilities they looked at it and said well there's a a chance that\nWhat was done here was illegal was ah was someone ... acted outside of their their uh their legal bounds within the department of justice in this process\nBut we're not sure handed to Horowitz so in that case you don't lick it because of Horwitz comes back and says no wrongdoing was found\nThen you look bad by leaking that information\nAnd you hook burned you know your connection to me\nI I don't sense because of the nature of what you know how it happened and and frankly how quickly that kind of happened and the fact that it went that direction to begin with tells me they see that and say there's there's a great\nChance here that that this is the wrongdoing and that's exactly ... and ... and Democrats were completely quiet yes and the other part is that the violence from the Democrats when it went to the inspector general there was really nothing the other side of that of handing it over to Horowitz is that\nHorror which doesn't have to ask anyone for documents at the department of justice through an investigation but ... the ... office can walk in and can obtain those documents and no one can stop them\nWhy has doing why hasn't the conservative media from the very beginning talk about the fact of why this went to the inspector general for that the inspector general because we were still we were both on for the first twenty four hours not understand why says going inspector jumped doesn't make any sense doesn't right\nAnd all of a sudden one day on the air ... is one that I think it was the day after or whatever we said well wait a minute\n'cause we're we're we were like ... ... because they were making the explanation as if we can't do this because it could be due did do damaging some of the top secret store allies and therefore we're giving it to the inspector general more like why why would you go to the inspector general or\nYour word oh wait a minute the inspector\nYou do you if the Republicans lose the house that this all stops just investigation stops\nSo you better if they win you better get as much information out as possible that you went out to the American public ... otherwise\nThe fear is it will be buried mhm and the American public will not know the truth\nBecause the Democrats and nobody's ever argue this and we said that the Democrats actually do not want the people of the United states to

incarnations all the way back to Nineteen sixty nine or ... and our dealings with the transportation industry as always\nAh had that particular issue bent on economics\nAnd so when I saw this today I said okay this is something that we have to bring up so people can understand about the economy at large it was the wall Street Journal's analysis of Commerce Department statistics out on why we're doing better what is driving the increase\nIn the gross and the GDP in the increase in economic growth what is you know what is driving it and their analysis is almost half of the increase\nFrom April of twenty Seventeen from last year till this year now new numbers are coming out this morning but based on the numbers that are that came out from last month\nAlmost half of the increase in our economy is due to increased government spending\nAnd they looked at you know really from the majority of the Obama administration where the uh economic uh growth was the average GDP was to point two percent\nAnd compared it to the two point nine percent economic growth that we've had since April of twenty Seventeen just under three percent\nWhich as you know we know is it is a good thing a defense spending has increased drastically that's one of the major reasons and increased government spending that has helped the the GDP\nA defense\nSpending was contracted at an annual rate get this Eric ... to point one percent from two thousand nine to twenty Seventeen\n... ...\nAnd they really go back to you know the president's real you know really the first budget when he had no influence on his when looking at right or to growing at a two point nine percent rate since April twenty Seventeen\nSo there's a huge difference in defense spending that turnaround added a point to one percentage points to the ... on average to the nation's overall economic growth rate according to the Commerce Department when a including faster spending on non defense items and spending\nAt state and local levels increased government spending\nAccounted for a point three four percentage point a to point seven percent point increase in the growth rate since April twenty Seventeen which means\nUh the economy has grown a two point nine percent uh since April of twenty Seventeen the last quarter was what four or one was ... right was it was a very good courtroom uh almost half of that has been because of government spending\nIf\nNow it has also increased other factors are at play faster business investment due in part to energy investing can trigger point contributed point three percentage points to the growth rate faster consumer spending accounts for about a third of the pick up a slowdown in home building has subtract it\nTwo percentage points from that growth rate\nTheir concern in as as we said before is once the government spending moderate\nThan that increase goes away and as we said before the true growth and if you listen to the show you know we've been consistent\nUh irrespective of whether it's been a Republican president or a Democrat president or the GDP is not the most accurate way it's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way\nIt's never been the most uh uh accurate way we believe to truly a show the indication of economic growth\nBecause money being transferred back and forth or government spending is viewed the exact same way as private sector profits and sales and we believe that that storage\nThe actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent from democratic presidents to a Republican presidents well it's important to monitor the true expansion of wealth\nYes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector not that we don't support an increase in defense spending no we're ... we're just talking about how we analyze how it applies to the economy is doing so without the increased in government spending\nOr you would have had a a a\n... a growth rate of of two point five six percent up from the two point two percent from the Obama administration\nThe point is how critical it is because you see the increase\nYou see the increase in a huge increase why because of fossil fuels which drives the majority of\nThe private sector increase in GDP that's still what driving the majority increase in GDP in the private sector it's still not as much as government spending\nRight\nSay for all of a twenty Seventeen that's how much you know we have increased government spending\nOver the last\nRoughly year and a half when that government spending goes away so does the GDP increase that's why we have been so concerned and we've taken a great deal of criticism from people who used to agree with us but now disagree with us\nOn the increase of increasing the cost of goods by terrorists and as we've said it doesn't matter who you are as a matter of whether you call yourself a Republican or conservative or liberal a socialist a capitalist if you believe\nThat an increased cost in good\nIn the marketplace benefits the economy then you don't know what you're talking about it's that simple and so that's why we have always been so concerned\nAbout trade and about artificially increasing the cost of goods and services when we've talked about the president\nAnd the new NAFTA the president's number one accomplishment on the new NAFTA has been what what he believes he has done to the car industry which will increase the cost of buying a car in the United states in Canada in Mexico and we'll make it harder\nTo sell that product made in the United states\nOverseas which was what the president claimed he wanted on trade and we will continue to say this on tariffs the president is all over the place and when you're all
