I'd say if I look at a a a a Clarence Thomas he's probably ... ah Scalia was almost Ninety nine probably Ninety nine percent\nJust doing it off the top of my head Clarence Thomas probably somewhere between Ninety and Ninety five percent ... depending on depending on the year [laughter] yeah and and what I'm hoping is that you have a\nA you know you have a Kavanaugh that ah would get to the Ninety percent level at least the for me on on the on on the important cases I'll be very pleased with its greater than that but again nobody expected robbers to rewrite Obamacare right oh huge\nAnd and then you look at some of his other cases you're like Oh absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right so\nI'm a again this to me was about\nThe greatest thing that came out of this besides getting a ... Supreme Court justice that isn't a a roof gator ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the fact that you and I talked about that the left has\nMade it very clear what they want\nA but I don't think that the Republican Party or\nI think a lot of conservatives knew this was this was a a part of who they were I don't think a lot of the moderates in the Republican Party\nFought they they were a\nAnd I will say some of the moderates that were never Trump or some of the conservatives that were never Trump per\nSe but to see it in action and to see\nThem look to see the debate points that they were bringing up to see what they want it done to see that they rejected the mindset of due process the mindset of a a presumption of innocence this stereotyping\nBut at the convenience all women are to believed unless\nYou're there was those type of woman over there by the way to one of the stories of saw is that now Democrats are starting to blame white women for cabinet are being put in women I thought women were always right\nRight and then I then they started blaming Ivan Eddie and the case if he\nWell wait a minute I thought the woman was women were always right right yeah yeah but that case of too many holds well that's the whole point that the\n... the so now we're just in a comparison of holes in a case right you are stating that and so they're all over the place and when it comes down to is they're just trying to fit in argument to fit their narrative at the moment\nIn order to get the judge in that will fulfill their liberal desires and a judge that will legislate for them they're all over the place on their opinions\nAs\nTheir opinions don't ... their opinions on their goal post move all over the place right\nSo to me it was the fact that you were able to see\nThe left and them and not just the far left\nWhat you saw because we normally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw over the last two weeks was the main stream of the Democratic party\nIn Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law\nReject a presumption of innocence\nAnd we'll slander and defame somebody's character\n\nEvidence to do so yeah and I think a lot of I'll tell you\nHad a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was renting he was you burn in my ear\nAh because ah as you said you know and and I've talked about independent Bob for years and used to vote for Democrats he started telling me how I can never vote for democratic get ... ever when I'm being told what white males thanks as always Ron and white men are always evil and women are always to be bullied because everybody knows that's not true right\nBut that's where they are so we'll get to that up by the way last year it was getting rid of the electoral college by the lab we told you the next thing would be getting rid of the Senate they got there because of all this now home [laughter] as him BC reporter who said you know basically it's time to get rid of the Senate\nSo have you ever to the electoral college go to the Senate the pits our entire narrative that they actually hate the constitution of the United states and ... actually don't like the United states because they want to change all the basic tenants of the constitution so that we will get to that House Democrats talk impeachment\nA Senator Graham says you wanna pick us go to judge win the presidency hey let's get back to Russian collusion\nWell it's about time there's a couple of Russian collusion stories are out there but but not the Republicans are Trump colluding

Fort Hood was opened in Nineteen forty to\nThe veterans Health Administration and I didn't know very much about it I'm not a veteran and nobody in my family is so after I began writing about the VA my daughter worked for veterans Health Administration has been a nurse practitioner per year but I was really intrigued\nBy what you could do if you had a health care system either discovered some things that that the ha had done to reduce very serious hospital acquired infections\nWhat they've done to promote teamwork which is something that prevents problems and healthcare and private sector health care\nHospitals don't do my job and so I became really intriguing I thought would be really interesting to write a book about veterans' health care and about a national system because it's so large this health care system in the United states and one of the largest in the world\nSo I jumped in and I got the go ahead some folks at the VA and I spent five years researching veterans' health care and was just really stunned by what I learned about it\nAs a veteran who has been using for over Thirty years\nWhile I'm aware of many of these jobs are real prone to vote on guns very good care I don't know many other people who have to do I guess it's not surprising so they really big bureaucracy with our problems but by the same token you know when he was drawn to do\nWhen you know we sort of forget the VA it's big bureaucracy yes but so are most hospital systems in America in the private sector because they're consolidating and what used to be one hospital and somehow it's twelve hospitals or is trying to be fifty hospitals so if you want to get away from bureaucracy\nI don't know go to Mars I mean it's everywhere you know and the thing I think that's different about the VA is driven by mission not money\nAnd it's very accountable I mean one of the reasons we hear so much about the problems is it's a count of all it's accountable to you it's accountable to Congress it has its own factor general\nAnd everything is public and eventually becomes public even if they want to hide it that's not true and private sector health care I mean\nI've done a lot of work there and you know patients suffered some problems and even if they have a settlement from mount practice that started nondisclosure agreement that they can't even talk about it\nTo a state board of health or medicine so you never find out about the problems of the private sector but you know one of the really sad things than he has said you don't find out about the great stuff at the VA is doing I mean it's delivers\nIntegrated care which is something most of us in private sector healthcare never experience we go to the doctor\nTalked to him for ten or Fifteen minutes for her than we get a referral to some you know mental health provider on colleges stir\nOr neurologist who never trusted the primary care provider and everything is fragmented on toward needed and in the in the VA ha it's really extraordinary I mean that you go to a primary care\nAppointments and you say I'm feeling down or I'm feeling anxious or whatever and they won't write you a referral they'll walk you down the hall to a psychologist or a psychiatric nurse practitioner and introduce you to that person who will see on the spot\nAnd you will get mental health care that way because they've discovered that if you give a veteran a referral to a mental health provider and ask them to make an appointment and go to the appointment they usually won't make it and if they make a day off I Want to go\nSo it's sort of de stigmatize is that and this is really important to you know so well veterans suffer from about twice as many mental health and substance abuse problems with people in private sector healthcare\nWell that certainly a reason why we need to know understanding appreciate or the whole system is going to lose your freedom we're moaning about health care system from\nThe bottom line who was always the same is despite all their problems there are really bad ones of them is going to do support our veterans who are you saying that that's a very key issue as\nWell and there's you know so well and is your listeners know so well military service\nSometimes creates or exacerbate the problem is that people come in with so veterans have more pain problems they have more mental health problems say a higher risk for suicide they have all these toxic exposures mean will a private sector\nPrimary care doctor a nurse practitioner be able to recognize the difference between Agent Orange that diabetes and diabetes or burn asthma and burn that exposure has my or suicide ballot it you know I mean every single\nStaff member of the ha is trained at least somewhat to recognize what they call suicidal id Asian or thought so you know you could go to Europe ... and they could say come back in two weeks and you could kind of look glum and say well I'm not sure I'll be there two weeks and they go work you know\nAnd that can trigger a look and took a patient's chart which by the way it down to size already people who are at higher risk for suicide\nI mean I thought that VA has problems I mean we have to remember it's got three hundred thousand employees Seventeen hundred sites of care it's the largest healthcare system in the country so it's good to have problems but we're to the problems come from do they come from\nBad people and the VHS or do they come from the fact that the ha it's under funded understaffed we have now close to fifty thousand vacancies on sales in the VA\nI mean that's kind of cards burnout that's going to cause delays and even with those vacancies the VA has better wait times in the private sector\nWell I have to agree with you because everyone knows will be to the phones the reserves you except for the wait times were not that bad but everybody knows are bad except that are doing the business world that's always been on the whole you're saying is absolutely true\nYeah I mean I think this idea that the VA have terrible problems if I may be so bold as to offer his editorial suggesting I think the VA has problem every single scientific study shows that\nThe age of livers care that is the equal or superior to private sector because it's integrated it's coordinated I just had a really ... I Am man how has that problem you're still young and he went to some fancy fancy orthopedic surgeon and you look at his X rays and said\nOh you know you aren't candidate for surgery Oh yes you know I can see why you gain\nHad fun go live with it may be peachy will help you know do it yourself if you were a veteran he would've been put in uptown class which we know reduces protections pound he would have gone to an integrated programs would have gone to peachy\nYou might have gone to medication classes I mean the care he would hike I kept thinking gee if my friend were veteran of the question I I'm concerned about and and I think all veterans and obviously active duty service members who are gonna become veterans chip worry about is what is Congress doing\nTo address the problems and the veterans' health care system the mission act that was just passed in the road to privatization\nAnd I think people don't understand that and don't understand what's at stake I mean you have a really good health care system designed specifically to address the needs of military veterans we study after study that showed the private sector provider\nDon't know that military culture I don't know about you but\nNobody's ever asked me if I've ever served in the military\nWell I mean I cut it sure and we have documentation that\nThat's a new study just came out and family practice that they

warriors are going to continue this conversation now hey welcome back Matt thanks then he was a pleasure to be here give us a quick review of your time and mother army\nWow okay I started out kind of sneaking in under the wire at West point in uh the balmy summer of Nineteen eighty one I safety under wire because a lot of my classmates got their ... appointment through\nA congressman or senator and I sort of had an at large entry into the or the military academy but you know was able to ah fend for myself pretty well there to help my classmates and I was able to get an armored slot was what I Want is I ended up going to Germany for my first assignment\nTo the ah three twelve cab which was uh divisional cavalry squadron of third Armored Division and really enjoyed my time there be a lot of good friends\nCame back to the advanced course Fort Knox and then went straight down to Fort Stewart\nWith a unit and eating there were in court and was deployed for the Gulf War in early summer of Ninety Ninety spent the next ten months in the tropical paradise of ah the middle east so and after that I came back I got out and went into explored the are\nThe jobs scenario out outside the army\nYou wanted to hang out with those civilian people there was a number\nOf reasons for that but we'll get into that later but the the I think it was it was a good step for me\nThough God's Muslim civilians you may so many of these right okay we're talking about warriors\nAs we discussed last week with autumn there's lawyers at every level of society and and as you pointed out a couple of times\nYou out to be committed and focused as if you're gonna be a warrior we'll talk mostly military and again don't want to put down the other word certainly as I've said a hundred times on the show people in law enforcement or not our brothers in arms but there certainly are first cousins and valor\nThey put their lives on the line every day for people that don't even know many of them don't even like him so please don't take that as an exclusive but we're talking about people in uniform right everybody puts on the uniform better be prepared to become a war is that a fair statement\nYou know any of that is exactly what I was thinking it's funny you should say that because to be a warrior you need to train to be a warrior I think inside a lot of us think of ourselves as warriors\nBut the men and women that are going into battle they need to train every single day as closely as they can to replicate combat conditions because you never really know how you're going to react so the closer you can get to replicate those conditions and training day in and day out to be a warrior\nAnts you know your enemy no the order of that all the more that you know the more you trust the people around you the better you're going to fight\nAnd I think that is true in any scenario in life whether you're in business or whether you were in sports\nThe boys the journals five eighty WC age as your\nYour mom and she wasn't that much about\nIs much more marshals sponsors smart\nAnd the military and national fortunate for them to somebody\nThis law just maybe we can we do they monitor the zoo vet who's the one that was going to\nBe these mostly promised us some sense\nCommissary agency to be exclusive supplier of the freedom of choice home base branch to learn more about them or check out career opportunities that spark National Guard\nTroops you know now it's football season and the service academies football time on this show and joining me now of course there's football cohost Clinton Roberts was subdued\nThan a it's a great day to be a falcon man\nYes I think so the only game last weekend and air force hosting navy army at a bar and you are and force guys were not very nice to you need to guess where you\nWell we've provided them as much hospitality as they deserve but it was a great game as service academy against our car says I say for the falcons was particularly rewarding as they took a leg up on the race for the commander in chief Charles here by the feeding\nThe Naval Academy Mitch shift in thirty five to seven\nFoot lady started off on top coming out and scoring on a a and the second quarter to go up seven and nothing and after that an air force just really unleashed a barrage and that was all behind quarterback than the his with his first start of the year\nDJ ham and the third\nAnd interestingly\nNavy is having some quarterback issues for a change of Malcolm Perry was her flight behind center and the leadership and just never could really gain traction or against the falcons the trash so it was a a\nWell attended game over forty thousand than\nIt was a great beautiful day and Colorado Springs and you know have an accounting for three out of the five charge towns and the air force just totally overwhelm a navy and and coach for the amount of low low even\nGave this statement that they just worked out for for something to that effect\nWhen I was never been known to be hard to understand you know ... mile is\nVery clear and I dare say that was a somewhat you hold on my ear\nBut there's one more game that go with that first weekend and in November will take care of that at that time\nThat I was and I I'm afraid I Will not be rooting for your team that day that's\nAll right then and that's all right every little thing that album out or to gather positive they're forcing sacrifice that\nThings like that so I've got a brother in law who's going to be granted he was out there cheering too so uh are a whole family to the Persian you guys and\nWe usually go to games where everybody on the field would give their life or every other person\nIs right there and they and um but I tell you what a lot more football to replace the here and are ... are free teams are inaction next week and I think the falcons hopefully have gain some traction\nAs they move on and their schedule or as well as a Navy I think they're going home and they should be able to rebound and men army travels out west to play on oil and fire San jose state team that I think they should have handled so uh you know you can't stop\nAnd rest on those laws are a lot more football reflex\nThat's the key issues in the middle of the season a victory might feel really good but that was yesterday\n[laughter] that's right and so you know when we look at uh like I say I'm against San jose state army as a huge favorite game or I Love the black Knight they've got national attention they did it in their last Oklahoma where they took over and over time\nBut then they seasonal wise they beat the quality opponent and really until they get their for their schedule is\nReally pretty light so I have like army to continue to roll again the only other lawsuit with suits having a very good season ... army as a very good football team this year they're gaining a confidante under the new quarterback Calvin and Hobbes him and I expect them they're really just roll over San jose state\nEven though it's in a way a game and you know when you go away games\nAh things can get a little squarely but I I think a army should be able to handle San jose state\nOkay Airforce you're out west to aren't you at San Diego\nStuff's right now that's going to be a tough one San Diego state that very very high quality came from the airport the past couple of years and throw a what I liked the fact that again air force there's rarely seen\nTo ah find who they were finding identity as a team ... again for the navy now\nMaybe a quarter of the predominantly running chain San Diego state are going to throw it a lot more and ah when I was there and saw air force their secondary struggled against Nevada tapping yeah so\nThey're going to have tightened it up in the secondary but if they can do that and they can continue to have a strong run deep fat the falcons all parents and the ... of course if that's\nThe best the parents to keep another came golf in front of\nHim in at the airports to play ball control off and control the clock limit this was actually then again they will be in the game until the very\nWell here's hoping and then navy or they hosting temple\nAre their whole Sikh temple and look simple beat Maryland and temple or have some very good wins but by the same token they have some in the losses and they're really saying that uh they're up and down next year and so they're looking to gain some consistency\nAnd uh but you know Navy is really trying to find itself to this uh\nBut now here in America it has morphed into something called knockout game it became popular a few years ago when young teenagers would pick out an adult to attack and then casually walk up to them and sucker punch them in the face\nThe goal was to render them unconscious with one punch\nIn some cases they would even kick the unconscious victim as they lay on the sidewalk and even take selfies of them while standing over the victim\nQuite a few people had been seriously injured put into ... and several have actually died as a result of these types of attacks\nBut how can you defend against crazy acts of violence like this here a few handy self defense tips you can follow to minimize the danger of becoming a knockout victim one when you're around people you don't know especially when in transitional spaces like parking lots and sidewalks always operate at a heightened state of awareness\nCheck people out from a distance and if you see anything that makes you feel threatened or uneasy leave the area\nToo when you walk past people keep them in your peripheral vision many times attackers will glance over at you and then look around the area to ensure known as watching before the launch the attack\nWatch for these non verbal cues and respond appropriately when you see people with the various intent\nAnd three when walking past people on a sidewalk or a hallway or in a parking lot give them a little space don't let them get close enough to play the knockout game and for\nDon't be afraid to make brief I contact just so people know you are aware of their presence you are sending the message I see you and I hold you accountable many times this is all it takes to ward off an attack\nI understand that we shouldn't have to worry about people like this but the sad reality is that this type of craziness happens and we need to be aware of it and take precautions fortunately for the victim in this story there was a co worker with a staunch warrior mind set any successfully intervened to bring this story to a happy ending\nAnd does exactly

Haley a bizarre visit to the oval by Kanye West and it's only been a few days and spread Kavanaugh was sworn in\nAs the newest Supreme Court justice seems like a lot longer than that doesn't it here to talk about all of it is our White House correspondent Karen ... first of all let's go to President Trump talking about the hurricane 'cause it really was devastating he says he's going to go down to the hurricane zone where you see that probably\nAt some point or early next week of course the big concern Sherrie is when the president go and not impact any of the operations on the ground communications are still quite bad down there and they don't want to take away any time attention and at work power\nAway from the people that need help so the president says he wants to get a firsthand look though at the damage we expect that when he goes down he'll get a briefing from state and local officials and do some touring of neighborhoods that were particularly hard hit it'll look a lot like the events he's done in North and South Carolina after Hurricane Florence\nAnd a Texas in Florida during last year as hurricane season\nOkay you an ambassador Nikki Haley saying that she's going to step down at the end of the year did we see that coming\nIt was a big surprise here in Washington especially here in the White House press this was something nobody was expecting and it was pretty amazing that they were able to keep this really a closely held\nThe president said he and Haley had been talking about this for some time and that the timing was right for her to say at the end of the year she was going to step down the big question of course now is what is she going to do next and she indicated this week that there is no set plan\nPresident said she could come back to the administration at any time she wants and have her pick of any job it certainly sounds like she's going to take a little bit time away and not ruled out jumping back into politics but she ... she made it very clear I'm prompted\nNobody asked her a question but she says she's not running against President Trump in twenty twenty she will be out in the campaign trail supporting his reelection\nOkay so talking about campaign rallies we saw a couple of more than we were going to see several more before the midterms these or something President Trump just thrives on he loves\nIt he love and getting out on the road the White House likes getting him out on the road in front of enthusiastic crowds he has for rallies this week and that's the case that's going to continue between now in the mid term elections\nI think he'll be on the road for five days notably neither all evening events seven o'clock eastern time he wants to try and get prime time coverage\nBut there's been some reporting this week that he's actually not getting that wall to wall cable television coverage like he used to he said something really interesting this week's area in an interview with Fox News he said people are
