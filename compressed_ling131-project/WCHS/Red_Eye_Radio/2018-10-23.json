this yesterday that what you're going to see from the Democrats is free everything for twenty twenty mhm\nFree everything but we don't believe in the constitution and we hate America that's the new that is the new narrative we don't believe in the constitution we don't believe in due process we don't believe in the first amendment we don't believe or in the the the second amendment we don't believe that there should be a Senate we don't believe that there should\nA a a a a a\nElectoral college we don't believe in the constitution of the United states but we wish to give you everything they get up to six thousand dollars Camilla Harris now Cory Booker talking about fifty thousand dollars\n\nThat can be used or by the young poor in this country to buy a house or to get a college education so now they're up to fifty thousand dollars remember back in twenty sixteen to show you\nThat Eric and I are on the cutting edge of where the left is going oh we had dated look why\nDon't you just come out we need somebody to come out to be the first one to say we're just going to give everybody a hundred thousand dollars whether or not up to a hundred thousand yet but two years after we said that\nAnd it was two years right about now mhm 'cause we told Hillary look if you want to get if if you're looking for that last you know to we push hundred thousand everybody should just go all the way yeah Cory Booker now up to fifty thousand dollars ... that's\nThe other problem we discussed yesterday was Hillary\nYou know with ah with everything you know the the big free and and and all the money you don't forget the free will also pay you were going to pay you know the government's going to pay you\nSo you get everything for free and we're going to give you money well if you're Hillary there's no way you can't be a moderate in your approach\nNo if she's thinking of running you better take some numbers down they're gonna have to be bigger than what's out there now\nWhen you well you know is this the six thousand really just got blown out of the water just out and ... the couple of days that now we're up to fifty thousand\nRight and that's not enough\nYou can't buy a house for fifty grand alright bunkers got fifty thousand who's got marking on I got a hundred thousand a hundred thousand airtime hundred thousand\nWhy don't we just force the home builders to build somebody there ... everybody their dream home\nOr the grocery stores they can charge you anymore\nLike health care as a writer who must be a writer yeah free food one by the way why isn't anybody come up with that and you're thinking about that for years long shouldn't that be do for cash yeah why isn't somebody come out and said look great ball for everybody should have\nBeen before health care you know go to the doctor every day but most people most people except for supermodels eat everyday\nWho'd\nBy the way we don't condone just walking into a grocery store and leaving without paying\n[laughter] hasn't happened yet [laughter] wait wait for it\nBut that's this is this is what you're gonna have to [laughter] it will be an auction they'll have an auctioneer\nDuring the\nPrimary for the left it'll just every every instead of debates it'll just be an option oh what a promised his campaign promise auction you've caught\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nYou've got Democrats out there saying you know with this one point six billion dollar lottery yeah we've got to start up and the money that we're going to get people to be looking at one point six billion\nHow about if we have a let's call it the lottery that everybody when that's right yes how about that is the right hand picked by the way somebody should be paying for these ideas you know we we told the Democrats back in ah\nIn twenty sixteen you ... you know just start offering more money right we set a hundred thousand right Corey bookers up the fifties is up to fifty what that story coming up about the the the fifty\n... because it wouldn't go to everybody but they're up to fifty though that's a point it's up to fifty now because it will continue to expand but that's what I'd run on ... if I'm a Democrat but we wish to have is a lottery for everybody where everybody wins well it's funny because\nYou know they focus on in this case young poor people um that includes most young people\nMost young people are poor because ... and here's the law as we pointed out yesterday too you start promising things than people realize well ... you're not going to be able to afford that for everybody and and they will draw a line\nIt will be for some\nSo in a rising economy and people start making a little more money they're thinking of themselves so wait a minute\nI might not get that that's going to go that free stuff's going to go to somebody else but not me see that's the world we live in and by the way that's the world but the Democrats helped to create ages ago this is where we are forget about you I'm Out for me\nI'm Out from mine\nIt's all about me so my neighbors are going to get fifty grand I'm not going to get fifty grand\nAnd meanwhile Eric and Gary have to pay for and we have to\nPay for it\nAnd building you're you're you're building a welfare wall and making us pay for it\nAnd if you're a first my listeners because even under the Republican tax cut Eric and Eric's taxes in my taxes went up around\nThat's why I went to early voting today and voted straight ticket Democrat [laughter]\nI'm proud of fact I Want my money dry\nI Want all about me [laughter] I

is from NBC News is the blue wave turning purple I'm reading from the story Republican affiliated voters about pays democratic\nAffiliated voters and early voting in southern closely watched states according to data\nProvided by target smart and independently analyzed by NBC News data analytics lab\nGOP affiliated voters have surpassed democratic affiliated ones in early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee and Texas\nYou know you you and I have closely watched\nThe um the ah Montana or a Senate race\nWhere you have a Jon Tester going up against a Matt Rosendale mhm and we've we've noticed that you know the our CPA average on that the real clear politics average by the way it's a great website to go to for anybody out there if you're never gone to it to look at you know all the latest polls across the board\nAh and but you and I looked at that and Jon Tester the Democrat you know you've you've seen consistently over the last month is up by three well the latest poll that was done there was was September twenty second it and write and tester was up by four at that particular point in the margin of error was three point seven\nUh and you and I said you know how can you make a how can you look at that now are CPS has it as a toss up\nRight now they've they've they've got it as a as a toss up but when you see that you know 'cause we've talked about what is what is the voter excitement level to you when you see Montana in there that makes us look and wonder what would the latest poll say I'm the tester Rosendale race in Montana\nAnd and because there's a number of motivators but the ... the entire a capital a confirmation process\nAnd the hearings and then the ultimate confirmation a vote\nIs there anything in that particular race that was that was motivating for one side of the other\nAnd what what are the polls saying it's frustrating for me because I I actually ask you during the break or they did they just go on vacation when early voting started the pollsters they don't no no\nBut polls are still going even if well the problem is is a major races you happen to have some in recent days you had some up until ah I've got to go back to the Ted Cruz a work\nThing but it's at least two week oh\nWell that's why the Montana's ... over a month all well it is a modeling I brought up about ... thirty to answer my whether they will get right a Texas thirty two is now what twenty nine days old in terms of that poll which is\nSomething it's a house seat but it's it's one that's been held by Pete Sessions for a long time and Pete Sessions is up by one but that was a month ago\nSo I I have no idea I don't know why the pollsters are not more active especially in this particular uh uh uh election season as as I I thought I guess I thought they would be\nFor any first term of a president their first midterm is crucial\nAre so GOP affiliated voter sub surpassed democratic affiliated ones in early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee and\nTexas only in Nevada have democratic affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voter so far in early voting according to the data key Senate races are underway in seven of those eight states\nAnd we'll prove pivotal in determining which party controls the or the chamber the latest data suggest robust enthusiasm among early Republican voters that could put a dent in democratic hopes for a blue wave in next month's midterm election remember and breeding verbatim from the NBC story\nA Republican or Republicans typically dominate a early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to\nThey have the advantage with him in person early voting for example the entire early voting picture and Florida which has yet to be gone in person voting is incomplete or in Arizona where two members of the house democratic a Christian\nA\nCinema and Republican Martha mix Sally ... our neck in neck in the contest to build a retired Republican Jeff Blake's\nA Senate seat forty four percent of early voters had a Republican affiliation compared to thirty three percent of the Democratic affiliation right twenty three percent of early voters were not affiliated with either major party and that's a group as other\nIn the NBC News from a a partisan analytics in Florida where a democratic Bill Nelson who's running for reelection in a tight race against Republican governor Rick Scott forty four percent of the early voters had a Republican affiliation versus thirty eight percent who had a democratic affiliation\nAn Eighteen percent who are not affiliated with either party in Indiana\nWhere a democratic Senator Joe Donnelly is facing reelection challenge from Mike Braun fifty one percent of early voters had a Republican affiliation compared with thirty nine percent who had a democratic affiliation\nAnd ten percent who are not affiliated with either party you know that's something to be looking at not just the\nNot just a voter enthusiasm of Republicans and Democrats which by the way is extremely important mhm because if you have more enthusiasm of Republicans in her mid term election like that that's almost unheard of well\nEspecially when you talk about first day of early voting one one reason they take a look at that as it because people are essentially tropic of the bet to to vote to to get there say\nAnd who was at which group is that that is more motivated to get their first that can tell you something\nAbout the the point I was trying to bring is not not the Democrat or Republican but\nIf you have if you know if ten percent or in the one case was at a\nIn Florida eight Eighteen percent not affiliated were independence going right now where the polls on were independence live right now our independence being affected by what has gone on now independence for the most part did not like it was going on in the cabinet hearings which may be a huge\nUh you know a driver to the poll of independence but we're independence going in this election\nI haven't seen a lot of you know election polling analytics on independence we've heard a lot about the enthusiasm of Republicans and Democrats but of course that's key because independence and most elections decide you know where the country is going mhm\nAnd I just haven't seen much I'll do some more research on it now yeah I'm going to do some more research to see what's out there on on independence but it just popped into my head right now we spent so much time talking about were Democrats are Republicans are\nAre not realizing that a significant portion the the determining factor of vote in most states is still you know the where the independence lie mhm\nCharleston's ESPN is the home of college football and basketball major

when we went all the results of the the mid term election with early voting going on in a in a lot of states up there and the early voting in a in a seven of the eight states that had been looked at that have\nUm a Senate races toss up a Senate races right now and Republicans are are leading as we said yesterday I mean you you have right down when you look at this I mean this this has the possibility of becoming a very unusual mid term because you do have\nA right now you have a really energized a Republican base you have an energized Republican base because of of of uh of of Kavanaugh which is huge habit because of Trump you also have it because we believe one of the unknown of factors here\nIs this caravan which is slowly crossing Mexico but won't get here from what we can see even if they were going twelve hours a day\nWhich wouldn't even get here until election day but we'll be in the news every day and a until election day and has the potential of bringing illegal immigration because immigration and illegal immigration\nWas the number one topic really over the last two years\nMaybe until the Kavanaugh\nNomination you know got in there to bring that back to the forefront illegal immigration as an issue does have the great potential of putting Republicans are over over the top possibly even in the house\nAnd that is extremely unusual because the party when you have a typical situation where a party has the executive branch and and ... and ... and in both branches of the the legislative branch ... it's ... it's almost always a loss of seats\nYou know it it right now the tactics of the ... we always we lately especially been talking about how things change every day the new story will be different once Kavanaugh is confirmed by Monday everything that you know there are new complain\nOn the left will be different\nThey bring up you know anything and everything they're throwing everything just try and make it stick with all those are motivated

turnout by volunteers in the disappearance of Thirteen year old Jamie clause in the murder of her parents ABC's Brian Clark\nAnd there's another group saying what we got our cash shut up mhm Mm yeah and so now there's so many ... so the NFL the owners probably said look don't ask don't tell and it's a liberal it's liberal fighting liberals and it'll eventually blow up in their faces yeah I'm an hour and then we can move on\nYeah I mean I I think you're I think you're probably right on it's probably you know unofficially don't ask don't tell for me it's a don't watch don't\nCare [laughter] [laughter] well let me just a thing if there is no reason to watch my team anyway because they're not colonizing\nWell yeah I mean you know my my team attempting to I I just saw the headline attempted to come back you know over the uh the Redskins this past weekend and then you know couldn't get it done\nBut I I I\nI think of again the bigger picture of the fact that it's not just the protests driving the people that you you you've got two big\nThings to overcome right\nYou've got to bring back the people who left because of the protest but you got to bring people back who left because they they're watching other things because they're doing other things I mean that's where I think a lot of the erosion\nIs you've got to create new excitement in the NFL not just\nEnd the whole protest thing you've got to create new excitement in the broadcast presentation of the game\nAnd\nThey haven't even started on that I mean\nUh you know the used in a lot of the movement to digital and and we knew that my comment is going to be more of that in the in the in the coming years\nNo doubt but that's about reaching the audience where they are but you know you put a store where the traffic is right so do you put your game your presentation is going to be where the traffic is if it's on digital if a if it's on line and that's where you're\nGoing to find that audience but you've also got to change and I think that will help change the presentation of the game\nBut that's something nobody is focusing on right now because they can't get through\nYou know this is even if it's just a handful players\nIf it's making the news it's like you know come on guys it's time to get back to football but you can't get there because these stories still make the news that's you know it's it's like the left you look at\nA uh a war and and oh Casio Cortez\nThey don't represent the majority of the uh the the rank and file Democrat out there but they're leading the party\nIf they're making the news and they're driving motivation on the other side as a result of it was a ... ... was a Tim Ryan\nYou know challenge Nancy Pelosi for for his seat and and you know we got to get away from the identity politics and and everything else\nAnd who else said that a couple of others have said that um but they can't\nBecause it's not making the noise I mean the the I guess being a more moderate Democrat if you could they would still be far left but\nGetting away from you know the identity politics or whatever it is that's driving the far\nFar left well\nWhere where do you moderate where do you because that's not making the news that's not making the social media or that's not where the interest is by the mainstream\nMedia it's boring so it's you know this this is this is all you know part of well\nAnd I'm In a really scrambled equipment and what you see here is what you see happening in the ... in in the Democratic party where you have victims in the oppressors and ... and as we've said this that the identity politics\nYou continue to cut the pie of victims becomes greater but then when the number of victims becomes greater than the number of oppressors\nA must you know must become a a greater or you know we've seen it a ... look ... last week you saw the most of the cycling though the women's cycling a champion you know the the the mail one the biological mail one and\nThe female came out and said the the two females that are are one of the females that came in\nLike third place she goes this is ridiculous this was a male\nRight and he has gone crazy stating the bigotry and the intolerance and right and and and and and all that because I Know you're a you know you're a man you're not a woman so that's the debate that goes on and so as we said the feminist up today the ... the old time feminist wish to protest is\nThe new time that the new feminist do not want to protest is\nBut you destroy feminism as we said all along the feminist have now become the press or think about this did you ever think that the feminist would become the oppressors of\nLiberals right now the feminist the feminist movement this is how insane it is and what you have here is in the in the NFL\nYou of error greed you know a Malcolm you know Malcolm Jenkins was part of the group that agreed\nThat okay uh the owners are going to give a hundred you know a hundred million dollars for the for the organizations that we wish to get money to\nTo help make racism less mhm okay fine All right we will we agree that we're not going to Neal anymore ... well now he is viewed by air agreed and Capra Nick as\nThe oppressor he is a Neal colonialist\nRight he's a sellout right because the whole the the real thing is with the ... or a read\nThey don't want a deal no they want to be able to scream oppression so so the victims some of the victims now that we're perceived as the victims here in the NFL or those in the NFL standing up for who they perceive\nThe victims war\nNow they have become the oppressor they're just as bad as Trump they're just as bad as any top ... because\nThey have decided that they will negotiate to try to make things better and the radical left doesn't want to negotiate show they want the constant and they wanted this constant the debate out there they want to be able to cry racism day in and day out\nAnd the fact that it's never going to be solved because it can't be solved once it's solved or once you get to where most people believe society is today we're racism is not a factor like it was\nFifty years ago or sixty years ago or a hundred years ago or a hundred and fifty years ago\nThey have to insist that it's actually worse than it's ever been or they lose their purpose their purposes gone they can't say that things are getting better for it and so boom it's going to blow up\nAnd a significant portion of the NFL of blacks in the NFL that were initially supportive of it and said OK enough we made the protests we made our point we've got the money from the NFL to put to good causes we believe are good causes\nNow they aren't the defenders of the victims now they are the oppressors it's what happens\nRight what's happening with the Democrats everyday it's happening now in the NFL we've been saying it\nFor years here not unexpected no because it doesn't matter who you are the person standing would you nearly what was the case may be in protest could be the oppressor tomorrow and that's what's happening\nNow Malcolm Jenkins is a sellout right I'm sure you know what whatever other labels and want to throw at them but a Neal colonialist that's the that's my favorite one mhm you know Neal colonialist yes that term was used on an NFL football field\nYeah well that's a first at least whether they're making

Senate races out there that the Republicans lead only one state Nevada do what the Democrats or a leader at the at the moment and we've talked about\nYou know what might be influencing this election and we know that the whole cabinet thing is we and we need more than just a Supreme Court justice it's it's about everything that was surrounding that it's it's from the ... you know the the non belief in\nA in a in instability it's about the non belief\nIn due process under the law it's clearly where it it what has come out of this that the left doesn't believe that the Senate should exist anymore that the electoral college should go away\nAnd it's something that we have said for the longest time and I wondered 'cause we've been saying this for years\nAnd it really started out with the whole it it started out with the whole free speech the first amendment issue\nWhen it came to and this goes back what ten Fifteen Years ago a about a well corporations and groups don't have free speech free speech is only for the individual and we said it's ridiculous and then we got to the whole thing the the whole remember the slogan corporations aren't people\nBy the way I got that I saw that the other day somebody actually use that the other day I thought that had died out\nBut that's still out there well of course that's as we said if you're going to make that argument then nobody should ever able nobody should ever be able to protest their property taxes because property is and the person\nWell of course but people pay the property taxes and and corporations are made up of people and those people in corporations have just as many free speech rights as anybody else not involved in a corporation which is what a corporation is a set of rules and regulations set up by the government\nTo regulate business you don't lose\nYour free speech rights because you want to enter into a a a a government policy right you don't lose your free speech rights\nOr you know because of it and so it's an easy argument to to dissipate but we said back that we send them when that started coming out which one would they really don't believe in free speech they believe in free speech because they do business was being negative businesses wrong that's their argument\nBusinesses evil therefore evil people shouldn't have free speech rights\nAnd and so we you know and it's not a pop ...\nAnd then it wasn't a popular opinion to haul no river ground sized for that or what do you mean corporation yeah people in ... you may not like it but yeah people well why should why should they have it because of their goal is to make money\nAnd the matter what their goal is are are they stealing or or right they didn't leave for money right a buddy\nSurly old colonial because it was it was it was coupled [laughter]\n[laughter] it's real bad [laughter] but the but the thing is is that um the the it\nWas it was part of the whole well there's too much money in politics [noise]\nAh oh who's the guy that was on I'm used to be on CNBC then he went over to MSNBC or Dylan Ratigan you know that was his ... and he had had the fake anger thing going on\nBut we said look breakfast out of work to do it you don't want a break it down to two words Casio Cortez\nShe spent next to nothing compared to her opponent Hillary want Hillary didn't win right\nBut I Know but nobody in the lead really has complained about money in politics right since ...

borders\nAnd so since they want to open borders as we said whenever they talk about campaign when it should be whenever they talk about comprehensive immigration reform you and I asked well what would that be they never give you the specifics of what it would be because I Would think the comprehensive immigration reform to anybody out there\nWould be okay what we have to do is we get it would be to ... what do we do with the illegal immigrants that are here in this country that have been here for significant period of time right and you and I both often said\nGee if you make the offer just see

as magnesium spray gr blue light shielding glasses and regular yoga and meditation classes\nOver the past ten months he has spent about four thousand dollars for his quest to sleep and now he's getting about five hours of sleep nightly\n... see I couldn't spend four thousand dollars in sleep could well\nSee the problem is is I'd be worried about the money that I was spending and then that we ... exactly\nYeah he said it's worth it and he's now working\nI'm ... and they talk about that ... a sleep is the new hustle they talked to one slouch yes is the new hostile or this was a woman who runs a these sleep coach soda who's ... who is from upstate New York buffalo\nSleep is the new hostile she runs a two thousand square foot sleep center and charges her clientele financial

yeah\nYeah I talked to another sleep culture caters to high end clients mhm mhm charging up to ten thousand dollars for a day long session including life coaching and dietary test to determine whether sleep problems may be linked to food issues right\nUh you know well first of all thoughts and prayers for further guy going through you know all those a life changing events I'm I'm sure that's a that's a real cause for losing sleep a clearly a ton of emotional distress there but I'm not trained in that but I Am trained in\nWell I'm\nInsomnia you know it it's the it it is sometimes the\nAh it's not just for people that work this shift yet but you know for people that work any shift a sleep can uh you know be the base of\nBut I don't know that you know I'd I Would go in this direction I mean the first thing I Would do I mean naturally for me it would be if I couldn't solve and it was really becoming a problem\nBecause it it it would become a medical issue at some point then I Would go to my doctor that would be right as mine it and now you may spend a lot of money at\nYour doctor ah you know and I understand people not wanting to have well I don't want the chemicals or or this to to go to sleep but\nThat's something I Would discuss with my doctor even sell you know okay let's not do the pills or whatever let's what can I Do what do you recommend I I I don't know that I Would go into the for me I Would want medical experience first if I'm going to turn to somebody you know\n[noise] you know for for me it's really interesting and and I've been blessed that I really never had major sleep problems at all mhm and and I feel blessed because of it but I Know last as I was telling me ... or ... yesterday that last week\nI still can't get on a regular schedule where you sleep you know really one time a day who the day shift so tough now I'm back on this ship sleeping twice a day 'cause that's what I did when I came on the ship and I you remember I just said I'm going to you know I I couldn't\nI was trying to figure out okay what time can I sleep all I Can't do that with my body my body tells you when it's time to sleep yeah and and I'm Glad that I can pick up on what my body tells me that because it's twice a day I go home and I go to sleep and and and then I sleep again at about five to six o'clock when my body gets tired\nAnd you know I mean you know what a disciplinarian I Am at that people that know me and to know me and my whole life said you really became disciplined I mean you have to sleep during those times and I said if I don't it throws up my tier mind my mind is gone if I don't\nIf I don't do it but because I'm a because I'm On that schedule rarely do I ever have to you know take even anything over the counter mhm anymore I I was for a little while they're taking the melatonin maybe once in a while and\nSometimes on weekends I may have to take a little bit of it because my I changed my my sleep pattern but that's even rare now I've decided no just sleep and if you wake up in the middle of night get up you know do some stuff for an hour and I go back to sleep and it was my ... my my dentist my uh who\nAre is asleep therapist who who uh\nSaid when I told him I scheduled 'cause he was always concerned as my dentist 'cause he was also wanted to sleep therapy\nAnd I told him I scheduling what oh she's asleep twice a day goes when that's how the basically the caveman used to do it came I used to go to sleep like seven o'clock there was no TV they went to sleep seven eight o'clock\nThey woke up at midnight one o'clock and set up for a couple of hours and back to sleep again that's how human beings used to do it and he said so you're basically into it and he said do you find many problems and I haven't had any problems no type of medical problems but to me the only thing that really insurers\nAre that I I mean it it's almost said I Do have to I Do have to work out almost every day working out does make a difference for me ... tiring out my body does make a difference doing physical activity\nI'm having trouble uh getting to sleep I have trouble finding the time I mean my my life is so busy it ... it literally is a a round the clock you know huge family or other business aside from you know this ah and and then of course a lot of the stuff pertaining to to this\nYeah but it is but I've known your long enough you can operate without sleep I Can't yeah\nYeah well I Do not my mine's in point I was up at two AM a Sunday Morning and uh up until\nA almost one PM on Monday a afternoon that's when I went to bed Monday afternoon I got up at six thirty and then went back to bed for another Ninety minutes\nUh see I I Can't I Can't I've known your long enough to know that you can operate would sleep your brain still works my brain does not work yeah the same at all if I if if I don't sleep correctly it is so tough for me to to to do that so I guess as\nWell and for the ... same thing I mean my allergy well yeah and and for me it's the same thing it is also too about the exercise and diet and everything else because had died during that time I mean you know we had a big red that big a family wedding on Sunday\nYou put the pedal to the middle with us or NATO smart Saturday mornings eat right here on the voice of turtles to Ninety six points by in five eighty WC agents [noise]\n\n\n\nInternet radio eight six six Ninety run I he is are currently and I'm Gary McNamara you know we have stated a you know with the election\nComing up here I'm In a you know in a couple of weeks well it's actually going on right now but when the results come uh come in then a what we had two is twenty twenty and what are the Democrats talking about free everything as we talked about Medicare for all free complete healthcare is what they're talking about everything\nEverything is paid for it now is you know we can't even do that for the senior citizens right but this Medicare plan which more likely like Medicaid Medicare or would be would be would cover all Americans everything would be free college education free as they've been talked about a ... with the\nA six thousand dollars a year\nOr to be a given what do they call that again guaranteed income from the government now Cory Booker talking about they're taking it further as we said that they would\nCory Booker looking into opportunity accounts baby bonds they would call them\n... and we'll explain what that would be what that what would what that might\nMean if these came about which would mean fifty thousand dollars by the time that you were Eighteen that you could use if you were a low income person in this country ...\nSo as we said we we talked about the fact that some day they make it to a hundred thousand dollars well they're getting to fifty\nYeah and will tell you for precisely what it would be but that's what we figured we knew that the Democrats only option would be we're going to give away the house everybody get something we'd you know if we give away reached off then people will vote for yes\nWhat because they couldn't here here's the thing they couldn't slow the role\nBecause if you talked about right now if the conversation or if it you know imagine I think you said earlier or you know if this had not happened because they're focusing on health care right now uh but uh the Democrats and hopes of you know gaining some votes\nHad the cabinet thing not happened just imagine that they didn't go full on a a\nMedicare for all uh the guaranteed income and everything they just focused on the one thing which would be what\nSingle pay if they\nFocus just on single hey\nCould they get people's attention to think about where we are politically right now with health care [noise] we've set for a long time\nTrump because he talks about before he became president single payer and entertaining that thought could they have started the discussion on\nThat and made it an issue [noise]\n\nShe's read

eye\nOf welcome and a good morning as we end of the mid term and then the midterms over we're just we're just projecting out what will happen for the the twenty twenty election and what's already happening with Cory Booker coming out now with his new opportunity a bonds which is the fact that the you know giving\nA uh every baby born in America a thousand dollars and then\nTo the pores two thousand dollars a year up to age Eighteen and then the uh the poorest in the country would get up to fifty thousand dollars and then depending on your on your a level of your family level of of income anywhere between\nUh just that one thousand dollars you know initially this will be sixteen hundred dollars all the way up to fifty thousand dollars a that along with ... and her guaranteed income for people that would be at least a I think a six thousand dollars would be\nThe maximum of where that level is at along with Medicare for all which would which would be all\nOf your medical bills paid for for every body for everything no deductible\nAnd also free college and so that's where the Democrats are are are are going without question for twenty twenty and we're still a long way out because now one's going to have to leap frog over another to say no we're going to get more and we're going to get more and we're still two years out who knows what to look a look\nLike I didn't think we'd be this far I'd yeah I didn't either by that I wanted twenty these these brands will probably grow [laughter] in terms of the political promise behind them but they were offering these plants should be viewed as a right wing conservative and have seen month\nWell because I mean think about it um you do have to offer more and more as we go along right I mean that that has to be in terms of the political promise of the the free stuff has to be you know more and more\nAre we broke it down earlier on the you know before on the nearly fifty K.\nAh that ah that that the poorest of children by the time they're Eighteen would have in this account and the and the treasury well the problem with that is that you know you're talking about a political promise right you're talking about something that's going to happen in the future\nSo by the time that it actually started began you know in twenty twenty two if Cory Booker too\nWas to become president right I'm not only with the you know the breakdown of you know they won't be enough\nBut the timeline will be wrong because well wait a minute I just I just\nMy my child's already born my child's Thirteen is my child going to get something my child just started college and I just spent a lot of money raising my ... my child going to get C B pro rated right while because you can talk about paying off the college loan right years later\nI mean even the Obamas had college loans when they went into the White House we're told but if if because that's something you could\nHandle it if you did the political promise I'm just talking about promising something I'm I'm Talking I'm not talking about funding it or the reality of it I'm Talking about what I'm Talking about the\nThe the the reality of a political promise connecting with someone motivating them enough to vote for them\nThat's all that is that that's that's the only thing in this equation because you think about it or wait a minute a you know a a Casio courthouses is promising or Kamala Harris is promising me this on the living wage right okay that's that says or or cash records has the same ah will ah will will pay for college\nWhich would include your college you're existing college loan or in some cases right will pay off your college mom um\nThose are those can be retroactive or can be a future promise for people who are voting now not only if you're talking about the you know the people who might vote Democrat or or might be in the center are being independent and look at this idea and go well well well that could work\nOr does it really effectively work with their particular situation and then on top of that or does that interests me is if I'm really thinking about a generation who's having fewer\nKids there's the book or plan even resonate with them ... kids I I Know what about me\nI'm not I don't I'm not worried about my children because I don't really plan on having a family I'm giving my children the debt well yeah [laughter] thing is I'm not going to have kids because it's too expensive even when you're fifty thousand dollar plan enough it's not enough so I'm not I have oh wait a minute by\nThe thousand dollars doesn't help with raising my child now that's what I Need to ... dollars a year that exact and help with raising my child now that's\nBecause the idea is that we have you know we have too many kids in these poor families that by the time they're Eighteen they're\nA disadvantage because they can't afford college were home and all this all these items\nWell no no no no no no you're you're not you're not trying to get the future vote of those kids who haven't been born yet you're trying to get there but you know would be parents votes right now and they're thinking to themselves well no I've got a number of reasons why I don't want to have a family 'cause I Can't afford it\nYou're not given ... so it's never going to be\nSo now I'm so Camilla Harris gets my vote because she's promised me six thousand dollars if she gets a lot and have it with my kid exact I Want and six thousand now\nAnd or Bernie gives me or maybe Kamala Harris comes adds onto it and says free college for everybody and she gets my vote too because she's going to include existing college loans and of course free healthcare yes Medicare to right yeah\nSo the what you can get me no ... or ... my kid you're fifty thousand I Know I'm not having kids ... thousand Eighteen years from now no and and my kid gets it I don't get it ... no no I'd rather get the six thousand dollars now\nAll the ways that will give me ... will know give me the six to ... don't get me six thousand dollars give me Fifteen thousand dollars to raise my kids now right instead of the fifty thousand dollars at my kid could use down the road right no I Want it now and give me an now\nGimme gimme gimme gimme exactly beginning that then you're not trying to get the vote of the the baby that's yet to be born you're trying to get the adult vote they don't care about the future they care about now\nSee they're not thinking we're ... we're trying to tell them Gary we can do the strategy for I don't know a couple of million apiece they're just not thinking you're either not going big enough or you're not going direct enough\nLet's go to William in Virginia William welcome you're on ... Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nHey great show that I think I Will say that was thinking about how when you take out their cash that bombed out by that time that that will be so high that that you'll end up getting only twenty five percent of that\nNow and then we'll be right but I Would say right [laughter] yeah [laughter] there you go we're going to like ... when we when we when we started with the program\nWe weren't going to tax it but it hadn't years into what we realized that everybody eight years from now yes everybody eight years from now will be taxed on it right and therefore", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Charleston", "day": "23"}
