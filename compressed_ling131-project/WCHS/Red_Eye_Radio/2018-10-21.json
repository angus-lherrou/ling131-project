two other program called Mars and yes we are talking about going to the red planet the president of the United states has made it official last November the president said that a we're going to go back\nTo the moon in fact starting next year in the end of next year the U.S all as booster rocket is going to take a trial run around the moon\nWe're going back to the moon and then after that to Mars and then the on to the asteroids maybe tightened who knows maybe to the stars but we're just today is Dr ...\nAnd you walk with who's going to walk us through the steps\nOf what it would be like to be on Mars and then one day our descendants\nMay one day visit the stars she's in a stronger ... planetarium she got her bachelor's from Johns Hopkins University in physics in a PHD from the University of Washington She's also studied to Berkeley and a Princeton and know she'll be on the national geographic dog huge drama\nWell let's see I don't know where we lost most often we are talking about going to Mars and let's see now we are on the red line of what is it like what's the weather or life on Mars what would it be like to to roam across the surface of the red planet\nWell you know I think it's a funny thing about living on Mars that the weather is whatever you make it so\nMars of course has its own whether it's known of course for these very high wins and these huge global dust storms that covered the planet I'm most notably earlier this year a blogging out the opportunity rover\nI'm from view so we have a fair amount of data from our spacecraft on what the weather is like on Mars\nBut for human beings um you know Mars is not a very hospitable environment for us so if we weren't going to live there or walk around on the surface we'd have to live in some kind of habitat and that might mean\nYou know building dome is on the surface it might mean actually building habitats under the surface into existing lava tubes\nAnd we would be able to tune the environment I to be really whatever we want it so you know that means that uh you have your perfect climate controlled environment ideally anyway\nBut if you want it to go for a walk you would definitely have to have the protection of a spacesuit\nSo again probably better than being exposed to the elements on Mars um\nBut also you know I think I'm as earthlings we get used to certain things like having the experience of a breeze or the feeling of sunshine on our space so while it would be a fantastic experience from the standpoint of you know you'd be walking around on an alien world\nUm you know and then when you were home you'd have whatever your perfect climate control is you'd also miss out on that experience of just being out in the wilderness um so it would be definitely\nA pretty different I think for human beings who are so used to experiencing their environment and these subtle ways\nOkay well he learned Musk the billionaire\nAs ambitious plans to eventually put up to a million just is a million columnist on the red planet starting by gradually melting the polar ice cap so once again Mars would have water liquid water\nFreely flowing to the ancient riverbeds dried up about three billion years ago [noise]\nSo uh well what are your thoughts you think it's possible though one day we might be able to tamper with the atmosphere of Mars given the fact that it is so cold there but given the fact that to live on Mars we may eventually have to turn for Mars like we are to reform the earth right now but what are your thoughts\nHey everyone proactive MD have an

radio\n\nSo I Am [noise]\nMichio on the day we're talking about the planet Mars we're entering season two of our National Geographic special ducking drama about the planet Mars on one headed has professional actors and actresses portraying astronaut says they land on Mars and then\nBegin to colonize that planning and then they also have\nScientists to appear in the program Lucy and and myself both appear in the ... drama and once again Lucy and walk with our guest today she got her bachelor's in physics from Johns Hopkins university\nMasters in a PHD from the University of Washington She's also stayed at Berkeley and at Princeton University and currently she's an astronomer at the Adler Planetarium specializing in Stiller magnetic activity so we'll also talk about extra solar planets in outer space\nWhat many people think that the key buzz word for going to Mars is self sufficiency that is having a colony that is self sufficient grows his own food\nUh melts its own water for drinking purposes and creating a rocket fuel solace yeah and first of all did you see the movie the Martians starring Matt Damon where it was a poor as an artist and Rona dozens of Mars with no resources hardly at all did you see that movie\n[noise] probably much to Andy whereas I'm great joy I read the book and I didn't see the\nMovie [laughter] some better on\n'em I absolutely love the book the marsh and I thought it was really creative and I you know that ... character is so really to um he's kind of you know despite the fact that he's an astronaut right he seemed like kind of every person on Mars or in some sticky situation where you're really trying to figure things out\nUm so I I really loved the book I still have to see the movie though [laughter]\n[laughter] okay well in the movie a poor Matt Damon is stranded was hardly any resources resources that are only lasted him a few days and he would perish on the sins of Mars food water even the simple basic necessities are\nAre watching on Mars but using the fact that he is an engineer and a scientist he's able to well uses only human waste to create fertilizer to grow crops he's able to initiate a chemical reaction\nTo create enough life giving chemicals we can breed and and cultivate a small farm and use gigantic solar panels to get energy and believe it or not he makes a trip back to the planet earth an amazing amazing trip\nBut what are your thoughts given the fact that the astronauts are not like the pioneers who had access to food\nAnd water and air when they colonize the United states given the fact that Mars has no trees has no agriculture has no liquid water or what are your thoughts about the challenges facing asking us as they try to become self sustaining on the red planet\nWell I think for any kind of near term Mars exploration people would be very dependent on earth still you know I think that the goal ultimately would be self sufficiently self sufficiency particularly if he wanted to have people living there\nFor a long period of time just because you know as we discussed earlier it takes a long time to go to Mars and that's true whether\nYou're a human or whether you're a cargo ship that just has like the re supplies\nAnd the history of Mars exploration also told us that not every mission to Mars succeeds you know we've had plenty of space craft that have been lost or that have failed and so you really don't want to take chances like that with\nSomething like the food supply so having some measure of self sufficiency even if you are still\nExpecting ... earth is always something that has a really really good idea now\nCertain things like in the Martian for example um [noise] that idea of using human waste to fertilize on like grow your potatoes and\nTo have to take another short commercial break but African\nThey were going to talk about extra solar planets planets even beyond our solar system once again a special guest is Dr Lucy and walk away than you are

three five and when you hear the recording lead your name the call letters to the radio station you're listening to if you're listening to one\nAnd the city you're calling from and then asked that question may say Carmen and maybe you can have your question hurt on over a almost a hundred radio station that carries science fantastic and once again with us today is Dr ... the Adler Planetarium in Chicago\nYou know with life gets started early and build technology and things like spaceships and then where is everybody um but you know I think that\n... as far as like searching for extraterrestrial intelligence goes that's really been like a pretty small effort in astronomy um you know a very dedicated effort but it's been considered so fringe eat that for a really long time\nUm it hasn't received very much attention or funding and so the fact that we haven't found anything yet doesn't mean that it's not out there it just means that we surveyed as Jill Tarter likes to say a glass of water\nCompared with the volume of the earth's oceans as far as the space that we can study goes so you know I certainly think that um you know I Hope that there's life out there as far as worrying whether it would have bad intentions or not\nYou know I read this cycle analyzing a T I think we don't really know what and other intelligence would want them or would be able to offer a you know sure maybe they would want our resources but maybe also the reasons that they're able to travel through\nSpace and time on long distances is because they've solved disease I'm you know maybe they have to care for cancer so I think that there could be potentially um wonderful benefits as well and\nYou know I'm a scientist if I don't know something I Want to figure it out I'm so even if the outcome is kinda bad I still want to figure it out [laughter]\nOkay well let me tell you my thoughts on the question of the Fermi paradox as to why don't the land of the White House lawn and advertise their existence I mean why are they so shy my personal attitude is that when you walk in the forest and you meet the squirrels and the deer\nDo you engage in a conversation with them well may be a first you do but eventually you get bored because the squirrels and the deer they don't talk back to you have nothing to offer you and it seems to me that if they can reach the earth from outer space from thousands of light years\nThere perhaps thousands millions of years ahead of us in technology now what do we have to offer them I mean think about what do we as a civilization has to offer them which squirrels\nHave to offer humans eventually we will lose interest and simply leave them alone now that's my opinion but what are your thoughts on this question\n[laughter] well you know I I wrote an essay awhile ago um for Scientific American called ... dolphins dream of space travel and I'm In that I talk about the fact that it's possible that life in the universe in general maybe exists under water if oceans are common um\nAnd you know my background is studying how the radiation from stars effect planet so its surface is a planet generally speaking are very irradiated then maybe a safe place to be is a notion and maybe\nThe main form of intelligence out there is something more like whale\nSo you know would whales necessarily want to go and explore space maybe I mean we human land dwellers to explore our deep oceans to 'em\nBut you know I think that and wanting to travel across space is definitely something that you have to decide as a as a species that you would you want to do um just because it involves a lot of resources so we don't know um whether that's something that uh\nThat space whales might want to do with so maybe uh maybe the intelligence that's out there is more like those squirrels and\nDeer and even higher species like a dolphins whales than than like us so we don't know\nAnd speaking about whales or in my book and future of humanity I speculate about the fact\nThat Mars and of course is interesting but Europa and selling us there are a lot of moons of gas giants out they're much more than Mars like planets and they may have liquid water oceans underneath the ice cover not to mention that there are real planets planets without stars and\nThey would have moons and you don't need a son to generate energy to create to live under the ocean\nSo one possibility is that life throughout the universe is mainly aquatic\nAnd that we are the exception but the changes um and some of those Europa and the ... gas giants having liquid oceans is incredibly high compared to plan is like the earth which is in the Goldilocks zone\nSo what are your thoughts do you think that perhaps throughout the universe aquatic life could out number a ordinary terrestrial life forms like us\nI think that's absolutely a possibility you know there's a lot of great things about being in a notion um that's why life here got started in an ocean right it protects you it means you have a you know other food sources sort of floating around you\nAnd as you point out it means that you don't necessarily need the warmth of a sudden you know in a place like Europa Jupiter's gravity meat that and provide that extra warmth um from what we call tidal heating and so you know maybe\nOur in our ... we have run out of time in science and dust but Lucy and thank you so much thank you so much for being on science fantastic Oh thank you absolutely my pleasure that once again a special guest today with Dr Lucien ... of the Adler Planetarium\nAnd what happens and

E. R. K. E. Y.\n\nBrought you buy a car [noise] diet than to get back to science thing with the president Michio Kaku before the break we had a question that the universe is expanding and what is it expanding into well\nOur universe is a bubble of some sort so we don't know exactly the details of the bowls but we live on the skin of the bubble and the bubbles expanding so ticket balloon put dot sign it representing the stars and the galaxies and the balloon is expanding\nAnd what is it expanding into well the skin the surface of the balloon represents the universe\nAnd therefore what is off the balloon where does off to the moon is the third dimension now if you're a bug living on the surface of the balloon you can only see two dimensions but we're backward left and right\nBecause the balloon is the universe the moon is everything there is now where is the universe or the bubble or the balloon expanding into it's expanding due to the third dimension now that the bugs cannot see the third dimension the bugs I can only see two dimensions\nBut is expanding into the third dimension the third dimension of space now Einstein says our universe is a four dimensional bubble so what is it expanding into the fifth dimension\nNow you can see the ... mentioned just like bugs cannot see off the balloon\nBut that's what the universe seems to be expanding into another theory wish explains is called string theory or string theory has not been verified now the expanding universe theory of course had been verified it every time we look at the galaxies in outer space\nShake theory has not been verified drinks every actually predicts that the universe is expanding into eleven\nDimensions not just for not just five but eleven dimensions and so think of a bubble bath of universes so our universe is a bubble and is floating among other bubbles out there\nNow this explains I think a resolution between two of the great paradigms of religion in the Christian religion we have genesis in Buddhism we have nerve Anna\nNow my parents were Buddhist and Buddhism there is no beginning there is no end there's only ... states have consciousness called nerve ana\nBut I was raised as a Presbyterian has a child\nAnd every Sunday I went to Sunday school and I learned about genesis and the fact that the universe had a beginning and instant\nWin gods said let there be life so how can you reconcile these opposite point of view to totally opposite points of view one in which there is no beginning only states some consciousness no beginning no end\nAnd the other one being a definite point whether the universe began well the multi immerse idea coming out of string theory explains it\nBecause you see our universe our bubble had an orange and it had a big bang there was a moment when the universe came into existence but there are other bubbles up there\nAnd what is it expanding into nerve and or something the on the bubble nerve Anna that is eleven and mentioned all hyper space and so string theory says basically that all the particles are nothing but vibrations on a tiny tiny little vibrating strings\nThat physics is the laws of harmony the string\nThat chemistry is the metal knees you can play on these vibrating strings the universe is a symphony of strings and the mind of God that Einstein wrote about in in his letters in his memoirs\nCharleston business reigning power by Bloomberg is on Ninety five twenty three and six eighty that when you can't be part of the ... the age has needed for Business Network\nIt's YES Network dot com I mean the plane I

come in and before the break what happens when you fall into a black hole\nHow is it possible that you as you fall into a black hole you die almost instantly but someone from the outside far away looking at you with a telescope will see that you are frozen in time paralyzed and it takes thousands of years for you to fall into a black hole how does that work well\nFirst of all falling into a black hole is not very pleasant many bad things happen to you among them ... and it turns out that your feet or a ... a black hole a little bit faster than your head and so you are stretched as a consequence by tidal forces and you look like a noodle\nRecall the spaghetti vacation and so one of the horrible facts about you falling into a black hole is you become a noodle of spaghetti as you get into a black hole\nIt even closer to the that horizon of a black hole even the noodles begins to fall apart and the Adams the very Adams of your body becomes noodles and they get ripped apart\nAnd you basically turned into kinds of the dust and spaghetti as you fall into a black hole not very pleasant\nWell the way Einstein looked at it is that kind of ease at different rates at different points in the universe so think of putting a clock at every point in your room\nOkay so every point in your room this o'clock thousands of clocks right in your room Einstein says that they don't necessarily need at the same rate\nSome clocks can be faster than other clocks for example on the moon o'clock on the moon beats faster than a clock on the earth a clock on Jupiter be slower than a clock on the earth and all these things are measurable this is science fiction\nThis now speculation we measure these things in the laboratory\nAnd so the main falling into a black hole has a clock\nHis clock in a different from a clock on the outside part of the man falling into the black hole his clock says he dies almost instantly now a clock from the outside yet light from the man of falling into the black hole but that light is affected by gravity gravity polls on that light\nBeam stretching it so it turns out that you get what it's called the red shift and things talked has slowed\nDown in that light being so I like being shot from a man who is falling into a black hole that light beam is stretched called the red shift\nAnd time is also slow down because of gravity so that gravity is so intense of a black hole than it slows down time stretches a light beam and so you were looking at the men falling into a black hole you\nSee he becomes reddish he becomes like spaghetti and he's basically paralyzed\nAnd again and not very pleasant thing to happen now we've never observed is of course because of course the nearest black hole that we study regularly is at the center of the galaxy and that black hole is why something like fifty thousand light years from the earth\nAnd so we've never done this experiment but ... theory so far\nUh this is what the theory predicts and so far we have no violations of Einstein's theory of gravity let me repeat that again\nWe have no violations that all of Einstein's theory of gravity every time it comes out right on the dot as Einstein predicted a hundred years ago okay\nWell we've run out of time in this segment of science fantastic so keep the calls coming once again if you want to get on science fantastic give us

that and also elephants that you know the elephants almost rarely get cancer now sharks do get cancer and there was a a fad a few years ago that sharks don't get cancer wrong\nBut elephants they rarely get cancer and they're big lots of places to get cancer why because of the gene piece of the three that turns out that healthy PTA threes help to counteract cancer\nWe have a I think two copies of elephants have something like almost twenty copies a piece of disarray\nAnd because of that they have air correction mechanisms and they don't get cancer [noise] now the second way to become Marshall is digital immortality and that is to digitize everything known about you and eventually digitize your brain\nDigitize your credit card transactions Instagram photographs biographies videotaped everything including every single neuron inside your brain that's called the connect on projects\nAnd from that you can build a reasonable copy of you\nFor example as a hologram then you can talk to the image would be a ... near representation of who you are and every year they were getting closer and closer to the real view\nNow of course is not really that you the biological you it is a copy of you but when you die\nYour personality does not necessarily have to die I Wish you now during the middle ages we have something called ... that is you had the soul on one hand and the body on the other hand and they were separate\nThen came and the twentieth century neuro science we said bah humbug there's no soul is just neurons that's all it is up there in our brain neurons well now we're coming full circle\nNow we're going back in the middle ages because we now realize that the so called soul might be able to be represented by information by digitizing everything known about you\nSo in the library for example you'll take out a book not about Winston Churchill but you'll talk to in synch arsenal\nAll his mannerisms speeches thinking patterns are all codify and I would love the opportunity to talk to Einstein thinking about that for a moment talking to historical figures that have been digitized out one day you might be digitized as well you might forever or someplace\nAnd you'll be able to have a conversation with your great great great great great great grandkids and give them advice and vice even though you're\nMore whole body has long since disappeared now the point is that all of this is consistent with the laws of physics I had violated no law physics in mentioning the fact that yes at some point in the future\nDigital and biological immortality may become realize and then the key question is when well digital mortality as coming pretty fast already there's Silicon Valley companies offering a digital version of what is known about view today in the future you know the kind of extremely accurate\nAnd once we sequence the brain that connect on project may be able to give us a copy of the brain but a biological immortality decades away\nThat doesn't mean it's impossible but I think given the rate at which were understanding genetics and still decades away as somebody once told me our generation to generation now alive\nMay be the last generation to die\nIn other words our grandkids are grandkids may have the option of hitting the age of thirty and then\nStopping stopping and just living forever\nWell if you want to know more about the aging process and how it's going to be very important for us in the future and get a copy of my book the future of humanity and in my book I mentioned that we're not necessarily going over populated the earth as we begin to live forever look at Japan\nJapan has the oldest living ethnic group on the earth Japanese women\nThey hold the world's record and the Japanese population is collapsing when people live longer they have fewer children and that's the reason why Japan now in Europe in the future will gradually get smaller and smaller\nWhat unfortunately that sit for science

well he knows that I work on string theory which is the leading candidate for his theory of everything but he asked what about another theory\n[noise] well I'm not familiar with the theory that he mentioned however let me say this so far scientists agree that the unified field theory that is string theory seems to work is very hard to test in fact impossible to test with today's technology\nIt predicts many universes not just ours so there are criticisms of string theory but what about an alternative to my knowledge and correct me if I'm wrong\nTo my knowledge there is no alternative all the other proposals including things like Lupe point them gravity\nDo not give you a theory of everything so what is the bottom line what's the problem what is the bottom line for his theory of everything I think everything is actually quite simple it has to include two things\nJust to things and you two could claim to have a unified field theory\nFirst that has to include the standard model the standard model of the quantum theory all their quirks and all the ... and all the left on all of that has to be included in the standard model in any unified field theory is a theory of almost

program we've been discussing long term care and evaluating this risk because the biggest threat to the long term success of\nWell it's not exactly the most enjoyable conversation it is very important\nConversation to have and I want to start out now by looking at\nThe need for long term care rises\nThere are essentially for different ways that it can be paid for the very first one is looking at insurance is do you have any insurance that you put in place to help pay for some or all of the long term care needs so if that's not the case the next step is\nSo funding with your own personal asset to indoor getting assistance from family now that might be financial assistance from family and or that could also mean some degree of the care is provided by family no this is a very\nCommon occurrence oftentimes if if the insurance isn't in place the family will step in and at least initially they might help provide some of that assistance when it comes to the the physical care aspect of it now the last piece of the puzzle there in terms of how it could be paid for his medicate\nAnd we'll talk about that in a moment because a lot of people are\nHave a have a different understanding or the wrong understanding of when Medicaid might step in and what that situation looks like for them so it's first of all talk real quickly about\nSelf funding with with your own assets so if you decide you're going to be self insure you're going to pay pay this ... this need or this cost for the long term care and eat out of your own pocket\nThere are some pros to the ... the biggest pro obviously is if if you decide on the front end that you're going to self insure and pay for it out of your own pocket if you don't end up having a need\nThere is zero cost to you there is zero impact on your portfolio and you did not\nPay for insurance along the way so theoretically there's a when they're financially now the assets that you save\nBy not investing in insurance they're not paying for insurance you theoretically could turn around and invest\nAnd hopefully there would be some gain there on that pool of money and other downsides are obvious so when we're looking at evaluating pros and cons of this the downsides are obvious\nAny long term care expenses are coming directly from distributions from your financial asset so not only are you staring at a potential hit to your portfolio you're also staring at\nA potential hit to your income stream as as a family unit so especially if you have a spouse or all of a sudden if ... dollars have to be redirected towards your care their standard of living changes in a hurry now if you elect to go the self insurance route also\nAnd decide well I'm going to try to invest what I normally would have spent on insurance\nThere's obviously going to be some investment risks for that underlying portfolio in there's there are certainly going to be some difficulty in terms of managing the assets managing the payments and that's that's one of the I guess the big advantages to having insurance involved is that\nMany of the insurance programs out there will take a more active role in helping you to identify the care that you're going to need that care options that you have an ultimately setting up how it is that that care will be paid for\nSo let's transition assuming that you say you know something\nI Want to address this risk through insurance rather than through my own assets paying for for myself what are the options insurance wise so\nThere are essentially two different options you have from an insurance perspective the first is what's commonly known as traditional long term care insurance\nThis is very much akin to\nYour homeowner's insurance your automobile insurance where you specified a
