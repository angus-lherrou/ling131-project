I'm Crazy we got Donald Trump with all those personal shortcomings when the country needed him most as long ago was saying you know Providence I don't know but I wouldn't you wouldn't get any argument from me\nYesterday one and I was a strong supporter of his during the general election of course that doesn't say much either considering who he was running against right\nAnd I remember many of us thought we would be very satisfied if President Trump would just nominate conservative judges that that was enough especially for the Supreme Court we all are a lot of people I knew thought hey that would work for me that's that's enough right there and I think a lot of people across the country felt that way [noise]\nSo I thought we were way ahead of the game when he appointed a Judge Gorsuch to the U.S Supreme Court but he didn't stop there and I'll just mention some of them are things he's done a mentioned amid much bigger list last night ending the bomb a care mandate\nOpening up the Keystone Pipeline remember Obama wouldn't do it and I n war reserves and in countless regulations hurting the economy and the proof is how well the economy is doing\nA significant tax cut lowering our taxes and simplifying the tax forms by the way it was ... and the same one I mentioned who years before his time say we should be able to fill out or a tax returns on a postcard and then everybody copied them years later and ah that that is eventually the where they want to go with us\nMoving of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem getting us out of the Paris Peace accords withdrawing from the disastrous Iranian deal I didn't talk much about that last night can imagine we paid them hundreds of billions of dollars under fifty billion under Obama that gave them secret cash in a plane which he denied\nPay them off for what they're our biggest enemy do you do you feel like I Do that you live that I live on a different planet I mean ... of our biggest enemies or at least the ones killing our soldiers right now we give them money to eat them to hurt us and hurt our people that alone I mean\nIs incredible eight six six nine to read and I want to know what you think about the Iranian deal is incredible eight six six same number nine o seven\nThree thirty nine meeting with Kim all young to possibly reduce the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula getting American remains returned from North Korea making sure our borders mean something I admit that hasn't been solved yet\nWe're gonna talk we didn't last night about the the ... people from Honduras up to request asylum that's going to be a winning a situation for him to deal with and I'm saying that obviously sarcastically\nAppointing countless conservative justices lower courts now right\nYou watch federal judges and ah you know the ninth district which is a crazy district or gets overturned the most saying things like a you know he Trump kept the president can't do is they can't do that as a Muslim ban and all this kind of stuff and they've taken power and their own hands well support and then he points these lower court judge a federal judges to\nAnd of course the naming now of a second Supreme Court choice another conservative Brett Kavanaugh the list goes on and on\nAnd the American people love that he's not politically correct\nThe American people are tired of all those politicians who spin and spin and spin and are afraid to see what they're really thinking so maybe he does too much but at least you you get people love his honesty or at least he says what he means you can never say\nThat about President Trump that he doesn't say what he means he may say to watch but he never says two little I came up with that when he was one of the most conservative presidents in my lifetime he's done a great job and most the American people get it\nBut it doesn't matter to the left or to Democrats or the comrades in the media\nI'm afraid to tell the left the Democrats and liberal listeners on the call and they let me know what you think and I said last night I bet asleep softly\nIf the presidential election were held today President Trump would easily be reelected\nHe's kept most of his promises and the American people appreciate that and he is resonating with the American people more than ever\nAnd I don't know if you feel the same way I think each day is becoming more and more presidential he's growing into the job if you remember Harry Truman to replace the FDR and people said often I teach government history too so I Know some of the stuff and they said oh he's going to be awful terrible but they said Truman grew into the job also\nYou're dreaming by the way if you think he's going to be defeated I just wanted to tell you guys out there and the other side you will fail to get rid of him but not from lack of trying you started the day he won that is so obvious now\nActually we can hold they started the resistance against them much before election day but it was election day can they couldn't believe that this ... so called bumbling fools had one\nRight he was so bumbling but he's still one right no matter what the upper lead or of the FBI and the Justice Department may have guaranteed right where we've seen the text between page and struck and all that stuff\nHe won I don't know about you but I was teaching in that time at night and I was almost in tears when I heard he won Pennsylvania which was always seems to me like Republicans fools goal you know we're going to wait at this time going to win Pennsylvania we got it down\nAnd not only did he win but despite their best efforts he won he still here and he's going to be here for six and a half more years no matter the Mahler persecution I okay\nProsecutors so persecution to me no matter the hostile media media no matter the never Trump hers which I can never understand them no matter all the elites and the swamp President Trump is still here\nWhich never should have happened according to them and despite their best efforts to destroy him including getting a special prosecutor appointed I fault attorney general sessions for that I'm going to talk about that more later he should never have recused himself he played into the Democrats hands\nPoliticians typically talked our adversaries that's not a big deal and toss them many of talk to the Russians including a bomb and you remember Obama promising off Mike the things would be better when he got re elected not to get you know make more stuff happened\nI've been a big supporter sessions when he was a senator but I'm disappointed in his jobs attorney general and disappointed his lack of oversight Rosenstiel but more of that later\nSessions should have made amends by fire Rosenstein especially if he threatened to congressional staffers did you hear that he threatened them as they help their bosses conduct oversight and justice disappointed by the way is the new FBI direct to almost nonchalant attitude about corruption in his agency that amazes me\nThis is all gotten way out of hand and it was clear to many people by now that Mueller's investigation is a witch hunt in search of a crime\nIf anything there was a soft coup to get rid of President Trump perpetrated by the highest ... or our government at the Justice Department and at the FBI and I'm not sure until all the dust settles was my prediction if we won't find President Obama's fingerprints all over the you wait and see\nWe're we're never supposed to find out about the subterfuge because Hillary was supposed to win\nWriter champagne or celebration I was a big boats the celebration is supposed to happen in New York City there were waiting for her match the only one thing it never happened Donald Trump crashed that party and they're never going to forgive him for that\nAnd all of it would have been swept under the rug but she didn't win and that's where this tyranny and this resistance started if not sooner\nThe swamp must be drained by President Trump and this must never be allowed to happen again\nIt's time to free President Trump from this distraction I Want to know you think it's time to free the American people from this distraction\nIt is time to free all the defendant smaller so far named in this witch hunt like Michael Flynn that never should have happened he didn't even know he was being under investigation I don't think of the time it's all part of the resistance and Scott and\nLet me tell ya and I I Want to go on but I Want to get your calls what I thought about President Obama we never did what these people did so let me know what

now but anyways is a great program and I try to stay up to catch it\nHere in us you know ... or ... the thing that I I Wonder is that you know you see people like Hillary Clinton of all people are\n... come on television talk about civility and you add briefly touched on civility I Believe yes yesterday's progress\n... was so amazing and these people by now you have to be ... ... they think that we're nothing but a budget blind mice ... horrible and then when the truth of the matter is there's nothing to that at all that could be further from the truth\nThat shows the matter is that and I wonder why people like Hillary Clinton and and that all the so called a ... bad actors that they refer to know why they haven't been handed out subpoenas and why haven't they got to the judicial process the justice system\nAnd I have to wonder that\nWell the white talk about later probably well I'm very disappointed and Jeff Sessions he showed no guts no no I'm a ... for us what am I thinking of you know he's been so weak in in his position\nHe I was for him when he was named them but I've been very disappointed in him and by the way just to your point about Hillary civility they eat\nAnd the very I was thinking about this when you were talking the secret service they treated horribly who who who give their life up\nFor them or she is and care what what you did the\nYeah and then you take a look at Joe Biden you know swimming naked in the pool and and and so on and so forth these people they they're beyond the word despicable wars Hillary puts it a deplorable a you know it it it it's you have to be\nTotally blind\nOr just totally ignorant of the fact that you I mean just look at the facts and look up out of this country is falling in eight years we had we had a leader of previous presidents so called president take this country down and I believe you set the racial relations and in our country back fifty years\nI I don't know the number of years a peep but I agree with you totally I mean saying if I had a son the Trayvon Martin whenever he looked like me are always assuming that you know that and what was the guy's name and the other state I can you know hands up don't shoot all of a sudden I got to be believed\nYeah Michael Michael and he\nSent it back in a lot of people who voted for him because he was black thinking he was going to show we're not ... and so on and yet he he uh ... you're right it's worse now ... animosity in this country is is worse since he was president\nAnd you know the the most disgusting part of the Michael Brown in Ferguson was a simple fact that if you look back and look at the history of ... as the events happened as everything went down\nIt walked into as I recall to convene a convenience store he pushed the owner around as a store or the Senate and the store knocked the attendance down walked out with a budget goodies and then one on down the middle of the street looking for trouble the guy was wired for sound so\nIn some of minority it only as yet or minority leader\nSays that said it was the way the police officers simply look you are right on all counts and rubber Obama what was that I don't know how many days before the election said we're going to fundamentally change this country I I I have a friend on radio who said measure of you sent your wife when we get married I'm going to fundamentally change you\nKnow it's it's it's insane and this was the guy we ... and the president\nAnd at the end of the day as far as the Ferguson is so that\nIt didn't take very a lot for them to ... to ... to respond and I'm I'm Talking about a ... a Eric Holder and Jesse Jackson and\nAl Charlotte and it didn't take a ... was it a matter of a day or two and they ran to Ferguson to to to to to stir up the eight and discontent as usual and you know the what the amazing part of it was as they grow that Michael Brown and got into the the officers patrol car to retrieve the officers gun just showed him\nYou know you have a glass of water\nSo so exactly but but so where so where are we as a country now the racial racial division in this country is a credible and it needs to stop\nBut they kept talking and driving home all this crap as nothing more than a damn smokescreen to make us look at the next issue that pops up and whether we like it or not the mainstream lame stream media is running this country\nAnd

checked your trend that check your treadmill ups particularly on dual will positions where\nTires or bolted together and essentially forced\nTo rotate down the road at the same speed because for two dollars in your local truck stop you can find a ... gauge anything beyond one eighth of an inch difference or\nCalmly refer to as for thirty seconds from the tire industry between do positions can really add to rolling resistance not only does it add the rolling resistance it tears up your tires faster\nIn in a lot of cases it's a similar condition in terms of a fuel economy as having maybe a break tracking that may be a tidbit out there for the listeners to really key in on because mismatched trend ups on dual can really add rolling resistance\nThis has been the marriage or drive a report

composite sketches demand Trump accused Clifford in April tweet of a total con job concerning uh non existent man\nAnd one of the court decide they reason with Mr Trump's argument because the tweeting question constitutes rhetorical hyperbole normally associated with politics so\nThey lost and ... has been losing late which of course he says will appeal the dismissals a defamation cause of action and are confident in a reversal\nThere's I Love this cold listen to this quote there's something really rich in Trump or lying in the first amendment to justify defame Ming a woman no it's\nReally rich when you talk about defamation after what you and your client did the judge Kavanaugh don't you love\nIt when histories upside down anyway the judge award a Trump reasonable attorneys' fees also\nAnd his lawyers and no amount of spin or commentary by Stormy Daniels or her lawyer ... can't truthfully characterized that he's really in any way other than total victory for President Trump in total defeat for Stormy Daniels and he didn't add\nUp her lawyer boy when I Love to see him get the Democratic nomination for president maybe we'll do that tomorrow ask you who you prefer to get the nomination but here's someone who disagrees with me let's see if I can find them again yeah Robin Boise idaho Rob you're on with mark\nElse go they took my call I'm just happy to instill some common sense of the show uh I I think\nTrump is absolutely abhorrent a I got a laundry list I won't go kill 'em all but the the barbaric handling of immigrant children disgusting um there is at Youtube videos like seeing and believe me believe you don't believe me it's been taking you to\nHave a talk show years ago I Believe it was a David Letterman or you said in a slug arrogant way I'm very very intelligent so of course I'm an atheist or he's got a Christian\nOr can you hold hold on I Want to just I'll give you a chance what you said something that hit me right away so the barbaric treatment of immigrant children first of all they're not immigrant children they're illegal immigrant children\nOr let's call them the way it is and I don't know what's bought whites barbaric to say that you have certain rules and laws and ways of getting in a country and if you don't come in that way\nThan we can't accept you what's barbaric maybe is the parents bringing the children here they're responsible for the families being a separate and broken up so I don't think he's being barbaric you would probably call me barbaric\nJust 'cause I Want some rules and I want some uh procedures in terms of sovereignty wise that barbaric\nI don't care what the children belong to the handling was barbaric and if it was your child you'd be singing a different feeling you\nKnow no no no no you don't get to go on you don't run around you know no you don't get to go on if you don't give me a chance when you say something so absurd if it was my first time wouldn't bring my child up here if I knew that can be separated from me\nI Would do in the first place so don't tell me what I Would do I'll give you your chance but don't try to read my motivation on my mind these people I don't blame them from trying to get away from terrible conditions but there are rules and there are procedures\nAnd it's not barbaric to say if you do that we we have certain laws and rules and procedures how we handle this go your turn\nExplain our federal judge a put a stop to it it is barbaric whether you want to say it or not the way they handled it not let's just do it\nYeah in the first place separating the show around here with that but if you want to go with the separation being warranted it's the way they they ... they say half bought\nHandled it let's just say for instance the real quick I took like Chuck E. cheese recently I had a bracelet that said one two three for example that my child at a bright so said one two three\nThat way when I was able to leave their verified the bracelets that was it was on my way they could have done something similar but they didn't do anything she got\nChildren at all really it was first of all it was done and a half but way\nWhen it first of all it's an unelected judges so you were trying to prove something by the judges if the judge yet he knows what's best than what's best for the country and what's best for the rest of us he never got elected to anything but leaving that aside\nThe parents shouldn't be bringing these that's what I Do what you said you would do the same thing if we ... no I wouldn't bring my child up if I knew they could be separated from me and and once knowing that I I just wouldn't do it in the first place they're the ones who were there and give us yeah\nIt is I understood the air if you were taken those routes or that route and your child was was ripped from you and and and taken from the border and putting some concentration camp a dog kennel\nIn ... if you're ... you would be very well you're giving\nYour giving you you're just giving an awful name to what happened to the Jews and others were putting concentration camps these will not concentration camps they weren't close to\n... have you seen the footage where they were they were visited they were not humane due to uh to house children\nYeah well I I didn't know that that's not my impression\nOf the ... one point one point I have on a total number ... okay I'm going to give you some more time it was\nOkay praise there was a ... there was a a a press briefing had recently okay we're seven minutes and thirty four seconds long he said the word Barry twenty five times or you might be like why are you bringing us up he talks like a used car salesman\nIf you listen to his speeches everything is very very very very\nThat some way to the hard way that you see I'm I'm I'm a teacher\nI'm a teacher and I have I think I'm pretty good ... I don't care if he has a queen's English the king's English sorry\nI I don't care about that I care about what he does you're picking them saying very twenty six times you sound like all the elite is you're putting them down because you're so much more fish are well here's my point that doesn't movies is Charles ... because he says very twenty five times it proves he has a problem maybe with the language he doesn't speak as well as you do\nWhen we go by used car the demand doesn't say it gets decent ... or a gas mileage it gets very good he speaks in most ways very an awesome and great to\nSee a pattern of each power sharing it so now you're putting\nDown used car salesman they provide them valuable function I ... I Wonder what you'd be like if you were you picked on me what if your daughter was a used car sales person I mean what are you saying you're picking on them because of his language because he didn't go he didn't go to Harvard or something what are you saying\nShe had it and how\nShe thought maybe you yeah sheep chickens Fox News he didn't go back with Steve ... a ... interview uh Brian Kevin she ... they showed the video and I'm a truck driver so I Can't watch it all the time because I'm On my work I work right now\nAh I worked in a early morning shift to the morning but I'm saying I'm telling you right now I Believe in what the president's don't that's why I voted for him I don't think he's a racist at all as a matter of fact as a black man uh I remember\nIt was about maybe like Fifteen sixteen years ago in double ACP gave him an award how come they did you hear all these other people calling him a racist but how come you don't hear them speaking up than he is\nBut they won't even defend them either because if it's convenient I think for people to just put a label on people without any proof\nThat's right you know ... it's just\nIt's just it's just ridiculous and uh he has done more for this country the last president didn't in eight years and I'm the I'm going to tell you right straight out Obama was the worst president ever\nAnd you'll be surprised may not want to ... or you\nMay be surprised to know you haven't heard me because I've been on a number of years but until recently not back on this network\nA I feel the same way I think President Obama is the worst presidents we've had in our history certainly in my lifetime he did more damage and he started by apologizing for the greatest country in the history of the world he was ... going on our apology tour\nUh I I agree are examining ... and\n... and that one before Saudi king and ... which is ridiculous I'm lying but I I like what Trump you alluded to in his speech a couple of weeks ago a and the un I well I got out of this speech was one of the things he didn't exactly say what what I took from it\nWhen you say it's going to make America great again he was letting people know why don't you make your country great again and make it a place that people wouldn't want to leave\nYou know the what about that\nWhat we've done that works so well right free enterprise little regulation limited government why don't you try that for a while the guys and see how it works in your country I'd\nExactly and ... and ... again going and going back to the immigration boy that guy said the ... the kids were treated those policy was put in place long before Trump became president\nThat's right and as a matter of fact\nA lot of those are the love those kids coming across there there may may not even be those kids up a so called adult children they clap somebody a walk across we saw it on the videos was with a somewhat of a you know people from Syria were just picking kids up\nWalking across the border to get into some of these places and then they didn't belong to them so you don't know who these people are\nAnd in Mexico as a matter of fact treats the people that come across the board is illegal beef from Honduras El Salvador Nicaragua and Guatemala they treat them like garbage\nAnd they're very harsh than I Am so hey that's all we Gerald we yeah\nWe we got to go but thank you
