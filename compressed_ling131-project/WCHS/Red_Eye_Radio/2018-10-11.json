Seventy five on our sustained ... wins\nSo that puts a data category one just just barely a and and we're expecting you and I talking during the a crucial meeting and you were saying you expect a and I think most do or that the next report which comes up here and I'm In uh in forty five minutes or we could see that downgraded to a tropical storm\nAre still very dangerous uh you know if you think about uh the the uh a hurricane heard sustained winds of Seventy five miles an hour while they're not what the ... the storm isn't what it was in terms of its power is still dumping a lot of rain and then of course those winds are still damaging\nSo uh we'll get the latest from Tom hale and John trout along the way coming up here and just\nWe have an election coming up here in just a little under four weeks yeah um yeah breaking news uh and\nUh some of the polls out there some of the uh interesting a poll numbers up in the New York times yeah yesterday right well we'll get to that look at the CBS headline ... also coming up here on the show prominent Democrats or reject taking the high road and as a viable political strategy that is yeah you know that's after Hillary Clinton\nAnd uh uh and then the more I got my like Cory Booker or none of the former attorney general\nOh I'm a I've got Eric Holder oh Eric Holder yeah coming out and saying if they go low kick them yeah ah and\n... and we you know said this yesterday and the day before a in a while we said the day before it looks like they're heading in that direction and yesterday was obvious that that's the direction that the mainstream now\nOf the Democratic party holds is that we're going to be it's going to be instability it's going to be mop like tactics\nOr is going to be getting in your face wherever you are ... it's going to be getting that on camera mhm uh in order to uh to do it and then ah you when you had Eric Holder going to the point of saying take them\nThat was really the first statement of using physical force against your political enemies they seemed to have no shame and that this is coming from not the fringe\nAs as recently as even a month ago remember we had to call and somebody called up and said well not all Democrats are like that and we said well your party is\nYour party and that this was really basically going to where the party is being controlled by the left ... uh but now when it comes to instability and getting in people's faces and wanting to film it\nAnd and getting to the point of terrorizing people with a with a mob yeah how about a mob terrorizing people matter where they are\nThat has now become a mainstream mindset of the Democrats if you're a Democrat\nYou know that this isn't again when CBS writes it\n\nYou know that even in the media are saying well what are they doing here which is strategy right Hillary Clinton coming out and saying it Eric Holder coming out and and and and saying it and so here we go I'm\nRand Paul and his wife taking on a Cory Booker for his for his previous statements ... and I still have not heard one or maybe you may have heard it one of the debates if they asked one of the senatorial debates I don't know I didn't see that but I haven't seen\nIn any major publication where you have had I haven't seen any publication and to make that clear I have it may be out there I haven't seen it\nWhere you have one Democrat come out and say stop this than others ... is this is ridiculous enough and as we've said\nWhen you when you think about it I I understand why they're going there because where else was there to go either you were going to make the decision as a party\nTo do what they said after twenty sixteen was look we've got to go to the mid west we've got to go to fly over country we have to start talking to people we have to find out what they you know what their needs are either you're ... you're going to go in that direction\nAnd talk about the economy and talk about those things or you were going to say our bases radical left\nAnd we need to go radical left and so this is obvious and you know that they're doing this this is obvious that the mainstream of the Democratic party have realized we can't beat this site we are I don't know last week\nIs no are you there is no road for them to turn around basically and come back\nReverse direction will you we'd said that two letters again really well and and you know when we set it after the election\nUh you because there is that once they took that break and you know considered going to the Midwest for a moment [noise]\nThey came back from watching what wait what are we say before lunch oh we're totally not do not know what I wanted to can't do in that we're not doing that um but when you when you go you know back in and look at the history of of basically this this ramping up to this point\nThere at it there at this point now now ask yourself do you think they're going to reverse course they're not going to so what is next\nWhere do you go from here\nUh we've been asking that and every time they find a new place to go to become teachers now they're going to get in your age not going to shout well what is what is beyond that right now\nI Believe it's a terrible political strategy that's going to backfire it is I think it's already back right up but you know this this is where they've decided to go which uh again\nI'm not surprised because once they're only as it and we'll talk about this more coming up on the show\nWith a bit later on but there's really two places to go right either moderate may become more centrist and really become more centrist mhm or go to the left and if you go to the left the only place to go is what the tactics of Occupy Wall street antifa whatever right that's the only place you could go right eight

McNamara long with a Eric Harley welcome and\nA good morning ah we're in fact I'm looking to talk with meteorologist Tom hale who's been with us\nAh he's been with a red eye covering a Hurricane Florence a covering Irma and uh over the years of his uh his career has covered a number of storms very few like hurricane Michael because there are very few storms like this one let's talk to in fact Tom hills he joined us right now good morning Tom\nGood morning I'd Tom I\nWhat what is your I I guess first take away in terms of the size of this storm a as that we ... we last spoke in our last hour which was the uh the five AM eastern hour on a on Wednesday morning\nUm it it did could you ever have predicted going back to last weekend that Michael would have gotten to a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds plus\nNo I wouldn't have I wouldn't have gone that far I Would have said that it was going to be a major hurricane and when when it took its path because as I shared last died all of the meter logical conditions favorable for this to develop and continue to develop existed\nBut for it to drop in air pressure down to nine Nineteen Miller bars putting it basically\nThe or the ... the third most intense hurricane and I'm a on record that to me it's kind of mind blowing a I would've never expected that this would have a lower air pressure than Katrina wow\nWhich was a nine hundred and twenty mail of ours well or or let's take it a step further\nI I I I I'm about to the power of Katrina but it was a pretty disorganized tropical storm when it came up through the Bahamas or and actually I was in the Bahamas for that\nWell and at that point I would've never never guessed that after it went over to Hollywood, Florida cut across Florida and then went into the Gulf but it hit that Gulf moisture that had been untapped\nAnd in the atmosphere with prime for that and so while in Nassau, Bahamas where I was a it dumped three inches of rain I was an off\nA at the amount of moisture that it dumped a nobody anticipated Katrina would be much more than a tropical storm and then when it came off Florida it just exploded yeah and and and the thing about Katrina was its sides\nIt grew to four hundred plus miles across it was enormous in size and Winfield but then we've got to Andrew Andrew that came through\nIn a you know Florida in the seventies Andrew was nine hundred and twenty two Mila bars\nIt was even a little less deep air pressure and so here comes Michael okay at nine Nineteen and so yeah yeah I\nI'm a I'm I was in quite surprised you know it was Nineteen thirty five the Labor Day storm or the lowest pressure on record a hundred and Ninety two Mila bars Camille which you guys talked about you know yesterday a Nineteen sixty nine Camille was nine hundred Mila bars\nAnd here comes Michael number three at nine hundred and Nineteen ...\nDo you know people in your profession learn from a hurricane Michael because the the ideas to learn a you know this but I but for the audience is to learn and it'd be a better prepared so that the the people in the path of any future storm can be a better warned\nSo ... so far I mean but is this is this defying logic an interview\nAt ... ... it's not it doesn't define logic but um what is what it does is establish um precedents and\nUh we you know and and and I believe to be honest if you saw the weather channel you saw it unprecedented okay well we talked about that yesterday the national weather service in Tallahassee said that this is an unprecedented\nA event we've gone beyond the barriers as this storm has intensified the way it has\nAnd making it the most powerful storm to hit a the panhandle and Big Bend area at that point I shared with you that it was all that's off and at that point it also meant that we were then going to be and documentation mode\nAnd so I have to apply to I I didn't get the name of the young man I I I I'm surprised we all saw him um this morning he was actually streaming on our station\nIn Panama City um and I believe is from Jacksonville television station um and um\nHe was in a parking garage yeah right yes\nAnd and and his coverage or was seen worldwide people were picking them up worldwide and and we threw out\nUm you know the TV station a that would be a W. J. H. G. ah which did streaming coverage um um basically when when we went off the air they started their streaming coverage\nAnd and continued until they lost more than just power they lost power at their transmitter sites and that was pretty much game over for them but they were only twenty feet above a sea level they were confident that their staff was going to be safe\nIn that situation but they continue to keep an IT guy on board to make sure that they kept feeding that and so they set another sister station in our system through and this gentleman in that garage I\nAppreciate his honesty because wedding basically did was documented where he was where he was standing yeah\nAnd and and and smartly I'm not going to go stand out there by the edge of the parking garage but what I found interesting was that that parking garage was also home for countless people in their cars\nYeah yeah I'd just be a ... is his name and a lot of people were following him a Drudge Report actually even put up a lead a early Wednesday and uh and he had been during that time basically staging and showing\nYou know the well a calm literally calm before the storm\nAnd and ah so he was he was broadcasting essentially a through periscope\nAh for periods of time thirty to forty minutes or even shorter times but then as you mentioned ah going live later and this is something that again and it is too I think display the power of a storm for many of us\nThat have never been through the storm and very few people relatively speaking had been through a storm like this but when you're able

you know can't be controlled by the government action can't be controlled necessarily a by what can't be controlled at all\nBut if you think about all the other threats in our lives you know a health

basically what her message and her statement\nI I think\nThose with the debate or with the the skills to debate and the knowledge of the ideas on which this country was founded are always going to win when\nThey go low we kick them you know when you were talking about it though but I wouldn't want to you know what things that might interest you and\nUh this though when you talked about you know radio and I knew this when I was I don't know seven eight years old I knew I wanted to be on the radio ... that was dominant nothing else really entered my mind\nA bit like I said for years it's what I wanted to do I never thought I'd end up doing talk radio mhm thank God I did because I I couldn't sit and talk about\nA star is born and Lady Gaga is wonderful performance every day and and ... by the way I haven't seen the movie so I've no idea what this wonderful or not I'm just I'm I'm assuming that if I'm working for music station I Would have to do that ... what a wonderful performance and the music was just wonderful\nNot that look talking entertainment and we'll talk about our team at once in awhile but to do that every single day\nAnd have have to be positive about what comes out of Hollywood and do that every\nSingle day would everybody knows it would kill me to be able to do this and articulate ideas and and uh there's there's two things first off the people to call you and say thanks so much because I've learned a lot that's that's a wonderful thing to have wonderful thing\nThe other wonderful thing and people are saying might think well you can't really me that I Do is when people call you with extreme passion of how they\nDisagree with you mhm because I'm always amazed wow\nThey really care what I think [laughter] yeah I really I I always get that really ... somebody's really ticked off me for something I said you're kidding really loud and that's interesting and so I said to me that and I know it's going to happen but you know when we talk about\nThe Democrats and the whole instability thing I Will tell you this\nWhen I'm dirt during the campaign\nBecause of the way that you and I you know we've always done shows we don't care whether you're a Republican or a Democrat no and you know we're we're conservative you know slashed libertarian I have a lot of liberal friends right and and and I don't know if they'd comb your friend any more of a well we but we don't we don't care that the politicians that we analyze we don't care what your label is\nIf you agree with you we will if we don't we don't\nA lot of people are bothered by that means even on the Republican side had been bothered over the years and I'm starting with Trump when we disagreed with him we've respectively disagreed with a a ... when I first got into talk radio George Herbert Walker Bush ...\nRead my lips no new taxes [laughter] so it goes all the way back there with a with W we disagreed with a lot and and uh I'm with a a Trump a few things not ... you know and but the things that we just grew with Trump I Will say our core to our belief\nAs as conservative and free market or you know a a people when it comes to economic things mhm uh and so we may be passionate about it but the vast majority of what Trump does you know I ... what he actually does substance wise and the legislation that he puts forward and\nThe executive orders that that he puts forward when you actually read into it and his foreign policy\nUh I'm In one hundred percent uh agreement with but uh\nYou know to be able to do that to be able to go on and just have you know the freedom of creativity oh I Know the point I wanted to make\nThat as it seems that everything is getting on civil out there mhm and things are going crazy I don't know what it is but it's like and I know would you agree with me we've never had this discussion\nSeems like I'm getting less flak yeah because I'm\nNot really getting there are no I mean I there was more an anger a year ago or two years ago or ten years ago or you know from the response that we you know the ... that I Would get the things that I Would say ... very few and far between now\nWell and and I think the uh while the tactics clearly have changed and when the tactics change and they go the direct route as they call it and they became they become of the it's it's beyond a protester it's someone who's going to be in your face\nAnd when that happens they don't happen because why do they go there because they don't have a debate anymore they don't want to have a debate I'm not saying this is the case where everyone on the left in fact I think there are plenty plenty of Democrats out there\nRight now but can't stand what's going on on the left and can't stand a first of all had no need for Hillary Clinton or or if they did and they look at what she said just a couple of days ago\nHighly disagree with that kind of tactic and will use it but the problem is is that that's squeaky\nCrybaby whining wheel\nIs always going to get the grease\nAnd that's where the cameras are that's where the social media is\nI I look at it and I think to myself that the reason and Benin talk radio twenty nine years and I believe right now for is insane as it seems to be out there I Know the flack that I get is extremely light\nI think probably people are taking it to social media and but I really believe that the point is\nIs not that are that are arguments had changed any or have become stronger we may ... and\nI think it should be called talk show host you learn\nHow to debate better and put your points are for better I think it's the fact that the opposition is completely and totally insane I mean right now they're just insane\nAnd so people you know they look and they say okay you know we're what's what's McNamara said today okay I disagree with it but ah\nHe's not insane like they are over there I really think that's worth a when were you you know you if you're you're comparing and you're say okay what about ... what do I compare you too\nAnd when you see that the opposition isn't articulating anything in any type of common sense or critical thinking fashion\nThat I think more people are just open then to or an ... an agreement just agreement to an opinion that they might not even agree with one hundred percent but they see that there's rational thought and critical thinking to it mhm\nRight well and and they were and we do hear that from time to time\nBut I don't agree with everything but I yeah I understand how you get their central right mhm and we've had over the years we've had plenty of great discussions with Democrats liberals who call and want to have a sane discussion on the issues\nBut no\nThey're few and far between if they exist at All right now because I don't know they're looking at their party\nAnd asking well\nHow do we actually win something and then move forward you think about the word progressive oh that's the whole idea right of taking the country to its next step that's a great point ... they're still using progressive yeah I don't think so well you know that there's no way you can when they're saying\nGet in your face and shot him out of the building that's progress the answer is it's not it's the opposite of progress\nI think the key is here is that it is the evidence the last couple of weeks\nAnd then what has just come to this week with the proclamation that we're not going to be civil anymore right until we you know till we win or an until we win shows that they have come to the realization that they cannot defend their own arguments threatened the substance of the ideas\nThey are lost\nAnd it's just pure rage and emotion over what I don't know I Can't figure out a I tend to believe that we think in a in a in credit at a critical thinking way and they're just pure rage and emotion and there's no way to even have a debate right eight six six Ninety ...\nTips from Jay Jay killer and associates incorporated on

us ... spending a lot of the show and a lot of the day to day\nTrying to make heads or tails of the polls right especially after the whole cabinet thing\nAre we still don't have a reading yet I Will say this though I haven't seen any Democrat with any huge bump I haven't seen a few Republicans ... with huge problems and may be one poll right uh for example uh the one would\nBe a the Arizona race mhm uh where and I've just got my bike here with yours on a race or wear 'em and\nSend them over the Democrat right yes and and uh I just can't I've I've got my like here for the um [noise] and this is the I'm just looking at here now I Can't find it yeah and this is the uh the seat that as being vacated by Jeff like\nYes in Arizona and okay let me get their zone here\nA year here it is a ... I'm Sorry uh in the ... the ABC Fifteen pulled that was a done ten one to tend to uh she was up by six likely voters now the CBS you go with it went through the fifth tend to to ten five\nHad sent him a plus three mhm uh but right now I mean that's a you know that's a dead heat that's a a dead heat with again her showing it means she's never want to poll before me Sally right so and send them out has been up you know by two or three over the last month\nAnd all of a sudden a plus six appears out of nowhere and so either it's an outlier doesn't mean anything or it does mean something\nBut again that only goes who tend to so that doesn't cover a lot of uh of the insanity that went on last week right\nAnd so we'll see where that goes from a from here are some of the other ones that we have\nA uh looked at a and again we're waiting for holes that go through the week you know really do the ... this past weekend right we still don't have it for Missouri yet Holly versus a McCaskill ... latest is one of the goals are tend to\nAnd that has a tie yup so\nYou look at a at looking at Nevada however versus Rosen yeah Miller's up by two how old is up by two in the in the New York times CNN poll also you look at the NBC News nearest fall\nAnd also up by two there are so that really is a dead heat but you look at the swing or those\nLet's see here the the NBC News ... nine thirty ten free and the New York times CNN poll was a ten eight to ten ten so if you look at uh the previous poles and the swing the CNN poll going back to nine twenty\nFive through nine twenty nine rose and had a four point lead\nAnd now that swing a has been a total of six points for for Dean Heller in recent days this is why we talk about pre Kavanaugh post Kavanaugh\nBut especially the hearing and then you would look at the hearing that entire week of discussion and and craziness\nAnd then the vote this last Saturday as you mentioned that's really the the period you want to look at and of course after that what changed if anything change the minds of ah the voters and which voters which group the Democrats as you mentioned\nNot you can't find one that's getting a real bump but there are a couple of Republicans that seem to be getting something from it is enough to win is it long lasting will stay there are in till election day well keep in mind a couple of things first of all\nA within a couple of weeks you can start seeing early voting and those that are motivated will have that when you see early voting numbers are that are up that means people are really motivated and very anxious chomping at the bit to get out and vote\nNow in the the the New York times poll I guess we're still continuing their ... it's called the light pole or the one in Texas right so they they start doing it again tomorrow but as of right now and that's the one that had Ted Cruz up by nine now using cruise up consistently\nUh you know in there and I look I I still believe Texas is different animal and probably wouldn't be the same\nAs as other states I I Believe that that the if cruise wins if cruise wins by you know double figures yeah I think he would have always won by double figures irrespective of the cabinet race yeah I I just think Texas is a different animal than than other states are in\nA primary what have you might want twenty sixteen he won the state\nUm do you look at a also now look there was a period a where especially ... right around the convention time [noise] plenty of people in the Republican Party didn't like Ted Cruz remember the uh there was he got voted right and and the word from Capitol Hill\nI mean he was being demonized by fellow Republicans are at one point so this is someone that Ted Cruz is someone who gets the benefit\nI think maybe a to a greater degree as than than others\nOf the Republicans coming together after the capital thing when there's a juggling within the party than someone like Ted Cruz who's been criticized by his own party you know the then he's going to get he's going to get that bump a little bit more or the benefit of that a little bit more\nUh than than others might\nSo I I'm it'll be interesting I think to to really watch this next three weeks three and a half\nWe I Am and ... house races we can't tell because there's that you just look at it in the polling or they don't do a lot of polls for a lot of these house races and so you really don't have an indication now I'm sure inside their campaign they do\nBecause they're doing the inside the inside polling but you you know that's one of the complaints you and I were having to earn our Mitchell meeting their little while ago saying ... really can't tell because the no polls in three weeks well in ... in two weeks you look at the\nToss ups the number of districts right now that are that are classified as toss ups or categorize to stuff that's thirty two according to our sleepy and they're not doing they don't do polls on the house seats as often as they do\nFor the Senate seats and I have to wonder what has changed after the cabin on hearing and confirmation vote and I have to wonder again in those districts\nKeep in mind a number of

you run more efficiently is right on our number one goal now tropical storm Michael\nCentered over the state of Georgia let's get an update from meteorologist John trout good morning John\nGood morning guys everything we've been saying about the system ah throughout the past couple of days has been true and then some you know the system arrived in Georgia overnight as a category three hurricane a storm has not had a Georgia this strong since Eighteen\nNinety eight and those types of things just just\nDowned you with us when you begin looking at the you know the uh fourth strongest on record\nTo ever hit the U.S about just under a cat category five at a hundred and fifty seven miles an hour\nWhile a ... in terms of what we're looking at in the coming days here for a not just Georgia but ah the Carolinas what is the threat still from Michael\n[noise] well we're going to see continued rainfall in areas where they don't need any more rainfall that's for sure we'll see the sister moved through southern Georgia or most of South Carolina and the low country of North Carolina where the ground is already saturated the trees are sitting in mud\nAny amount of wind is going to topple those trees and we could see some additional flooding in those areas I mentioned also tornadoes if you picture a hurricane coming onshore at a hundred and fifty miles an hour when it hits the land\nIt begins to slow down a little bit because it encounters homes and trees and the ground friction slows the surface movement\nOf the hurricane but as you go aloft a thousand two thousand feet up the system is still advancing pretty rapidly well that sets up a window gradient and when we get a wind gradient we get rotation and a potential tornadoes are spawned as a result\n... and of course when you look at the the flooding are often the most deadly part of a storm or that's something that as you mentioned on the ground saturated in the Carolinas but but certainly even in Georgia a with this kind of rainfall flash flooding is is the big threat correct\n[noise] it is a flash flooding and the result of flash flooding I'm aware of one possibly to death set this hour we're not going to believe our eyes\nWhen the sun comes up I just want to mention that we're going to see drone footage for miles of homes destroyed of the\nCanopies over gas pumps ripped from their mornings like

Hollywood Reporter we are not making this up because you you if you haven't heard the story you're going to think we're making it up\nThere's a headline from the Hollywood Reporter Stephen Miller who's the one of the president's advisors Steven Miller's third grade teacher says he was a loner and ate glue\nGod\nIs my witness they have their pictures you can see right there yeah there is Stephen Miller with his fellow third graders at Franklin elementary and they have a circle around him and his third grade class picture you want to hear how the article starts ...\nIn Nineteen Ninety three Donald Trump senior political advisor attended Santa Monica is frankly momentum ... where he was off by himself all the time\n\nDo you remember the character and peanuts the one called pig pen and the dust cloud and crumbs flying all around him that was Stephen Miller at eight years of age I was always trying to get him to clean up his desk he always had stuff mashed up in there he was a strange dude I remember he would take a bottle of glue\nAnd we didn't have glue sticks in those days and he would pour the glue on his arm let it dry peel and then eat it off\n[noise] um so I\nWould say the majority of male students at that age we're doing the same thing\n[laughter] I didn't eat it but I did do the thing where you let it dry and peel it off your skin I did that all the time I remember that was the only ... that was the only reason I ever had glue\nI remember being concerned about I'm not academically he was okay with that though I could never read his handwriting but he had such strange personal habits he was a loner\nAn isolated and off by himself all the time so it was I and I ended up normal oh wait probably not the best defense for Stephen Miller is\nA note or Stephen Miller responded on Twitter uh when I was young\nI blew sometimes I too much blue I I like glue I still like glue\nYou didn't know that's the capital I like beer comparison yeah All right yeah come on the present okay sorry Stephen Miller responded\nOn Twitter because the headline on Twitter from the Hollywood Reporter it you know is ah the that Stephen Miller as a as a kid was a loner an aide glue his\nResponse on Twitter\nOf these things is true [laughter] that's holding a liquid [laughter] that's hilarious um but at this but\nIt's just where they're going in and this was a report from his teacher now or that they're getting closer to the home more now to third grade and\n\nWell I think um they should I think they should keep going I Want to know what those infants are up to all of them well\nWhat's going on in their mind I Know what's going on a a diaper about what's going on in the mind as a you know as a fetus Trump kicked his mother over and over again it was obviously domestic abuse mhm\nKavanaugh to\nThat's the one guy gentleman called up a couple of weeks ago and ... or ... maybe it was last week called up and said I mean it's a lifelong apartment we need to invest it all the way back to the ... what were the third grade now yeah there were not to high school yeah well now we've got we and the thing is they skipped junior high and went right to third grade\nI I I'm trying to think what my teachers would say oh man oh crap oh I've heard my better never getting involved in politics\nMy former or a a German teacher a ... ... is a I mean it still rings in my ear today mhm\nAnd by the way I did say this I was doing a radio show didn't know he was on his deathbed and he heard me talking about him and and this goes back to Ninety three I was talking about it was on his deathbed ...

are currently eight six six Ninety run I let's get an update on now tropical storm\nMichael as we turn to meteorologist Tom hill good morning Tom good morning\nAll right so where are we with a with Michael and what is the the storm in terms of the power of the storm still look like\nWell the power of the storm is still there at about five thousand feet we've got wins that are blowing at about eighty miles an hour that they haven't diminished all that much and with thunderstorms those thunderstorm wins the downdraft translate some of that wind so we have higher gas and so for that reason alone\nAt wind is still an issue especially when it gets across into North Carolina because\nUh we talked about this\nFor four days in advance as Florence was coming in\nThat they had already had some saturation from a remnant\nA of a tropical storm that pushed its way on through and and of course when obviously\nFlorence came through the low lying areas that are run up through a Fayetteville\nAnd a south of Raleigh that entire area is still very saturated John trout touched on it and he said trees are sitting in mud and that's exactly what it is we had ... that's the event that we had in the Carolinas with a very slow moving Florence\nAnd as this storm moves up through there I think there'll be a lot more ... and also there's going to be obviously a good deal more flooding now\nYes they're likely to get about two inches of rain in that area but it doesn't take much for a little bit of flooding to to\nReef re and develop and\nIt's west of there where the heavy flooding is actually going to be taking place up toward Raleigh and then back up a a up into Virginia a Lynchburg, Virginia Roanoke, Virginia everything on the eastern side\nOf the mountains there are up to Charlotte and or Norfolk that entire area um is gonna see anywhere from a three to as much as eight inches of rain as it gets further on up\nUm and there's a you know why not to include here are the folks over Allen the outer banks from okra coke island which is down towards the south end up to duck\nOr they're under a storm surge watch and affect ...\n... and how I I guess what is the potential there in terms of that storm surge uh and and what the the heightened might be\nA four feet okay to them or the or yeah or you know it'll inundate some neighborhoods some some areas where it'll come out of the banks um but um it's when you think about it it it just goes to the power of this now tropical storm\nAnd its Winfield yeah right yeah and that's\nJust amazing I mean if you look at the the power of Michael has came\nAshore a Wednesday afternoon and something that we touched on yesterday during our program and that is the the because of that power because of that energy behind the storm and it grew after of course uh we got off the air uh the it intensified\nThat that means it's a longer lasting a storm so you're expecting\nMichael to still be a tropical storm\nA strength in terms of uh when it goes back out over the water\nAnd reaches Ireland yeah why why so why [laughter] yeah well\nAh to our friends in Europe uh you know um you can have ... does does that does that are on the water is warm enough that far north in the Atlantic to keep it going then yes no guy yeah\nWow yeah I did I just assumed by the time we got to walk Tobar probably be cool down so I was surprised to hear that but they are still warming up yeah L and\nAnd and that's why we're having these storms ah you know the the normal hurricane season ends at the beginning of November right and so at this point there's a reason to that extent this is the fourth\nMajor hurricane that we've had in the month of October period and so yeah that's and that's simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October when you consider that there's been four of them total ... and and so and\nThe last nine something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said it well is it going to kind of lose some power as it comes into shore and and I and my immediate reaction was you know no [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah because you were right because I I'd asked that question which brings me to another question that is just a just personal interest to me\nAnd and that is when it ... from ... ... ... tornadoes hurricanes get their energy from the warm water right yes All right so do does that mean\nThat a hurricane like this doesn't then does it as a result that it's taking the energy from the water does the water actually cool down\nA yeah actually it does because what it does this causes up boiling a which by the way is a very bad thing if you like oysters\nAnd I've just letting you know [laughter] might not be good or Easter season right I\nThat came in and Nineteen eighty five was the last storm that hit this\nArea of Florida and and and came came in hold onto your hat\nAt Mexico beach wow the same place wow and for that entire year\nAnd I and I'm not sure it might have been longer than that it devastated the oyster crop of the Appalachian bay um you know ... right area wow\nWow in terms of the life of Michael you know from the time that it was officially a tropical storm too you know looking at the forecast as you mentioned a back out over water in the Atlantic ah is this going to be one of the longest living storms in terms of the life span the time that Michael is acting\nUm no I don't think so you've you've stumped me on that one because we've got some that don't even make it here but for some reason they just spin around in the mid Atlantic right we're in the western Atlantic and so I've never I've never looked into that yeah yeah um he\nHe just seems that a ... and you mentioned this earlier talking about you know we always\nOften we'll talk about a storm the remnants of the remnants of and as you mentioned we this we're not going to get to that point in terms of it being overland here we're not going to talk about the remnants of Michael it will be still tropical storm Michael overland\nYes it is to Charlotte to Raleigh and Norfolk yeah and that's where I'm concerned about a lot when it goes to know for that whole area up there the Hampton Roads area you know that area just floods [noise] yeah\nAnd and so I mean we didn't talk about it a lot with Florence but it was flooding in Florence it was nothing compared to the flooding that was going on\n[noise]\nCharleston's ESPN is the home of college football and basketball major league baseball the NBA NBA NFL champions on me for all these fears

ACS\n[noise]\n\n\n\nInternet radio he's our only and I'm hearing from our eight six six Ninety or read I mean I find the top of uh\nUh you know ... I Wonder if there is pressure inside Congress I guess it's just pure speculation\nBut inside St look if you got to do after we got to get the steel and aluminum done we're not going to do and we're going to do it let's get everything done and that's putting pressure on the on on the White House or the fact is yeah you know having NAFTA is going to\nAt least stabilize the market with some good and bad\nAs we have gone through and we have gone through a a NAFTA because we do believe that if if the new NAFTA passes\n[laughter] it'd be trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA if it passes it's going to hurt the auto industry it's not going to help the auto industry is going to make cars more expensive that's not a good thing now initially when you say it it's something that may not hit the market at that particular point\nYou know at at but when you take everything together the worries about regulation in the tech sector or all of a sudden the the you know the the fed or raising rates are the fact that the bond yields\nAre going up again it's taken us taking us more interest money\nUh to to service the the the the dead\nAnd the possibility of the trade war with China where there there isn't doesn't seem to be any type of conclusion and still a great uncertainty about\nA steel and aluminum tariffs and still and uncertainty whether you know Congress really hasn't there's been no indication from Congress or the leadership in Congress about the trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA\n... well you mentioned now or the the terrorists and PG E taking a ten percent hit yesterday\nA and you that this is a very old company but talking about raw materials and the cost of raw materials and and so as you know there are essentially they're manufacture a and and distributor of of uh of of coding and special materials special materials\nBut that is also part of the auto industry so the the the car sales ah the automobile sales have or seemed to have stalled out for now or what's behind that are certainly do you know that the cost of automobiles is going up and that is directly related\nTo terrorists then there's a greater demand for used cars when there's a greater demand for any group in terms of products that cost goes up so it it is it's a number of things that hit start to hit all at once\nAnd you go back to All right well how much of this is controlled by either the fed or the federal government and how much of this cost of government\nAnd right now you can look at ... and I think you could look well at interest rates ... and and you see those two right now sticking out but everything that we just said here\nIs related to what government regulation\nEverything that we just and I didn't even think about that until you just said there until you're ... wow everything is government Ryan ...\nIs so you can actually make the argument that hurt it irrespective whether it's trade agreement government regulation the fed rate you know ah on on interest rates are the the debt that with the debt that we have in service seen our our debt all of it goes back to [laughter] in in some way a\nGovernment\nA regulation and when we talk about the tech industry and what are they worried about government regulation so it all gets back to that\nWe've said this before and you look when we you know we've gotten into great debates and disagreements with the administration about ah you know their their policy on tariffs therefore or new label turf babies\nThat the president came up with a but the look in the real world you raise prices it hurts and economy and the story but you can sit there and go rah rah rah usa usa you can have all the chance you want\nBut if you raise the cost of goods and services it always hurts and economy and hurts workers\nAnd just because you wish to chant or\nYou know just say America First doesn't mean America is necessarily first by the policy that you put in because you love the slogan slogans main nothing ... economics is related to how people respond to incentive\nIf you make the cost of goods more expensive it's going to hurt an economy not my opinion it's the reality of economics end of story\nWell and and again it is something that can be controlled through policy it as something that can be a\nTempered and and why do we want ... why do we want to step in front of the progress that's been made that terms of you know well wait what was being done\nBy the administration has done so much good that when they do bad that's going to we believe hurt them ... because I don't believe\nThat a Republican\nIn the United states can handle a bad economy as bad as a ... a Republican president can not handle bad economic news as well as a Democrat I Can't tell you why but it's just the reality\nAlthough I got rid of Obama got elected for a second term there was nothing moving in the economy right I don't believe Republicans can survive a bad economy especially if you look good economy and then it goes down over the next two years\nAnd what is it what it was the first couple of years I think at that point almost all Republicans in this day and age are much more vulnerable because Democrats cell that better than Republicans do\nYeah uh you know do you see that the interest rates rising and the you know any kind of slow down in in major sectors than you you put those together ... the housing sector at the at the toward the end of\nOf or I guess getting close to the actual fall out of the subprime mess the fed was raising rates\nSo you have these these loans out there that were set to balloon and mature and as they were the rates were going up which meant when it jumped to that ultimate rate it was going to be much higher than expected\nWell when you had delinquency rates are as as they started to creep up and up the forecast for that sky rocketed because of the rise in interest rates that was ultimately going to do those homeowners it was clear well if they can't keep up right now\nWell then what it balloons out with even a higher rate to a higher rate than it than they had expected and plan for well all bets are off it's just not going to happen and that's that's part of that was part of the dynamics in place\nWell what you have here is you know uh the basically the fed going in and the the point Kramer was making is that\nIt was not Jim Kramer at CNBC in the street dot com was that he wants to be more regimented and he wants them to do the homework on the economy he feels that the fed is not doing their homework\nAnd they should review the data because to his point what do we know about the fallout from terrorists what do we know about a long term\nBut at the point is being made that the the feds don't need to raise rates right now\nWell you\nAre admitting you're saying that our policy is also affecting\nYou have to admit that any policy by any governing entity is is affecting negatively right terrorists or whatever it might be like ... regulation and\nTaxes because that's what a tariff it doesn't matter whether you call it a terror for an income tax whatever if your tax if you're raising the cost of doing business is always going to hurt\nWell and and that will see in the coming days where where the market rebounds if they believe this is long lived if they if they're going to be long lived if\nIf they believe that the administration is going to do an about face on terrorism and and the tears even in the situation with China because it's it's affecting negatively way too many producers here in the U. S.\nUh than than the market will adjust accordingly but if we start seeing that uh that fear become the reality in the economic numbers than the market will also ... and the way of course\nYou see positive is coming out of leadership in Congress that we want to get this NAFTA thing done right yeah but I've heard nothing not yet nothing right eight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers conducting thorough pre trip inspections allows you to catch any problems before heading out on the road post trip inspections give the shop time to react to any problems that were identified during her next pre or post trip inspection\nThree three three nights when I radio and shell motel on making your hardworking journeys more manageable\nOctober twenty six visual Texas Chicken fried steak restaurant you celebrate without the legendary chicken fried steak and eggs for chicken fried steak dinner for only five Ninety nine\nBreakfast lunch or dinner the skill it's famous him chicken flights to run on the smoking route country agree it's just fun you know all the twenty six just no denying celebrate ... expecting participating hundreds of restaurants in a federal ...

radio [noise]\nAnd I'm Mary McNamara along with our hardly eight six six Ninety run I\nWell it's now tropical storm Michael but still a very dangerous storm and so now we turn to a meteorologist Tom hale who joined us good morning Tom\nGood morning don't let that fool you right yeah because uh you you you look at the footprint of of a tropical\nStorm Michael now a which has been wreaking havoc on on a Georgia and headed for the Carolinas and it's it's the satellite photos or just a amazing or just darling in in in this this storm again\nStill has plenty of energy or what are we looking at a I Know we're a scheduled to get an update or within twenty five minutes or so\nBut yeah the last update has it at sustained winds right now at roughly sixty miles an hour I'm guessing we can expect in the next report that to decrease\nI Would think so should drop to probably fifty if that um it may still maintain itself but I think a ten mile an hour drop as reasonable although it\nAt looking at it in radar and just kinda clocking it I I I don't think it'll drive more than ten miles it might pick up a mile and forward speed gone to the northeast it may be Twenty one miles an hour\nAnd I'd earlier predicted it would exit the United states it about twenty three to twenty five miles an hour [noise] uh but that's not going to be until it gets up into Virginia\nBefore it exits outta here yeah um yeah it's a um it it it's an incredible storm it let me give you a little kind of a broad overview\nOkay along the coast and the outer banks they're gonna see storm surge from the storm in the Carolinas of two to four feet that's water inundation rice and then you can at high tide waves which could cause some problems\nIt's not the biggest one there then we'll be another one or not the biggest one it will be feeder band soon we'll be talking about the potential for tornadoes\nNow these tornadoes and the feeder bans the feeder bans are coming in from the east and moving off to the west so that kind of curving from southeast North West and the bans have individual storms at 'em and they're moving out of about forty miles an hour\nNow those individual storms are capable of brief\nSpin up tornadoes in the individual super Sal soon as we get into the afternoon those storms will be heating up\nIn the afternoon maximum heat and that's going to happen primarily over the Carol North Carolina's where you're going to see that the greatest potential for\nTornado activity but it's a wind and so whether it's a to an addict wind or it's a sustained tropical forests when the forty to forty five miles an hour\nIt's going to do damage and a lot of that damage is going to be treated damage and it's going to be in North Carolina because what's going on in North Carolina\nOr what has gone on his Florence and so it's saturated soils and so these trees that we've noticed that most of them because of the wind have been toppled over we've seen a lot of root ball photos right on on\nTelevision mhm so\nBoom overcome the trees now what are the trees hit the power lines\nBingo so we got the trees hitting power lines and we currently have seven hundred and thirty five thousand customers now that's they count customers is homes right\nOkay multiply that by two assuming there's only two people affected by every home and we know that numbers low and and you're already a one and a half million people already without power and that number is going to grow as it gets into the Carolinas and I think\nThe next big numbers for power outages\nAre going to be in the Carolinas during Florence between the Carolinas they had over seven hundred and fifty thousand power outages and I think this is capable of of if not repeating it at least bringing in another four to five hundred thousand customers\nYeah and so we're going to get a will get over the two million mark on on people affected without any kind of power and then you have the question they were staging people for power\nIn Pensacola and just draw a circle around from Pensacola around this whole area a thousands of power of of trucks utility trucks right\nAnd they're going to go into the areas they can get into first so maybe the Carolinas and Georgia and so forth are going to have a better shot at getting power even though they did stage I Believe the number was up to Nineteen hundred power trucks uh\nAround the uh Pensacola area and around the panhandle and so you know they're going to be working as hard as they possibly can but just the physical flooding an inundation and the damage and the debris is going to limit the time that it's going to take for them to get their power back so I still believe that\nThe landfall area the pan handle the took the greatest Bryant is going to have the longest period of time to restore power\nI mean face it there's a lot of places they don't have to restore power to anymore but they still have to be able to address the power lines that went there\nSure yeah the infrastructure itself has to be restored and and as you mentioned\nOf there may not be a a customer are there any longer unfortunately but still is a a a a an infrastructure because down that line of course there are other customers that that has to have to be\nA half to get that power and have it to restore the the if you look at uh the uh the impact there as it came ashore a hurricane Michael again one for the record books you and I I was asking you the question kind of put you on the spot last last hour but you\nYou actually answered it on the spot very well and and were corrected generally speaking talking about the longest lasting\nA hurricane and and I found a little data their weather dot com about ah this would be a hurricane John back in Nineteen Ninety four which had a a thirty day run a this thing traveled nearly eighty two hundred miles and all out in the Pacific\nAre effective why but then kept going and but ah roughly a thirty day run but I mean if you look at and you mentioned this earlier and it it it's something to remind folks that are still in the path of Michael that\nTypically and very often we see a that a storm or or hurricane starts to fall apart overland and then we we hear words like the remnants of but there are no remnants and again this is a well formed tropical storm a that is traveling ah right now headed for the Carolinas and wreaking havoc\nOn on Georgia and uh and then we'll go back out over the ocean ah we also\nWant to go where you name it extra tropical once it goes out over the ocean ... okay and and write\nIs it's it's no longer in the it's no longer a tropical storm in the tropical zones or so forth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regain power and that regain power is considered extra tropical but it's\n... you're right in in nailing it here the it it may not be the thirty days storm that meanders out there and\nBecause it's making good time but it's definitely covering a lot of terrain", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "11"}
