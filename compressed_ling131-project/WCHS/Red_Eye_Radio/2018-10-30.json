way that the masses\nThe billions of people in the world and the hundreds of millions of people in the United states respond when Senate that said I Can't change that you can change that no president can change that it gets frustrating when people believe\nThat they can bend economics and I'm Talking about uh on on the left and some in the populist portion not conservatives\nBut the populist conservative out there that believes that economics is what their opinion wishes it to be that's very frustrating because it shows that people actually don't care they really don't care about finding

them out of restaurants well\nThe behaving like that and they'll send it to the the thing that one of the things they've got\nThat comes up every time one of the major points has brought up every single time and has for a while the Trump is creating instability by stating you know by being part of the chant lock her up lock her up lock her up as we said before though that's not an on civil comment\nThat's a common based on the fact is we have said before of many people believing that Hillary Clinton should legitimately be in jail\nIt is based on the fact that she broke the law that is\nRecognize I don't know who doesn't recognize that fact right she just wasn't prosecuted\nFor breaking the law hope the SP espionage law and the or trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act law by putting the server in her home mhm\nAnd we\nHave gone through this ... the actual law and even call me said well it yet but no reasonable prosecutor would do it because we've never fought an instance like this yeah because you'd never had a secretary of state that put a private server in their home\nTo avoid the freedom of Information Act and\nTo allow foreign entities and she knows that she's smart enough former first lady former senator secretary of state to know\nThat our enemies are looking for anything that's on secured mhm mhm but thinking and believing though that's okay we know what the intent was Ian ... everybody knows that the intent was I Want to keep stuff private I don't want it to be documented by the government\nAs is law to be archived by the government right now they're law Airforce subject to freedom of information that right\nThat's what like lock her up about it's not about locking up because she ran against Trump son about locking her up because she's married to bill ... it's not like in Iraq because they produce the offspring of Chelsea Clinton who now wants is is expressing interest in running for political office\nWell it's not no it's not based on rhetoric it's based on a fat right that she broke the law and that she is not above the law\nNow you may disagree with their analysis but you cannot disagree with the fact that back up what they are saying\n\nAnd so they use it by the way they use that every single time and the like the last month where I've seen them saying well let's see what you're saying that the lock her up lock her up that's uncivil that's a no it's not meant to be in it it actually it's meant to promote\nI mean\nThat's something that has provable by the way that fact that basis is not debatable right\nThe actual facts in the case nobody has debate it now she hasn't gone to trial or she hasn't gone to ... you're right but nobody debate\nFacts right and nobody debates what the last day right it's simply call me who hated Trump they didn't want a prosecutor now\n\nWe know the whole story when we've been through it before we've gone through the last specifically we went through the first draft of as we know the first draft of analyzing Hillary Clinton what she did and how they changed the language of it because the language that they originally had was the exact context of\nThe law that she broke right that she was not prosecuted for she broke a lot this is the fat she broke the law but was not prosecuted more ...\n... and that's why they state lock her up it's not a hateful comments know you want

talk and analyze the mid term elections we've talked about the strong and weak points for the Republicans are and the strongly points for the the Democrats one thing that Democrats brought up\nA now we think they may have had it too late but it's still doesn't mean that people don't recognize that especially\nIf you know this is this was a time of the year when a all of us I mean we here at at at our job\nHad to put in for you know benefits here are the last uh ten days or so a lot of other companies are doing it a Obamacare but you know premiums are are coming in now and we had said this back then that the Republicans left this thing wide open\nThat you know they did a horrible job or a you know when it came to especially premiums that we're going to sky rocket\nAnd we said they've got to come up with something as to what they're going to do and they really happen\nAnd Newt Gingrich wrote an article for Fox News and so the twenty Eighteen mid term elections were less than two weeks away there's just three days ago and many polls show there was a sizable block of independent voters who have not yet made up their minds at the same time health care remains the number one issue for the American people\nThe best way for the Republicans to earn the votes of these undecided voters and honor commitments to the Republicans who are already support them urge to clearly articulate how they would fix the broken healthcare system\nAnd he goes through the whole thing that the should be Republican principles\nUp for the book for America as a Republican principles for America's health and health care system we believe that every American should have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life\nSupported by a health care system but it's simple to use innovative unaffordable we believe that every American should up his or her choice of the doctors and insurance that meets his or her specific needs we believe the healthcare system should be transparent about health care cost\nAnd quality of treatment options and that this information should be available to every American and assemble understandable wasteful patients can make better decisions about their own health we believe in protecting patients\nWith preexisting conditions so they can obtain affordable health insurance coverage we believe in the importance of American Medical innovation that leads the to the breakthroughs that dramatically improve\nHealth outcomes while significantly lowering costs we believe that a doctor patient relationship\nIs the center of ineffective healthcare system and it should not be disrupted by micro management from public and private bureaucracies we believe American seniors have earned their health care benefits and that they their families and their doctors should make their own medical decisions not an elected government boards bureaucrats are private third party\nPayers are middle men we believe in a competitive healthcare market where private sector innovation works to strengthen public programs one size fits all government controlled healthcare interferes with doctor patient relationship need taps new medical breakthroughs provides less has access to treatment and leads to long wait times\nFor critical care we believe that the current health care system\nIn America is far too expensive while it is very good at treating people when they become sick it is much less effective\nAnd helping Americans remain healthy which is equally as important we believe the goal of health reform should be to build on what's working and fix what's not destroying what's good about our healthcare system in an attempt to fix what's bad is not acceptable step\nTowards a better future and then he goes on to the Republican accomplishment so they go to the accomplishments [noise] you know including eliminating the Obamacare individual mandate\nOr the uh uh six billion new to fight opioid epidemic the past the right to try legislation passing historic VA mission\nOr the Trump Administration providing more affordable health care options for Americans through association health care plans in short term limited to ration plans so they go through that there's ten different ones there then they say the Republican promises for additional improvements\nIf the American people re elect Republicans to a majority in the house and Senate we pledge to enact a series of practical in specific changes based on what works in the public and private sectors to build a better healthcare system the system will keep people healthy and provide effective treatments and economic security for those who get sick\nThese legislative changes will and they go to the pre existing condition which really goes back to the block grant right\nWe do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches like high risk pools and reinsurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it goes to the states\nThe states make a decision as to what they wish to do right and for the reduced the cost of prescription drugs by requiring additional transparency and accountability across the entire prescription drug supply chain\nA lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by eliminating the health insurance tax\nReducing Washington's mandates limit choices the drive up costs for insurance strengthen Medicare by protecting Medicare part D patients from excessive out of pocket costs maximize medical innovation they go through that but basically go through all the things that they should that they should actually do this has been a failure the Republican Party completely\nThere is something that probably Ryan should should have been talking about on a consistent basis there should have been a mark\nIn plan forward is with massive television ads leading up to the election that if you will like this if this is our plan this is our contract ... and Newt Gingrich bringing it up and this is two days ago it's too late oh yeah yeah it ...\nIt's not going to work uh now we're inside of a week first of all it's because a Newt Gingrich is is only going to ... no one is going to uh pay attention to Newt except for the choir\nOr because that's who he's preaching to but you're right with ah the Paul Ryan at the beginning of this year we talked about twenty sixteen all of the we're going to do away with with Obamacare we're going to do away with Obamacare we will\nDo away with Obamacare and then by the time they got there the sentiment by the rank and file a changed and it was like okay well we'll do away with the some of the Obama Care and then they finally got to\nThe individual mandate which of course than a undid the funding mechanism\nAnd then forced them eventually will force them to pay for it in another way premiums going up all of the ... which is exactly what we're seeing and we we talked about that disconnect between twenty sixteen\nAnd the end of last year\nNow you have this this whole new cycle and and whole new opportunity to essentially launch the new plan based on what you know about the public sentiment and they do know what\nThen why wouldn't you do that to say if you give us if if if if we are in charge this is what we want to do and go at a point by point as Newt Gingrich did\nAnd and and it should have been it should've been Ryan and the president yeah this is what we're going to do look it isn't done yet and you promote the daylights out of it yet I because it's one of the top issues than", "show_name": "Red Eye
