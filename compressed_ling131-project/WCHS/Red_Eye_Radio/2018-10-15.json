Republican Party on notice mentioned as they continue this quote heart attack is merely a beginning we are not pass if we are not civil and we will not apologize uh-huh unquote\nBy the way maybe they're following up on Hillary's remarks did you hear what she said this week where she said Democrats can't be civil with Republicans during Donald Trump's presents I Wonder what would have happened if she had one\nAnd Republicans said the same thing we certainly can't be civil until Hillary Clinton's term is over\n... of course get it if you wear a make America had ... anywhere you're you're in

said recently you've always fears about possible deadly force being used\nAnd who can say for sure that he's wrong you said it's it's going to happen if this continues at something like that is going to happen the left and the Democrats and the media which kind of resolve seems like these days the means not supposed to be like that but it sure seems to me that they're on the left\nThey can't accept the fact that President Trump won the resistance of you know that's what they call it started before he was even president and there may have been we're finding out now a soft coup against him to remove him from office\nMore and more information is coming out about that\nBut by the way we were not supposed to find out the information Hillary is supposed to win and Obama said she was going to win and there was no reason that you wouldn't when we want to find out about any of the stuff\nThat that makes me think like a banana republic\nBut there were those in this country there were ready to overthrow the will of the people in whatever fashion they could so in my opinion that was the beginning of the civil war me star before that but that with what's been going on President Trump\nTo overthrow sitting president to go against the will of the people just because you don't like the results that's left person's right and it continues they President Trump's so much\nThat anything goes because they have truth on their side they can't imagine this the shock them when I say it on other shows\nThat they were probably an equal number of people that were devastated by the election of President Obama I Do for many resistance but I got to be honest I I like to count the days that okay this years over you know all you have three more years left of him\nBut that I didn't never occurs to them because they're so arrogant to begin with\nSo why don't you tell me if you agree with me how bad things have gotten between the two sides in this country\nAnd do you think we're fighting for

about this at eight six six Ninety red eye and this whole week I'm filling in on red eye radio but just a couple of more points to consider\nWhile you're calling and I want to add that the extreme hatred for President Trump is palpable you can feel it I Know Hillary was all set to be crowded and they were shocked by President Trump's win but the hatred for him knows no limits\nPart of it I'm sure is what they regard as his unsophisticated behavior in a good part of it is his personality which can easily alienate people I knowledge that you difficult sometimes especially with the things he says he often says things you shouldn't especially on Twitter and he picks fights where they should be not\nHe means the White House see I'm being honest by answering some of his outrageous critics\nAnd he's clearly incapable of accepting much of any criticism I get that all of a few of us are but the spice his personal short ... I think I better and see the softly so some of those in the left don't have a breakdown\nOf the mayor credit that break down judging from what is going on these days\nI think President Trump has done a great job as president\nThat's right I didn't even say a good job I said great job now you can disagree with me but then vote him out false don't try to undo the election results those on my side didn't try to undo a modest when there was no such thing as resistance\nMake sure you guys on the other side you get to vote on on your side if we can\nIt's fairly we lose but don't set up ... years and use the power of government to destroy your opponents this what happens in banana republics not the United states of America don't destroy what makes this country so unique in so exceptional\nSo I Want to know do you agree that there's a civil war going on in our country\nAre you prepared to fight back to save our country let me know what you think an eight six six Ninety read I I Am more if I start feeling in on red eye radio and the guys will be back the next week so I'll be with you this Sunday Thursday\nSo I said he's done a great job tell me if you agree with me and certainly call me if you disagree more cost her on her at a rate [noise]\n...

they're good and the right as bad I Wonder when you can correct me if I'm wrong but I Wonder if the right uh you know sort of copying their civil war language can be dangerous I Know\nI'm twenty five and are just getting off the coast campus um the younger right we is a really um [noise]\nThey're they're in love with this idea of you know not your grand puppies guilty so they they're really getting going along with the idea of punching back against the left but I Wonder if our energy should be more focused on convincing the left that it's not this um this good versus evil that they probably don't even they kind of a justified in their work do you\nYeah I don't think you can convince the hardcore left it there is no talking I mean you'll find out there maybe some independence you can reach maybe some of the Democrats I used to do a show in Los Angeles where I had two Democrats two Republicans on every week\nAnd those kinds of people you could convince in by the way this or you can almost distinguish the left from liberals liberals used to be like Alan Dershowitz where if you disagreed with people you know you followed it through the ideas and and the ballot box what the left or people like the antifa groups\nUm where they weren't even let you speak that there's a new fascists even though the accuser enemies are being fascists so I don't think there's any talking to the left if that's what you meant\nBut I Do think there's great middle that you might be able to reach and even some perhaps conservative Democrats are and that is true of our ... to ... to the hardcore conservatives right wing conservatives you're probably not going to change their minds\nWhat you try to do and the reason fashion people who are open to it have you met people at school that you can talk to his opposed to some you can't\n\nUh no no not at all so you can't talk to them at all [laughter] oh no no you go you're saying yeah they've they've completely censored who they want to um [noise] yes I I I get what you're saying\nYeah do you do you have friends on your side [noise]\n[noise] yeah I mean the you know like a young Republicans group\nRight and it's you know their neighbors that hundred and one [laughter] yeah how about your professors and teachers I'm camps and you don't have to say where you go\nYeah no that that's a pretty it's pretty left leaning to you can't really get a word in and then when you do it just kind of a shame fest\nYeah pretty discouraging uh what's going on on the campuses especially you can never hear conservative speaker they won't let them talk my right\nOh yeah no you're absolutely correct\nYeah so I think you have to join the organizations you do so you don't feel alone and try to work on people you can't how about your family how do they feel that they didn't think did they think you're crazy\nNo neither do you ah thankfully I grew up in the Christian also so probably a pretty level headed\nYeah well I I Would suggest to you that you you know keep up the fight with people who are willing to listen and try to work on those people who might be persuaded by the fact many people don't know right they live their lives they work hard at their jobs and the you know they tune in occasionally maybe that's why the Kavanaugh hearings will be effective\nBecause I think the the great majority of people were not happy about the way he was treated and and what went on there the idea that allegations are enough\nTo convict you at least in people's minds or something\nYou know is is outrageously is against the whole system where you're innocent until proven guilty he was guilty just because he was accused of it and so maybe that influence some people I think people are going to be surprised by the elections what

outrageous but then it brings me to my bigger picture which I talked about the first hour\nThat we have a civil war the left believes that they have truth on their side and anything they do is justified so much so you can't speak on college campuses you can't even go to a restaurant in peace now right\nAnd they'll do anything and everything to get rid of President Trump and Hillary said this week something about we will not be civil again and we don't have to be civil as long as he's president of United States whoa we we've gotten to that point of view I remember that Ronald Reagan\nWe'd have drinks with all these days you cannot drinks with Tip O'Neill at night\nAnd he's and for the regular season and say you were battling me in the daytime and Tip O'Neill the Democrat

wouldn't put up with with this nonsense and you want power so badly you'll do anything to destroy people yeah that's where we've come now we've come to a point where\nIt sounds like a second civil war to me and you see the anti for the protests in the street in Portland I mentioned that last hour what took place between the prayer group and their group and bloody and bears knuckles and the bear spray and all kinds of stuff it's it's getting violent out there and of course we have the situation of Steve's police\nAh almost being murdered by a guy who you know shut up the congressmen and

in early November and the Democrats take back the house and that's the protection\nOf a lot of so called polls now and of course the polls wrong before so we're hoping for a bigger turn it on our side use you won't believe what's going to take place they'll have hearings half the hearings they'll subpoena people it won't be safe to work for the Trump Administration anymore they'll get you on something and they'll get you on everything\nSo this can't pay this can't be what you want to happen in America even good liberals on the other side I Wish you'd call me an eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine\nYou can't want this because just like the reason we now only fifty votes to elect the Supreme Court justice or fifty one and the vice president votes in case of a tie is because Harry Reid started that\nYou know the Democrats the left and liberals can't want this 'cause it's kind of come back to haunt them\nThe next time they win and in American history it goes back and forth between Democrats and Republicans and on one side on the other side you you can't want that's the problem is you're you're not seeing you open up a new can of worms where you weren't guilty\nJust because of an accusation you open up a new can of worms if you will do anything to get rid of the press in the United states because you disagree their views and on Trump's case even worse you know like who uses a you personally soul pose than\nYou and you can't believe this ... this bump getting this fool this guy is not an elite is like the rest of you that he ever could have one and by the way\nHe's going to win again I really believe that the election was held in two years' long time he'd win reelection\nSo as ... we're we're in for a battle and we've got to make sure\nThat the the house has not taken over by the Democrats I'm pretty sure we're going to keep the Senate and we're probably when a few more seats in the Senate but in the

it's a pleasure to be with\nYou this week they'll be back on Sunday night with you and let's go to the on in Kirkuk Iowa you're on with mark\nHow\nAre you uh I Do I just had a quick a little observation myself I'm I'm pretty politically neutral um but you know I must have been in as young as I Am I I watch a lot of uh you know\nMedia and and uh getting on the social media and just the way that they're portraying on the current president Mr Trump is just a little ... it seems a little unfair and the way that they're doing it it it seems like they're just uh they actually get into the political side they want to just ... you\nKnow a lot of like the more scandalous things like that stuff but he says stuff that the ...\nAnd the way that they're pushing it it's just purely for conquer and it seems like it seems like a lot of these uh these are that are\nShowing this stuff or they just want to do it for the money and I think that's just kind of a a dangerous thing to do because if you're um you know pushing the fact that we need to get all these young people out there and and vote and then you want to only\nReally show one side of the story it just seems like it's almost an agenda and it and I just think that's kind of a dangerous thing like especially you know like I said if you're going to have all these people\nExcited about voting and not really know exactly what they're voting for 'em I just seems that that that could be a dangerous situation\nYou're pretty perceptive how old are you a twenty five\nYou're pretty young and uh it seems to me that you you reflect what I think a lot of people are feeling after the hearings especially which is the way they treated the the judge pretty badly they're treating President Trump pretty badly now and some of it um honesty I support him big time but he does bring it on himself with some of the tweets and so on\nWhat the personal vendetta the hatred they have for him is way out of bounds\nOr I I did not like personal mom I didn't like I'm not sure I agree with him the more than one thing on his policies\nI certainly wants to know harm to come to and I certainly didn't wasn't part of any resistance I I just knew you had to get rid of him the next term and I lost that one too you didn't see people out in the streets you didn't he see people are threatening the press I guess they didn't want it to the no I'm like that\nBut but in general the anger towards this president I Know that you may not remember this you're pretty young towards George W. Bush was pretty angry but this this is even surpassed that\nThey we actually have to in this country trying to get rid of him even though he won the electoral college any lose fairly elected president United States we have people in the FBI and the Justice Department working in collusion that was where the pollution was to try to get rid of him to undo what election that it's not supposed to happen in the U.S\nSo they got to know in the first hour and a banana republic where that happens a you're pretty good how about your friends do they agree with you or you're by yourself\nI yeah I Know a lot of the the people that you know I surround myself they they do think pretty much the same way again uh like I said I'm pretty politically neutral myself and a lot of my friends are but they do understand what\nThe media is trying to get people to see and the way that they're presenting it and it it's definitely outright like I said I I don't really put myself in the middle of all that but I I definitely don't want to see people\nThat are expecting one thing and then they go vote and they don't know what they voted for kids you know growing up everybody's always like okay you're voters get account but it doesn't really count if you're not voting for something you don't really understand so\nThat's really all I Want it to me or now just to make sure everybody's rate it be\nBefore you go in and sounds like you did go but I I'll say that everybody else out there\nThe fact is I'm not one of those people that wants to make it easier for people to vote\nI think if you don't know enough about what's going on and you don't care enough to go out of your way the vote I have a feeling you're not one of my voters that you're going to do it based on emotions and feelings which is what the other side is anyway to begin with\nAs opposed to as our caller just said\nA knowing the facts and knowing the issues and that's what can you don't have to agree with me but at least go in there don't do based on emotion you you hate President Trump so much or he he's a man and you know we don't want to listen to ... and so you're the woman that I remember that was years ago maybe it is again\nA vote for him because they don't share your philosophy or your principles of course is another issue\nWhich is as a teacher part time teacher I can tell you this most students don't know our point of view what I often use is the minimum wage laws they'll say of course I Want my re uh want to get a raise or what do they call it also not just minimum wage livable wage I Love that one like it's a job of a business this may sound heartless\nA job a business to give you a livable wage no it's not\nIt's a job I teach economics job for business to make a profit if they don't make a profit they won't be around you won't have any work or they won't hire you or the lay you off when they won't hire your friends\nAre the jobs of the business they give you a livable wage and it's not the job of government to decide what wage to give you\nThat is what the Soviet Union did that with communism is and that's what's socialism is and as most young people they've never heard the other side where does money come from I've said that for years people do not know including adults not just young people young adults\nThat the government has no money to tone it just takes ... from some group of people in the form of taxes and give it gives it the others when students you know the snake oh I never heard that\nI never heard that before see conservatives couldn't win it's a harder thing to explain\nA than just being emotional and say you know whatever livable wage pro choice global warming of course it changed the climate change when it gets very cold just say these catchy things they left and the Democrats are much better at that than conservatives are takes a while to explain\nWhy they shouldn't be a minimum wage if there is you you just can't raise in arbitrarily that the government should do some bureaucrats and do it\nIt takes a long time to explain capitalism why that's the best system ever created so far\nThis is tough to be on on our side it it takes a while and if you have a meeting against or oh good luck it's a wonder we win any election is one of the President Trump won with all the things that against\nA and let's go to David in Greenwich uh let's see where that is in Greenwich New Jersey and sounds like\nHi David\n... morning thanks for taking my phone call um\nI guess mine are six quick points on that you know President Trump has hated for what he says\nAnd and I get it it's not for what he does you know let's not forget in this country that on President Obama came in I didn't vote for him but I liked them as charismatic the money in this country and you should know this uh from as you're teaching the money in this country dried up and it went back up on the shelf ironically it comes right back out again\nPresident Trump cannot force corporations to invest money or make things happen\nI mean he's a businessman he's a wheel on dealer so he's hated for what he said\nNot what he done second I I think the people in this country should understand that both the Democratic and Republican Party are are are corporations\nJust like if you want to I wanted to start our own right eye radio corporation political party we couldn't do it too so when they take it so personally thinking this is us and this is it's not an us and them their corporations and\nRaise your space in science IQ every Sunday night with planetary radio on five eighty

he was all set to but it did you see this as a woman confronted him in the elevator\nAnd he admitted that was part of the reason he was for an additional FBI investigation Jeff Flake is a fool this delayed did not unite the country as he suggested or placate the Democrats it further divided us this was all a show to delay the process\nSo they can get in power Lindsey Graham had it just right this is all about power and I could take it more easily if they just said what they felt hey we just wanted to let you guys because we want to get in power and then you can't have the Supreme Court judge or what I Wish they would be honest about that\nBut they're a bunch of phony Hippocratic\nHypocritical leftists they discussed me tell me what you're thinking eight six six Ninety red eye but it's worse than that\nBecause we have now taken away one of our most basic rights the presumption of innocence you can charge anyone I said this before with any crime you want and you don't even need to have proper ending evidence it doesn't matter if they're innocent you can still ruin their lives and there are no consequences for the IRS doesn't porn [noise]\nBecause you have to prove they did it with mouse if they didn't intentionally do it then they get away with this do you remember I don't know if you remember this Reagan sector labor I think it was secretary Donovan that's the name that comes to me\nHe was asked after it was found innocent after he was accused of I don't even remember what it was they said something like what are you going to do next and he said something like\nWhere do I go to get my reputation back\nAnd some like Feinstein Senator Feinstein have the nerve to question Kevin O's belligerence and demeanor at the hearings what was he supposed to do some and Feinstein after you've helped destroy his life\nAct ever so serene as you ruined his life I wouldn't have I Would have let them have it wears his bank account\nFor all the good work he has done for all these years later\nHow did Bill Clinton to stay as president after what he did with the complicity of use Senator Feinstein and others in the Senate those hearings were not a good week for America and I wanted to know what you think because it relates to my whole point about civil war\nI Want to know what you think eight six six Ninety read I\nMatched with Christine for I'm getting a chance you guys can hear me I was on another show a few weeks ago so I'm getting this off my chest a second time I'm very fortunate I Do I think she was attacked yes she appears credible in that regard did judge Kavanaugh commit that attack I doubt very much\nEspecially since no one could corroborate her story I when I say I think she was attacked I don't know exactly what happened and whether some of this could have been in her imagination because there are a lot of inconsistencies\nIn her story she doesn't actually got there how she got home when it wasn't exactly why she didn't tell others at the party or anyone else for decades after that\nSo now as I said we've reached the stage where all you need our allegation\nSo what's to prevent hundreds of people from now on making accusations and stalling every nomination they don't want and ruining everybody's reputation in the process\nNow there's going to be no way to get off this merry go round just accuse accuse and accused [noise]\nIt's a new Democrats strategy that has not worked\nThanks to Senator Flake and Murkowski flick at least voted for it\n[noise] but Murkowski didn't I think she I think there's some movement to recall her and she needs to be recalled\nThe rest of the bills fools who allow this process to take place looked by the way that sleazy lawyer what his client claimed about Kevin our\nFame can be yours would the flick of your cell phone do the Democrats as I said last hour understand where all of this is going\nTo remember Harry Reid starting the nuclear option with the judges and now we can just do a fifty fifty one\nAnd yet the reaction did you hear the reaction of the righteous Senator Feinstein as a quote it showed him to be aggressive in bowling here's what Joe Biden said\nHe witnessed a degree of invective blind rage and Bruce partisanship that threatens not only the Senate and the Supreme Court it threatens the basic faith and fairness and justice that binds the country together\nIs he getting that's a Democrat play book and Mitt Romney or another genius I mean I was a delegate for them by the way I've got to make and full disclosure he announced the support the decision to wait a week another example of why he lost he doesn't know how to fight these people and that's a point do you have to know how to fight them\nI was going to ask you your least favorite person that you watch during that week and perhaps senator Mazie her on her own or however you surname my top your list especially after comments that men should just shut up\nShe and she by the way a week or so ago she was asked if she was confident Democrats didn't strategically league Christine forms accusations against Canada just days before a committee vote\nI think it was here's a quote are you confident the Democrats didn't leak that letter and how to respond to senator Graham's charge that it was inappropriate for the Democrats to refer to a doctor for a referred to a lawyer hosts George Stephanopoulos asked her own on ABC's This week\nAnd what a chance or she spelled spotted all of these things called do not focused on what we should be focusing which is the credibility of judge Kavanaugh she responded before calling Kevin O's claim some political conspiracy against them bizarre\nShe didn't answer and stuff like that to me and her and she goes on a by the way even as all of these accusations about this being politically motivated being tossed around everyone acknowledges including judge Kavanaugh that Dr Ford is not being politically motivated\nBy the way she her own has suggested Kevin did not deserve did you catch this he did not deserve due process because of his outcomes driven conservative legal philosophy that is very clear to get it if you're on the right\nYou don't want to serve the process of being a a a proven guilty just the accusation is not\nSo she may not have been politically motivated afford what you used her you and your masters in deception used her\nThis is all just crazy and I I Love with Graham said he's going to get to the bottom of its suggesting that someone then find science officer or one of Ford's attorneys may have been responsible for strategically delaying the leak deploying the link to harm Kevin O's chances\nAre it's just amazing as he said those actually Senator Hatch so this the goalpost moving never stops\nAnd here's my summation and then we'll take your calls the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the ... to cross the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right\nThey chimed in because they to her left this group of four they our civil liberties group and so they came out against this nomination and I quote\nAnd he said he was born and records deeply concerned by the allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to his longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh they passed a resolution stating they oppose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court there aren't credible allegations\nViscerally ACLU allegations that judge Kevin O's engaged as serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you say anything then that have not been adequately investigated by the Senate what would be advocates adequate seven FBI checks eight nine what does it Dr Ford's credible testimony subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct\nYou mean the great thing that even the times wouldn't publish the an adequate investigation maybe they can investigate better and judge Kavanaugh's testament to the leaders of the doubt about it is a fitness to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nThis is not a decision take lightly we cannot remain silent under these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment of hardest core to the land I'm trying to shorten it the standards for such an appointment on the burden is on the nominee the burden on the nominee to prove that something that happened how exactly does one do that\nThe burden is not mad as long as they're unresolved questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assaults assault get it on resolved allegations so if they can never resolve it which they can't because there is no cooperation then while I can never be confirmed\nAnd it it goes on and on I I don't want to make your two depressed but there does again based on allegations I Want to know I just want to know where in the past the ACLU wanted someone convicted\nBecause of allegations but this is what the Democrats in the left have no soul there was no place to go with all of this except down on the other and the loss of a piece of American tell me what you think\nOf all of this application of the selection of innocence and self righteousness of those on the left and the fool's on our side and if you agree with me that we're about or in the middle of a second civil war\nEight six six Ninety red eye or the

county\nA you know typically the president's party loses the the the party in the president empower loop they lose seats\nI think it'd be very close and maybe we'll get lucky and we won't lose the

Bush or said that oh you know they'll get forty percent they can get up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote and I thought oh forty percent use they'll lose every time but you're onto something really significant which is the black vote and President Trump they said Romney got six percent I think Trump got eight percent\nOr if we start to get more of the black vote on the Republican side the Democrats are in huge trouble because they've counted on that Ninety percent Ninety three Ninety Ninety five sometimes I don't know what I buy my God I think it was way up there they count on that\nIf ever they lose an interesting percentage and that even the Jewish population they they started to go the other way they the Republicans and I'll START I think at twenty five thirty percent\nThey're in

thought she was credible 'cause you you know she had that childlike voice and she seems sympathetic and I can I be sure that none of this happened I'm I'm not even talking my camera on now\nBut I was saying can I be sure that she was an attack by someone could shave fantasize that all that stuff maybe [noise]\nUm yeah it's suspicious but a lot of people don't want to talk about it for many years to come so\nIt's just unclear I ... you know I I Can't be sure that you make of that stuff up\nWell you know you you saw a picture of her ... year book and\nShe looked I looked like a ... a nice kid like an awesome young child young girl and you think of something or and a half and you think she would have been on it like you know like the next day that night she would've probably told somebody [noise]\nUm so I think it's just the ... to me I mean just seem right away and much nonsense\nYeah but you know it's hard to read someone's motivation and many people say been through that that you don't want to say anything to embarrass you feel guilty whatever I just try to be fair in this thing ah someone got me on the letter of the national show that I was on and said mark look at you saying she was credible well [noise]\nI don't know I I just trying to think of what the average person out there watching is thinking and and she seems certainly sympathetic right\nA site I if\nI just want to take the position that people on my side or you know always telling the truth and the other side is not you're going to get in trouble you got to look at it the way an average person looks at somebody Susan Collins from Maine senator was so good\nI didn't expect her to do the she did everything factually and went over everything in her speech for over a long and wasn't she seemed very reasonable of course they hate or for now\nBut I it's hard to get into someone's mind uh who knows maybe there was fooling around going on his high school kids or one of my engineers that are stationed suggest Louis maybe there's a lot of fooling around his high school kids do\nAnd maybe he was there and maybe she made more out of it than it was because he became very famous who knows [noise]\nAnd that's the real answer who knows after all of this what really happened yeah and that's why you can't vote no and that's what I think Susan Collins said you need some corroborating evidence can ruin someone's life or deny him the Supreme Court nomination\nBecause someone has an allegation that nobody has corroborated it doesn't make any sense\nAnd that's why I but you want to be fair you don't want to overstate your side because you're going to lose people that you have to win over that's true of any kind of election [noise]\nLet me know what you think eight six six Ninety
