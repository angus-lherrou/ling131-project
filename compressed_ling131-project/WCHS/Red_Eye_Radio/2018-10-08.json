and have a social impact at the same time why it's so important to do it\nFor those who are thinking about starting businesses are have started businesses and then also those inside of companies where they wished their companies would take on more of an active role in trying to make the world a better place so let's start there okay if you're inside of a company right now\nAnd you feel like we're not doing enough look around yeah what can you do well\nFirst of all you have a voice and you have colleagues that I'm generally you either work with or you know and you have friends so number of thank you personally can get involved and\nAnd volunteer um there are ... there is actually one point four million nonprofits give or take in this country today do a deep dive into yourself to find out what you care about\nI'm oftentimes people are led into causes because of personal situations for instance if you've lost someone to cancer or heart disease you might find yourself gravitating towards those types of organizations\nOr you know you might have had experience seeing hunger firsthand therefore you might go that way so I think it's really important to find out what you care about I grew up with a a mother who worked for public television and always told me that it wasn't about making money and it was about doing good\nAnd a father who taught at one of his college for thirty nine years which which talked me you know that a woman's voice needed to be heard you know they had they were second generation I'm and\nVery much about getting back to the community so that was instilled in me from a very young age I always wear my hard on my sleeve and in hindsight probably what really pushed me over the edge as I moved to New York city in two thousand three and I didn't know anyone\nI'd had a paycheck since I was Fifteen um and\nDid that make you nervous the idea of not having a paycheck and\nOh my God and in fact I um I left bent and with the assurance of two organizations that said if you leave we will hire you so I left on a friday and I started on a Monday I named it next year since strategies\nBecause I thought it was just a place holder I'm Nick here's the strategies as my ex husband's name and he's a wonderful fellow but it just you know it didn't make sense but again I thought it was just oh until they figure out the next thing\nAnd then we're coming up on five years on next month\nCongratulations thank you what do you wish you knew then that you now have come to realize now\nThat we'd be here in five years and I would have more confidence and well yes and I I I wouldn't be so terrified I'm and but the best advice I did receive which I think is the reason for the success was a well two things one\nAnd this is this the price of the consulting world when you have good month you have a tendency to want to record\nAnd and and just kind of save it for a rainy day and what you should be doing is using that to invest in bringing the best people around you\nWho do all the things that you are not good at so hiring more hiring more aligning yourself with you know maybe finding partners um but I had been very conscientious about surrounding myself with the people that do the amazing things that I Am unable to do and I also say you know I was the grand old age of forty eight when I started the business\nAnd I don't think it would have been as successful if I had started at age thirty eight and that is because of the pure network effect\nI always say as you get older it's just it's it's like the law of gravity you just know more people yes um and I've always all my life he can every single meeting\nAnd you know it wasn't until Adam Grant came out with his book give or take that said actually the more meetings you hold the more productive you get that that's how I've lived my life I Am so fascinated by people and their stories and what makes them happy and\nThe reassuring king is early on in

and there's a high probability to show he was killed by Saudi operatives\nThey\nThey just started the process will see what happens to it next time there is a a an opening on the high court and if this president is still president or how that goes but ultimately\nNow you're going to have to wait and see what what Kavanaugh's does on the bench what effect the ultimately has and that won't be seen for years and so the when there is that\nIt's an odds game as we've been saying for for many years going back to Andrew Breitbart and and his comments to us during the twenty twelve race and\nTalking about how important the Supreme Court was when we asked the question why should we support or should conservative support a moderate like Romney at the time\nFor for president and his answer was SCOTUS Andrew Breitbart answer was very clear and it is an odds game because you can support a John Roberts Neil Gorsuch\nOr Brett Kavanaugh and through all of it you still may not get those decisions you think you're going to get its always intriguing but sometimes it's disappointing and how they decide and we'll again we won't be able to see that effect\nOr if that's going to happen or for many years ultimately on the court there there will be cases where his decision will be key in those cases but we'll see how he decides and and what his thinking is in those opinions as they come across\nRight I mean what what it's about ... if you look at his judicial history I Would say that\nAre most likely I'll agree with eighty percent of what he may be eighty five to Ninety I dunno ... between eighty and Ninety percent all agree I'm a ... with him you know we we talk about\nA true construction as some and by the way when we talk about ... what was that the or was it the location\nDevice was at the location of ice on the cars\nAre about ... what was the case that everybody has a cell tower case wasn't the ... there for everybody where everybody said well we're especially the never Trump first came out and said she oh you did you see he sided with all the liberals [noise] excuse me you didn't get your judge mhm and then we had to point out as\nMany other people did no uh actually on that particular case it was the liberals on the court or and and the Gorsuch\nThat actually used the Scalia ruling\nA you know Scalia was probably the ... the the most construction is judge of of my lifetime paying attention to what the Supreme Court has a has a has has done Clarence Thomas always is not always a construction is right\nClarence Thomas will a judge based on at times based on what he views as a conservative win for the day right that's not what I'm looking for I'm never looked for that I Want that's up with a legislature to decide to meet is these are all constitutional issues I Want judges look at the constitution doesn't say that\nNow well that's not up to me to put that in\nDon't bend the constitution or straight from the constitution in order to fit your political agenda\nRight so I'd say ... I'd say if I look at a a a a Clarence Thomas he's probably got a a a Scalia was almost Ninety nine probably Ninety nine percent\nJust doing it off the top of my head Clarence Thomas probably somewhere between Ninety and Ninety five percent ... depending on depending on the year [laughter] yeah and and what I'm hoping is that\nYou have a a you know you have a cabin on that ah would get to the Ninety percent level at least the for me on on the on on the important cases I'll be very pleased if it's greater than that but again nobody expected Roberts to rewrite Obamacare\nRight oh huge and and then you look at some of his other cases you're like Oh absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right so\nI'm a again this to me was about the greatest thing that came out of this besides getting a ... Supreme Court justice that isn't a\nA roof gator ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the fact that you when I talked about that the left has made it very clear what they want\nA but I don't think that the Republican Party\nOr I think a lot of conservatives knew this was this was a a part of who they were I don't think a lot of the moderates in the Republican\nParty fought they they were a\nAnd I will say some of the moderates that were never Trump or some of the conservatives that were never Trump hers\nBut to see it in action and to see\nThem look to see the debate points that they were bringing up to see what they want it done to see that they rejected the mindset of due process the mindset of\nA a presumption of innocence this stereotyping but at the convenience all women are to believe unless you're there was those type of woman over there by the way to one of the stories of saw is that now Democrats are starting to blame white women for cabinet are being put in well wait a minute I thought women were always right\nRight and then I then they started blaming Ivan Eddie\nAnd the case if he well wait a minute thought the woman was women were always right right yeah yeah but that case of too many holds well that's the whole point that the\n... the so now we're just in a comparison of holes in a case right you are stating that and so they're all over the place and when it comes down to is\nThey're just trying to fit in argument to fit their narrative at the moment in order to get the judge in the ... fulfilled their liberal desires and a judge that will legislate for them they're all over the place on their opinions\nAs\nTheir opinions don't ... their opinions on their goalpost move all over the place right\nSo to me it was the fact that you were able to see\nThe left and the and not just the far left\nWhat you saw because we normally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw\nOver the last two weeks was the mainstream of the Democratic party in Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law\nReject a presumption of innocence\nAnd we'll slander and defame somebody's character\nWithout evidence to do so yeah\nAnd I think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was renting he was burning my ear\nAh because ah as you said you know and and I've talked about independent Bob for years and used to vote for Democrats decided tell me how I can never vote for democratic get ... ever when I'm being told what white males think is always wrong and white men are always evil and women are always to be bullied because everybody knows that's not true right\n\nBut that's where they are so we'll get to that or by the way last year it was getting rid of the electoral college by the left we told you the next thing would be getting rid of the Senate they got there because of all this now own [laughter] is Han BC reporter who said\nYou know basically it's time to get rid of the Senate\nSo have you ever to the electoral college go to the Senate the pits our entire narrative that they actually have the constitution of the United states in ... I actually don't like the United states because they want to change all the basic tenants of the constitution so that we will get to that House Democrats talk impeachment\nA Senator Graham says you want to pick a SCOTUS judge win the presidency hey let's get back to Russian collusion\nWell it's about time there's a couple of Russian collusion stories are out there but but not the Republicans are Trump colluding with the Russians by the way no ah wow left is really going back let's bring back Colin Powell for perspective see that\n[noise] well yeah well why don't we first see how many of the protesters there at ... on the steps can identify Colin Powell through a picture or tells you buy given his name if they're given his name\nWho he is or what the it was the fact that guy that was

read [noise]\nAnd they have certain hunting I'm Jerry McNamara eight six six Ninety or right I just want to note here ... uh and and let me point out something that that I just you know I look at conservative media and I'd just say stop it\nAnd whether it was the you know in a drudge you know we know he's conservative but you basically just list things but he had the Taylor Swift story as the number one story half the day yesterday yeah and it's the number one story right now on Fox yeah All right\nNobody cares what she thinks no ... nobody cared opening Taylor Swift things why do the editors at Fox News\nBelieve that she deserved the Taylor Swift comes out in support of Tennessee Democrats who cares oh ... before she said she won't speak on ... not ... who cares somebody cares nobody cares what she thinks\nThere's so many things that we can be doing as a as as as a media that are important and I'm not saying you don't put the you don't have the story somewhere ...\nYou know 'cause you could you get your story but it's been the number one story now for a few hours sitting there\nOn as we go into a Monday with everything that's going on right right Taylor Swift as a story that they they put up there even though ... story and you know him supporting Donald Trump is a Side Story it's notable and the different because you have\nA mega hip hop star supporting Republican president who was hated by pretty much everybody else in his community and in in his profession so that's notable because\nIt's not what a what he was unique ... news just things that are unique and different right and and ... and\nThe thing is that ultimately though the the endorsement\nDoesn't really do anything now sometimes you'll see a you know these mega endorsements come on a come on board for an Obama but that wasn't what got Obama to the White House the endorsements don't do anything except show that those celebrities are getting on the bandwagon\nA most often\nBut you're not it doesn't matter who the celebrity is\nThat's not the influence with the with the people that's not the the real influence with real Americans they really don't care what celebrities have to say politically unless those celebrities are getting involved in politics and they're going to run for office that's that's the ...\nI just just a that was just a side comment there'd be no I just saw it and when I went to a psych okay let me when I woke up well you know it's funny when I went when I went to sleep last night it was there when I when I woke up to come in the show was there and I'm like All right enough in our pre show meeting we were talking about it because Sunday we always I always measure of the day\nBy the number of over the top breaking news headlines that sometimes it's breaking news on an event on something that happened uh and it's actual breaking news often it's breaking news breaking news Trump tweet that no that's not breaking news\nThe\nThe number of stories on Sunday dwindled down to just nothing I mean it was it was really well it was down to Taylor Swift endorses Democrats\nThat's what it was down to because here's what happened Saturday you had your vote Kavanaugh confirmed the life is going to wind about it they're going to whine about it a little more on Sunday Morning and\nThen as we predicted or as we told you it's really not a prediction because they are too predictable on the left all the protestors go home and it's over you know you you still have some talking members of the house talking about impeachment not going to happen\nIt's not going to happen because you're not going to move on it when when you know you want to well if you want to open this door if you want to go down that road\nGo for it I'm sure you'll have some radicals on the left on Capitol Hill that will keep talking about it but it's not going to happen for a reason because there's nothing there it's the reason the confirmation vote went through and he was ultimately confirmed\n\nYou're not going to have them well we can move when we could do this it those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given when when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working in a grassroots effort to change the minds of the electorate has no\nThat didn't happen in fact Hillary\nHad a net loss of life doors and Trump had a net gain after the election after the election\nBecause these people don't live in reality they don't look at the facts and anything they don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that ... that the process is that they slap on their Superman Cape and they're going to be a hero in a moment\n\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet confirmation process that was wild it was distorted if you look at it the President Trump was the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out\nSo there was a supplemental background check\nThere was zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit\nBut the people he wasn't looking to get credit from the the media or the left of course\nBut the people the everyday people look at it and they'll they'll look back on this process and go well one of the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean that don't follow it every day and we know people work\nAnd some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and you don't take it in like like we do or or or your average new sound would do so you don't have all the details ... they look back on this and they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself\nThat allowed the process it was Chuck Grassley that allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gave her every single chance to prove her case and she could not that's the reality of this will\nNot that the ... you know the left wants you to believe in the protesters and the Weiner's in the babies\nWant you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it nope they opened it wide you could not have given them or her\nMore of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law but just something just to stay in children of a\nPreponderance of the of of running of the the evidence something to back it up and she couldn't do it now\nI and neither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done the uh there what what didn't what did we find out the only thing that we didn't find out\nWas Ford who said that her\nThe the uh the note and whether she had video whatever the polygraph ten and the therapist notes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know that because she refused and her lawyers refused to to turn them over\nCapitol ... free game it's seven seven thirty voice if I was ... by ... what do you see age as\nThe

don't believe in the second amendment when you don't believe in due process under the law when you don't believe in the ... and the presumption of\nInnocence you really don't believe in this country right you have no idea what the country's about and we understand now on the show we believe that that\nThe majority of our audience and the majority of conservatives understands the separation of powers we've talked about that a lot we've talked about how the majority of America though so close to Seventy five percent does not\nBut if you understand the concept of the are by camera legislature you understand why we have a house of representatives you understand why we have a Senate you understand why Great Britain as a house of lords in a house of commons\nYou understand that the founding fathers of the United states they wanted a separation of powers the thing that they were most scared of was that a ... take care of their group\nA particular group of ... a a person\nA small group of people a particular kind of a legislature or a court or president see\nThey were scared to death that power could be concentrated in one of those areas and they ... they were trying to avoid that more than anything because they had looked at the history of the world\nAnd seen how authoritarianism works and they didn't want it\nAnd the by camera legislature was a compromise made by the Congress and when you look at it the house of representatives\nOr you have I think fifty three house members in California\nOnly one in Wyoming why bigger population and California fewer people in\nA ... in Wyoming both of two senators a that was done for a reason that was done sold the house would more represent the United states by population and by region but the Senate\nAnd on and and by the way the the reason that are you a are elected for two years so you're closer to the people more accountable to the people if they wanted they believe that the house of representatives would be closer to mob rule than a Senate [laughter] [laughter]\nSo they they but they wanted it they wanted the the the Congress to be closer to the people small areas you know of the country where you represented you know that area of the country and you had more power of the state\nBecause if you had more population and a bigger state you had more representation\nIn the house but they also wanted in every state wanted the ability to have\nSome kind of equal employed\nSo the big states could not rule over the little states\nYeah that was the reason right the reason the bill of rights exist the reason that we are and constitutional Republican not a direct democracy is why separation of powers and also protection of individual rights and protection of states' rights\nAnd that's why it was done and do things move slower yet\nBut founding fathers were worried so much about legislation moving slowly through\nThey preferred that then mob rule\nThe electoral college exist today is so you can't have Marlboro or you can have the big states not knowing what the future was going to be in this country where the big states would totally dominate in the executive branch\nMhm it was all it was all thought up not to have the separation of powers so power to knock congregate in one area and as we said when it comes to the bike camera legislature to give them to give the people one body which is the house\nAnd then the Senate which is to per state which is six years\nSo they could be more long term looking at a country where they weren't voted in every single or every two years and the senators were more likely to look at what was best for the country and not just the region that the congressional membership\nOr represents I'm most ... of I daresay that the vast majority of the left have no idea of\nI think most people I listen to our show do it and understand you know everything that I said but I don't believe that the left understands that at all or cares to understand though I don't think they care about it\nBecause what they want is again a and as they often engage in in fantasy that created in their mind a fantasy of what the nation should be\nI mean they create a in their mind a fantasy of what the what the government should be giving you every day so the makeup of that government needs to change to fit that fantasy most often they're okay with doing that they don't understand the process they don't care to understand the process\nThey don't care why it was set up this way and\nYou know it's interesting because you look at what happened after Trump was elected and you had people on the left you know then at at at that point start talking about uh we want our guns because not all but some on the left we want our guns because ah of the possibility of a tyrannical government\nHey welcome to the second amendment\nNow they're excuse the point that of course directly to this\nPresident but it was about the same idea basic idea of the second amendment and\nIt's often too little too late for the left they call for something something changes well we didn't know what was going to be that just one small example was Obamacare not that it was small but much smaller than of course change doing away with the Senate completely\nWe didn't know we were going to happen but we thought someone else was going to pay for it\nYeah well lessened weren't you start coming in and you start changing the very foundation of the constitution and they do believe this is this is really been the game all of them all\nYou know the the whole um changing of the first amendment isn't just about protecting their free speech because of the things they want to say and doing away with yours and we've talked about that battle but it's also doing away with the freedom of religion\nBecause your religion is bigoted\nIt it needs to go away completely because we disagree with it freedom of speech while we protect that when it's\nA it's our group talking we don't want you to be able to talk you don't have freedom of speech example California used the wrong pronouns\nThe penalty mechanism in the law includes up to one year in jail\nYeah freedom of speech they believe in

I Know when the Republican base is motivated\nUm\nAnd they're quite motivated right now I I don't know\n[noise] ... they're uh they're motivated and their unified when when I saw that what George W. Bush how many times and he called Collins and he called her numerous times during this whole process and this is George W. Bush ... to push for a Trump\nNominee mhm for for the Supreme Court this says you're not at everybody and I think one of the reasons that you not everybody is look we've dealt with Trump for the last two years the people in the Republican Party that just can't stand\nAnd all of a sudden the last three weeks I woke up and went hoops he is really not our enemy\nIs really not our political enemy there may be some things that we don't like we don't like his tone we don't like this we don't like it'd be exaggerates we don't like when he doesn't tell the truth at times but\nHe's a lot better than these insane people on the other side I Believe that that's what a lot of ... maybe not all but I think it's a ... well it's just that everybody except Bill Kristol\n[laughter] well [laughter] it's interesting [laughter] and that's not going to happen and possibly George with 'em but [laughter] but the\nThe the the the idea if\nYou look at it and I I find it kind of a interesting that uh George W. Bush the same president who said well signing campaign finance law I Know parts of this are unconstitutional but I'll let the courts work it out [noise] called Collins to make sure that the court gets it right\nUm but but [laughter] that that\n... percent of the way it right by the way great observation I miss yeah well I I just uh you know but but certainly anyone from the Bush family doing anything to support a a Trump comedy is is definitely notable but\nIt also goes beyond what we used it well it goes right to what we're setting goes beyond the the political aspect of this and removes it from the current wife\nThe house because it is about the long term makeup of the court and George W. Bush of course recognizing that I'm certain um as many of us do and it is\nAlso recognizing a indirectly and while we haven't and I would love to hear from the former president on this or asking the question uh if if it is the case with him we pointed out it is the work that the president does now we can go back and forth and the comments made\nA the and the communication errors and and things even on the issues that we disagree with\nUh we we are the original ... babies [laughter] and then\nHave those discussions but we said from the beginning\nIt is the reason that you from the beginning some you know ultimately with your vote that it becomes\nWell as it always is that buying their decision and then along the way regardless of whether or not and I saw somebody in my neighborhood with for Ted Cruz signs in their yard that you know not one\nNot too but a total of four they're really really voting for a ... and so our time to time but I'm ... and and I thought I thought to myself you know okay that's that's the that kind of enthusiasm\nUm even if we were to show that uh we don't do when we don't do endorsements because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really do anything it tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion\nOn the ideas and we believe that our audience than the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions they may be willfully ignorant not our listeners but others may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision\nOr you know or are there still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about ah when that person is elected if I\nIf I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign I'm skills from day one going to watch them on on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course a head of that work\nYou are back them in order to you know uh to to\nHave them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W. Bush or anybody else that came together in most did on the right or for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about\nWhat the work and and and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh\nBut also the Senate or more importantly more recently uh the work there and why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together a because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure\nOf the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates\nUm but the end and one of those moderates along the way would include a Lindsey Graham I was just going to I was just going to a\nMentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the left was motivated because I hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know why this royal debate the more or whether there'll be a\nA whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know the young people and I haven't seen a change in the ... young people that vote Democrat are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term well that and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you look at look at Lindsey Graham ... and the fight to defend Trump and his pick yeah because if you are defending his pack your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see the George W. Bush or read that called\nCollins numerous times ah to tell her how to a vote when you see the colon speech\n\nYeah and and except for ... yeah it's really a ... ... there were some things I disagreed with her on her speech or like when she gave\nA Dianne Feinstein the past ... the big pass which he shouldn't have done because Dianne Feinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with and to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nAh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walk through every single a point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins defending the great Trump pick\nWill re capital busy weekend a football high school college and the NFL shuffle Smith movie\nStudio with us we're clock our entertainment headlines for the birds and partly in Studio ... by which\nWe see every news from Greenville sick on this station\nStand to lose our national politics Sunday evenings that NATO sex with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on ABC News team recap\nThe week in Washington and providing interviews a politician's newsmakers his drive the national discussion from congressional action the scandals and the oval office ABC News goes behind the scenes and the most relevant information they keep you\nABC this week with George Stephanopoulos Sunday afternoons at one with an encore date on the voice of Charleston five eighty ...

Americans understand that they understand\nBasic fairness and when they see I'm not just the radicals but the mainstream of the Democratic party the mainstream of the party that are arguably\nHas more people supporting it mhm not by much but maybe more people supporting it\nThen the Republicans mhm just looking at the last election on the popular vote out the electoral college vote\nOr when they see that they say I don't really wish to be a part of that that's just that's crossing the line that that's no type of\nAnd and and when you find out that you know the the fact is they're the ones that burned Dr Ford it was a Dianne Feinstein she Vern ... the victim Chinese the one that wouldn't keep the anonymity of the victim right it was the Democrat who leaked it\nIt was the Democrats right it was the fines of Feinstein's office or one of her staffers or it was the the the congresswoman mhm right was it was that or or her staff that's it it had to be one of those do right\nAnd so when you look at it you all you see is from the Democrats is manipulation across the board character assassination across the board not the no belief and the presumption of innocence the stereotype\nIt could treat all women all need to be we believed all white men white men or ... white men can't and people look at that stage and it's just like stomp\nIt well I think you chew we have to keep in mind the and this isn't a this was recent history we don't have to go back and so the Democrats the sixties recent history you have in it because again the same side that said we're going to stand up for women\nCalled the women who voted for Trump self massaging is yep they in fact the candidate herself after she lost said well the problem is is that women listening to their husbands the husbands tell them how to vote enrichment stupid\nBecause your husband has to tell you how to vote your son even your boss tells you how to vote your stupid and can't make a decision for yourself what which has it Democrats\nThere to be believed or not if they vote with their hearts and minds and the twenty sixteen election against Hillary no theirself massage units which first they will tell you for whatever reason they hate women\nLoaded with history headlines right here or San Francisco chronicle activists blame white women\nAfter Susan Collins says she'll vote for Kavanaugh right ah [laughter] ah

lost and now it's that women of color are the victims they blame white women well I don't know Dr forged genetic makeup or her\nHer ethnicity background but she appears to be and a white\nWoman and and what it comes across as is you just will do anything to get a win right you won't show compassion to a victim\nYou will slander people you will the fame people you will say that the presumption of innocence should not be part of the the the the process you say at one point that all women should be believed than you demonize other women\nAre there is no consistency to the mindset except we will do anything to get a win and I do believe that's why you had the reaction of many independents who say\nThere's a complete total lack of any type of fairness any type of ... it's the Democrats were

doesn't sound like this is going to ask well\nIs a while now and November at that makes sense I Hope everybody running for the house in these purple districts\nBlast will be asked a question do you support in teaching judge Kavanaugh\nBased on five allegations none of which could be cooperative and he won an outcome so badly that she would basically turned the law upside down a all I can say is that this is going to the streets at the ballot box or I'm gonna I'm never campaign against our colleague in my life\nI'm going to go throughout this country\nAnd let people and things that you know purple states are red states where Trump one now what I saw you know what I think about this process now\nWe were talking before we came out and they are and I said that you have a list of ... the all the people that the president has that are on the list for potential nominees\nMath what's your boy boy here's my point this is a list that was compiling November but he actually put it out or during the campaign they're twenty something people on this list I'm asking Chuck Schumer\nName five nine three name one that would be okay with the threats have a novel is a mainstream judge our chosen at five and ...\nA Bush supporter then everybody running for president on our side\nBelieved that Brett Kavanaugh and ... were outstanding conservative jurists the other side wants to cancel the election so Chuck\nYou want somebody new look at this list and see if there's anybody a great deal but what you want to do is Senator Schumer is to overturn the election and you take the judges were not going

Frank Bruni writes\nI Can't think of another Republican whose journey from an anti Trump outraged approach from ... was quite so illogical or half a sad end he suggests that you are auditioning for a

whether the Thomas a lido for now ... now I'm bipartisan when it makes sense [noise]\nUh I Try to have a good disposition costs are like my job but don't mistake that I don't care\nAbout the conservative cause so if I made you upset because I Would not legitimize McCarthyism thing good and I think I can survive in South Carolina is\nWell you know the thing is is that uh I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning\nI'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from uh the uh the outrage that he delivered\nA there on Capitol Hill that day I think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election\nIt needs to be carried through and that attitude needs to be carried through a on important things that that ah that matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows\nWhat kind of other nomination process we may go through a while a Trump still president but uh you know making some very solid point\nAh the what was going to\nYou know they used to it when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right ah Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president the left wanted to use that and\nAnd and and really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be the by porters and willing to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was and in some ways he was but of course you're demonized now you're Hitler\nBecause you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly\nSo well you know the thing is and reading Frank Bruni is common in New York Times that none of it relates to the actual case and right what he was talking about there it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and\nYou know in Trump is you know been in a Trump has been mean to him and called him names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore\n[laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump's side with Trump's candidate I mean I did it change doesn't get\nWhat we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump it really wasn't a Bernie doesn't get that and I don't know I I have to go back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump\nOr from Lindsey Graham but Lindsey Graham ah when he issued his concern that day or a week ago last Thursday\nIt was based on the lack of merits of the case and the ... and on the larger a much larger than a pretty much the treatment of capital by the Democrats\nAnd they're going to try that you're going to try to make the perjury claim right again where there is no evidence for perjury uh you know whatsoever and uh and and so uh it's like really you're going to bring that up and he is just in they do not and he made it known he said look I don't want to Brett Kavanaugh on mhm\n'cause I don't want it goes but if the Democrats want to pick a Supreme Court justices win the presidency right\nThat's what you have to do and and that would be you know going forward a your best bet in fact if you're on the left and we you and I talked about this off the air last week look to play would be look OK Kavanaugh's seated but we can't let this happen again we can't have a third\nJustice seated by the current president I mean that would be the argument from the left or I guess the a proposition or concern issued to the rank and file 'em but the left doesn't operate that way the failure\nOr with all due respect that Mr Dershowitz in his appeal to the left\nI'm really is to is to not recognize what the left is all about they don't care about the process they don't care about whether or not there's a case there or not they don't care about anything else just keeps screaming whining crying\nA you know foul and that's what they'll do now that's what we want them to do because it's working it's actually working right now because the rest of America looks at it and recognizes that for the silly behavior and at times outrageous behavior\nThat it is and I don't know what's gonna happen you know I I read all the polls and everything else but I don't know because to have something like this happens so close to the election yeah so I think that has United the Republican Party like I've never seen before and I don't look I don't know how if it's motivated that the Democrats because\nIf twenty six team didn't motivate the Democrats mhm right and they hated Trump at that point mhm uh will the motivation be there now or is it more despair from the the the Democrats and well the Republicans\nWho have definitely been energized follow this will they be energized those additional Republicans who might not have voted\nIn the mid term will they be motivated\nAbout what about the people in the middle you know power they motivated by the census impossible\nTo predict what the

then are we developing a pattern with the second and third no they fell apart and then we look back at the first one and realized it also changed and was falling apart what they what they were trying to point out here was\nShe could have been the victim the one person to centrally if she were to give them a Dr Ford or to have given her testimony and nothing else happened she could have been the one and it could have been at least plate or spend with out\nThe evidence to back it up in a way that might have influenced votes but because of the behavior and they mentioned\n... making the uh the you know talking about having these role in her speech\nBut it does that happen all of that happened because of what\nBecause of the left made it happen because the people sitting on this panel helped make it happen\nWhile you're in you're thinking about it too because of the narrative that every woman must be believed mhm and after Ford and again her story was like ... the story itself is incredible yet right being told that was your major talking point you've got to believe\nThat the the alleged victim the alleged victim if it's a woman alleged victim must be believe we've seen the
