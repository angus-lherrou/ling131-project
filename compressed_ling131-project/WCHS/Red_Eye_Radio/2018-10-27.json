it's money that's not appropriate for that that to me as a misuse if it's not appropriate it and they take it from one cough or to the other that's to me that in the ... but that's like saying if\nYou have if you open up a new tax and you say okay this tax money is going to fund education and this tax money that used to fund education is going to go elsewhere that isn't technically misusing anything\nYou're not always you on the line ...\nYou may be line yeah you may you may have it may not be the original intent of what you told people you were going to do those politicians back then sold you one thing and politicians today by the way we had said this way back when\nThat eventually they're going to move the money around we talk show host back then said this was ...\nThat happened in ... and ... and it did happen so you can say is the did the system overall uh not tell you the truth over that period of time you wouldn't be correct sir yeah could you pick one individual Who Lied about it probably not yeah\nWell in my opinion that's the misuse of funds are objects actually because it's allocated for this and that is what you some of them that's that's you you bring something to the people and you tell them we want to introduce this way of raising funds for this\nPurpose low income because remember they'll still tell you what's going to education but\nIn fact and they like it is it's not adding ... right\nBut as it was originally sold it would add to educate him without any agrees it would make it so we would solve the problems did you also see what was that\nDid you see the attorney general of the of the Colorado saying that ah you know that overall state coffers aren't benefiting from the marijuana sales right because it's recreational things that people would spend on ... ... and other things you\nWell it's funny because you and I talked about this about sports venues or something and they they sell you you know okay we're going to build his new sports venue and it will bring a lot of money to this area well it might bring money to that block that the vicinity [laughter] that um that neighborhood\nBut it's actually shifting it from somewhere else in that area in other words people were making that because there's only so much money they have to spend on entertainment right um you know unless unless with the exception of the Dallas Cowboys where you have people mortgaging\nThere [laughter]\nIn front of city lights and force the seat license and typically they wouldn't do that before so there is that but ah yeah it's just you're just taking entertainment money\nI don't know if you know what would be a great study now you've got me curious\nPeople who are spending money on legal marijuana and I guess we could only include the the people who\nI don't know who are smoking more marijuana or just started smoking marijuana because it's legal what did they change about their budget what did they give up which in order to afford the marijuana I Would I Would love to see that poll I'm just curious\nJust curious if not Netflix oh come on and say but other than\nThat but if if you're heavy pot smoker you really worried about a budget\nWell the money has come from somewhere [laughter] right [laughter] okay what is it that you're talking now what's in the pawn shop now not ... not you're you're not cutting back on Monday [laughter] well and the 'cause that's that's adding to the budget so you're Cheetos slash pot budget where where's that coming from\nBut the judge just seeing a little bit about the lottery there we thought we'd start the show out with that in speaking of ... coming up with a little bit we'll talk about Mr pot ... John painter did you ever think you'd call him Mr Potter\nYeah here's a guy who didn't like messy so he went to work for a tobacco [laughter]\n\nWell you remember he was completely against legalization of pot you know now he makes his money off\nIt and you know what's interesting is this started a while back I mean this this is the company that that is with right I mean\nHe I remember when it first broke that this was I don't know either earlier this year last year\nWhere they were saying you know he's evolving grappling whatever that was that they you know with with the Obama on gay marriage um he's grappling these evolving but he's changing on his opinion on [noise]\nWell yeah he's in the private sector working for a company who's going to benefit from it is going to get a paycheck from it so now he's for it\nWell you know the ... remember he he was one of the reasons that the term the swamp was calling a swamp that he's currently in yeah if the DEA flies over it though and\nHey a swamp ... that that would be a good environment right lots of natural water\nAt all no I'm I'm thinking about where I live and I don't think they've found any big pot farms around there now but it's quite it's quite a swamp the area and so there's a lot of there used to be a lot of grow areas you know within like a ten mile radius illegal grow area illegally are not legal in our state yeah illegal grow area\nI haven't seen one in a few years so I'm probably five or six years I haven't seen right where where they have I don't know if that technology has got better but I mean they were quite sophisticated\nIn a row in some of these huge that boggles the mind that\nThey they just have these huge in the middle of a you know metroplex not middle but I mean how you deal but but still you would think somebody would discovered before\nIt induced in helping right in the middle of extremely large suburb right where there might be a lot of wild area right right yeah you know ...\nJust a 'cause Dallas Fort Worth has quite spread out but I haven't seen that in a while but I remember they had like two or three ... I was in period like a year and a half of this goes back about ten eleven twelve years ago it was like what in the world's going on\nI was I was a just a I was a a mile from the ... mile north of the DFW Airport one time and traffic\nLike twelve lanes of traffic five o'clock in the afternoon I look over on this media and close to a line of trees a huge coyote it look more like a wolf because it was filled out it was it was a heavy set coyote just sitting there\nJust looking at traffic one wasn't a dog it was a coyote and it was just thinking to myself man it's crazy you know you've got all this wildlife like you said it's it's all spread out\nYeah and you know in this neighborhood here there's wild animals all the time you took a coyote whom you think it's a cat but [laughter]\nWe didn't work but it's more like as as somebody when they came over to my house one time and they'd seen pictures of my cat that came about when they said that's not a cab I somebody talking about the ... it's the panther it's up there [laughter] I'm pretty sure that when he was hanging out [laughter] yeah it was like okay this is a sixteen pounds yeah\nAre coming up on the show today the latest poll on the tax plan what other issues could affect the outcome of the mid term elections and we'll talk just a little bit about John painter because that story on the whole pot thing has has come up will tell you about the new company that will help you move out of San Francisco\nAnd the Turkish president says ... killing was premeditated and we'll say about the owners of a bakery will appeal to the U.S Supreme Court the EPA report\nAnd all that came out we never got a chance to talk about it\nA lot of a ... yesterday and just are are complete and total election coverage and everything that's going on and and I think it's important because we talked about the polls but I think it's more important to talk about the issues\nThat may be affecting what's going on the stock market yesterday in the volatility of the stock market you know caterpillar now worried why because they're building their parts more expensive why the terrorists we look at issues that could possibly affect and\nHurt the Republicans one of the things that we didn't talk about yesterday was the farmers yeah farmers aren't happy because of the terrorists look you may you may have destroyed family farms that have existed for a long time\nA big because you've taken away because of the terrorists taking away their supply chain yeah and as we told you win even though the president came out and said okay we're going to free up money for them they said that's not going to save us right because that doesn't that doesn't make up for the last is that right ... and the fact that we're not we're going to be shut out of the supply chain\nThat for ... and we don't know for how long I mean uh they could lose their livelihood with farmers I mean this is for them it's it is their livelihood so that that towers over Kavanaugh and the caravan and and and anything else that might influence votes and this is they could lose their lively\nAnd you've had a ton of small businesses out there that have been affected by the terrorists as the steel and aluminum tariffs you think\nAbout the department of hit them in any industry in any region right and in our region its its oil and gas but a farming ah and in the mid west\nThere are every ... every other business is essentially related to that economy the farming economy so it's not just the farmers but it's the other yet uh businesses in that area that are supported by the\nInternet and that's an unknown quantity right I don't know how you figure I don't know how a lot of these things I don't know how you figure it in and come up with a formula as to what's going to win\nIn in two weeks all I can tell you is the issues\nThat have a great probability of affecting the election both on the Democratic side as we spend a lot of time out and also the Republican side sure what it could hurt the Democrats and what could hurt the Republicans because there are things out there that could hurt the Republicans in this election that more coming up plus

eyes [noise] ah you know I just I saw this article I I I I thought it was worth bringing up 'cause we talked about the midterms and the the tax cuts and everything else from the president promising more tax cuts are coming up\nFollowing a you know the the the election even in the lame duck session\nBut the the hill dot com or talked about\nThe latest poll the American barometer surveying before you say look that's a big pool because everybody loves the tax cuts\nEven if they don't emit let me first go through the numbers a majority of Americans want President Trump's tax cut to be made permanent or left alone ... and allowed to expire according to a new American barometer survey\nThe poll a joint project of he'll TV and Harris ex pulling company found that twenty seven percent of respondents want the plan to remain permanent\nTwenty nine percent sort of should be left alone it allowed to expire forty four percent of the respondents said the plan should be rolled back\nAnd you're saying wait a minute forty four percent that seems pretty high doesn't it right want the tax cuts rolled back but\nWhen you have close to fifty percent of people that pay no income tax why would that be surprising right they saw no benefit out of the tax cutting and they're not paying mhm so that isn't surprising at all as to other folks in there and and again we we always asked this question um and\nThis is on on the tax cuts in certain\nDistricts and we if you listen to the show for a while you know we said this the danger this could cause especially in house races that are read in high property tax income tax areas\nAnd this is the fact that I Know and and again I live in a I don't live in any extravagant mansion the my house is twenty three hundred and forty square feet not tiny not like the house I grew up in ... was you know with my parents for the first house which was probably I don't know\nThousand square feet eleven hundred square feet ... was tiny a but still I live in a you know middle class or middle class section I Am with property taxes and sales tax I'm ... right against that ten thousand dollar limit\nRight and\nMy property taxes maybe a little higher but we have no income tax here where there is no state income tax ... uh in in Texas but we\nHave always worried about the Republican tax plan not because Eric and I not for that reason but for other deductions at you and I can't take because of business interests were in not because you and I have to pay higher taxes because that's the even though you and I have to pay higher taxes that's not going to change the way that were voting\nRights not going to change the way that we plan on voting at all we're not talking about us we're talking about a significant portion of people out\nThere that are having to pay higher taxes in that plan because they live in a high tax state and they may live in a Republican district\nBut if you see some of these districts in these in these blue states but even in in some even in Texas there are tons of people that may be hit\nOh yeah because you because you have that cap on it mhm you think of the tax rates very um\nYou know from you you can go just a from where I live to just uh you know several miles north and the tax rate varies greatly yeah and then of course the value of the home yeah that influences\nThe Bible that my tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm a\nYeah my my tax rate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of people moving to it um but even aside from that if you've got a a home that's worth more than ... where's your your taxes are higher\nIn with a lower rate right so when when you see that and you see the number of of a ... and and remember ... ... ... the the the people that will be at that edge\nA aren't we're not talking the super rich were I bought on about what is viewed in many of these high income areas\nAs solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class\nRight and they're getting hit and they don't like it and\nWhat's their only recourse right now there's still a supporter of Trump but what's their records to send the message my Republican congressman mhm and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to them paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's vote\nIt has the potential of changing five percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing\nI'm just the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan and this was the one thing that may bought ... that is they're coming out bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes\nSo many of them coming out now I'm going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes not we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax going to we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually in many where they're going to raise taxes which could hurt them we've also talked about the care of it\nRather than ever in the Republican Party that's one I'm yesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears along expected decline is here now the economy overall\nMay not be an end and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\nBut it will change those small business people that are being affected and\nA caterpillar a ... where is it to the caterpillar story and then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are killing us write the steel and an autumn of the the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't a China thing\nRight it's the United states and Europe and and and\nMexico that they're still in effect mhm and it's killing them it's raising the price as we said\nWhen the president came out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] All right\nAnd and uh the his you know and the only success that that he claimed\nThe the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's unbelievable that he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost of buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing\nOn the voice of Charleston five eighty that will

I have to work my way through it but it's outstanding anyway welcome different religious freedom jak\nThank you Dan and it's great to be with you\nYeah I Know you're down obviously was in the military tell us a bit about your story how did you decide to get into writing and particularly its military biographies\nWell I have an engineering degree from the University of Notre Dame which is not exactly the most convenient for a into writing\nBut my graduate work as an engineer for a while and then for one reason or another I kept being asked to write different pieces for different people and I was asked to write a documentary I was asked to write a newspaper article and some things like that and so never really thought about being a writer but uh was\nSort of called into service that do that and had a gathering of people together friends of mine and I was telling them about my father's experiences in World War two you know landed on the beach which which journal pad and\nI Know a lot of people have seen the movie pat and then at the very beginning George nice guy gets up and give the speech where my father was there when general Patton actually gave the speech was given I think the day before the day just outside of Oxford in England and my father and his buddies were there and so my father but tell me these great stories and\nSome of my friends are recounting that said you should write a book about your father's experiences and especially like you say ... what the liberation of a concentration camp\nAnd at the time I thought well didn't everybody's father lander Omaha Beach didn't everybody's father liberated concentration camp and\nYou know they were saying no no no they didn't you should tell the story show I decided having done a lot of writing at you know in the past I decided to you know what let me see what I can do I at that point had never written a book but I you know I read books so I thought how hard could it be [laughter] in\nGeneral I I was an engineering degree who else would only wrote a couple of books boy do I relate to you\n[laughter] good yeah so I wrote it and I the first actually tried to get an agent and it was ... credibly difficult if I'd like to represent may\nNot actually sent it off to Harper Collins on my own and through a friend rarely and they asked if they could publish it so I'm actually still don't have an agent ige harbor college publish my book strayed away so uh that's the story and that's the book\nWill like I said this one that I can put down because I Can't skim through it\nIt's incredibly well written and as I mentioned to you my mother's side of the family are all German Jews so what went on in the concentration camps and stuff is incredibly personal to me when it's so well written and Jack\nYou don't tell the typical war story you sort of represents the greatest generation and more specifically what your father Joe did in his buddies\nI've read a lot of stuff on this because it can cause a family of interest I haven't written sing like yours\nRarely talk about that book\nWell you know my parents with the war and my when I was a kid my father always showed me the stored she got from World war two and a metal he had a lot of metals and things like that and\nUh it may sound like a strange thing to say but he always told me the sort of a fun parts of the war you know the any sort of interesting a funny story is if you will that happened during the war you know with his body for this type of thing and uh the little exciting thing that happened in\nA ... always would just love asking him questions because I was always interested in\nNot just what happened but what did it feel like you know what it feels like to leave home where did they feel like to step on that boat and go across the ocean and what it feel like when you you are approaching Omaha Beach and and these types of things and and as a kid of course I Would ask and things like\nWhere did you sleep during the war I mean 'cause there are bad to have a play\nYou know and of course my father would say I don't think I did sleep during the war you know we got a couple of hours here and there wherever we could and but you know he would just tell me all the details and what in in the emotions of what he was going through\nIn one day ... hours about twelve he showed me he said I Want to show you something happened during World War two and I of course it you know I assumed it was gonna be something fun or exciting or you know interesting like that he had an album of photographs and he said I Want to\nThis happened at a concentration camp and I honestly didn't know what that was and I asked him what's ... what's the concentration and he said that place where the Nazis were killing people but we made them stop\nAnd he said I Want to show these pictures for two reasons the first of which is in his body taken these photographs he should at some point in your life somebody's gonna try to tell you that this didn't happen that this Holocaust did not happen he said it did happen I was there I saw it\nHe said the other point is I Want you to make sure that this never happens again\nAnd he showed me these pictures and they were horrendous a few of them are in the book and I was completely shocked that anything like this could ever exist you know he didn't have these pictures in his drawer for whatever it was at that point thirty forty\nBears are now you know and and since the war\nI didn't know exactly what to do but I ... years later that perhaps ... what it was called to do was to write about it to let people know this happened and this had happened and my father Boyle witness to it and and just to let people know not only about the Holocaust than the fact that it did happen and it was a witness but\nWhat it was like for the soldiers to leave home but to go through this incredible experience that and then to come home and so I just wanted to tell the story is not just of the battles are not just of of the generals and the officers part of the soldier what it was like for the common American soldier who were too\nWell you did a good job of that this was colonel due to go on from I was a freedom we're discussing the Holocaust with all sorts jak Sacco jak I'm sure our listeners are going to want to see how can they get a copy I guess Amazon that kind of things\nYeah Amazon they have copies and Israel before candle and I have a website can get it if they want it autographed or anything like that I'd be happy to do that jak shackled dot com\nIs the name of the website and they can get one directly from me or they can go to Amazon are pretty much any book store you gotta\nWell I recommend you do it jak take a minute now in some up some of the key point you'd like us all to take from our conversation\n[noise] well I think the main point is that I Want people to understand what the American Soldiers have met with the American military has met to this country these are some of the greatest people who have been in this country has been the American military in the end what they have done\nYeah and sacrifice in World War two they you know these guys came out of the depression they went off they save the world and I want people to really understand it I think they might get a feel for that they read the book\nThese guys save the world and you know what they were up against the world would be completely different and unrecognizable as these young men who were teachers and farm workers and and you know I got off left the homes that they lost\nAnd travel to a distant land to fight really for people they did not know they'd only fought for the people there they fought for our nation and our freedoms are our way of life and they came back\nAnd they built this country and you know so that phrase the greatest generation I Want people to know like a realized how true that is what I Want them to get to know a few of these guys personally because I think it not only it's not just about my father it's about all up and I I Know that\nA lot of people can relate and and and another thing I can add quickly is that a lot of the world war two soldiers didn't talk about when they came home so I get a lot of information a lot of the emails and people telling me\nShe and my grandfather was in World War two of my father was there my uncle or whatever and they never talked about it yeah and I knew that they had gone through a lot of things in this book allows people to see what their fathers grandfathers a or a you know family members\nOr what the American Soldiers went through and what they the emotion pet day style and how strong they were and how victorious they were these\nWere the heroes and they used with a liberator and these are the guys that saved our our nation\nCouldn't agree more with the what my father in law falls into that same category jak thank you for taking time to join us today and thank you for

each of those teams if you look up and down baby schedule navy army and air force of course recruit nationally\nAnd so especially where there's a heavy navy influence I Believe as large navy base over and\nThat is much to squeeze in San Diego I been there yeah and\nSo uh I actually have a brother who station in San Diego so\nIt is a huge navy base cued recruiting territory for navy\nAnd so uh you know between the navy and Texas and Florida you'll see that our team tried to get those three states has always have historically been fertile ground for good football player smart football players

comfortable with using deadly force as well he allowed the fugitive to get into the car into begin driving away I suspect he got in the way of the escaping vehicle and was almost run over there by prompting him to shoot through the windshield\nI'm not saying this was wrong but here's my question\nWouldn't it have been better to shoot him inside the home before he was in the car and driving away and here's why I say that number one\nShooting an intruder inside the home invokes castle doctrine laws which give you more legal protection than outside the home and your driveway or in the street to it is much easier to shoot a man holding a broken beer bottle out in the open than it is to shoot him in inside a moving vehicle\nThree the armed resident put himself in unnecessary danger by stepping in front of a three thousand pound bullet on wheels he could have been killed quite easily\nAnd for shooting inside the home would have caused damage to dry wall or maybe a lamp but shooting through the windshield on your cars going to cause a lot more damage now he has to replace a windshield and repair other damage to the interior\nBut I think the most important lesson here is decided ahead of time when you use deadly force in when you want a man inside my home threatening my family with a broken beer bottle that's a no brainer to me I think the proper military term to use here would

something bigger and better to do\nSo I kind of mid west decided I'm going to be a ski patrol where Ines on this narrowly ski mountain not knowing anything really about avalanches\nAnd when I was in

avalanche dog deployed to the scene but failed to find the children\nWhen when I kept asking them well wait a minute isn't that the dogs only job is to find humans how come the dog failed the answer I got wasn't good enough and that night when I was walking in a snowstorm I decided I Wonder if I could train a dog to save a life\nAnd I bought out to never leave anyone behind\nSo what was the reason that they gave you a y you search and rescue dogs wouldn't work so well in snow\nWell and they had a trained avalanche that I don't know I mean to this day okay to the scene has complicated there was a lot of people and seen but I\nKnow the answer I got wasn't good enough and I don't know if they could answer it maybe they didn't train enough maybe they weren't really as good as they thought they were and I don't know even to this day because I had to let that go but I said I Will never let that happen on my watch and I set out to train the best possible search dog and\nIn our career than even
