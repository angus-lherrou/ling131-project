I keep calling AmeriCorps amongst sorry Andrew Cuomo her son to marry a ... a former governor\nA quite a legacy is topless governor now he's governor [laughter] and now you have um Michael Bloomberg who if you if if you realize the latest reports you switch sides he's no longer public and he's now a Democrat officially\nOh I thought he was an independent for once he became a Democrat [laughter]\nYeah I Would Republican independent and back and forth now he's now he's apparently he said a Democrat\nBasically you you read the fine print of it and you realize that he's taking up the slack for failed democratic leaders who who could ... day a proper impression to the Democrats or to the public as to what they were\nI mean you had yet Hillary Clinton was a complete train wreck and had Bernie Sanders was complete broad\nBut credit the credibility issue with Michael Bloomberg is is very good because the man is also if you look at comparing him on his on a scale you know put them on boats on the line up they have the same thing in common and they've got very broad experience with city and state federal governments they know what they're talking about\nAh also they're quite affluent they're very rich people and their their head screwed on into similar but shall we say different direction I won't say out different and my my ... year personally\nIs that if Michael Bloomberg was elected to the presidency of the United states we're going to have a very strange turn around the bench where he I suspect he will bring in his own agenda and at the same time it's not a bad agenda but\nHe will alter the premise on which the current president Donald Trump is is is proceeding and if he does that\nAnd God Knows what can happen but I think those are the only two candidates are viable because their populace route the northeast and the mid west I might add especially Michael Bloomberg\nReally I ... and you know I can understand that they're popular maybe in New York but I don't think it carries far past or maybe I don't know in the ... I don't think they're even known in the mid west yeah Cuomo is the governor but I don't think Bloomberg is an easier to people you support by the way\nYeah and and that sort of your real quick real quick I Know you're pressing the time but the the previous callers who tirade at the idea of Hillary getting away with murder listen you want the honest truth to that\nI no doubt you wish to a potential prosecuted that if you bring me out I got up like a couple of hundred names and maybe two hundred names and I'll bring them down and to keep people in Congress and Senate people who basically made her way easier for her\nWell I I wouldn't hold up past the Hillary although I the word was that she had stuff on Obama I don't know that you and stuff on lots of other people knowing her and I wouldn't argue with you on that could you sit down to Geneva Republican you could sit down and don't count Bloomberg that you could sit down and have a cup of coffee with\nUh quite frankly very few and far between I Would say that a Lindsey Lindsey Graham strikes me as a very profound than he's a he's a really decent guy and he's he's got a heart and he's got he's got a minute\nAnd he's got a compassion for for the people of this country\nA ... he's a he's a Republican correct so yeah you know I I I I Would think that ideally he'd make a great pie minimum at minimum you'd make or break the are exposed to a you know I mean look at Trump Trump is already wise you chose a tense\nAs the tea and it's it's great insurance ... behind you sew anything ever God Forbid goes dramatically wrong ... you've got it you've got a man who could step into your shoes and probably do just as well as you\nWell you run your very articulate and you are blind challenge do for a Republican you did very well so I appreciate your culture and you have a great night thanks so much and let's go to ... ah yeah we have time right you can in is that Hammond, Indiana\nYeah one or two or speak to the question of of prosecuting Hillary Clinton [noise] um ... you don't want more true world or if you lose an election you out one or two choices you to leave the country or you go to jail or worse\nOr our moral reasons we're a stable democracy is because there are certain political norms that we don't\nViolate all remember all the ... the ... the possibilities Democrats going through ten years of Donald Trump's tax returns after he leaves office or think back to the Bush administration a lot of people both at the enhanced interrogation was unlawful\nRight so so we don't I don't think we want to get into a pattern where the incoming administration prosecutes the leader the leaders of the ... the former administration leaders who the other party because our our politics have become\nToo hostile as it is we need to take a step back and understand that there are certain traditions that are critical all through our are having the stable democracy we have and rule of law is only one of the\n... well that's an interesting point because you know a lot of people and the other side I think he shouldn't be above the law\nBut as you point out that she has a unique position of also having been the opposing candidate which of course doesn't explain what ... what what what they what wait a second what the FBI and the Justice Department did with a soft to trying to get rid of the incoming president\nSo this is a very complicated situation and she ...\nThe Justice Department though but I'll give you one ... my point after the civil war right the Confederate Sam Hi committed treason could obviously committed treason yet we did not try to lock them up because it was more important than the rule of law that we come back together\nGood a good point can I you know I said you may not have heard me I said whoever talks in the last I didn't quite say that get it but that's what I was thinking on this issue with Hillary a you made a good point that's a great point with the civil war I preach oh who could you have coffee with\nOn the other side or a silent when it probably\nI Would probably lean toward a Ben Sasse\nUh-huh yeah he's bright guy yeah he's he's things things that are good you did you pass the test you did very well thanks so much\nHere I Am I Can't ...

right he committed uh certainly uh illegal acts at the time and yet we were generous and you know we we didn't Lincoln didn't want to do that kind of stuff\nThen this is a wartime\nThis isn't war time this is it people who actually are saying that the people who did who fought on the side of the confederacy [noise] we're finding that this is I have a different view on on the civil war them some people do I mean I I I understand that\nFor some it was about slavery but for most it was about a overreach of the federal government and civil disobedience and states' rights that's where that's where the bases\nThere were a lot of times we're fighting on that okay go ahead\nNo you know I was living in such good\nOkay now but I mean that's so that's where I mean to me the rebel flag that the rebel and actually it's not even really the rebel flag it was a a a battle flag from a particular state it took on a representation of states' rights to me that represents states' rights over\nSlavery and when I talk to people and I've actually talked to people who have flown that flag where I've had that symbol on their truck or whatever that's what I asked him I said okay now what does that represent to you and nine times out of ten it does have to do with you know states' rights and an overreach from the federal government\nAnd the people that uh take the other avenue as far as slavery and white supremacists and stuff like that then I just you know okay what makes you better than anybody else\nWhy why or why are you better than that person what gives you the right to enslave another human being so and I think this is also the difference between an old dove tail here the difference between conservatives and liberals I won't go party wise here because parties are evidently irrelevant at this point and that is\nWe engage in conversation we engage in discourse\nDefend your defend your principles defend what your argument is they just want to shout down they want to call you names now that is not everybody in the Democratic party that is why I I don't associate that with the Democratic party these are the left wing way out there which\nComes to who I Would actually

sit down and have a beer at a cigar with him or something that would be cool [noise]\nYeah well I appreciate your hamster died the guys are not following rules yeah\nYeah well ... well it's okay well

rising star who are no longer I think it is a viable candidate that'd be Jerry Brown I'd love to see him run\n'em really who actually is blue moon love I Love\nOh I'd love to see him run oh I don't think there's anybody out there that's going to be able to beat Trump\nI really don't and I think he's because he's got one a campaign under his belt for the presidency he he knows a lot more one thing you can say about him he learns\nAnd uh I I think he's learned a lot of valuable lessons and I don't think he's going to be he was a little I don't know if they saw but he wasn't he didn't play hardball the way other people that and I think this time he would really\nKind of be a little bit more aggressive and the way he would uh address anybody who comes against him on the left I'd love to see Cory Booker go up because I think each I think you ... the same thing with Elizabeth Warren\nI think anybody from the left it\nGets out there he's going to pretty much read\nI certainly agree with
