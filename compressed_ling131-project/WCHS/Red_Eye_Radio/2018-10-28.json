I was never able to get the formula right I I Am I blew off all the hair on my head more than ...\nAnd for my wife and more than\nOne and blew up on one son those on the stove concocting it but I kept thinking this fuel and I could never quite get it right and then um I had a friend or an adult friends who knew Werner von Braun and um I got him to\nA ... von Braun what I was doing wrong and the answer it came back was\nThat I was mixing chemicals by volume instead of by weight and when I'm mixed them by weight I Do all the most amazing solid rocket engines and ah and then sent a number of rockets\nHaving having this knows where but I'm going because I never found them\nAt the same on very high bar fast and\nUh and the fuel actually work but I so I developed a a very serious interest in rocketry in science as a kid and um you know I built flying model airplanes and stuff like that and then when I was\nFourteen I Begin um because I wanted to be up there\nOn the rocket or or in the airplanes I started taking glider lessons we can actually get a gliders license that fourteen um but I wasn't was successful in getting that but when I was sixteen I got a powered\nA private pilot's license and had been a pilot ever since so\nIf if it's in space if it's in the air I'm interested in\nAmazing and then how did you get interested in becoming an editor and editor in life magazine at the Washington Post at time magazine\nThe road and by driving along fearing that you'll be born in ... by the endless miles just to the radio tuned to hear him turned on\nLimbaugh Ninety six five four point five and ... do you see\nYeah why Charleston because it's my Charleston and here's your chance to tell us who makes a difference in your\nCommunity and individuals have gone above and beyond the quality of our communities and we'll make sure they get the recognition they deserve\nEvery month to recognize the champion of Charleston ... from social media vineyard felt the format WC Asia network dot com last chance for story telling us why you want to nominate the champion of Charleston West Virginia where are you more present in the voice of Charleston five eighty WBAI dress [noise]\n\n[noise] it's drier than [noise]\nWalking back to science sank\nCosting me copy in this hour we're talking about a book called how to live on Mars written by Stephen ... now made into a TV series on the national geographic channel about Mars was different about this TV series is\nHard science that is we are talking as\nReal scientists talking about going to Mars and we have professional actors portraying what it would be like to be an astronaut on Mars we should point out that even ... was a senior editor for science at the life magazine an editor at time magazine the Washington Post and currently\nThe editor a breakthrough technology alert\nWell you talked to about ... on my skin he has plans to go to the moon with the D. F. R. rocket a new rocket that he's designing which is really designed to go to Mars\nNow NASA on the other hand wants to build a lunar orbiter\nCalled the gateway and from there go to Mars now he led must seems to apparently wanted to jump to Mars and bypass the moon so in your TV special you have competition between the astronaut and minors so here you see a competition between NASA and a billionaire\nWho is literally building his own moon and Mars rockets who may want to simply jumped to Mars and bypass and moon ah what are your thoughts about this rivalry\nI think the rivalry is real but it's also more cooperative\nI'm In a very quiet way than people may imagine for example had now not I'm offered space which is an extremely young company of the time the opportunity to build a a resupply vessels that crude or the dragons\nSpaceship that goes up the falcon rocket had they not offered them that contract to resupply the international space station I think their dreams of going to Mars would have been realized a number of years later than they will be\nUm that crude dragon capsule um the rate supplies the international space station will probably next year for the first time carry astronauts I'm from a a United States or the United states rocket\nTo the international space station we've been reliant on\nThe Russians for a number of years now to use their Soyuz ever since\nUh we cancelled the space shuttle program and we had no uh no way of getting\nThe United states is that no way of getting a human off the surface of the earth and that's about to change with a space Texas crude dragon capsule and that whole crew dragon capsule\nI'm learning curve is very applicable to the rocket that um they contend the bill to get people to Mars and it was a great stepping stone for them um the thing that difficult to understand is why\nNASA would want to go to the lone anyway um they haven't they aren't they have a bill\nI'm One of the largest most powerful rockets in the world the space launch system and that system actually can be built in the larger and larger stages so it's even more powerful they got a rocket for the first time\nThat can actually get humans to

magazine time magazine Washington Post discover magazine and now editor of breakthrough technology alert all throughout the book how will live on Mars which is now made into a TV series on the national geographic channel and to me it's the second season well\nIn your TV series I you mentioned the rivalry between two groups uh one of the attention of astronaut that landed on Mars but a second group of miners\nAnd it just sort of modern friction between these two groups now in reality we seemed to have two parallel routes to go to Mars on one hand we have NASA with a giant ... booster rocket\nWell first of all let's talk about time frame of the numbers are because what must proposes\nI think is not irrational um you need a lot of people on Mars using all the resources that are on Mars and\nAnd uh they're both the minerals and the and the elements that you find them are are almost identical or whatever you can build on earth you can build on Mars\nI'm just using local resources you're not going to bring very much stuff from earth because it's just too expensive but what mosque is talking about in numbers\nIs by twenty if I I presume he will use\n'em do start sending cargo missions to Mars so that habitat and oxygen supplies and so forth we'll all be available when the when he sends the first human to Mars but I think in about twenty twenty he will start every two years which is the launch window for Mars\nStarting in twenty twenty probably do three successive missions\nAnd land three huge cargo missions probably using the Falcon Heavy rock but possibly an even larger rockets that's kind of a modification of the south and the heavy and that looks a little more like the F ... rocket that he'll be sending humans to Mars and beat for twenty thirty I think it's highly likely\nThat he will live actually send humans to Mars will be a one way trip um they will be setting up habitat and staying on Mars in the twenties thirties he intends to start building the afar rockets in math and that means dozens\nA year in each rocket you would have an eighty to a hundred people going to Mars\nBy twenty fifty he hopes to have one thousand such the fire rockets each carrying eighty to a hundred people each trip launching every two years so by twenty ...\nYou you could possibly have one thousand rockets eighty people in each rocket that's using a conservative number eighty thousand people arriving on Mars\nEvery two years it does not take long to build a civilization of a million people if that's true now even if we got this by Seventy five percent and there are two hundred and fifty rocket carrying approximately twenty thousand people to Mars\nOr every two years by twenty fifty you're going to have a very large outpost of humanity on Mars which is what you're going to need to be able to survive on Mars because again everything\nYou do on Mars you have to build them or\nYou have to build an iron smelter you have to build an aluminum smelter\nUm you have to build a fabrication plants will be three D printing lots of stuff but you will have to find on the surface of Mars\nOr the materials like sulfur in silicone the will help you build plastics\nUm the will be able to create a larger and larger living environment and infrastructure for humans\nAnd all of this sounds like a little crazy on a little while but it's not it's actually not I mean you have to start thinking of space sex in the same way that SpaceX has become a delivery system\nFor thousands for hundreds of satellites that are waiting to get into orbit in warehouses around the world we have satellites that\nCountries want and people want to launch into space that have no rights and and because there just aren't enough rockets and there aren't enough launch windows and must just keeps building more and more falcon ... and it's starting to build the salt and heavy and\n... it's actually starting to build a crew dragon capsule that will carry astronauts to the international space station starting next year I'm it's become quite a large rocket factory got Jeff Bezos who also has similar plans to build rockets\nUm you're going to have a lot of supply and you have to start thinking of\nOf space acts as an airline\nUm and this is really no stretch of the imagination compared to what happened with the airline industry in the Nineteen thirties\nUm you just start building more and more of these rockets and there's more and more demand for both for what they can do to get into earth orbit front also to get to Mars and um you can you can dramatically bring down the price\nUm because you'll have more and more people who want to go\nJust starting to imagine for a minute there's fifty three million refugees in the world right now\nHe's only two percent of them actually wanted to go to Mars that's a million people right there that's a lot of demand\nOkay well fortunately we have run out of time so Steven thank you so much

does correspond to lying in certain circumstances today we had a battery of ways in which we can so called the tech lies\nWe can look at for example sweat\nSweat salt water salt water conducts electricity so by analyzing the conductivity of your skin by putting too small electrodes on your skin\nYou can detect whether or not you're sweating\nAnd therefore whether or not you are code telling a lie you're breathing rate your heartbeat the kind of activity of your skin any number of ways are put together to create a polygraph which can be beaten if you can psychologically control\nYour body so that you don't tense up you don't start to sweat get nervous but you distract yourself by thinking about the seashore or birds or are thinking about something else\nYou can actually train yourself to defeat a polygraph and now we have brain scans get a copy of my book the future of the mind and you'll be shocked to find out\nHow much materials that we can actually get from the living brain but looking at blood flow\nBlood flow in the brain we can actually see thoughts thoughts as they are being created in the living brain this is amazing this means that old wives' tales could actually be proven to be correct in some cases many parents believe for example that\nThat teenagers suffer from brain damage well that's partly true a brain scans or their prefrontal cortex teenagers show that it's not fully developed so their ability to evaluate risk taking is faulty and that's why teenagers take necessary risks\nAnother old wives' tale that you can show about using brain scans\nWell many people believe that what I meant talks to a pretty girl he starts to act stupid\nWell if he brain scans someone who's talking to a pretty girl sure enough blood drains from the prefrontal cortex\nAnd

testicular professor hill Cancun give us a\nThe hotline number is six one to five six for eight one three five and before the break we had a very important question which goes to the heart of modern

radio there is no television there's no electronics modern technology the transistor laser is all of it depends upon\nThe Clintons theory and it boils down to a simple question is light a particle or a wave\nNewton Todd light was a particle\nWell this may freaks people out but the answer to that is yes\nAnd the multi versus interpretation you can die in one universe and still live in another universe now what's the catch is always catch some place that catches the probability of meeting that dead person\nIs extremely small so small that it's not going to happen in a lifetime of the universe so chances are you've died in our universe that even if you are in a life in another universe you'll never be able to go back to the original university came from\nSorry about that\nOkay well let's move on to the next listener phone call\nOr Chicago there's this you argue and I'm watching I Want you on the ... too much on past it was her questions and everything and it's pretty ...

like cooking or\nIn the park and all that so you more about all\nAlong so well one of our Kosovo\n... well the short answer is no we're not going to find new particles new particles would require another Large Hadron collider at ten billion dollar machine outside Switzerland\nHowever or we hope to find answers to many mysteries of our sun\nFor example there was a mini ice age during the medieval period\nA paintings done during the middle ages show that certain legs were frozen over place which are not frozen over today people or ice skating on these frozen lakes temperatures drop tremendously during the certain period of the middle ages called a mini ice age\nSome people think that the variation in the sun intensity cause that also a giant solar flares\nCould wipe out

to happen again\nAll hell breaks loose property damage to a trillion dollars in property damage we'd have blackest everywhere food rice would break out communications would go down\nThe Internet weather satellites everything will go down it would be horrible we really thrown back maybe a hundred years in the past if another Carrington event were to happen couldn't happen again the answer is yes\nBut why I mean how often what had happened again it turns out that several years ago we just missed\nWe just missed a solar flare that could have given us another camera in a band how often are they we don't know the answer to a lot of those questions so we don't have to find the answer by sending probes near the sun and\nWell unfortunately many of these probes are not going to come back sorry about that okay let's move on now to the next\nListener phone call\nHurt our economy is is how it works out whether or not Lewis Powell I yelled at its worst on or relativity theory as I

Einstein wanted that was a children's book when he was a child a children's book asked the question what happens if you could ride alongside a telegraph wire All right alongside electricity and

[noise]\nWell do you ask an embarrassing question and I'll Try and make a stab at it first of all we don't even know the size of the universe I'm we know the density of the universe that is how much energy and matter there is in a cubic centimeter\nSo for example if he were to have a piece of gas and highlight every molecule in that gas and make every molecule the size of let's say a basket ball that\nWould be that rough the density of space time so you realize that the ours is an exception were quite dense here on the planet earth but in outer space hydrogen Adams are only as common as\nBasketballs and so that's how rare and the density of the earth the of the universe is then the next question is well how big is the entire universe [laughter] we don't really know\nHowever inflation scenery is\nThat most a rigorous theory of the big bang inflation theories actually compatible both with the universe starting from a diet\nAs well as the universe starting from an infant she so to answer your question we really don't even know how big the universe is and then the question is what is a total amount of matter energy in the universe that we think could be very close to zero so let me explain\nMatter has positive energy energy to do work\nGravity has a negative energy 'cause you have to add energy in order to go into a empty space [noise] now how much positive and negative energy is there well it's very close to zero\nThat is the total amount of matter and energy in the universe is very close to zero so it takes no energy to create a baby universe\nNow in string theory we believe in a multi verse of universes some people have criticized that they say that that's very wasteful\nCause whereas all the energy going to come from to populate all these other universes but do you see that misses the point the net energy of each universe is probably zero\nThe total amount of space in the universe and the total amount of matter in the universe to add up and when you add up those two you get zero\nSo in other words we don't really know the answer to your question\nThe best we can say is we know the average density of the universe and the total amount of energy in the entire universe including matter could be zero so the embarrassing thing is we have no definitive answer yet\nTo your question a lot of theories but no definitive answer OK let's move on to the next to the listener phone call\nAnd bread for an hours worth [noise] what are permanent bubble [noise] read something about it I'm not sure exactly what they're about ... hours for you to parents I Love your show like have a great day [laughter]\n[noise] okay thank you well first of all I'm not exactly sure precisely what you mean 'cause you could refer to several things\nBut let me explain Enrico Fermi was one of the great quantum physicists who helped to create what we call nuclear physics\nFor example he created the first nuclear reactor at the University of Chicago he helped to build the atomic bomb and he realized that there are two kinds of particles ... and those bonds\nAffirming on is like an electron spin is one half of ... constant so the electron spins and isn't very small amount\nBut it is consistent with what his call for me on some of the electron proton in a court or offer me on however they're also bows on ...\nAnd into your spins not to have but one two and three\nTwo kinds of particles one particle that makes up matter the electrons across time these are the ...\nAnd then we have those on which make up the forces light and gravity are made out of those on\nHold and fortunately we have run out of time so once again this is science fantastic with our president Meteo Cancun and give us a call\nThe number to call this thing so into five six or eight months three five and maybe you can get on national radio to give us a call and maybe you can get on science fantastic with professor Meteo ...

that's eight five five Texas fifty five Texas super food dot com [noise]\nTo be looking for in Britain here's the interesting thing about today's investor and\nWhen you look at the history when you look at some of the statistics there is a study that's published each and every year and we've reference this in the past on the show that's conducted by a research firm by the name of del bar\nThe name of this study is the quantitative analysis of investor behavior on so long winded way of of saying how to investors screw things up and how badly do they screw that up and then why so ... what are the key findings that this report year in and year out discovers right\nNear a mark this particular a report was an analysis of a two thousand and fourteen so the two thousand Fifteen analysis won't be done in available for a few more months\nBut I'm sure will be sharing it on later shows this is the twenty first year that the firm has done this or this is not new for them or new for us to look at it but here some of the key stats and every year the theme is pretty much the same it's bad it's just kind of to what degree a bad is it when I say bad when I'm Talking about is\nThe difference between the average mutual fund investors returns\nVersus the average stock market indexes various returns and they compare the two so here's an example\nIn twenty fourteen the average equity mutual fund investor so an individual investing in some type of an equity mutual funds I stock fund under perform the S. and P. five hundred by a margin of just over eight percent does an eight percent difference\nAn annual return that year for the average equity mutual fund investor versus the U.S and the five hundred\nIt was I think Thirteen points six percent versus five point fights and that's just one year and this has been happening year after year after year there's always these discrepancies between what the typical investor burns and what the relative index that you should be comparing that mutual fund to Ernes and there's always a discrepancy\nYeah when you look at that here's here's one stat from this study that I always look at because\nFrom our perspective it's important to look at investing over the long term I mean a lot of people will share with you all this was my last year as return and they may be their chest if the return was grade or they may slumped down if the return was poor but the real proof is in the putting when you look at\nA longer term stretching and when you look at a twenty year stretch rent that same statistics so the average investor investing in a mutual fund\nThat is equity base or stock market based mutual fund the average investor earn five point one nine percent on average each and every year over the course of Twenty years meanwhile the S. and P. five hundred earned nine point five percent so just short of\nThat ten percent number so you're talking about a gap of more than four and a half percent\nYear in and year out this is a really big deal\nIn the right mark and your point there it proves that the twenty fourteen numbers I shared weren't just a one year anomaly I mean this is a twenty year number you're talking about and imagine that on your investment dollars the difference there compounded annually over a twenty year period the difference between\nYour portfolio value versus that of just an index value if you're just to have done that\nIn the obvious question is going to be why why is the average investor lagging just to the broad market index so badly and this is true whether it's a stock market based index or bond market based index and your question is why we're going to share that with you\nNext we will walk through and dissect the psychological reasons as to why this happens stay with us and you say for an injury [noise] [noise]\nThe longest running public affairs program from television is also on the radio tuned in for a meet the press with Chuck Todd Sundays in the voice of Charleston five eighty WC agent meet the press has an hour long show featuring interviews\nDo you have this confirmation bias and I want to talk about that also proves the importance of actually working with somebody who knows what the heck they're talking about and not necessarily believing yourself indoor believing in answer you get on the Internet\nMarketing and one of the reasons this happens and and by the way studies have shown this is a oftentimes a subconscious issue that people don't even realize they're actually even doing it and along the shore to what happens to people is most of them don't like to be wrong\nWhether it's a hit to the ego or just creates more uncertainty or more stress or whatnot people have a tendency when they think they've chosen wisely or made a decision\nThey would like to think it was the right one and therefore they have this subconscious oftentimes driver that then tries to provide data or information to support that decision because again they don't want to take a hit to the ego or they don't want more uncertainty in their life if they can simply just confirm this decision they've already made it makes them feel better\nOne good example for many people not only in their investments is simple a simple thing like buying a home\nPeople like to think that their home values are going to go up and what they don't want to admit is that the neighborhood or the suburb or whatever they're living in might not be going up as quickly as they want and that's a difficult thing to swallow not only because you feel like maybe I didn't choose the right location for the home\nBut if you're trying to use it as an investment which some people kind of get blurry as to whether their homes for\nA place to live in a roof over their head or whether it's an investment it's even harder to acknowledge that and then you try to\nFind supportive data in the area whether it's information about school districts or retail development in the area you keep telling yourself all the property values have got to go out to that I just know I made the right choice eventually they're going to go out\nWhere money investing meets clarity in confidence this is the usa financial radio show\nOnce again with Brenda Anders here's Marc Mauer is when [noise]\nWelcome back to the program if you can think back to the fall of two thousand and eight you'll likely remember some of the pandemonium of the financial crisis and you no doubt remember some of the media headlines it didn't matter it didn't matter where you turned\nYou saw Bear Stearns struggle and what's interesting is obviously going out of business and then you saw what happened to Fannie and\nFreddie and you know you look at some of these things that transpired and especially these big entities and you say well there's no way they could fail there's no way\nAnd one of the keys to surviving\nMarket volatility and by no means or we suggesting that what's going on right now is going to be a repeat of what took place in a waiter or nine but you have to suspend\nSome of the disbelief some of the things that could happen and and you have to go into it from a mindset perspective with a neutral ground and understand that\nThings can certainly happen and\nA lot of folks when you see times get tough like this\nThey might make snap judgments thinking they can now slide in and buy certain stocks on the cheap as their sliding down and this is the whole concept of you can't catch a falling knife and\nWhen we experience this market volatility it's not a time to overreact it's not a time to panic and one of the things that we suggest\nYou do in this might be very silly but do write yourself a little known right yourself short story about the last time that the stock market did this\nIn what happened what was you know share the ending with yourself because maybe you need to remind yourself in your own writing that this is going to happen we're going to see some of these market corrections if you will some market volatility these are things we should expect to experience Brent as we talked about\nYour a mark in what happens to people as if they sometimes don't\nWrite a story as you point out or put up their own personal guard rails maybe we should call them as to hey if the market stays between here and here\nHere's what I'm going to do but if it goes outside the guard rails maybe that's when it's time for me to consider making a change but most people don't have any truly defined\nMeasuring sticks or guard rails to know do I just ignore all this noise and in any market turmoil volatility or do I really need to\nSit down and rethink what I'm doing if they would simply even just do that establish some ways to kind of measure their risk tolerance isn't measure the volatility and no okay now I'm fine I'm Still in the guard rails and if they go to a certain spot to say okay maybe an hour and you do something different if they would even just do that\nIt would help correct a lot of the bad behavior in some of the things we talked earlier about the typical investor behavior and why the average investor dramatically under performs the markets because they don't have\nCertain policies and rules for themselves put in place to help manage that and when the markets volatile and people get scared if they don't have guard rails it tends to do when they make their worst decisions\nHere's the real truth of it if if you have experienced anxiety as a result of some of the things that have been going on recently in the stock market my contention is that you may be invested incorrectly and I'm going to share a dirty little secret with you about the financial industry\nThe financial industry has historically had these risk tolerance tests and basically what they do the entire intent of them was to determine your asset allocation and they will say well you should have sixty percent and stocks you should have forty percent and bond\nThere are different rules of thumb that may suggest that but the truth of the matter is\nSome of the manner in which they landed on how you should allocate was completely incorrect and the truth of the matter is is we have to actually establish\nAn officer index that I'll call it if you will you have to establish a risk score for yourself and we work with and all of the usa financial radio advisors work with\nSome analysis software here Brent that basically identifies a risk score and essentially what to your point it identifies these guard rails that says you know something I can tolerate this kind of risk and I'm willing to enjoy\nThis upside return and I understand kind of the downside risk\nAnd it's not just percentages Brent ... we have to put this in real dollar\nMark something always gets lost when people look at things typically in percentages only\nIt sometimes doesn't really hit home until you take the percentages and calculate them into real dollars and then if you apply that to an individual holding a particular investment or an individual overall portfolio\nAnd you ask them hey there's in Ninety five percent probability and the next six months\nThat you had the ability to burn X amount of dollars in your portfolio versus suffer X amount of dollars of loss\nAre you comfortable with that or not versus you know hey you consider yourself to be a moderate investor and aggressive investor and oh by the way what age are you and then we try to figure out what you should be invested in that is very generic it doesn't go deep enough but even going just to percentage gains and losses isn't enough for most people have to help them\nCalculate it terms of dollars and all of a sudden it hits home and it really means something and that's when most people can typically start saying yes I like that or not\nI don't and then you go to the next question okay if you gain this many dollars in lost this many dollars\nHow do you feel about that and it is this yes no feeling out process to help somebody really figure out what is really\nTheir risk tolerance and everybody should know hopefully all listeners do there is a direct correlation between the risk and the return and wants portfolio and there'll always be so it's just measuring the connection between the two of them and finding your comfortable spot and your sweet spot\nYeah and that's probably one of the most important things that we do here at usa financial is to identify you have to work with your portfolio number in understand your portfolio and so if you have a portfolio let's just say throwing out numbers of five hundred thousand dollars\nAnd we're talking about uh ten percent lost to you well that's that represents fifty thousand dollars so that's the number fifty thousand has to be the number in your head that as you're evaluating certain risk\nAnd evaluating how you should be allocated you have to identify fifty thousand a number that is going to make me uncomfortable is if I reached that number or be if I go beyond that number in terms of the lost perspective you have to identify that because\nIf you have a portfolio of a hundred thousand obviously ten percent of that ten thousand so those numbers are a little bit different\nTen percent is different for everybody and unfortunately our industry does things\nCompletely backwards in terms of how it identifies asset allocation how you should be allocated in Brent this is really the value of having\nA good cabinet advisor who understands this and we'll work with you as an individual level again before you do this before you go out on your own or if you want to evaluate the opportunity of working with the new advisor or if you just want to put your current advisor to the test\nYou need to know the questions to ask and that's what we cover in the audio book that were making available today this audio book it normally sells for on Amazon for thirty dollars but today it's a gift from the show simply call triple a triple eight Ninety five Seventy two\nThe name of this audio book is the Nineteen questions to ask a financial advisor it's really a guide\nFor making sure you have the right advisor for you give us a call triple a triple eight Ninety five Seventy two that's eight eight eight eight eight\nNine five seven to ... once once you've now identified and you understand what your risk score is because folks if you don't have your risk or if you don't know what that is and if you're advisor hasn't walked through through that\nSit down with your local usa financial radio advisor it's extremely important that you understand that part of it and go through that analysis will walk you through that analysis but once that's done Brent what do we do what's the next step in terms of surviving a little bit of market volatility like a question mark before I touching that I Want to quickly\nBack up on something you just said and that is you know once you establish your own personal risk or what you need to use any they haven't announced this done of your existing investments in portfolio to see if they match and sadly more often than not they don't there's typically a big discrepancy\nMost people on the surface think that a little bit more aggressive than they probably are and if they went to the right series of questions they'd probably find that out\nAnd then most also find that there's more risk in their portfolio than they really rely so it's kind of a two pronged effort one is to establish a risk or to have an analysis of your existing portfolio and see if there's discrepancies\nThen the third step is you need to take some action to get them lined up appropriately\nThe market on the biggest thing somebody can do and it comes time to\nNeeding to make some changes and some allocations are ... in your portfolio is understanding that different investments indifferent investment types carry\nDifferent risk or as in and of themselves so although you're going to look at it overall for yourself as an investor what is your score what is my portfolio but then you've got a dive down inside of your individual investment choices to figure out what the scores are", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Charleston", "day": "28"}
