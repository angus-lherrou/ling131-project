anything like that\nToday we're going to talk about well the physics of everyday things lasers computers touch screens and we're going to talk about well outer space or the origin of the moon what is dark matter what is the standard model of physics\nWith us today is Mr Russ swan author of the book the physics behind and we are going to talk about the physics of well ordinary things but we talked about Moore's law which simply says that computer powered doubles every Eighteen months\nAnd we get Moore's law because we can as tiny tiny or transistors using laser light or ultraviolet radiation but then the question is well what is laser light so Russ\nOh that is why laser light is so different from ordinary light\nWell laser light is made with exactly the same stuff as ordinary light is made of protons which are really tiny packets advantage either on top of energy but the difference between ordinary life which has a loaded wavelengths and the whole load of\nColors because of those wavelengths is a laser sauce all older photons Olga ... all the same energy you they have the same color\nAnd the same wavelength and so\nAppear as just a single color you cannot have for instance white lays out a sort of a physical impossibility we're gonna have a red laser will green laser ... as long as it's not one single wavelength\nOn the other thing about a laser light how's besides being a single wavelength is what we call a coherent and it means the old wavelength of energy the folk songs all\nAt the same time the sort of thing around together\nAnd they grow up together and they go down together and the vibrate in exactly the same path and so this means that you can take a laser light they can do really interesting things with the things you can do with the regular light

higher dimensions we're going to talk about well things that you see around you every single day did you know\nThat almost second by second almost everything that you would touch you experience that you work with\nEverything ultimately comes back to physics but we don't think about it that way and that's where the bugs and physics behind comes into play because we're going to talk about ordinary things well before the break we were talking about lasers rainbows\nAnd now let's talk about stealth bombers and another form of electromagnetic radiation and are they really invisible so Russ tell us about stealth bombers\nStill bomb was holes all designed in a few different clever engineering ways to minimize the rape you read a reflection of invisible to natural light you\nCould feed them but not really quite difficult to write a book they're almost invisible to radar and there were two main methods that are used to reduce our signature\nWhen he was the shape of thing so if a radio signal is transmitted from a radio station it is something if somebody made of metal it will bounce back\nAnd if you make the thing that it depends on who made a lot of flat surfaces\nInstead of coming back to work through radar system\nThey might reflect off into different directions so that cannot be detected I'm not really rejects would be great off thinking that you're a print simply outgrow it also applies to two warships a retro reflectivity is one of the interesting things here if you're wearing a high visibility ...\nHave you noticed what are you trying to life on it you're trying to back very brightly because if they are designed specifically to be moved back to reflect too much was reflective but to reflect the signal back where you came\nAnd I feel sorry for the exact opposite to be completely normally retro reflected which means that when they designed the aircraft have no rights aren't because their rights aren't go allows an energy beamed bounce one about twice been calling

but has a rate of signal about the same as a bird or bumble bee really very tiny\n[noise] okay well of course the average person has seen movies like Harry Potter where there is an invisibility cloak where you really really really are invisible to light\nNow there are some things called ... materials which gives you a semblance of invisibility for a microwave radiation but well what are your

behind dot dot dot in other words we're going to talk about the physics of ordinary things things that puzzle you every single second of every day because physics is all around you\nWe usually just is invented the transistor we invented the laser\nWe invented television we invented radio radar X rays and microwave devices\nWe invented the space program senator words you can move without bumping into something that was originally invented by a physicist someplace so once again Ross swan is the author of the book the physics behind\nIt's called um fourteen which was an isotope recall them which has a a radioactive property to it and\nLike all the way to react to things that will decay which means it becomes a bit less radioactive over time and the joy the physics behind this is the passing of the radioactive decay\nHis very mathematical isn't highly predictable and if we can measure a sample of the cop and fought to you and see how radioactive it is now\nIt's quite a simple matter to then go back and say well this ... this piece of carbon fourteen was captured\nI ... years ago it maybe two thousand years ago maybe twenty thousand years ago but it's really really useful particularly for organic things brings out once in a live through a piece of a poem or whatever\nIt absorbs carbon from the atmosphere and the cop and fourteen is made in the atmosphere by cosmic rays and then for around in the air gets absorbed by the living creature when the living creatures died the radio carbon begins to decay and I figured out and you lose your just comes along\nUsing the physics of radioactive decay\nQuick measurable equipment is complicated measurement but it's very accurate or to determine whether something is ten thousand years or a hundred thousand years old I'm ...\nAnd it is an issue that we have not just one clock but many clocks that as many radioactive substances that decay a different race class DNA\nWe can actually can continue how well things are by looking at their DNA DNA mutate at a constant rain over long periods of time so it's an issue that we had many clocks and all these clocks agree with each other you know we're not making a mistake\nWell that's right and radio carbon is useful for things that are perhaps between a thousand and two thousand years old who use things like potassium foresee which has a life of one point two five billion you use the matrix having\nA strong tomato sandwich however I fly for about a round about fifty million years so by using a ... billion out of your body\nUsing these cold and various look the clocks were called ... cook in walks in terms of archaeological day thing we can come up with a picture of things we can also cross reference for instance if we have a sample from saying an objection\nFor him it was quite good written evidence of when that happened you could men to become a tree and he agrees with the date of the history so then it's another confirmation that we know exactly when things happen and it proves that you\nKnow the earth is not something to me as old as ... billion years old\nOkay and now there's talk about the age of the universe itself and people wonder how do we know how all the universe is first of all tell us about the Doppler shift and the expanding universe and how we determine how all the entire universe is\n[laughter] yeah so I think some of the greatest scientific discovery is really the twentieth century were the universe is expanding\nFirst of all the way it was considered the universe was probably I think things are moving about half of it but the discovery by Edwin Hubble really the things we're moving away from each other and everything was moving away from everything else\nWas one of the big big breakthroughs in science and the twentieth century one of the bigger discoveries more recently it was the only things moving away from each other but they're accelerating as we move away and this is really quite hard to get your head around it it doesn't seem logical ... that can be\nA expanding and accelerated expansion in the universe and yet\nThis is what the physics shows it's a lot of proof really of the floats we have to go looking for things\nAnd you will find things that you would expect to find\nDo push ups as little as possible things calls it as a stall and moves away from off every observer colors appear to train you know I'm like where you live the colors and the rainbow will change as you move your position superstars moving away from it looks a bit rather than it would otherwise red shift\nThen be used to measure how far that store is away because there is a way the fast moving\nAnd the big bang theory was all of this move or if we look at all the stars all the galaxies in the universe and the the way that troubling today and then ... backwards would come to a point about fourteen\nSoon after ... years ago when they must have all been in just about exactly the same

U. dot org on Facebook we have three million fans on Facebook six hundred and fifty thousand fans on Twitter and maybe you can make that three million plus one on my\nFacebook sites and the Internet site you can see the books that I've written for New York times best sellers of the latest one is called the future of humanity the future of humanity in outer space you know that the dinosaurs the dinosaurs did not have a space program\nAnd that's why they're not here today to talk about it\nWe are we're the lucky ones because we do have a space program and then the question is is our space program up to speed\nWill it protects us one day when we inevitably face a catastrophe like what happened when the dinosaurs got wiped out sixty five million years ago when Iraq plowed into Mexico and white top to dinosaurs\nSo give us a call six one to five six for eight one thirty five is the number to call leaves that message by\nMaking that question and making that comment and putting it on radio well we had a question before the break and the question is rather advanced so let me try to break it down first of all we do I do\nFor a living my paycheck comes from the city and state of New York 'cause I work on something called string theory shrinks we think it's a theory\nEluded Einstein for the last Thirty years of his life a theory of everything each vibration of a tiny tiny tiny little string\nCorresponds with some of the timing particle and that's why we have so many subatomic particles so physics is now reduced to the laws of harmony a vibrating strings chemistry is the middle of these you can write on vibrating strings that unit versus a symphony of strings\nAnd then the mind of God\nThe mind of God they diluted Einstein for the last Thirty years of his life the mind of God will be cosmic music resonating\nToo hyper space tend dimensional space\nNow we live in a three dimensional universe but there could be hidden dimensions out there because if our universe is above all of some sort even children asked a question what is the bubble expanding into\nWell our bubble is expanding into hyper space we think ten dimensional hyper space but the question you're asked how come I sometimes say eleven dimensional hackerspace well let me explain\nIntent dimensions we have five string theories that are totally self consistent and qualify for his theory of everything now we don't like that\nWe think the universe should be unique in some sense so why should the universe create not one but five mathematically self consistent university this sounds a little strange right well Edwin at Princeton\nFound out the reason why if you go to one more dimension up\nInto the lemons dimension\nIs very big and that energy is addition to push that galaxies apart in fact that's why the big bang\nBang that's why the universe is expanding but the calculation of dark energy has eluded businesses up to now what does that mismatch\nMismatch between theory and experiment is ten to the one hundred and twenty that take out a sheet of paper right down the number one and then ride a hundred and twenty ... zeroes after that one\nThat's a mismatch between theory and experiment now\nThat's in Paris team and this is the biggest investment in all of science the biggest mismatch you know all of science is tender that one hundred and Twenty one with a hundred and twenty zeroes after it\nThe mismatch between the experimental value a dark energy and the theoretical value of dark energy so what are you going to do\nIf you ever find a solution to the dark energy problem you're going to call me\nAn well I'm a generous man all split the Nobel Prize with you\nOK to ask what it's worth it's worth a Nobel Prize\nIf you can figure out why dark energy is so dark and so energetic\nOkay well let's move right on now to the next listener phone call\nHello Jessie for you I watch it on your question already shaped me out on some of the um I had another question about the future of your heart when they put on uses\nAnd you had an interview and I think it's the opposite but anyway you were talking about you know dramatic and had a question about it like when we go

Congo\nUm how much energy is in the universe [noise]\n[noise]\nDo you ask an embarrassing question and I'll Try and make a stab at it first of all we don't even know the size of the universe I'm we know the density how the universe that is how much energy and matter there is in a cubic centimeter so for example if he were to have a piece of gas\nAnd highlight every molecule in that gas and make every molecule the size of let's say basketball that would be the rough\nThe density of space time\nSo you realize that the earth is an exception were quite dense here on the planet earth but in outer space hydrogen Adams early as common as\nBasketballs and so that's how a rare the density of the or the or the universe is that the next question is well how big is the entire universe we don't really know\nHowever inflation scenery is the most rigorous theory of the big bang inflation theories actually compatible bowl with the universe starting from a diet\nAs well as the universe starting from an infant she\nSo to answer your question we really don't even know how big the universe is and then the question is what is a total amount of matter energy in the universe that we think could be very close to zero so let me explain matter has positive energy energy to do work\nGravity has a negative energy 'cause you have to add energy in order to go into an empty space [noise] now how much positive and negative energy is there well it's very close to zero [noise]\nThat is the total amount of ...\nOr and energy in the universe is very close to zero so it takes no energy to create a baby universe now in string theory we believe in a multi verse of universes some people have criticized that\nThey say that that's very wasteful cause whereas all the energy going to come from to populate all these other universes but do you see that misses the point the net energy of each universe is probably zero the total amount of space in the universe and the total amount of matter in the universe add up\nAnd when you add up those two you get your oh\nSo in other words we don't really know the answer to your question the best we can say is\nWe know the average density of the universe and the total amount of energy in the entire universe including matter could be zero so the embarrassing thing is we have no definitive answer yet\nTo your question a lot of theories but no definitive answer\nOK let's move on to the next listener phone call\nIsn't Britain for an ... an hour's work where our hurry bubble I read something about it I'm not sure exactly what they're about but er I ... to ... and I love your show a great day [laughter] [noise]\nOkay thank you well first of all I'm not exactly sure precisely what you mean 'cause he could refer to several things\nBut let me explain Enrico Fermi was one of the great quantum physicists who helped to create what we call nuclear physics for example he created the first nuclear reactor at the University of Chicago\nHe helped to build the atomic bomb and he realized that there are two kinds of particles for millions and bows on\nA for me on is like an electron\nSpin is one have a ... constant so the electron spins and it's a very small amount but it is consistent with what is called uh for me on some of the electron proton and acquired or offer me on however they're also bows on\nThose bonds had enters your spins not half but one two and three so we have two kinds of particles one particle that makes up matter to electrons and protons these are the ... and then\nWe have those ions which make up the forces light and gravity are made out of those on\nHold and fortunately we have run out of time so once again this is science fantastic\nWith professor mean she'll Cancun and give us a call the number to call is six one to five six or eight months three five and maybe you can get on national radio to give us a call and maybe you can get on science fantastic with professor Michio Kaku [noise]\n\n\n\nMm [noise]\n\nRaise your space in science IQ every Sunday night with planetary radio on five eighty WC H.

a question about reaction as propulsion many people have tried to create that 'cause then you could basically have motion without the rocket fuel thing about that rockets without rocket fuel however ... has\nThe last word for every action there's a reaction and we know that because we've tested it on rockets airplanes we've tested it on bulldozers skyscrapers every time there's an action there is a reaction\nAnd that's going to fight in something called the conservation of momentum so sorry about that if you want to venture I Would suggest you try something else other than something that violates the ... law motion however if you do have a theory what are the steps that you should pursue\nWell first of all you may want to take a patent out on it\nHowever I warn you that if you have a patent for a perpetual motion machine usually they ask for a demonstration model so many people over the centuries\nHave claimed to have created a perpetual motion machine energy from nothing in fact in antiquity going back thousands of years [noise]\nEnterprising adventures we'd go to the king\nAnd claimed that they can get energy for free [noise] usually it was some kind of spinning wheel of some sort\nOf course because of friction you basically lose energy you'd have to add energy from the outside but anyway over thousands of years people have tried to get inventions are sponsored by the king in which case\nIt could become millionaires in the process however\nCenturies of analyzing all these professional motion machines\nWe physicists have come to the inclusion that there's something called the conservation of energy\nWhich in turn is a byproduct of Newton's laws of motion so other words the patent office will ask you for a demonstration model don't just think you can create something in the laboratory and become an instant millionaire\nHowever I Do suggest that if you do have an idea\nThat and to talk to a patent attorney\nOr if you simply want recognition for your idea and not necessarily to commercialize it publish it in a magazine [noise] there are several magazines you can submitted to there's physical review which is a magazine at my organization\nThe American Physical Society it is the premier American physics magazine physical review\nThere's also a European Magazine nuclear physics for example a published by L. severe publishers inning in Europe\nThey are one of the leading publishers of nuclear information um papers in the nuclear field so if you have an idea and you don't want a patented but do you want recognition for that theory then you may want to send it to these magazines and then you will get a referee\nSometimes more than one referee in fact I referee other people's papers all the time\nMagazine's send me articles to referee for

Cassini you're calling from and then asked that question make that comment\nAnd perhaps you can get on national radio\n[noise] okay let's move on down to the next listener or by the way I forgot I have to answer that question about dark matter before we move on dark matter was first founded by astronomers decades ago but he was dismissed because it was too ... posture is\nFor example the Milky Way galaxy spins it looks like a penny will in fact\nBut it's been ten times too fast by rights is should fly apart\nIn which case the earth should have been flying into outer space a billions of years ago but the Milky Way galaxy is quite stable and we see these galaxies everywhere in the universe that are very stable but all of them are spinning about ten times too fast\nEither this means that Newton was wrong and we are very reluctant to give on Newton's laws of gravity either do it and it was wrong or there's a new form of matter in a halo surrounding the galaxy keeping the galaxy intact\nPreventing it from flying apart that dark matter now we have maps and dark matter dark matter is invisible because when you photograph these galaxies we don't see a halo around these galaxies are all we did see opinion will\nBut they're stable and they spent ten times too fast and we now have maps of dark matter when the light goes through glass it bans light\nSo how do you know that this glass inside your glasses while classes and reasonable so how do you know that there's a glass inside your glasses because light bends when he goes through your glass and that's why you have eyeglasses [noise] same thing with dark matter when like goes to this invisible matter bends\nThan using a computer we can calculate how much dark matter there is by calculating how much bending of light there is and you can Google it you can actually see maps of dark matter\nReconstructed using computers looking\nAt the bending of starlight well it took a short break and afterwards we'll talk about what is dark matter anyway and\nWhy should use care once again this is science fantastic give us a call [noise] six one to five six for one brief I had asked that question that you've always wanted to ask on national radio [noise]\n\n\n\nRiver wonder how big going into Syria more created or social media has honors of companies and individuals make their own currency was watching delusions are making the world more transparent and giving back to the people's\nPersonal media companies raised tens of millions in the past year alone would bring in marketing fuels look first equal to avoid worldwide do miss the currency revolution\nWas the first of all media dot com V.

the presence of dark matter what is it and why why should we care but first of all is there much in before we have maps of dark matter which surrounds the Milky Way galaxy holding the galaxy together so that it doesn't fly apart\nAnd the next question is what is dark matter made of\nWell the short answer is we don't know that the Nobel Prize waiting for that person who could finally tell us what dark matter is however there are many theories\nSo you have two finals one final which is a black hole which absorbs everything and the other funnel ... matter and that's a wide hole and then several of my colleagues have said maybe that's the big bang\nMay be the big bang is really connected to a parent universe now as bizarre as this sounds [noise] this is compatible with an idea called

preposterous as this sounds hideous compatible with all the data\nWhen you look at the data from our big bang it is compatible with the idea that these big bangs happen all the time now does that prove it\nNo it only shows that are particular universe seems to have originated from a ... process from a parent universe but it is not prove\nProve we may have to go to another satellite called Lisa laser ... space antenna\nWhich is going to be a gravity wave detector in outer space which may give us baby pictures of the instant of creation\nThe instead of creation the exact microsecond when the baby universe emerged out of the womb\nAnd the hope is will detect evidence of a new record on a bill to record that connects our baby universe to a parent universe sounds crazy yeah but hey this is what we do for a living we physicists look at the data\nAnd no matter where it was a day to Texas that's where we go and so far our data takes us in the direction of inflation which in turn makes possible and multi verse of universes\nOkay let's move on now to the next listener phone call\nMy name is ... ... I'm In Colorado\nI Am not currently listener too but I Do listen to ours or Colorado Public broadcasting stations\nAnd my question is if the maximum speed limit for any object or electromagnetic radiation in space time is the speed of light light as if the space time itself\nCan X and faster than the speed of light there would be wonderful if we could answer that question from here for ...\n[laughter] okay well Einstein statement that nothing and go faster than the speed of light is slightly incorrect\nA more precise table it'd be nothing material can go faster than the speed of light you see nothing\nCan go faster than the speed of light I repeat nothing this\nCan go faster than the speed of light in other words nothing can stretch faster than the speed of light and the big bang was when we have this explosion of a tiny area which stretched to give us the universe of today\nAnd that stretching process was not material it was just emptiness empty space can expand faster than the speed of light\nBut material objects cannot go faster than the speed of light\nSo for example a here's an example from my use when I was a kid I used to take a flashlight and I would sweep across the night sky with a flashlight\nThe flashlight went from one end of the universe to the other end of the universe thousands and thousands of light years and the other direction and I said to myself now wait a minute I just violated Einstein's theory of relativity because the image that sweeps across the sky is going faster than the speed of light\nWell I'm a physicist now and now I realize that\nYes the image when faster than the speed of light but material object that is photons particles of light each particle of light did not go faster\nThan the speed of light here's another example let's see I have a bummer that dropped a whole bunch of bombs in a string\nAnd I'm On the ground and I watch all these bombs hit the ground [noise] each bomb is moving very slowly slowly falls toward the earth [laughter] well when I look at the image point the image point out where the bombs hit the ground and rapid eagle bum bump bum bump bum bump in a line\nI realized that that can go faster than the velocity of the bomb itself\nSouthern where's the image can go faster than the speed of light because it's not material but not the bomb itself [noise] okay well unfortunately we have run out of time in this segment of science fantastic\nOnce again you can always give us a call that six one to five six or eight one two three five and leave that question make that comment that perhaps you can get on national radio once again this is science and testing with the passer Michio cocker [noise]\n\nThis is ... different ones of freedom you a military veteran talk radio show this week on the front lines or freedom will discuss Bridget Gabriel's book rise in defense of Judeo Christian values then we're going to learn by war animals we're also going to meet our newest contributor Matt Hayes you offer comments are military be battle ready\nAnd we'll discuss this week so she got me football games\nSunday afternoons at issue on Ninety six five four point five and five eighty WC age yes\nDon't this sports weekly with Jordan poly or if you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen man football to adopt physical game you know that\nThe Buffalo Bills suck and you know that so I mean going on your teammates at half time is is pretty lame especially since you didn't have\nThe gall to stand up and look at them and say gosh I Can't do to you and proudly to your coach and had him in up to the teams out Wednesday afternoons at one on Charles ...

because we talk about this in in our world all the time the importance of having liquidity the importance of having access to your money this can also work against you yeah in that environment\nObviously the stock in such a large chunks in those two examples\nWas liquid for those individuals it actually ends up driving the value down for everyone else's the flood the market with those shares of stock and also one could argue that depending upon what your role is maybe you shouldn't necessarily have entirely free liquidity when it comes to\nShares of stock or that you are a key key role player within those companies so that that's a whole 'nother discussion that's well beyond the typical boundaries of\nFinancial in retirement planning for most Americans but it is important to realize that that liquidity\nCan come in very different structures so liquidity can come in the form of a individual stock as you were just suggesting there mark but liquidity can equally come in the form of a money market or a checking account\nAnd yet in terms of what they represent throughout the remainder of the triangle the investment triangle that is they're very dramatically different investment vehicles one is geared\nTowards growth that of the individual stock and one is geared towards safety the checking account or the money market account and yet both of them\nFull service financial planning in one place this is the usa financial radio show\nOnce again with Mike Walters Here's Mark Martin Smith [noise]\nWelcome back to the program if you invest in the stock market [noise] few invested in bomb if you invest\nPeriod my hunch I'm going to make a very bold statement\nI Will make a statement that the majority of view that invest probably invested in a way that is not can grew in with how you feel about risk and the reason why I say that\nIs it's not your fault that our financial it's the financial industries fault and Mike when we talk with clients about this and then we share with them how we\nApproach their own risk awareness let's talk a little bit about the difference that we take versus what the industry has always taken\nAnd I want to first started out by talking about the fault that is risk tolerance questionnaires because everybody's been through it if you invest in a four one K. if you work with a financial advisor I guess it doesn't really matter you've probably gone through this process of a risk tolerance questionnaire and you've answered a handful of ...\nAbout the problem with this because this is really important as it relates to the investment triangle corner that is the growth corner\nRemark to a certain degree you've you've already kind of uncovered the big looming issue kind of the elephant in the room that no one ever wants to talk about if you will and that is the idea of risk tolerance the idea of risk tolerance the way the financial industry has approached it\nFrom our opinion it is a flawed approach the concept of risk tolerance\nTakes basic information and then shoe horns someone into a slot on a sheet of paper and a computer program to identify what level of risk\nThey should be able to tolerate but the premise at its core we believe has many flaws for example if\nIf you had to individuals that both went to work in the same company let's say Thirty years ago and at the age of twenty five\nThey entered into the four o one K plan and now Thirty years later at the age of fifty five they're rolling over an IRA opening up a new investment whatever the case might be\nOver those Thirty years those two individuals have both been in that four one K. plant at their company for the exact same amount of time it just so happens that one of the individuals is the CFO of the company who's very\nNumerically oriented and the other individual was a a a manager let's say in the HR department\nThe manager in the HR department maybe once every year or two would take a look at where they were investing money in their four one K. and just make sure that we're putting in the amount of money they hoped and they just kind of hung on and hope things when the way they\nThey wanted them to go inside of that four one K. on the other hand the CFO had a much more active involvement with choosing where they wanted to be invested which funds they wanted to use and the four one K. over those years and so on and now here they are at the age of fifty five and they're opening up a new investment account and they have a risk tolerance questionnaire flopped in front of them\nAnd asked them how many years of investment experience do you have\nAt this stage of the game they're both now answering Thirty years but do they have the same Thirty years\nOf investment experiences the real issue and so there is a distinct difference between risk tolerance approaches which are very cold and systematic for lack of a better way of explaining it\nVersus what I Will call risk awareness and risk awareness gets more into your psyche and your character about how you feel and how you are motivated about money how what kind of fears you have about last\nHow you approach money and all that gets wrapped around money in terms of the potential for gains and losses in how you can stomach battered you can't stomach that and really\nIt comes down to these risk tolerance questionnaires are are stacked against you I mean the truth of the matter is is like you pointed out with that example in that particular question\nIt's going to score those two individuals exactly the same way it's going to assign you know a certain waiting to that the answer to that question even though they're going to give theoretically the same answer we know that that question is a is a bunch of garbage and it doesn't really factory in to how much\nRisk can they truly stomach what is their real understanding and tolerance for risk and so let's talk a little bit about the approach that we use here at usa financial and all of the usa financial radio advisors use when they're working with\nClients to identify what is the right amount of risk because let's face it when when we're looking at the corner of the investment triangle that his growth\nYou have to recognize that growth and risk\nAre going to be tied together now that there might be some ways to reduce some of the risk while still enjoying that growth but at the same time you have to understand that those two pieces of the puzzle are going to walk\nHand in hand together so when we look at risk when we look at identifying what is the right amount of risk\nFor our clients here at usa financial we use this this notion of risk awareness but specifically we identify your personal risk number now for a moment I'm going to I'm going to step out of the world of investments to sharing example because I think this is going to help you understand\nWhen I got married to my wife\nIt was time for us to purchase a new mattress and we went to the mattress store and if you've ever gone through this exercise it's almost comical to go through where\nThere's all these mattresses laid out on the on the showroom floor and you started hopping on them and whether or not you can really identify what's the right field for you but\nIt became very apparent that I like more of a firm mattress and my wife was more interested in a squishy mattress is what I Will say right I Believe the term is saw as unless you're being derogatory ... so we go through this exercise and after we done that\nThe salesman says well you know there is an option that you could consider and there's this other manufacturer and they have come up with something known as a sweet number bed\nAnd the concept is that we each have our number of firmness that that mattress will have in the sleep number bed fortunately\nCan allow one side that to have one level a firmness and the other to not have that level of firmness now\nWe didn't end up purchasing that because I ended up convincing my wife that a firmer mattress was better for her and so we I Want out but in the end the concept of the sleep number is very akin to our concept of the risk number let's let's talk about our personal risk number\nHow we go about determining what that is Well Mark why I really like the example you just went through although I think you took full advantage of your wife way shape or form it sounds like but I'm gonna I'm gonna let that pass for now the reason I really like the example you just gave\nIs because a fifty year old might have the same sleep number as a twenty five year old but then might have an entirely different", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "07"}
