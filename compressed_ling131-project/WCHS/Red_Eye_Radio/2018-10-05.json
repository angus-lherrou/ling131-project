Wilson on the scene I'm you know the the family or was the first to commissioned an autopsy\nThen that autopsies the one that showed the hands up don't shoot never heritage was alive\nIt's still being used today yes as a rallying cry that never happened\nOr that is unacceptable in America right you know we we talk about the Democrats are always talking about the fascist on the right well if you listen to what we believe mhm and what we believe about the presumption of innocence whether it's a criminal trial a civil trial or\nJust public opinion in general or a political trial still it's\nThe same thing you judge these cases you judge cases and you'd and and you judge the guilt or innocence based on the evidence that exist not just an allegation\nAlone and and the thing is I'm saying this with passion but I really don't have to because\nEvery single Democrat listening right now every single liberal and democratic protesting yesterday and they all know it but they are willing to throw it overboard mhm you know how they do it because of the first ones\nMany of those who are in a you know who ah were arrested yesterday a will would demand due process under you know due process under the law ... but the fact is they know it but they will reject it when it comes to their personal politics\nFascism leads the mindset of fascism leads in them when it's what they want\nWhen it comes to how they're going to be treated no you must follow the constitution completely but treating somebody else a constitution be damned the spirit of the constitution be damned the mindset of the presumption of innocence and that evidence is the only thing that leads and\nShould lead is thrown out the window because we want what we want\nYou know when it comes down to I was following a case here in Texas where a man had been wrongly found guilty of murder and all that and you have a Nineteen years in prison and got out and twenty six team they wanted to be fully exonerated was working to that end\nAnd finally it happened it was full exonerated so that's a total of Twenty one years where he was either behind bars are having is you know his name essentially associated with a murder that happened if he was not responsible for so I was doing some research just to try and refresh my memory\nOn other cases and there was a man who was accused of rape\nAnd spent decades\nBehind bars um it was rape and assault and something else or I think a aggravated assault and rape or in a third charge that I Can't remember but he was behind bars for thirty one years\n\nBefore he was proved it was proven that he was not the person responsible now mistakes happen in the justice system or we don't have we have the DNA technology now or that can prove that it wasn't a you know or their DNA of the scene or whatever it is\nBut you think about you know the\nLabel that goes with being falsely accused and there was a great burden that comes with that for a reason now sometimes it's that the work done in the investigation wasn't wasn't right sometimes it's an overzealous prosecutor on them\nIn the legal setting looking to get a political win but\nSometimes witnesses get it wrong well and and in one case in in the murder case it was it was a\nCouple of jailhouse witnesses that helped to seal the deal and you you look at that and and you you think to yourself\nWe often jumped to that conclusion even in a legal setting politics can come in and if you've got an overzealous prosecutor that insist on getting their way getting the when Duke lacrosse team yeah exactly you know well it must have happened because the media was reporting it right\nWell no it wasn't and and\nWe forget those moments I don't know what happened to Dr Ford I don't know what didn't happen but we look again at the situation in terms of the evidence and what backs up her story nothing zero\nEight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nOne eight six six months he read read on the radio [noise]\nIf you have driven

[noise]\nAnd ... is Eric hunting I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety ah ah right I think one of the last caller is referring to the letter a Chuck Grassley Sunday a letter to the lawyers of a doctor for it and it said I'm\nA I'm writing in response to your letter dated October second you said Dr Ford is was yesterday and you said Dr Ford is going to turn over her a documents\nTo the FBI but my request to view was not for the documents to be turned over to the FBI ... to ... the documents to the Senate\nJudiciary Committee response on behalf of the client is a non secular the constitution charges the Senate with advice and the president and his nomination senators have a constitutional obligation to investigate and evaluate independently the president's nominees are obligation as unrelated to anything the FBI does\nThat's why we just don't vote on nominees after the president loans us or the FBI background investigation we have to make our own assessment the U.S Senate does not control the FBI if you have an objection of how the FBI conducts investigations take it up with director rate\nBut don't raise that objection is a reason not to respond to this committee's demand for relevant evidence the FBI's investigative decisions aren't our concern\nEven if the FBI never interviewed Dr Ford or interviews or ten times this committee as a constitutional obligation to investigate Dr Ford's allegations and that's what we've been doing since we became aware of or allegations\nIt's not even clear to me what purpose turning over the over those materials to the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that over ... over\nTo us yes as we just said that's got was we stopped\nThat's the only purpose the FBI search such always and I always thought the last caller says well their ... their political what the investigation political ... the ... the the FBI only facilitates the interviews they conduct the interviews because they have the resources and the training and that's it's that simple right\nAnd and so it doesn't make it again this this is where her lawyers are bringing up something that isn't even relevant to the investigation to begin with because for the million times there is no FBI investigation the only investigation that's been going on is the Senate Judiciary investigation what because\nIt it just shows you how\nAre the the\nLawyers for Dr ... either\nCompletely clueless or they didn't want those notes to come out because have they been given to the FBI\nAgain assume the FBI decided to respond to them and take those ... those therapists notes they would have been part of the report\nThey wouldn't they wouldn't have seen the light of day beyond the eyes of a hundred people\nA it's not even and by the way emerges from my phone because I just happened to go into it or into the Mollie Hemingway was on it it's not even clear what purpose turning those materials over to the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that evidence over to the Senate\nThat is precisely the outcome that I think with this request is to get the information right you have claimed repeatedly that the evidence I've requested supports Dr Ford's allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nShe even provided some of the evidence to\nGive me a second Arabs I have to go to a to a a national media indeed if the evidence or supported your clients allegation you surely would produce it as quickly as you could but you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so\nYou are preventing the Senate from consider any evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegation\nI don't know what other imprint we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegation and quite the way you will claimed ooh that's a challenge is not right I urge you once again now for the third time in writing\nTo turn over the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications with the with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence in addition to the evidence I requested in my Tobar second letter in light of recently uncovered information this is interesting because that was the key of\nLook at the uh the last sentence with recently I covered the mission please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect contact with senators or their staffs particularly the ...\nThis is of senators Feinstein and Hirono other than a year communications with me and my staff member\nMy step in preparation for the September twenty seventh hearing the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge and Patrick Smith and a debris re mirrors Julie sweat Nick or their representatives sincerely Chuck Grassley that letter said yesterday ...\nSo like I said in the last caller brought up was she was willing to turn over to the FBI\nAnd our and our point was ... when I'm when I said no it's like because our point does it go directly to the Senate to begin with yeah there is no investigation they wouldn't be in bed they simply take it and give it to the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee and if it ended up in the report we wouldn't see that the the only by senators would set\nThe only the centers would see it and there for a goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence mhm and she wants the people who says she wants to people just see it so then the people can decide\nGive it to Grassley indirectly outside of the three oh two because then the other members of the committee including Dianne Feinstein would get it and immediately\nLeak it exactly or\nGenerating we waited for [laughter] just release the entire right to the to the Washington Post and let them printed completely sure\n\n'cause they're not political [laughter]\nOkay that's a relief well when the Washington Post and the wall street\nJournal no I'd be from you know from the west point of view and and that was the the point well no the senators or political the FBI is not well neither is the Washington Post according to the liberals\nAre and that ... let me see that ah when was that sent here when you were okay 'cause that letter must have been late last night Shannon Bream a pulse of the ten forty seven PM and then I'd seen the um uh Mollie Hemingway the last paragraph sure is interesting\nAbout please let us know your please get was you know what you have shared with Feinstein in her own oh\nWhoa mhm yeah\nBecause of uncovered evidence so what do they have right what what is what is that what is that one about so again I'm we're getting into stupid area again we're getting into areas\nYou know with the lawyers said in they're going to do something that doesn't even make any sense\nYeah\nYeah I ... a demand that doesn't even a demand that would in a demand that would ensure if you went through it that way that the know would never become public right you would never know what was in the notes right\nThey would not because of the Senate rule see the light of day if you want this public there's plenty of ways to do that\nScheduled for the same day ... speaking to Shannon brain which means just had to be late last night right a and a Fox News ... said he personally called cats\nA Thursday evening and told him I'm going to be there to vote for you as needed so that isn't going to delay anything it was funny because you said well you know it wears his daughter getting married and in Montana it legit you inside right I don't think he wants anybody you know\nProbably doesn't want anyone to know and\nBecause and that really spells out how crazy this thing is a and has become\nThe left bullies going direct especially after confronting a Jeff Flake that it's working that they're you know the the the tactic is not only working but acceptable\nAnd we'll shame you out of a restaurant will uh will confront you on the elevator will anywhere and everywhere as directed or I guess to encourage further encouraged by Maxine Waters anywhere and everywhere it doesn't matter where you are\nGetting their face well that becomes dangerous or because it's impossible for somebody to be able to assess a threat just imagine\nIn your everyday life and you're not a lawmaker uh unless we have lawmakers listening which we often do and we thank you for that but you're not included here\nYou're just walking around grocery store [laughter] thank you or the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for listening and and also Senator Lindsey Graham for this yet like this I guess and probably ramble although he's screaming know all the time um but [laughter]\nWe actually love ramble but if you're walking around you know in public the average person and someone just ran up to you and started screaming in your face you wouldn't know what\nThey're doing and you wouldn't know you don't you don't know what the threat level is and and and and certainly it's it's different when you were Jeff Flake and you're confronted in the way he was and you you you know why they're in your face but you can't assess the threat level in public you can't you just cannot\nYou don't know what the person is capable of doing if they're good you know they're physically harm you um it's it's impossible to\nAssess that so as such\nSecurity has been wrapped up a tremendous uh the restaurant in fact that's where Ted Cruz was shamed out of the restaurant ah first of all kudos to the restaurants saying you know because you can hear a person in the background on that video saying look you can't you know telling the protesters look you can't be in here this is a private you know\nBusiness so you saw the letter writer or that Rand Paul's wife wrote to CNN ...\nAnd and challenge Cory Booker and everybody else saying look you people are you you're you are enabling yes these threats you have to own it now 'cause rather Maxine Waters especially but and yeah and you need you need to stop and she directly when after Cory Booker\nRight you know that's the whole thing is that it ... it they have to take their responsibility in it they have to be the ones to take\nIt at least\nChange the tone [noise] are they going to do that

tells us is probably going to be a late Saturday Night but\nYou know I I I think about all the and I'm sitting here just contemplating and thinking of all the\nAll the protests the violence the civil disobedience when certain things you know a a when Trump was elected to you know the the women's march show all all of these things that go on and if you look over the last eight years and the number\nOf protest remember Occupy Wall street you\nKnow all all that that that ah that went on all the the\nThe occupying of city properties and everything else that went on what you're seeing now\nAnd you have a party that constantly does that you have another party that really doesn't do that at All right\nYou see now the getting into the faces of people which can be\nQuite intimidating but here's the question is it effective for them right has it been effective in and you go all the way back like I said we go let's go back to the Obama administration\nI mean you can look at you can look at the uh you can look at the uh the Tea Party but the Tea Party was completely and totally non non violent did not know know riots no tear gas nothing like that in ... so you look at it and you get into the Occupy Wall Street right right where you're actually trespassing\nAnd you know taking over and wanting to camp out and you know there were riots in certain cities that that happened\nWhen the police tried to push them off but at this is almost the exclusive domain\nOf the left and therefore\nThe Democrats sure yeah and you think about the run that they have had since all of this you know really I'll I'll look at Occupy Wall street as just the beginning of this portion of it has it been effective for them when it comes to the vote do people actually respond\nTo it or do they believe that the intimidation\nTactics\nWill actually work and change for example they're not you know you you you could see if they might be a you know threatening\nA just a a you know the the senators that are on\nYou know ... you know I'm On the edge right now right okay on the margins by but they're not they're going after everybody mhm it'll get whether it's Grassley doesn't care what their McConnell where do they really think that that's affected or is it the fact that when you are just so full of rage\nBecause that's what it is it's just insane\nRage that they're filled with right yeah just anger and and and rage\nIs it just a desperation tactic or do they actually believe that is effective I just I I really wonder and [laughter] and I was thinking to myself here before I started talking about this I'd love to sit down and talk with them all that wouldn't be possible [laughter]\nSo I'm never going to find out because I'm not going to be able to sit down and say you don't tell us what's your strategy is that right well\nI I I think after the ... like a thing I think they feel empowered to some extent they feel that it is effective to some extent\nBut I think it's probably a ... a lot of I was gonna say little of both I think it's a lot of both actually that they believe after confronting mansion and after you know the behavior in restaurants and everything else and shaming people out of restaurants I mean think about that Gary\nThat youre not protesters in a restaurant\nYou work there it's your job and you refuse in one case to do it ... because Sarah Huckabee Sanders is eating the food you're going to prepare and serve\nCan you imagine that can you imagine being in that mentality no\nIf I worked in a restaurant I don't care what I was doing in that restaurant and bar rock Obama and his family came in\nThe last thing that I Would do is refused to do my job me not doing my job is not going to change his politics or change anything that I disagreed with that he did and that's the mentality\nBut that's where they that's where they live we go back to the one restaurant where you had a man happened to be African\nAmerican wearing a make America great again hat\nAnd the staff was shaming him at a table to the point that his companion I don't know if it was his girlfriend or his wife was in tears\nAnd they kept it up they kept it up they kept it up I Can't imagine\nI cannot imagine I wouldn't be able to face my friends and family if I did something so despicable just shameful just shameful if you want to talk about getting a picket going out on the steps the SCOTUS\nAs long as you're not trespassing are breaking the law I encourage that I don't care what you believe I don't care what you're promoting are protesting for or against and I remember\nIt was about you know we've talked about it before is probably about seven years ago when um and and you know the person that I'm Talking about and\nAnd it was really you know somebody who I considered it a casual friend ... you know ... do the more professionally and and and uh they were in a conversation and it was a ... a black man who was a huge fan of my show\nNow I sort of knew her politics were more of\nThe liberal bent but she went absolutely insane we know we haven't talked since that point and she completely rejected me as a friend because in a conversation a black man said he loved us\nOh right\nThink about that and that was really my first taste of that type of sanity\nBecause that person you refer to as you described it before I went from zero to you know basically right or just just a small talk with you have good to see your\nAh they were stopping by that kind of thing to all of a sudden over the top rage right we could not believe that somebody of color would be listening to and more so be a fan of the ... right\nAnd you remember when it happened and I asked like I've sort of like laugh you know it's like well I I Can't do this it was so bizarre and so insane but maybe that was the early warning system\nFor me it leads right on on personal level on on a personal most impressed right on our understanding that that and and that's exactly what we're we're we're facing because the rage\nAnd bitterness I Believe is probably still there today in this person yeah I have to do is just I I Can't imagine that kind of mindset I have\nFriends that I still a love dearly that listen to our show and I've known them since grade school\nAnd we still connect on a few times a week on Facebook\nBut we see each other on a regular basis and everything else we love each other we tease each other about the politics and there was no way that either of us none of us would ever draw that line and say well you can't be my friend I Can't there's no way we can have the debate just like family\nBut not for the far left not for many\nBut I'm a far let it wasn't even what I said it was that a black man like yeah we talked and of course it was a little bit about about eight six six Ninety red eye\nWhen it comes to proper tire Karen maintenance what can you do to improve fuel economy Jason Evans is ... operations for D.C are

couldn't be cooperated in there was no absolutely no evidence except for the allegation\nThat I'm a that Brett Kavanaugh ever did anything that was wrong and pray it got to the point I mean even yesterday when when it was you know the that but it was six seven of his friends basically came on to talk about you know what was in your book\nAnd it just it it\nI mean they got to the point I was reading to you and let me see if I can find it here I just thought about it right now right or the the National Review article by by Charles Cooke Charlie Cook and it was just to the point of getting it was just to the point of complete ... here it is\nFrom Charles Cooke National Review perjury update\nThe Kavanaugh said he didn't drink to excess perjury claim was never remotely credible to

and battle to be angrier than the ... to be the angry is person in the room\nThey used to want to be the smartest person in the room now they just want to be the angry is person in the ... oh\nSpeaking of the first person to the world just an added up there's just a few of the stories we're going to get your calls and comments on this because a lot of people want to comment on the the Brett Kavanaugh on the cloture vote tomorrow in ... be a vote on Saturday or\nYou know what the vote count might possibly be but you when you just brought it up the smartest person in the world to see where bait or work shouldn't be Robert Francis or works and I we don't necessarily want Abbas\nEndorsement I'm thinking you got to meet me\nWell there's a couple of things there because you know the ... campaign as he broadens it out beyond the El Paso district where he serves look he's he's the king of El Paso no doubt politically\nUm the\nUp outside of the the cartels that are operating in\nWith all due respect to the cartels [laughter] um the the whole idea though is that you've got to broaden it beyond the El Paso district right I mean he can win your Paso district as long as he wants to run for that house seat um and I have friends there that say oh man he's got his hands and everything\nYou know so um yeah uh that's different though when you broadened it out to the rest of Texas now certainly he's done better than a\nA lot of the people who jumped into different races\nOr the former ah Dallas County sheriff Lupe Lupe Valdez\nUh and uh you know her running against ah the the current Governor Greg Abbott um that's you know again he's he's very well in the lead but well when you broaden it out to the state right level you gotta go wild you got to realize that you you have to protest\nYou're in the middle well then and that's a bit of work he's trying to do is try and do you try to picture himself and he's not in the middle on anything no but he he realizes that he has to lie even to get them or he can't be truthful even with Democrats in Texas\nAnd hope to get elected and yet the realization I mean the Democrats used to be that way all the time they used to\nWe need to move to the middle we need to move to the middle we gotta move to the middle we've got to move to the middle\nAnd and then over the last ten years or so no they were you know basically this is who we are I guess my point is\nThat when you think about ten years ago right now when you think of ten years ago mhm\nWhen Obama was running for president ... and ... wasn't it right about now right around this was in October remember he held it would've been no would've been the convention\nWhere we are convention ... when he was at the stadium the football stadium in in in Denver and they had like ... it looked like he was a you know the the the entire\nStage it was set up with these Ehlers mhm and everything else where he looked like some Greek forum yes yes mhm and ... and people going crazy and and remembering his first term Evan Thomas from\nNewsweek at the time he's God like yeah he's he's a ... you know always post partisan he's God like he hovers over the rest of us he's the smartest person in the world to now ten years later\nOne of the leading\nSocialist candidate in the country mhm I\nRide on Obamacare we don't they don't need all but yeah we're not you know we don't need a bomb death\nSo they don't have the Hollywood like about that that's that's a great point because here's the thing is that\nIs that ugly in inside the state it doesn't work but a work has no problem taking money from outside the state from the liberals who have been pouring money into the state her well into his coffers\nIn order to be Ted Cruz than an effort to be Ted Cruz um you know so you know he wants the liberal basically fill liberals to are you guys stay outside of Texas\nLook we've got our liberal places in in Texas now there are plenty of the districts that are blue and counties that are blue including the county we broadcast\nFrom yeah but but here's the point is though the point is not who he would have\nGotten in addition if he would have got Obama ... but the fact is he knew he could reject Obama publicly yet but then the ... ideas into his core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing to do anymore\nOh no that's that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too\nIs that it does nothing for them and it only irritates someone who might be in the middle and tied right I mean it's it only works against that middle which might get you over the it

Carlson on a with a fires\nShould care the American civil liberties union national political director\nThey put out an ad where they had Kavanaugh side by side with Bill Cosby\nYeah it's a terrible slander a sad and let's put it this way any at the age do you rent that against a private citizen they'd be sued for millions of dollars a there is no even\n\nThey're not even trying to hide anymore that they're not about civil liberties that they don't believe in the presumption of innocence but I just want to play a part of the interview that went back and forth because it gets to the point of being insane wherever the American civil liberties union what are they what why were they created to defend people's individual rights\nTo protect people that have been wrongly accused not just wrongly convicted wrongly accused\nBut the presumption of innocence is always the ... the number one thing that evidence is what determines whether you're guilty they existed or used to exist to protect people's civil liberties their their civil rights here's part of the back and forth\nThis is a disgusting at obviously but what's so distressing is that you ran it\nBecause this is guilt by

capping off how could you do that has the effect of you\nTo appreciate your comments Tucker the common thread here courses powerful men whose careers were on the line issuing denials about sexual

sets in judgment of the rest of the nation integrity is the critical importance the most important thing that we have about ...\nI I agree and I I Would never arguing against the importance of integrity what Bill Cosby has been convicted of crimes in court and we all know that's the one that the ACLU before it was taken over by partisans like new ones defended by capital has not been so telling them together\nIs by definition guilt by association and unfair do you think that the person you're positioned Twenty years ago would have seen that\nTucker this isn't a civil or criminal trial I think you understand that we're talking about a job promotion by us that's meant to that and when I'm making the standard of proof here it's not a brief beyond a reasonable doubt so then why don't you put it in the next to bill constantly who has been tried in ... he is not entitled to the presumption of innocence a few of the ... assume that\nYou're saying he's entitled to the job I'm I'm I'm\nNot actually a robot hold on I'm not arguing that I'm asking you why you put them next to a man who was tried in court and convicted of felonies and sentenced to\nPrison because that one of those things that individual also denied the accusations I think he would appreciate Tucker that we're criticizing people on the left and that I don't care about the left in the right I care about the participants to make the country was when she wants to fend it and now you you're an eight on\nSaddam and sexual assault\nHas taken very seriously here Tucker and I think that we're all in the
