{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "The best news talk and forks now on FM Ninety six twenty five ... five five eighty UCA Jess do you see a show network dot com\nMetro news point after rolls on down back to your friend and the crew\nFinal break tonight in the points after a ride and I with you until one o'clock this morning again talking about this mountain near\nDebacle tonight in Ames, Iowa thirty to fourteen the final score and and it's not so much even thirty to forty ... final scored how that final score came to me and the ... has been hot tonight\nIt has here's a couple that have come in here recently texture says there are only a few elite teams in college football the shared I never thought WB was part of that list\nI think the panic from the fans as a result the stunning lack of productivity from the ... the last couple of weeks yeah there's a lot in there I mean there there might be one of the team in college football it might just be Alabama and everybody else has significant flaws\nAnd that may be true that West Virginia is not part of that elite but I think what was fair to say going into this as West Virginia has had as good a shot to win the big twelve as anybody else this year may this year this season they and they still may the question for me and and the lack of\nProductivity from the other the last couple of weeks that's right and it's really second half of Texas Tech\nAnd an even last week again for it I I was saying this earlier there weren't the points there that could have been there against Kansas but if you go back and watch the first half from an up and down the\nField standpoint West Virginia absolutely dominated Kansas and it wasn't so much tonight to me it was a total system failure every every part of it also ah quarterbacking receiving running against Kansas it was not that there were small offensive line problems there were struggling at times to run it\nAnd there were three bad decisions by will wearing the red sun that's a totally different look than what you saw tonight and a total destruction I mean it's not even like we can go back in the first quarter and said\nWell remember there were those to drive where they had a clicking and they look pretty good right you're basically down to one passed from Greer to still look pretty good and nothing else work tonight\nEven those other games that we talked about and we said here in the studio you in the same Jeremy and the same chair\nThat boy we felt that will\nGreer that we had the mountaineers didn't play well in all of a sudden we were spouting off\nThe stats that we'll Greer had yeah and they were good they were great they're unbelievable but the bar had been set so high well tonight when you look at the stats that's not we'll Greer that was not a will Greer performance say why it wasn't we don't know why\nAnd in in any way it was it was the the the ... unable to scramble and get out of plays okay I Wish they did a good job containing the not throwing the ball away that's not something you usually see now maybe maybe he was booted a little bit from the forces last week in the over compensated\nBut it still doesn't explain why you just throw it out of bounds a few times but I still just go back to the lack of creativity on offense because I thought if there was something that was going to disappear from this off and it wouldn't have been the creativity even against Kansas that at times there wasn't the production you go back and look at some of the ...\nBlade designs that were in that game and some of the things that were unveiled that you hadn't seen at that point they were fascinating there was a ton to like about this all up and even if it hadn't performed at an a plus level for two weeks so to go from an Arab be or even the performance too when asked\nOr an incomplete I mean it might not even have been an estimated Fred it might have been an incomplete grade it was so stunningly bat that's the hard part just to fathom\nEleven to Fifteen for one hundred yards and one touchdown I Can't remember one half of the game you know more do more than that\nYeah and no rhythm know momentum they couldn't get anything going it ... it wasn't like they just couldn't run the ball or that I mean I was state we talked about this all night was bringing a three man front\nShowing a light box West Virginia couldn't run the ball my driving were ... they were showing a three man box dropping eight are showing dropping eight and bringing some pressure and that was be funneling West Virginia everything Iowa State did cause problems for West Virginia\nNormally happened in ... in less you're against the team that just has to hear your talent from you rarely do you see everything work for one team and it did tonight for Iowa State\nAnd again I was state is not the class of the big well maybe not even on the top half yeah I had a big ... and tonight they played like they were national champions caliber and what's coming up for West Virginia I mean when you look at the remaining schedule Baylor is the least of the photos\nYeah in given what you saw last year with Baylor coming all the way back on West Virginia because again west for days off and went into hibernation late in that game\nThey're getting better so that's not a team that ... a week ago I would've said All right you go in and you beat Baylor now I think that's off the table I think you'd better get it turned around quickly or Baylor's law\nYou do look at what west for or what I Would say did tonight physically to West Virginia and then see that you've got taxes coming in Texas that bigger faster stronger higher higher caliber athlete or what are they going to be able to do up front if\nIowa State was able to take such advantage tonight you get Gary Patterson coming in you know what he always brings to the gym you have to go to Stillwater as bad as Oklahoma State has been that's not a gimme yet again it's one game and you hate to try and make season long assumptions off this one game but I think this was such a bad performance offensively that you have\nTo now question everything moving forward I don't think there's a single gimme left on West Virginia schedule\nAgree but I agree a hundred percent right there and and it's frightening to think of the gene that we saw and maybe this is just an anomaly maybe this maybe you know maybe coming up on Thursday night the twenty fifth of October Baylor mayors role in seven o'clock kick\nA it's a night game in Morgantown it'd be a good crowd hopefully and things will turn around because amount that he was half to get back on track thank you big man thank you Fred we made it\nWe made it through music on thanks to Ryan got three don't forget the next

... talking about the latest developments in astronomy\nWhat can we talked about the moon\nWe talked about is properties and the question is well is there any commercial value to going to the moon or is it really does a dead rock some people talk about helium three other people say that well why bother to mind when you combine the euro uh what are your thoughts\nWell to be honest I don't really know what the future hold it hard to predict what's going to happen a hundred years from now\nBut the problem of course is getting into the theory that if you are going to mind something whatever you mind has to be credited with precious to justify it caught but again how can anyone predict that anything's going to be a good years for that\nI mean who knows what the price of a rocket launch will be who knows what the price of helium three will be or or cold or anything else you would want the line\nI Would also point out that every now and an asteroid asked by the earth and perhaps those asteroids could be mine it a lot easier to support from an asteroid because the gravity of an asteroid it's still very weak and asteroids contain valuable materials to\nBut again who knows what the costs are going to be in the benefits like it'd be very far future it's hard to forget it's very hard to [laughter]\nOkay well we're going back to the moon starting next year the U.S so that's booster

concerns the fact that the Japanese successfully landed on an asteroid\nBut first we have to get some definitions off the ground\nThe difference between meteors comets asteroids and the question is what is the relationship between these three given the fact that media or sometimes come up a tale of a comment and sometimes an asteroid can become a meteor most of the relationship between these three\nWell asteroids and comets are basically leftover object from the birth of the plot that was it the planet of our solar system Mercury Venus earth Mars and so forth\nExtra solar moon ever a family of course know lots of millions in our solar system all those two hundred go round the various planet of the solar system that's particular planet is a bit closer to its star than the earth is to the sun but\nIt's rather similar and had the orbital period of two hundred and eighty seven days versus the earth of course three hundred and sixty five to four days and\nThe moon well there's no and if they really think that if it exists it is\nPotentially the side of it now but if you can believe that we haven't Jupiter sized planet but the moon that's maybe as large as the plot it up to say this discovery needs confirmation but if it is confirmed it will be quite exciting discovery for extra solar meal ever state\nWell is amazing right I mean who would've thought who would've thought Twenty years ago if you were to predict\nTwenty years hands what we went to fight in outer space so many different varieties of solar systems and our solar system seems to be the oddball seems to me the exception so\nFar right so isn't it true that we have not yet found a twin of our planet and a twin of our solar system in outer space all these other systems look quite different from our system right\nThat's right there is enormous variety and diversity among solar system of the galaxy and we have yet to find our match in terms of the\nSolar system that has a star just like this Don and apply that just like the earth there are hundreds of billions of dollars in our galaxy and then we've only just started searching so I I have confidence that sooner or later or you will find a planet of the earth located at the distance\nFrom the sun from another star\nNow I understand that you've also written an article recently about a strange void that has been found in outer space and we think of this guy being full of stars evenly distributed when you're talking about a void out there isn't that rather unusual\nYes this is the cover story over the October twenty Eighteen issue the sky and tell us the local Lloyd they don't get believe out here just boy did it starts to sports\nMillion light years from us on the other side of our galaxy and stretches for a quarter billion light years\nNear empty nest almost no galaxies or stars at all and we call the local boy we don't know much about it it doesn't have many ... and obviously and that's what the story in the sky and telescope is all about the sound intriguing by all means pick up the October issue of sky and tell us go read all about it\nNow according to the big bang theory or the universe exploded over wild about fourteen billion years ago but it exploded rather evenly and that's why the night sky looks rather uniform\nSo what is avoid avoiding doing out there when we thought that the universe was relatively uniform what could cause that\nWell over fourteen billion years tiny differences in the city actually amplify themselves so the\nDancer each insulting to leave for a gallon groups of galaxies and clusters and then the less dense region band overtime and become these huge boy that's just the local boy\nSo that explains how voice arise they started off as simply under these of matter in the early universe and then a band and eventually become well in the case of the local Lloyd a quarter billion light years across\n[noise] now when we look at the entire universe itself when you see that as filled with a background radiation from the big bang the cosmic microwave background radiation which is extremely uniform meaning that the universe you are as probably started off in a very very uniform state\nBut but\nThere have been some irregularities found in the microwave background radiation that is tantalizing because this is the entire visible universe we're not talking about some people even claim that these are scars remnants of parallel universes\nThat maybe our universe collided with another universe\nMay be the scar leftover from that ancient collision is still with us today I was on his ideas rather preposterous but I've been tend to talks talks by real cosmologists who speculated\nThat maybe some of the irregularities in the cosmic background radiation are due to the leftovers of ancient collisions with other universes now is that for pastors or do you think that there could be a case made that our universe itself collided with other universes what are

us a\nAt six when to buy six for eight one two three five and maybe you can have your thoughts hurt on national radio on almost a hundred radio stations that takes science fantastic and of course the Internet as well\nWell before the break we had a very interesting question and let's break it down into its component\nFirst of all we have the second law through my dynamics\nWhich says that in any open system things fall apart we all know that\nThings rust things get stain things crumble things die in fact that's the reason why we die we die because chaos eventually takes over genetic mutations build up in our cells overtime\nCells get sluggish and eventually don't function and then we die\nThat's why we die the second law of thermodynamics however\nI mention an open system this means and in a closed system you can temporarily reversed the arrow of time so the arrow of time port points towards chaos the arrow of time points toward death destruction collapse calamity however\nThat's in an open system let's talk about a closed system whereby you can actually make changes in the arrow of time there's a loophole in the laws that there might ... and that is the plight energy from the outside mechanical energy from the outside\nSo you know there were some people asked a question if we have the second love to my dad I mix on the earth then why do we exist humans are obviously smarter than rocks so if the if the universe naturally creates rocks however we created\nWe represent a violation of the laws and through my dynamics we are intelligent we can sing dance we can tonight we can we can build atomic bombs we can build a rocket\nShips rocks cannot therefore he seems to a an average person that the laws and my dad I mix it violated note if you add energy from the outside you can locally reverse the laws of their my dynamics and where does that energy come from da da\nDa dun the sun's energy provides us with nutrients which allow us to therefore reverse the laws of thermodynamics locally so this means of course that the earth will eventually die sorry about that but that's the law physics\nHowever it means that temporarily locally we can reverse the laws that there might not make ten bingo here we are sunlight makes possible photosynthesis we eat the plants that arise from Puerto synthesis we metabolize these plants and get energy\nAnd that's where we come from\nThat's why we have evolution that's why we can have things that are intelligent arise from rocks so then the question or ask you another question what about the quantum theory so far we've only talked about classical physics that is a physics of Isaac Newton\nThe physics of Isaac Newton is based on the idea that every Adam is like a billion ball at tiny steel ball you know exactly where that involved is\nBut in the quantum theory in the quantum theory this uncertainty you don't know exactly where that ball is at any given time\nDo do you see is Jess\n... has been found guilty on

I really enjoy it I look forward to more shows like\nWhat you ask a very interesting question about naming names and it turns out that recently some astronomers have yelled and screamed at other astronomers\nPrecisely about the naming of objects in outer space you know we have the astronomical union which helps to regulate the naming of things but it becomes very contentious because so much John sentimental\nTie with certain names and he has these names may not be totally scientific for example the most famous example of this is Pluto\nNow by writes Pluto should perhaps not be applied at all well let's take another short commercial break and after that we'll talk about\nThe naming of things where these names come from is Pluto really a planet that is their planet X out there what

want to get on science fantastic and ask a\nQuestion give us a call that six one to five or six four eighty one three five bigger name called enters into radio station you're listening to if you're listening to on the city are you calling from and then ask away asked that question make that comment\nWell we had a call come in at about naming things how do we named things and it's actually rather contentious a first of all many of the stars and you see at night many of them have Arabic names algal el tear why\nBecause well during the after the fall of the Roman empire much of the knowledge of astronomy went to the Arabs they were the ones that carefully transcribe that information algebra for example was preserved from the Greeks\nThey unified field theory so again people get Einstein's mistakes incorrect he never said that Einstein he never said that quantum mechanics was wrong with it as a theory of the atom\nYou said it was incomplete he said that they must be a higher theory which gives ... argues quantum mechanics as a derivative\nAnd also about the DNA pictures yes I was on her Franklin Roslyn Franklin did not understand the double helix nature of what she was doing\nShe was the one who took the electron micro graphs which made it possible for other people that say aha it's a double helix here's how it all fits together no she did not do that\nBut she was part of the discovery and so you have to give her credit for being part of the discovery that propel DNA the centerpiece of biology so once again I think we're all human\nDoes it continue on a continuum of contributions of things and when you look in one given\nTremendous achievement usually it's the contribution of many people Nobel Prize winners in all their humbled is usually give credit to all the other scientists who also participated in that search\nAnd unfortunately many of them never win the Nobel Prize think of the Nobel Prize think of all the scientists who never won the Nobel Prize or because they never got the credit that they deserve\nOkay well let's move on now to the next listener phone call\nThis is our mom from Queens New York Post your two oh it was on her I saw an article for the Chinese\nUh an Eighteen or something like a laser like white people far from a mile away pretty much for a while ago you know thinking about a\nYear or so I have a great day so [noise]\nUh well first of all are the Chinese working on lasers yes but for that matter are we working on lasers and the answer to that is yes\nIs it possible to create a laser that can start a fire from a long distance and as for that is yes in fact we've been doing that for decades I even have a photograph in my picture file of a GI this is back in the seventies I think\nA with a rifle a laser rifle firing a laser beams sufficient to set off explosive many many hundreds of feet away so instead of getting a match and the lighting the views of an explosive and then blow yourself up in the process when I simply use a laser gun\nAnd shoot that laser beam and ignite that explosive and we did this decades to go back in the Nineteen seventies as I recall\nAnd so yes other countries are working on these things to we shouldn't be a naive to think that only certain countries are working on this technology\nBut the bottom line is avoid use now what practical use are these technologies can they be controlled will they get out of control\nThese are the bigger questions and for the most part lasers in warfare had been a big disappointment it turns out that laser power distant pace when it goes through air for example\nMeaning that the power the laser beam diminishes considerably\nAh meaning that the buck Rogers idea of laser guns and things like that [noise]\nAh well yeah it's still possible but more expensive and more unstable than we originally thought that's why we don't have Reagan's for example I Would simply costs too much and require power supply that we don't have\nTo create a Reagan\nSo the idea of a Reagan never materialized for practical considerations you need a power pack\nA tiny power pack that you can fit in your hand for example to energize Reagan\nAnd unfortunately we don't have that we don't have batteries we don't have portable power pack sensation to drive\nOr something like a Reagan\nSo the idea of going into battle with a laser Reagan battling away and defeating your enemy is still a dream rather than a reality we simply don't have a portable power pack sufficient to drive Reagan [noise]\nFortunately that saved for science fantastic once again you can always give us a call twenty four seven any time day or night give us a call that six one to five six for eight one two three five and maybe you can have your sauce hurt

U. dot org and listen to previous shows of science fantastic and before the break we had a very interesting question first of all information\nCan information travel faster than the speed of light well the answer is yes but it is useless information is gibberish is random information not usable that is you cannot say Morse code\nYou cannot stand tomorrow stock market quotations you cannot send tomorrow's Wall Street journal the a quantum entanglement which does send things instantaneously but is useless random information sorry about that\nSo if you're a star trek fan we still don't know how to make a sub space communicator that allows you to calculate it allows you to talk to someone faster than the speed of light\nNow the question or had yet another question and that is well he knows that I work on string theory which is the leading candidate for his theory of everything but he asked what about another theory\n[noise] well I'm not familiar with the theory that he mentioned however let me say this so far scientists agree that the unified field theory that is string theory seems to work is very hard to test in fact impossible to test with today's technology\nIt predicts many universes not just ours so there are criticisms of string theory but what about an alternative to my knowledge and correct me if I'm wrong\nTo my knowledge there is no alternative\nAll the other proposals including things like Lupe parts and gravity do not give you a theory of everything so what is the bottom line what's the problem what is the bottom line for a theory of everything a theory of everything is actually quite simple it has to include two things\nJust to things and you two could claim to have a unified field theory\nFirst that has to include the standard model the standard model of the quantum theory all their quirks and all the ... and all the left on all of that has to be included in the standard model in any unified field theory it is a theory of almost everything\nSecond it has to include gravity or quantum theory of gravity if you put these two together in a finite form you will be recognized not just as a Nobel Prize winner you'll be recognized as the next Einstein\nSo far the only candidate a string theory though it is not testable and especially with today's technology maybe tomorrow's technology but not today\nSo far there are no other alternatives all the other so called US Senators have either shown to be incomplete or mathematically inconsistent sorry about that okay well let's move on to the next listener phone call\nOr how little professor Mm my name is Steve and I'm calling from Hungary so the thinking about pheromones sprint or I got a question popped in my mind which is how it was like no which is a shorter snake steak\nUmm thank you and I'm really a big fan of yours [noise] [noise]\nWell I call from Hungary has one of the advantages of being on the Internet you get an instantaneous communication around the world\nWell first of all we have something called optics a theory that was worked out by the Arab and Greek astronomers centuries ago and what are the principles of optics is that like takes the shortest path between two points\nNow here's a question that is sometimes given to high school kids\nOr take a mirror\nOff we have a\nAnother short commercial breaks and we have to say but actually that we'll ask the question is I always think they're sort of ... to the point\nIs well once again this is science fantastic professor Michio Kaku give us a call the hotline number is six months to five six for eight one free five and maybe you can have your thoughts turn it on national radio [noise]\nUh when you use public why fine actors and\nSo and electric disturbance create some magnetic one creates an electric one grace magnetic one dot dot dot dot dot\nAnd he realized that what you get from this is a traveling weight\nThen you calculate the speed up this traveling wave and he was floored absolutely floored when he discovered that the speed of vibrating electric and magnetic fields is the speed of light and then he made that prosthetic that process\nThe attic observation this is light\nWas is light ever since humans first open their eyes we've wondering what is this mysterious thing called light well it was worked out by one of the greatest insights of all time\nWhen James Kirk Maxwell calculating the speed of vibrating electric fields and magnetic fields found out that both of them vibrate together\nThe speed of light and then he made the ... one of the greatest the insides of all time this is\nLight that's what life is isn't electro magnetic field\nAnd by calculating the speed of it I just I was able to realize that that speed is costing and all moving friends that gave us special relativity which in turn gives us the atomic bomb and the energy of the stars that's why the sunshine\nAmazing simple inside inside said in principle children could have\n...

is arguably one of the most polarizing financial products that's available depending on who you talk to\nThey're either going to love them and have ever find appreciation for them or they're going to think that they're the worst financial product ever created and the truth is somewhere in between and you have to make sense of\nHow it is to use this financial tool within your portfolio and that's what we're going to discuss today but more importantly Brent when we published in audio book a while back we published this specific to the annuity topic in the title of this audio book that we published\nIs the good the bad and the ugly\nAbout annuities so think about that we we walk through everything that you're going to need to know from understanding the good and and the bad and the real ugly because there certainly is ugly\nIf you'd like to have this audio book shipped to you normally the cells on Amazon for thirty dollars but today as a gift from the show we will send it out to

eight nine five seven to all you have to do is leave us your contact information and we will ship you out of complementary copy of that audio book the good the bad and the ugly\nAbout annuities and Brent you know we talked about consumers want financial products that have guarantees to them and they're willing to give up some growth\nTo get that guarantee but the reality is is there are very few guaranteed financial\nProducts out there there are a marquee you know some people on the surface they want to hear what they want to hear\nAnd so what they would like to hear is that you can get this amazing ready to return it's guaranteed you can always get access to your money twenty four seven anytime you want that's not how financial products vehicles and financial tools typically work like you pointed out there's gives and there's takes there's pros and cons\nAnd the key with all of this and why I liked the title of that audio book so much and as you pointed out you do have to consider the pros and cons the good the bad maybe even the ugly before you make decisions with with your finances\nAnd part of the purpose of that book is to get people to understand there is the right time to use an annuity in the wrong time there's ... ways to use an annuity in wrong ways to use an annuity so when people typically hear something bad about it and ... if they could dig deep enough and asking a question that get the right answers\nOften times what they really find is that wasn't used the right way or the right time and therefore the ugly part of it kind of came to the surface maximizing the way the tool is meant to be so\nThere are multiple ways to look at in a newly ... and that's that's really the key here is you have to understand\nHow to use a duty inside of your portfolio but bring we need to talk about some of the financial products that offers some guarantees we have to discuss exactly what these guarantees are who's making the guarantees because I think

that you have for your dollars but before we do that I encourage you to give us a call and request to the audio book the good the bad in the ugly\nAbout annuities give us a call triple a triple eight

[noise]\nAnd welcome back to the program we have been discussing a survey that was conducted a little while back by one of the largest insurance companies in the world and really the focus of this survey\nWas the fact that a lot of Americans think that we have a retirement crisis in our country and specifically the concern about living their assets\nAnd those dollars so it comes with a few challenges as well\nAnd when we look at who's guaranteeing those dollars\nCDs come with FDIC insurance and so there's a nice little\nI guess security blanket when it comes to investing in CDs and that's part of the reason why a lot of people find them attractive and they're willing to perhaps give up some of that that upside potential for that security\nAnd comfort of knowing that there's that guaranteed backing it the next option you might look at it as U.S Treasury securities and\nEssentially if you're not familiar with us treasuries are used to finance the federal government's debt and so\nIn essence what's gonna happen is they are guaranteed\nBy the U.S government's full faith and credit or in other words their ability to tax us right and so there's the guarantee there and really that's a pretty safe bet however when you look at rates of return there\nThere's nothing to to get overly excited about usually and so again there's that given take that comes with it and this is where people will often look at\nThe annuity as another option for some guarantees and so let's talk about the different types of annuities Brent and later we're going to get into you know the downsides and what to be looking out for but first of all let's talk about the difference between two broad categories the first is\nThe immediate annuity and then in a moment we'll discuss the deferred annuity let's talk about the immediate annuities first what is it and how does this work\nShare my you know it's one of the simplest annuities out there in in a basic thirty thousand foot view of an immediate anybody is\nWC H. S.\nFind the financial information you hear a new show on demand at usa financial radio dot com\nOnce again with Brent Anders Here's Mark Mars when\nWelcome back to the program if you're just joining us we have been discussing the exciting topic of annuities and what's interesting about our show and hopefully if you listen to us in the past one of the things that we really strive to do on the show and all of the usa financial\nRadio advisor strive to do is provide transparency and that's really what we want to discuss or the course of the next few minutes is looking at transparency and understanding and looking at a new disease from all different angles and the thing that's interesting\nAs we look at a new ... and really dissect\nThe options that are available to you there are a lot of\nRadio shows out there that will either be very much focused on an annuity maybe you've heard of a radio show that focuses on safer money and the fact the matter is they might dedicating entire radio show to safer guaranteed money but they'll never mentioned the word annuities because they're scared to Brent\nYeah end or are you ever hear about is positive positive positive they don't also disclose the potential negatives and again we used to have a lot and usa finance radio there are very ...\nA few bad investment tools or investment products out there it's just either somebody shouldn't have it at all because it doesn't sit right into their portfolio or maybe they should have it but they don't have the right specific one or they simply aren't using it the right way that's the difference\nYou know later in the show we'll discuss why annuities have such a bad reputation but first Brent we want to look at\nThe different types of deferred annuities because I think that these are the most popular in terms of what is out there being recommended by financial professionals so let's look at the different types of deferred annuities\nAnd break them down and look at some of the pros and cons of first there are three broad types of deferred annuity is the first is the fixed annuity the next is the indexed annuity and then there's the variable annuity let's first discuss the fixed annuity what is it and how does it\nWork I'm sure Michael with all these remember we talked earlier that their immediate annuities where you put money into a contract that insurance company they immediately start paying back a deferred annuity the whole point is to put money in and let it sit for\nA certain amount of time and then you can decide later whether you want to move those dollars into a different annuity somewhere out maybe you do on a turning income stream later it give you a little bit more flexibility in terms of when you may or may not want to turn on income or take withdraws but\nThe first one you mentioned mark was just a traditional six deferred annuity\nAnd what that is as you put money into a contract or into a policy with an insurance company and they are going to declare some kind of an interest rate to you and when you go into it you know at that rate is in you know for how long it's going to be guaranteed\nCommonly it's guaranteed for one year at a time\nSo you put money on deposit you get X amount of interest for one year guaranteed at the end of that term\nThe insurance companies and then tell you what your renewal rate is might be the same rate could be higher could be lower a lot of that's a function of what's going on in the interest rate environment with the insurance companies doing with those dollars and where they're investing on what kinda yield burning off of\nThe pool of other people's dollars that have been put into those inequities but you know for at least a year typically what you're going to get and then it just starts to renew one year at a time\nAnd when you look at that renewal rate there is usually a floor a minimum rate of return a rate of interest that will be credited to your account and so some investors really appreciate that and again we discussed earlier\nThat a lot of folks today are willing to give up some of that growth in order to have a little bit more safety and so the fixed annuity just a a real plain vanilla there's not too many frills to these contracts are pretty easy to understand the grand scheme of things\nWill declare that rate might be one year it might be three years it might be five years\nNow let's let's look at the indexed annuity let's talk about how it kind of has some similarities to the fixed annuity but let's talk about how it credits interests\nFor sure sure Mary ... to a couple of different things are kind of happening at once if you put dollars into an indexed annuity the lion's share of the money gets invested by the insurance company again pulled together with other policyholders just like yourself\nInto the very similar if not the exact same types of things\nThat a fixed annuity investor would have their dollars put into when I say they I mean insurance company they're investing in government treasuries T. bills corporate bonds things of that sort of relatively conservative but trying to earn a decent rate of return for which there are going to give a portion of the field they get back to you as a policy holder\nThe lion's share of the dollar is actually go into that that provide certain guarantees that minimum guaranteed interest rate for that you talked about a moment ago\nBut they also take a small portion of the dollars and they actually go out and buy index options\nIf mayor without an index option is it basically gives them the right to buy into a stock market index say the S. and P. five hundred at a later date oftentimes when you're down the road\nAt some kind of declared price and the whole being that that the market is actually higher than what they have the ability to go purchase that option and then they get the pocket the spread of the different to the game and then the next option and they give you a portion that gain back into your account so\nYou're getting a little bit of gain because of the typical fixed the new the investments that they make but you also get and potentially some game because of the indexes and what's happening in some of the stock market\nIt's important to understand though with with an index nudity that is not you purchasing the option to the insurance company that is doing that you've entered into a contract and they stipulate to terms and and usually how it works\nIs your earnings or the credited interest into your account will be based off of usually let's just say one of the stock market indices so the popular one is the S. and P. five hundred\nAnd they might put a cap on what your upside potential could be so they'll say well you can enjoy the growth of the S. and P. five hundred but up to seven percent or up to four percent are up to eight percent or maybe they're going to say you know you're only going to participate in\nFifty percent or thirty percent of the upside gain\nNow what you get for taking on a lower interest rate opportunity is protection on the downside and this is really what makes these financial products attractive for folks because if you've gone through two thousand eight\nAnd you understand that the big drops in the stock market how much that can adversely affect your portfolio these products offer that guaranteed floor where you're not going to take that negative hit you give up a lot on the upside potentially but you're not having to endure the downside\nOf suck more near exactly remark you know that's just one of those trade us and I wouldn't necessarily call that ... can you just need to understand that you are trading a little bit of\nRate of return or potential ready to return to get some kind of safety or some other features in return and as long as you understand it and it makes sense in your portfolio then you can do it it's when people don't know\nHow it works or it's been missed explained or perhaps even they've been misled and you hear things like where you can get market returns with no risk um any scratch your head for a minute and say oh how is that possible to happen if it sounds too good to be true likely it is\nYeah the idea behind these financial products is to give you an interest crediting option or rate of return opportunity that's going to fit somewhere in between a CD and the stock market and that's really the long term goal when you when you look at these options and you look\nWhat's available to you on the indexed annuity that's really the long term goal of the Senate and the important thing to understand when you look at a new diseases that any of the guarantees that are provided\nAre provided by the claims paying ability of the insurance company and so you really want to evaluate the insurance company that you're considering doing business with if this is an option for you when we walked through how to evaluate that how to think about making this decision in the audio book that were making available to you today\nAs a gift from the show the name of this audio book is the good the bad and the ugly about annuities you can request it directly by giving us a call today at triple a triple eight\nNinety five Seventy two that's eight eight eight\nEight eight eight nine five\nSeven to simply live as your contact information and we will

next type of deferred annuity this is very popular one\nIt's the variable annuity I think most people if they have a negative idea of an annuity that they formed years ago it's probably because they either owned a variable annuity or knew somebody who did give me the forty thousand foot view of the variable\nAnnuity I'm a pretty simple so the easiest way to explain a variable annuity is to say that it is a collection of basically mutual funds\nWhere they tax deferred rapper around them because with all these annuities ever touching on right now mark whether it's a fixed annuity and indexed annuity or variable annuity one of the inherent features or benefits of such as that the IRS does provide some tax deferred girl\nOn those dollars when you put them in there so when you're putting
