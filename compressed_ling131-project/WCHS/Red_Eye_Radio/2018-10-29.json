attitude um and have kind of taught me to always have this kind of an mounted enthusiasm for what you do\nUm and to think really big so we called it reaching for the trees stars um and it's been kind of instilled a nuisance a tiny little girl\nOkay so you're waiting tables is is the idea coming into shape at all at this point for outdoor voices\nI had a school no not at all um I found the most valuable thing about being a person's was I took a um a course called designing management so it was actually a business degree but we got proper training and accounting and kind of finances and\nOn the flip side got to learn about W sweets like adobe illustrator and photo shop which was a really nice combo because once you left school you're able to visualize your ideas like putting pitched ex together et cetera\nBut I don't remember 'em they're being much like\nJockeying in terms of business ideas and\nSchool a it was really like a environment to to really learn once I left school it was actually\nA one run on the west side highway that but the idea for a movie\nUm because I had grown up wearing lots of Nike love Nike it made you feel like faster you know kind of super human is how much is awesome\nBut when I was in school I think it was my senior year I was running at one point two miles on the west side highway in a very recreational pace and I looked down and I was like it feels like some real dissidents here in terms of kind of the Olympic athlete uniform but me going that like a ten minute mile pay so I said\nI Want to create an outfit for activity that's comfortable to sweat in but a little bit more aligned west kind of the aesthetic\nAnd like ... the recreation of of the exercise I was doing at that point in my life\nDo you have this skill set from school you have the idea what's your first step\nUm it was all making product I had no idea how to make clothing so um spend a lot of time in midtown and a lot of time on Google figuring out how to makers and um the material that I wanted to use and like\nThere were definitely crop tops that like had one you know only one arm arm hole at the beginning so um I\nWhere are you selling them in your apartment or like how is this happening I had a bunk bed I took the first shelf with the bugs that out and I kept my role as a fabric underneath 'em and I would do mark ups just so that I Would have some things have banks and pattern makers and be like hey this is kind of the cut that I Want\n'em but ultimately works with pattern makers in in midtown to make the first temple is how did you do that when when you were originally looking for the right partnerships I mean you talk about the mail you talk about the pattern makers those people can make or break among the company how did you find the right people I mean ah you meet all of them\nAnd and work with all of them um so it was definitely not the first people that that uh we still work with today um\nBut yeah I really try to go but you are John Glen young people early on\nAbsolutely and then you start to ask vendors who they work with them and I'm kind of deduced from there are like once we found the material or the right material source

I Can't remember one zero\n\nSo I mean that they have they have no credibility and that and and people don't care that's going to be located hurting more Republicans used to screen the debt and they realize people don't care now the Democrats are screaming that people don't care they they they just don't I\nRun a couple of things over the weekend where people were saying you got to understand the country is and I think I mentioned this last friday to this country is really going ah we're really going right we're really only right we're really going right in some areas we are ... physically were not no not even a close eye on on economic issues we're moving to the left\nWell and and then the Republican Party is moving to the ... yeah and\nYou if you look at the uh the the the major threat from capital to capitalism and freedom more importantly\nA it is that debt or because if we're not going to if we don't care about it now than we're willing to let it go over the edge and at that point you can't turn back which means\nYou have government take over control of industry when industry goes south or if there's a program that goes south\nOr you're going to have what again or imagine a scenario forget about cutting you know we talked about the whole hair cut thing\nYou know to two percent five percent ten percent but the problem was is that now you can't talk about a one percent cut you can't talk about a one percent increase snow you can't you can't live with your increase to one percent\nSo there's there's just no way you would have\nRiots in the street remember in Europe when they were cutting or some of the social benefits and there were then and there were riots by young people you know they were they were talking about the especially the like retirement benefits and everything else\nAnd the young people were writing there were setting cars on fire how dare you take away all of our free stuff well imagine you know an economy our size\nAnd we get to the point that we can't service that debt anymore well remember\nIt was what open that door it was the jet I mind trick of rock Obama as president the ... not a problem well today the the economy isn't collapsing but it will\nThen I compare it to saying well you're bedrooms on fire but you're in the kitchen and everything is fine\nOn on academics on on a tax cuts yeah the Republican Party is moving more conservative\nOn on spending uh on on a\nOn tariffs am I talking about China we're talking about the other ones and no we're moving in the Republican Party is moving in a more socialist right a a a a a position remembers we brought you friday the Commerce Department numbers and a half\nOf the increase we're talking about the increase in the GDP half of that increase is due to government spending mhm not not the private market booming now half of it is the private market and preventing and we agree with that\nBut we look at what's coming down the pike here with what Republicans have done and we're extremely concerned about where the economy is going to go\nBut to me when we talked about you know for example turf forget\nAnd you got as I said on friday\nHave conservative lost their economic mind ... because you have people that are conservatives that would absolutely be against the increased a government causing the increase or in prices in goods and services because the goods are going up\nAnd they're claiming that's a that's a good thing that will actually make an economy do better actually two responses on that on friday no no no no no tears makes the economy better know doesn't know we live in the ... and so people that were conservative I rented delusional date\nOf increase you know prices helps the economy it doesn't\nThat helps the ... the companies or the industry that it's designed to protect beyond that no\nBut when we get to I mean we've been talking about the blame game in the whole civility thing because on many issues out there we talked about civility when we talk about look you need to get along with everybody well let's talk about the issues you and I taught gone down this road before and we've looked at what the left as promoting in this country right now and what they're promoting something that we can't compromise\nOn there is no compromise and if there is no compromise what do you do as a nation on sanctuary cities sorry not going to permit sanctuary cities I'd open borders there is no compromise on open borders there is no compromise on sanctuary cities\nKnow where do you go there is no compromise on due process under the law there is no compromise on the presumption of innocence no there is no compromise on oh you believe this particular demographic or this particular gender there is no compromise there no you don't\nOh there's no there's no half measure to to border control you know in general you know forget about the the uh the the legal status or how many legal immigrants we want to let in\nWhat's we first have to have the debate about controlling the border right\nAnd they don't want to have it has now said many times they do not want to have it ... by the way good

this country a ... a and being in this is going into my thirtieth your talk radio\nA ... and one thing has never changed ... so many so many of us and I think now more led by the left or more than the right we seem to think that when one of these things happens that there is a solution to the problem\nThat we just did this these things won't happen anymore if we just had gun control if we if we got rid of all the guns if we um\nA a tone down our rhetoric ... if we got rid of the guns if we'd toned down our our our rhetoric if we\nOf made sure that people that had mental problems couldn't get guns and we go through this time after time\nYear after year\nAnd I understand why people do it because the unknown scares us\nWhy these things happen scares us I mean what what happened in Pittsburgh scares anybody that you could be a you know in your place of worship and somebody would come in with a a gun or and just indiscriminately killed people because of whatever reason\nAnd\nSo many Americans because it's so horrifying\nLook for a solution but the reality is when you have three hundred and thirty million people when you have a third of a billion people in your country\nYou're going to have some people do this irrespective of what the law is it's going to happen\nAnd when I see the you know the the blame game going on I just I look at it and I say\nWhen I first became a talk show host you know I was part of you know who's you know who to blame what's going back and forth back and forth and it does nothing it's an exercise in futility it really is there are things that happen\nThat we can't do anything about well and now now we now we can if we wish to live in a much more authoritarian society\nWell there's a there's many issues that we could do and and very severe a potentially deadly concerns\nThat we could do are we allowed to the authorities to walk into homes and and check on children\nThat will\nYes without any information or any kind of of ah you know that that a suspicion whatsoever just at will open doors start looking to make sure that there are no abused children\nIn that home\nYou know do when you when you hear these horrific stories of children being tied up and you know locked in cages are rooms or closets and are being starved in and all of this well that there are many we could if we wanted to allow that in our society\nWe could just say OK authorities canal just walk into homes at will and to just to see if any crime has been broken or committed\nBut you are in one of the neighbors of the shooter the synagogue shooter was was talking on you know Fox News saying I didn't even have a new there was no clue that this guy was a white supremacist I I didn't know\nAnd I wish there was a way to you know to tell I Wish there was a way\nHow do you know what even in a person's heart I mean maybe ... people close to them do um but then beyond that how do you know\nHow do you change their heart are and how do you predict whether or not because there are plenty of people filled with actual hate when we don't mean people on social media just\nBeing you know negatively about someone we mean people filled with actual hate that are potentially deadly well there are a number of laws we could pass to keep because\nUh you uh you know this guy was on a apparently a a social media site I'd never heard of a that was ... was a social media site for white supremacists\nAnd\nOkay so your we could say that participation in such a site\nOr is against the law we could say that I'm speaking out with hatred in your heart real hatred for groups of people are based on their ethnicity or or or culture that's against the law we could pass a number of law ascended I mean how do you change your freedom\nOf speech ... part of the reasons that freedom of speech speech exist is so\nPeople do proclaim what they think\nSo you know who they are you know exactly all the all you do by taking away their free speech rights as what you send them underground that's what you do well\nAnd and when there's pressure from you know society because the reason I'm guessing the reason and I think it's a solid theory here that the neighbor wasn't aware of of this kind of you know hatred in this\nPerson's heart is because in our society\nWe don't tolerate it morally speaking forget about the legality of it all forget about what can be done legally morally we don't tolerate that because the overwhelming majority of people don't have this kind of hatred evil than there are no\nAnd you cannot ... and and that's what it comes down to

that we talked about the first time we've talked about free speech the left does not believe in free speech\nThey don't believe in freedom of religion\nWe've talked about the different you know a Baker cases floors cases are out there\nAnd as most people in America bullied look don't want you want to do behind closed doors\nBut don't care what you want to do with your life\nDon't force me to believe it now the left wants you wants to force you to do it remember when Obama became president\nOh no no no come on I mean Obama Care now there's going to be fine no we're not going to force or anybody who was religious to do anything against a what they wish to what to do oh contraception contraceptives yeah we're going to force you to do this\nWe knew it all along so you look at freedom of the first amendment they don't believe in that anymore they don't believe in freedom of speech I don't believe in freedom of religion Second Amendment they want gone they believe is antiquated and as we as seen now\nAnd this comes from the identity politics ... created and nurtured by the Democrat Party are there to the point now of\nAs we saw during Cavanaugh a woman is always to be believed due process doesn't matter when a woman makes the allegation everybody knows that's total garbage\nEvery case is on the evidence if you came out and said you believe now there should be a presumption of innocence and we should have due process\nYou were called every name in the book you were called a gang rape enabler ...\n\nThat's where the political divide is in this country then we go even further with the election of Trump and the ... and and what happened with cabinet that now the left is promoting and we're seeing the beginning of this\nAnd it's\nAnd it's spreading now go to social media and see how many people on the left are picking it up well you know yeah the electro college\nWas wrong and now so is the Senate the Senate is wrong we shouldn't have it set it anymore and we shouldn't have the electoral college which again to me there's no compromise on those issues why\nBecause I understand why they were created they were created to protect individual rights that the left used to care about\nWe've often talked about the ignorance of the people in this country especially on the left when it comes to understanding the constitution which they don't even wanna seemed to understand whatsoever\nBut we live in a constitutional\nRepublic not a direct democracy and there was a reason for it\nIt was sold the majority could not rule over the minority\nIt was so individual rights could be protected but the majority could not rural your constitutional rights invalid that's why we live in a constitutional republic\nThey don't care and so now the political divide is not how much a government should provide to every body or how much the transfer of wealth should\nBe\nNow the left has moved into the political divide is Ben we don't believe in the United states we don't believe in individual rights we don't believe in the first amendment we don't believe in the second amendment we don't believe in due\nProcess under the law we only care about what we want and however we at tainted including tearing down the constitution of the United states if we had the power to do so\nWhere's the compromise if you sit in our states where's the compromise on that well there isn't any there isn't any so there's going to be a political divide and it's going to be fierce and\nIt's going to be passionate well and that's always going to be the case and and right now the reason that it is a the the debate is so fears is because of the importance of those items this is why you seen the Republican Party I think Joe especially since the Kavanaugh thing\nBut I think the the Kavanaugh thing was was not just about the Kavanaugh process or the lack of respect for the process\nI think it was an eye opener for a lot of those that were in the middle I think it was an eye opener for Lindsey Graham\nBecause\nAnd I had a one time during a pre show meeting during all of that after it happened we were like I said wow who knew Lindsey Graham huh but you had Lindsey Graham actually say during that a passionate speech\nTalking about the process during sort of my or and Elana Kagan's\nConfirmation\nAnd what the discussion was about\nBut I think for a lot of them they live inside the bubble they don't see it as we see it every single day they follow the rhetoric but they don't follow it like we do certainly they they hear things and they see things but now they were people were getting in their face\nNow it had come to their\nTable right there on the committee\nThat they saw it with a Senate majority leader basically being chased down in an airport they saw it with what Ted Cruz and it wasn't just\nProtester groups that kind of behavior had reached the Senate chambers and I think it was an eye opener for them\nMrs show listen anywhere at any time on demand to catch up on

never follow the route of guns are they really early and get my tomorrow on TALK radio what what somebody\nDay we have [noise]\nThese are currently I'm Gary ... so just having a discussion on the political divide from\nOur point of view and why it exists today and and it's just it's a reality of what we what we live with\nA we're not the first ones to live the political divide in this country and we won't be the last the only difference in the political divide now is it's not a political divide anymore as I can see it\nBased on the fact that we as a nation need to provide more to the people with a bigger federal government under the constitution but now it's a belief on the left\nThat the laws and the constitution that we have to protect individual rights and the minority\nDon't matter anymore\nAnd so you know we we've talked about capping off the caravan also brings not just illegal immigration or into the forefront but it brings in the concept of sanctuary cities mhm\nAnd I still believe that the Republicans have failed miserably to capitalize on this\nBecause yeah science or you think about sanctuary cities just the belief\nThat in a legal immigrant criminal and their freedom is more important than the rights and security of American citizens\nThat's the point that isn't brought up enough what you hear is sanctuary cities well we need to protect these people ... what are you doing you're not protecting just illegal immigrant you're protecting the illegal immigrant criminal that's ... ... by the way that's actually why it's news\nYeah\nYeah it's it is not you know this is the you I think the the situation in California where you had a city's come out and and go after the state for sanctuary state policy\nAnd the\nThe concerns that were issued at those all those events surrounding that and it's still going on there will be in it that will be an interesting legal battle by the way\nUh to watch in the coming years um but that threat is is very real when you talk about your cities' leaders are your county or your state leaders\nSaying we're not here to protect you I mean that goes beyond think about the empty political but the the political process the promises over the years\nWe're going to be tough on crime we're really going to work to improve things up some people actually were able to get it done\n\nBut those empty political promises people usually scoff at this is quite the opposite it's not just a political promise it's an in your face action by the government that says we\nAre not here to serve you and your safety interests were here to serve the safety interest of someone who doesn't belong here who was not a citizen\nAnd so I think it's important where the political debate has because many people are falling into it the political debate has become the back and forth on social media every tweet let's analyze the back and forth who had the worst insult\nWho made who who who made a the the social media stigma that could be perceived as a little bit more violent than the other person even though it really wasn't violent and even if they were kidding around and we're like let's talk about what really the political divide in this country is really about what is the substance of the political divide\nRight and I believe from my point of view that's that's what I fear\nI fear a lost of liberty I fear last of the protection of the uh minorities in this and and and I mean across the board I'm Talking about constitutionally speaking ... the the reason we live in a constitutional Republican\nOut of direct democracy and that's why the call to get rid of the Senate and the call to get rid of\nOf of ah the electoral college even if it's not going anywhere it shows the intent of where the left wishes to do when you see sanctuary cities when you see open borders when you see their leaders promoting lawlessness\n\nPromoting it yeah that's when you get to the point of people saying I don't know where I can compromise how do I how do I deal with you how do I talk to you\nRight\nHow do I how do I get I don't want to get across when when the Kavanaugh thing goes on and you have the main stream of the Democrat Party the mainstream Democrat senators promoting at a certain demographic always has to be believed in this case a woman\n\nThe ... and that the presumption of innocence doesn't matter and that the person that the allegation is thrown against automatically is guilty\n\nWhen you have that exist when you have the belief of a major political ... party the due process doesn't matter\n\nThat laws don't matter when it comes to sanctuary cities when the borders don't matter\n\nWhen the way of government that we have that protects the individual and protects the minority the constitutional republic not the direct democracy that we live in\n\nWhen the other side goes against basic tenants of what makes America America not rhetorically speaking not who's got the bigger flag not not claims that their American more than you\n\nBut those who actually believe and wish to defend the constitution of the United states versus those that don't\nThat's a political divide that's very tough to solve\nWell it's not like a you know a social issue where you know eventually there might be I don't know I'm a resolution or a change of heart we're talking about the very basic fundamentals\nOf the country of the nation\nWe're talking about the building blocks of the nation because what you have is where they build the numbers and people supporting all of this is people not knowing\nIts the willfully ignorant but that don't know\nBecause they believe that they can have a big government but not an intrusive government well if you believe that then you also believe\nYou know you you make a a you make a great point and uh I remember when\nTrump first started running for president people wonder if you'd be an isolationist mhm he wants to back off he doesn't want to get involved he's been president United States now he probably has projected us power\nWithout you know any type of major war better than any president I've known there in in in my lifetime ... you know projecting it I guess maybe you can make a case for Reagan because of the the the Cold War or a different thing\nReagan ... post Cold War say let's go post okay for sure but it's it's I don't I think it's unfair because I was totally different situation when you look at the Cold War that exist or but post Cold War\nUh I I think he's actually he hasn't been an isolationist I think he understands that even though we don't want to get involved in everybody's business you've got to project American power and I believe that he has why they want to do it is an interesting case I Do think that you have\nFor example you have left us professors that are sitting there and they're think tanks and talking about how we need to be you know global citizens and how the United states needs to you know needs to go away and to become part of a Europe or whatever but I think when it comes to comes down to the average person it's not that complicated\nI think they're not getting into theoretical political discussion leftist discussions\nI think it's about the fact that they get into their tunnel vision and say oh we didn't ... Kavanaugh's in we can't have Gavin I'll get rid of the Senate\nWell uh it's probably time Trump draws president tried to get rid of the presidency um get rid of the electoral college\nEverybody we get rid of the electoral college we can't have a ... if we lose the electoral vote and win the popular vote we can't have that right and and and it is pretty much the solution to everything from the lack of that didn't go away we'll get rid of that\nSo I don't I don't know if I don't believe that the average liberal running around who was outside of university [laughter] [laughter] or liberal think tank is going through that process of saying we wish to all be global citizens I Know that's promoted but you see the most of those those kind of comments mostly come from university\nA type people I think it's the average liberal politician out there since her and says I Want to win election next election what can get it for me open borders well I really don't want to open borders but I Want as many illegal immigrants to come in 'cause if we claim that if we claim that we care about them than if they can get citizenship will get their vote\nWell and that's it it it's you know if we can it if we can pose as people as the side that cares the fact of the matter is they only care about again their side the things that they want they want to completely do away\nWith the foundation of the nation they want to do away with this with the with anybody who disagrees with oh we want free speech but only free speech\nFor the things we agree with her uh [noise] well that's not what free speech is about\nFree speech is about the stuff you don't believe [noise]\n\n\nThe ... radio on Westwood One\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shell roads I'm a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine red eye radio and shoveled tell us what matters is inside\nAttention owner operators tired and chasing empty promises RSVP is looking for you to join their team offering a dollar Seventy five per mile for cello drivers or two dollars per month for teens\nAre asked me Pete he's all miles that hadn't back home or not in their vocabulary they're no treatment rentals needed a male hidden secrets how our I think the today an alternate RSVP three six five that's a A R asked me Pete three six five four apply online RSVP I on the dot com that's RSVP ... dot com\nTruckers quick question for you how\nDo you say in a chain when you're not on the road some truckers watch DVDs on laptops others just bring a book on their home some people even resorted trucks dub TV or ... no thank you me I like to one line to the end of the day was live HDTV in my cab or it was just horrible satellite antennas it's easier than ever\nMounted to your roof are still until your day is over then just shut them up in your sleep or gas\nBeing tenders or lightweight shut up and minutes and daughter Clara lifelike connection blood it gets even butter with dish there is no longer TV contract to reduce pain as you go programming you pay for only the most you actually use check it out a dish for my truck Doug gum fleet owners want to give your truckers the comfort\nOf home on the road is due to safety GV is perfect for college do you know the TV you love to watch it at home in the comfort of your cab\nAnd you have to put up with trucks or GV and over again find out more dish for much drug dot com today restrictions apply\nRed eye radio in our sponsors a devoted to trucking safety\nThat's why we're proud to bring you the red eye radio million mile club for twenty seven years\nWe've been saluting drivers who surpass the million mile mark with preventable accident free driving by reaching this milestone you can be a part of an elite club of drivers who share remarkable safety records and demonstrate superior driving skills\nIf you or someone you know it's a truck driver with a million miles or more driving was outer preventable accident register online at red eye radio show dot com that's run I radio show dot com\nThe red eye radio million mile club would not be possible without the support of our great sponsors including Petro stopping centers\nHow's lubricate or the ... the family of companies motel six the sink Christopher fund cats scale and cover electronics we applaud the individual truckers athletes who drive with care and keep our highways said\nDrivers your favorite magazines are now on stands and ready for you to read cover to cover truckers connection offers great jobs entertainment industry news each month\nJob opportunities for owner operators is easy to spot with a hot right on the cover and the best career options for truck owners inside\nLined truckers connection and job opportunities free at ... traveled centers of America we'll pills and other truck stops nationwide truckers connection and job opportunities for owner operators we're searching for greener grass just ...\nThe H.

American politics as you pointed out many times but that doesn't that doesn't matter no he's an extremist\nAnd we must labeled him as such\nThis will be the tactic for you know and has been the tactic by the left or for many years on presidential candidates but it's going to be the ... it's the tactic by the left on on pretty much everything now\nAnd we address this last week I don't like a lot of Trump's rhetoric and I don't think it's needed I don't think it's needed to win but I Know it's part of his personality I hate to say it but as ... as\nThe great conservative political pundit shots you said ...\nRemember during the campaign and was that after the campaign was after the campaign last messing with people's heads\nYeah we're from queens we messed with people right now I don't like

in years right\nLet the wins do the talking\nBut I understand but I I've come to realization of of who he is although I did see some I did uh some of the social media are posted well you can't no longer look at Trump\nSaid that the rhetoric is acceptable because he has good policy\nWon't know\nActually you can and you can also say for all of his rhetoric um [noise] look at the opposition ...

comes to border control\nWhat you have or what do you what you have a right now you think about this Trump is being blamed for the caravan\n\nLook you can be blamed the\nGround that's being blamed for the Asia is being blamed that he doesn't care and the and the and the point is because you said we're going to stop and that the border and Democrats are saying no they all should be able to get through because they're only looking for the American dream and that's what's fair\nWell then at that point it was nice rare but if you believe that as the mainstream now the Democrat Party believes you may be a liberal and you may say you disagree with it but it's what your party now endorses\nThey may not you and then they may not use the term open border but that's what they mean go ahead I'm Sorry go ahead\nIt is it is unfortunate that that\nPerception of the Democratic party has now proliferated but I I Would I Would venture to tell you that no president\nIn the past three or four administrations has deported more illegal immigrants than ... he deported more immigrants than any President Trump Bush Clinton Reagan none of them\nOkay and look I I don't know why I left you know what I hear leaning Democrat okay launch open borders okay one day here's here's we're here or there if we\nWant safety here here's a point I Want\nI mean we we can debate the numbers some other time but let's say that's absolutely true and nobody deported more than President Obama then why is Trump being demonized for believing the same thing that Iraq Obama believed\n\nIf things are hyper ... has a little bit less than ... than Obama did when it comes to his ... his way over and he talks about\nThe way he talks about it not what is not what he wants to do not the ... people are against what he wants to do is that what you're trying to say\nOh I'm trying to say is that the seems to me a as someone who is your brother is your\nFellow American citizen and I love you and I have a ton of conservative friends Republican friends we're all brothers we're all brothers what I'm saying is that it seems to me the trunk and the way he characterizes\nPeople who are in need and if you were in their position if you were in the same position you want the best for your family you want you would want the best for your friends you would you would want the best for yourself you want the best life it seems to me that\nYou're in a gay but a lot is not the last ... director that where gestures guilty okay well let me we're Jerry Lee are using language to characterize ride right well here's not ... it here's the point is ugly right now that people are dying in my opinion I'm All right okay All right bill that are dying with as a result\nOf hatred and partisanship coming from both sides and I will tell you that the left as just as guilty\nOkay here's what we were not saints here's a point that I Want to get too because you this is very important 'cause one of the things that that really\nGets to conservatives because conservatives have compassion and I believe and I believe that ... and I believe that that are that you actually we're we've got some interference or I I Believe the Trump is compassionate\nI Believe Trump's rhetoric at times goes over the top ... example [laughter] you know the example I'm going to give [laughter]\nKeeping the conspiracy going the cruise Ted Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination so to me that was the high level anything since then has actually taken down a little bit because that's what the heck of an allegation so we understand that when it comes to hyperbole he can go over the top\nBut don't you care about the substance\nIs it only the hyperbole then is that what you're claiming Democrat or Democrats only care about how\nYou say it's not what you say and you also have to understand when it comes to the theory that exist in America by a lot of people including Trump when you see the Democrats wish to protect illegal immigrant criminals this is not ultra part is going\nTo get people angry it is the reality of what exists today\nDating reality is not hate talk but when you have the Democrats who prefer their preference is the safety and security of illegal immigrant criminals over American citizens\nYeah you're going to get people angry including the president ... yep what's gonna happen\nUm look and by the way the whole thing with remember the president said the rapist thing and you know it's it's you know you and I for example we've said you could take quotes that we have said and and you know in the context of not knowing other things you could take it out of context as soon as that was said he goes no I mean the the bad people not the good ones and he said we know there are good people tried to come across\nThe border we can't do it so we clarified that a long long time ago in fact to clarify that right after it happened yes but again it was a what they did was they took it and they ran with it that that all are rapists\n\nAh to sit and discuss what rhetoric may dry but a mass shooter\nTo do what they want it's I guess on your part it would be a guest on my part none of us know you don't know what sets off people and so to say we need to tamp that we need to temper the rhetoric\nAcross the board or ... I think we should uh as conservatives because I think we can win every issue without doing so I understand why the left and I understand why some people on the right do it\nI disagree with it but I understand why they do it the leftist nothing else to go on the last caller I like I said it was really interesting he was talking about how you need to get rid of the hyper partisanship and then he went into hyper partisanship\n\nWell and and and saying that he doesn't know anybody that's for open borders I don't know anybody that well the fact of the matter is is that there are there are people out there that are calling for open borders I think we sort of convince ... and here's the thing I I Would ask a huge ask those that use side with\nAnd I mean the people running for office or that are holding office right now ask them what level of enforcement on the border\nDo they believe it it's a very simple crushed up\nBut we live in a nation was free speech we're not going to get rid of free speech the second amendment isn't going away free speech is going to stay\nA there is a party that was just to get rid of it ours is not that party\nWell they're ... they're working very hard right now to to do that and and if you think to the last ... I don't think that doesn't exist then go to talk to the people of California by the way you're using the wrong pronoun there is a penalty of up to a year in jail and that law for a reason\nWhen I say ours I mean conservative mhm I said party I meant conservative because Republicans as you remember McCain was a Republican assigned McCain or that or a sponsor McCain fined gold and Bush signed saying that he knew parts of it were unconstitutional but hold up the courts deal with it and you and I were furious when he did that\nSo so there you know if you if you think that you know you're the the colored in describing well where are your brothers were you know we we are trying to paint every one is as someone who thinks it's him\nOn the left but that's not the case\nTell me is not extreme in New York when they say if you use the wrong pronoun we can find you up to the point that it would shut your business down\nIn California [noise]\nIt's in the law [noise] they can put you in jail for using the wrong pronouns [noise]\nNow tell me that's not a threat [noise]\n\n\nAs soon as ... radio on Westwood One\nMyth or show listen anywhere at any time on demand to catch up on Eric and Gary's topics of the day visit red eye radio show dot com and click on demand that red eye radio show dot com\nIf you're forming today you know all about taking risk well here's one risk you don't have to take any more the risk of ID I be internal diesel inject do deposits because now cynics ruby field master bringing diesel fuel has an advance injections stabilize or to prevent id ID so you don't have to risk and gender\nFailure cloud filters and downtime in more cynics ruby field masters even back when the ten year ten thousand our warranty\nFor even less risk peace of mind power alone center inches of rain the sea agents\nCobra electronics is proud to support the fight against breast cancer by partnering with bright pink and traveled centers of America and Petro stopping center to bring you the twenty ninth LCD bright pink CB radio this limited edition right did see\nThe radio is helping to save lives for breast and ovarian cancer by empowering women to liberal actively for every radios old man who was making the donation device thinking the fight against cancer the right to the radio is available for a limited time ... travel centers of America and Petro stopping centers\nAttention owner operators how are you tired of chasing empty promises RSVP is looking for you to join the routine offering a dollar Seventy five per mile for ... drivers for two dollars per mile for teams\nAre asked me ... all miles that hadn't back home or not in their vocabulary they're naturally rentals needed a male hidden secrets are I think the today an eighty eight RSVP three six five that's a A R asked me Pete three six five four apply online at RSVP I.

I'm always curious as to the people\nWho do participate especially an early voting it's not just you know conservatives um it's liberals but even in our state you know it's a red state but you see that participation on both sides so you wonder what they are thinking and and if I could have a conversation\nOh with a number of them just just a round table you have you have\nMy mindset yesterday\nWas such a nice day yeah I mean this is\nUh to me this is this is not work today I'm In the middle of a three day vacation ... I just happened to be doing this today ... because it's supposed to be any like eighty today in eighty tomorrow and then it's gone\nSo I'm pretending this is like a long weekend and I just happen to come in here and want to chat with you ... I wanted to bring in some alcohol to pretend I was staying out real late in the morning and mhm\nRight so I took a long bike ride yesterday\nFifteen mile bike ride and I did it all throughout my huge subdivision that I live in\n... and as I was driving around 'em or we're probably knows I'm running around I'm looking for one cruise sign one\nBecause I told you the other day I I didn't think I saw once why specifically when Fifteen miles around I live in a subdivision that probably has about three thousand thirty five hundred homes I think it is relatively new uh south south the ... of south west to Dallas a twenty five miles southwest of Dallas\nOr right before you get to farmland is where I live you know it was like subdivision farmland ... but the big subdivision\nOr probably about two or three every block I Would go down every street two or three better science didn't see one crew sign in Fifteen miles driving through my subdivision and you and I asked the question is that even an effective way to spend your campaign dollars\nMhm [noise] yeah I see a number of them are in my neighborhood uh there's there's a few but there's just as many Ted Cruz signs right now and yards in my new yeah nah ...\nCouldn't couldn't find one yeah and and but I'm driving it I'm going violent man I Would love to talk to these people ... like if they were\nSitting out there and drive wages pay how ya doin' pull up my bike oh yeah riding the bike and then look at it uh even for that\nEven if even if I had to not to be honest and tell [laughter] well actually this is ... and not just a volunteer information just go oh see uh even prevent why over Cruz no that that's exactly the way I Would like to approach it especially at the polls just have like a ... just\nA roundtable discussion of people that are voting or just cast their vote a okay you know what do you think as you just cast your vote\nSo it would be you'd say what are you thinking not\nGot yeah so you ...\nWhat do you like what is it that is you know because\nIt it it's different in every low college it's different in every precinct\nUh it's different you know state to state or we do have you know Democrats that that when I mean Beto has won his district I mean and and can if he wants to\nServe in the house he can he can stay in that district I think for a long long time if he wants to 'em but there are you know again as you as you kind of wide now through the state I'm just curious as to what the the average\nEveryday person is thinking because clearly they're active voters so there's there's that um\nIs it a routine kind of thing that almost his routine for me but I take it very seriously and it is a very thoughtful process because I Do take it seriously\nYou have a routine there's nothing wrong with routine of means his party ... is part of the culture that you grew up right All right\nBut I Wonder if there are there's somebody will that that have a routine and it's just based on you know this is the ideology and and this is it and it's not or not even a ideology there's just no way I can vote for the other side I mean there's a number of questions that I Would have\nAnd I would sit it would probably take hours to sit around just a just a regular\nYou know think of Frank lunch and the stuff that he's done you know\nFox News a lot of years I like Frank but I always think he asked the wrong questions you know why he doesn't ask the questions I Would ask ... exactly [laughter] and and and I think in that setting\nToo I mean these are these are people that I I Know just voted these are people that are active especially if you were to do it like in an early voting setting mhm you know that that are active early and it's going to I Know what's going to be on both sides\nUm I Would love to see what is it that's driving you and we'll we'll see some of that I think you know after well a week from Wednesday we'll we'll learn what some of that was here's a question\nI Would ask in Texas nobody is even talked about the governor's race\nYeah there's really not a race they can talk about [laughter] at all because Greg Abbott has a roughly a ... point lead yeah over loop evolved as the Democrat yeah ... a former former sheriff above downtown ...\nAnd that's not even close you you don't hear anything about that so here's a question that I Would ask this is a very interesting question\nHave probably a couple of hundred thousand people maybe even more\nYou could probably point to a number of people that say that still stuck with me even though the president is with him in Houston I'm not\nI mean I I think you would probably again which some I Can't even measure that but I Know there are people that support the president right now support governor Abbott and are not going to support\nTed Cruz for one reason or the other and it's it's likely because I'm I'm guessing a handful of them at least are saying it's because he did not get on board and\nTwenty sixty I Would love to see those boats how many votes for Abbott but don't vote for Cruz at or battle just don't vote for ...\n... yeah no there or you know if you if you look at that there there could be a number of them that aren't voting in the Senate or how many of them\nYou know are looking at the governor's race and and you know going well yeah that's it that's all great wonderful but Lupe Valdez is not our ... there were a number of things that came up and her history as a share of that the left is considered that in fact have been more vocal about\nUh of course in the in the past few months that they're concerned with her actions as an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff department under her leadership\nSo you look at that and the and and those that probably has some to do with it again you know you could put some of those answers in that category but we'll see what we're comes together I guess on election day in and how many people actually did vote for Abbott\n... wouldn't vote for Ted Cruz that's an interesting question and point\nEight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of

Welcome to the show high\n... Joe ... a husband and I notice a ... as an American black who is conservative boy when you started off show talking about how you see it I have five those values ever take\nA especially when it comes to the African American you understand electrical committee when I go to work and or interest in my everyday life because that's just a group of people for my life is ... the centered around and they always ask me why are you a conservative and being black is because\nI'm a fan for myself and what's the alternative of socialism type but we'll go to where if you're a Christian as you say you're a Christian um those systems they're Adams to what you believe you know\nAnd if you are a male black male talking about racism\nUnder those this book as you say something that the uh the ruling party or ruled the mob doesn't like you're you're you're going to be in jail or be ostracized so\nI mean if you're that you're getting fat now you're not thinking about about all these other systems that you don't even know that you're promoted just because it's not a Republican issue you're you're you're not educated yourself on what the citizens really do and what they really are\nI\nI Can't argue with anything that you just said that uh they they really don't understand at times what they're promoting\nAnd James ... I've said this the the biggest challenge that we face today is talk show host is not debating the issues it's debating against ignorance people actually don't know what they're actually promoting\nTo me that's the most credit if I\nGo ahead go ahead yes because if I asked my my African American person that that that that I'm speaking with for a Latino person you know I'm I asked them because I learned this from you guys what are you for what what I mean I Know what your gas but what are you for\nAnd and ... most of them they really can't articulate what they're for they just articulate what their gas\nAnd as a black person I have to say so they have that my skin color doesn't dictate how I live my life it it informs me on\nIgnorant people in my vitamin but it does dictate to me how I think how I live so therefore uh ...\nYou when you're saying right for them is the problem do you really do we stand what is America races or you're talking about individual people who act it quickly\nRight you have to go down that and I think that's what we you know battle against all the time because\nThere had been we've changed the definition of things or people labels certain things\nAnd we have to go back 'cause you just displayed there ... James we have to go back and ask them okay what is it that you mean by that specifically what kind of actions are ... are you talking about when it comes to people that you believe a racist because we have to go back to every uh you know Republican\nA presidential candidate and Bill Maher said it\nYou know during the twenty six team uh uh the election season well the other guys Mitt Romney and\nUh you know George W. Bush and John McCain well they weren't Hitler Hitler but but definitely this guy is really Hitler but that's the that's the most the lab they really want to come out and and make you believe that this guy\nOr whoever it is the most recent was rent the current threat is the one that is is is the biggest threat to you right now the only way they can get away with that or they think they can get away with that is by creating a monster and the person\nYou know a James I saw the a young black Leadership Conference that the President Trump spoke to the other day and I saw one of the young people that was interviewed that said\nI'm finally off the plantation and when he said that I went wow that's going to drive liberals just crazy but to me and I'm not black\nBut to me when he said that\nWhat it was was I I'm I'm Out of the I'm Out of the mindset of groupthink that if I'm if I'm involved in group thinking find being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin and then my mind is still in the plantation\nAnd that and that's what I've been trying to some of the other foot you're you're you're pointing the finger at a a Republican plantation what I'm saying what what ... are you are on right now that one allows you to think as you really think\nBecause when ... when you talk to black folks about the the homosexual thing and the marriage thing or whatever\nIf you talk to the mission by issue as they lined up with more of a conservative mindset but because of their best so brave brainwashed into your thinking of all races and racism racism racism you know it clouds their their their their judgment\nYou know I Wonder\nWe talked about the identity politics with a with the ... with the Democrats in and the identity politics that are really\nI think come to the forefront because they're so radical is you know number one the transgender movement where if you're a a man you can be a woman and the the country and laws must or recognize you that way and then what we've got into now is transracial that if you're black you can be white and if you're white you can be black\nLegally and I started thinking about that and wonder how many cars we said this we said with the transgender it seemed that there was more acceptance and when they jumped to the trans racial\nI said I think you're going to get a lot of blowback from a lot of black leaders out there standing wait a minute so you can be whatever race you want whenever you want to be it and I thought that was really interesting I Wonder if people thought that that was ... just a ... a lot of minorities might have seen that and said okay\nMaybe this time for me to get on a different mindset as to where the Democrats are going\nBecause it is I expect that challenge is so what does this fight band for a way yeah was it all in vain yeah right\nNo that's I I think that's the question that that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset\nFrom the the the the left right now that\nYou can be whatever you wish to be now that includes gender or race so there because there's transgender as ... there's also a trans racial Islam and they want you to believe well if that's how you identify will hold on a second because if you look\nAt a you know the the\nThe civil rights at the protected groups created under the civil rights that\nIf there if you can belong if anyone can belong to any protected group\nThen there are just by saying so then there are no protected groups then the civil rights and they learned is done it's over ...
