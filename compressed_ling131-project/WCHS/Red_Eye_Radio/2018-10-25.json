that you support if ... if that's found out we have no idea what it is but if that's the case then that somebody who just write the less than two weeks before a major election\nYou just hurt their chances and and by the end and so when you you look at it as we said I mean this is a and we've said this all along but there was a rush rush in collusion or a case like this we look at it from the investigative ... point of view and if you're an investigator and you're looking at something like this ah and you know some of the questions that you're thinking of\nA based on the fact that you have a lack of information and nobody has said that these were actually live bombs where you say okay\nUh when we find out if they were you know live bombs mhm well then you know that without question was an attempt to kill these people that would end so right you go from it from you go from it from that point of view trying to figure that out if it was\nThey find out that none of the bombs were active that none of the bombs had any potential of going off\nThen you look you would be looking I Believe that two different things you if you're looking at it from an investigator's point of view which would be All right this was a scare tactic to either scare these people or it was political in nature mhm it was meant just a couple of weeks before an election\nTo help drive which is again something that you would have to look at it was to help drive the the motivation here was to help\nDrive an election to a a certain side mhm and at that point you would look at it and say well it's if they did this to help Trump did to help Trump and then you would look at it from the other side which was okay\nAh this was to set up Trump\nAnd make it look suspicious because of the things that Trump has said the provocative things he has said\nAnd help change the the uh public discourse\nTo blaming Trump as that's at like I said it has that started already without any evidence whatsoever but that's the most incredible thing with the media starts talking about whether it's you know soccer whatever yesterday from CNN going after the you know going after the president going after the right talking about the divisive\nComments out there will nothing could ... be more divisive than accusing another side or a person blaming them for something where there is a complete lack of evidence says to the motivation\nOf the person or persons who did a particular deed mhm\nNow see I'm not jumping out of China and assigning to something nothing could be nothing could be more divisive so as they sit there on their high horse screaming that your devices they had committed the ultimate sins and divisiveness anyway not\nWell Hillary comes out and says we must be more civil just days after saying there's no way to be civil with the other side that it's not possible she's shut the door on that just days ago\nWell look this this is where we we have the conversation but it's ridiculous and I say it's ridiculous for for this reason uh after steep skull east was shot and you had a man who was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nWho's goal was to assassinate and kill and he uh he did not succeed in doing it thank thank goodness to the Capitol police but his goal was to kill as many Republican members of Congress as possible\nWould you say that that has brought down\nThe divisive rhetoric on the left over the last year and\nNo no no and\nNone of it's going to all of this has to get a political advantage one way or another what you're hearing yesterday is about getting a political advantage because you cannot debate the point that we've just made\nThat the most divisive you had these people sitting in their ivory towers the media elite ivory towers claiming that they care about civility and they are anti divisive\nThat's what they're about and they hate the divisiveness that exist today and then they commit the ultimate sin of divisiveness and that is to blame somebody for potentially you know a a terrorist attack\nWould they complete lack of evidence to back up their claim there was no one oh either way there's no way of it\nAnd we may not have it for a long time\nAnd the fact is they don't see that no they don't they don't see that they don't and it's obvious anybody who is a political hack understands how obvious it is\nSo not really much more to talk about I mean it it's we either there's a will there's a again a we've said this many times on topics that we are ignorant about which means topics that we don't have the facts on mhm\nNot much you can say the only thing we can report or the the few facts that we do have a total rewrite seven yeah now suspicious packages according to the FBI or they were sent to you know prominent members or or or uh or backers of the Democrats and so\nThat's all we can say that's it that's all we know about it\nAnd as soon as they release it more information will you know will pass that along when we know the whole story if we ever know the whole story\nThat we can talk about it\nBut right now that without knowing the motivation unless that person comes forward and tells us what the motivation was\nWe can't assign it to anything we have no idea absolutely no idea no idea\nAnd\nSo that that's where we stand right when we find out more information we'll give you more information but speculation on these things is useless but the thing is that's the kind of nation that we live in ...\nWell sure it started right away you know and I was thinking too that you know the media getting on their high horse you know that ... that you know hey we don't ever cause any type of device of rice right in and all I have to say is Ferguson\nMhm built on a lie mhm\nCompletely built an ally CNN and MSNBC all over that mhm enabling\nThe the uh\nUh as in in my opinion enabling the range that existed uh attacking law enforcement you and I remember\n\nJake Tapper writing and writing tapper can you believe there's police are there in ... has been riots for the last few days of course they're going to stage police in riot gear mhm they were they kept pushing the narrative\nThat the you know that the police rotted control hands up don't shoot you remember it right they they they were part of of pushing and amplifying the divisiveness that was based on a lie mhm\nSo CNN don't set up there on your high horse as it were just the end is worthy innocent Arbor tours of the news\nWell there was a ... is soccer calling out his own Don Lemon for the other night saying that ah regarding the Ted Cruz and so then that that comes with the territory that in in a private setting on private property it's OK and acceptable\nTo me shouted out of a restaurant\nThat civil that's the kind of and and ... and the endorsement that came from Don limit on that that comes with the territory which is to say you should expect that from now on\nWhy don't you write some more memos Mr soccer\nDo you want to get in we do of lines open like us a lot to cover today latest polls on the uh the the uh the midterms are out there take a look a little bit of the you know the stock market yesterday you know took a took a big hit\nA yeah the only thing I don't believe it will affect the mid term election but as we've often said right probably whatever whatever whatever happens wouldn't probably affect economically the midterms ... when you look to twenty twenty and and long term there are things that in this country needs to solve before twenty twenty\nYes ah there are some things that this country needs to solve before twenty Nineteen before to my head\n[laughter] wow there's\nA lot of I mean that's a hobby that's my moral morning [laughter] if you if you look at what's going on economically and and what these companies are saying I I think the president I think he likely already knows that that if if he doesn't believe it then he certainly being told by every economic advisor on his staff well not every yeah\nMaybe not Wilbur Ross not maybe not ... I mean yeah yeah ... Larry Kudlow yeah you know as former economic advice well we talked about this the more ... than art Laffer wrote a book\nOr that said you know so much of this is good but the tariffs and other things and and and it was a the introduction was done by his cheap Trump's chief economic advisor yeah as we've already of\nIf Wilbur Ross doesn't see the danger here ...

we've always done is and and and talk about the issues or whether we talk about the issues and talk about the substance of the ideas is because we believe that we can explain them easy and the majority of Americans will agree with us\nWe have fun at times we sort of fake name call it up and you know and and the worst we ever call anybody who's an idiot because we call ourselves idiots\n[laughter] and and that's really about the the ... the worst that we um we do we get passionate at at times\nBut that's one of the reasons we've always set for any Republican out there you don't need to use any type of of rhetoric that the opposition can ever used against you in any way it's part of the discussion that we've had over the last couple of days\nFor Republicans and and the president and general take the wind and move on take the take the ... that's the goal the goal is to win\nThe goal is not to get in a better rhetorical means shot across the bow that gives you temporary satisfaction the satisfaction for me is getting the political when moving the country in the direction that I Wish to move it getting temporary satisfaction out of calling Eric\nOr a as nope it ridiculous study it may be true in status I'm Out every night to kill us [laughter] may be true and satisfy me for a moment\nBut it doesn't it doesn't really work I haven't convinced anybody have by that my opinion is right over Arabs because I did that did I\nKnow everybody in the control room raised their hand [laughter]\nThat's not only guys and and so that's the you know that's why we have ... you you take the whole goal is to is to make it that that you you when ... ... ... it's part of an and I I Will tell you this came from my dad\nAnd and you and I have talked about this uh the before just in you know different negotiations we've had in in the business together and that my dad always had a sane\nAnd it's in business be one hundred percent right one hundred percent of the time and the first time my dad told me that I just went when he ... that that you you can't be he said you know understand you're not going to be right one hundred percent of the time\nSo keep your mouth shut in any meeting the ... ... unless you know that you're one hundred percent right all the time sure footing sure footing make sure that you when you said if you want to succeed make sure that you win\nEvery single debate at times that might mean you have to say look I'm not sure I'll get back to you on that one it's one of the reasons why we really we ask questions on many issues but we don't speculators fact\nNow we don't speculate to the point of conclusion right I'm On things that we don't have all the facts on 'em and and that's what it comes down to for me is that uh you the\nFrustration I think right now is with me at least is the fact that for the first time in a long time\nThe Republican Party is motivated by a president\nWho on many economic things and national things can get things done mhm focus on those but beyond that build the momentum forward and you know I've got a couple of emails from yesterday's show you know in talking about well you think the people who are really going to be turned off by the horse race thing and\nBlah blah blah blah blah blah you know these people are with him they hold on a second you missed part of the conversation\nWe're not talking about the people that are already on board we're talking about the people in the middle that win elections for you right that's true you need to convince you've got to go sell the brand essentially to put it in the president's ah you know we'll house to to new customers\nBy the by the way I don't know I I I answered the the one email from the one woman who wrote that the the\nThe one that because it sounds like that's when you're relating yeah mine was from a guy but but I'll do my job and ... and and it was the same thing and and I answered you know and I answer back I said look I'm Talking about you are right yeah this was going to change it I'm not talking about my ... I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me\nWho was a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm\nAnd move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well I Know that's not the point that it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already\nIn the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do and this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can't get their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message\nThen they could get that out and they could they could gain more seats\nInstead of losing seats and this was back then not thoroughly now we're talking about getting a message across the people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced we've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you're not part of that group\nThe the Republicans but more importantly the president right now or they're capable together of getting real things done\nAnd they need to get our message out there there is this ... and we continue to to fight this all the time when we get people to call well you guys think that you can convince everybody\nThat we don't know\nThat's never been the goal to convince\nEverybody but there are people that\nLook people [laughter] people a vow of every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population that people learn every day and a teacher's politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that are called the show and I said you know I used to think this way\nAnd then I started ... you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them and listen to on economics and I realize I changed my mind completely ... people change their minds you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind though you're trying to get that that person in the middle\nAnd we were talking about specifically yesterday undecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing your base and never being satisfied with what you have always trying to grow it\nAnd we believe if you promote\nFree markets\nConservative economics\nConservative principles and you explain it in a simple way\nA nation that largely remains and we're not talking to you were listening to the show you have sought us out you sought out shows like this you've sought out information like this so we're not referring to you you're already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time\nAnd you are able to introduce them\nTwo different ideas there is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference in almost probably ...

I\nWant you to know that I Am not\nThat person right does it but that that's the point and that's the great point right there yeah it was specifically using the term crazy Democrats someone had abused that any Democrat some someone had to have used that in some kind of feedback\nThat they were getting that feedback that it was crazy Democrats not extreme right I'm not part of the extreme of my party because he used that why did why the term crazy Democrats because that's the feedback you been getting back right in your own\nInternal polling because extreme means that you've gone full on one side in in one direction and and to a a further extent well no that's not what's going on\nIt it is crazy and and that's the perception what you're trying to you're trying to target with those words the very perception as someone who has given that feedback to you with those words that's the only way that happens\nThe only way those words end up in an ad like that\n\nThey because someone must have made that that's that's where the the word crazy\nMust have appeared in feedback and unlikely multiple times\n\nAnd they're in their internal wrong and you know you're talking about tens of millions of dollars to run a Senate race yeah which means they are doing every type of of polling an analytical research you can get you get down to this point here\nAnd you see the desperation of using that in an ad that means you are trying to fight the perception of crazy Democrats in your election in Missouri and\nIt is the one thing that is killing your chances of winning yeah it is the one thing because it is if you think about the build up to you know if you listen to that there is a buildup that word is is is one of those hot button words\nThat you don't expect to hear but it was placed in the ad strategically at a certain place right as you are listening to something and all of a sudden boom she's not one of those crazy Democrats because and there's another thing too\nIt's a poor attempt I think at recreating a conversation that people are you know having out there but it's not that's not the conversation they're actually having the conversation they're having is if it were really I think accurate and and\nAnd portraying what's going on with some of the Democrats or independents interstate it would be two guys going\nMan those Democrats are crazy I don't know but I can vote for Democrats anymore including McCaskill that the actual conversation so you have to have you have to counter it with this contrived and and again I think it's ... it's a it's a poor attempt\nBut that's the only thing you can do you're not going to get Claire McCaskill coming out going hey I'm not one of those crazy Democrats\nOr the other thing I thought was interesting you know and and I'm not you know very familiar with Josh Hawley who's running against the attorney general against\nClaire McCaskill I'm I'm a I'm I'm not you know we live in we live in Texas and that's one of the top things is\nIt's it's tough for anybody ... and and I mean it's tough for anybody on the national stage to really have a key understanding of what's going on for example in ... in Missouri raised in many congressional races it's it's really tough because\nA lot of times it can be local and if you're not living there you don't see the stories that are pounded at you or that each and every day but you and I both looked at each other we haven't discussed us but we looked at each other the part where well and it's claimed that\nBut Holly as attorney general made wine runs and went to the gym ... during work hours\nWhich with all the heated rhetoric yeah an ad use that show you only thing they can make up your own and that was that's what you use and put an ad of desperation well here's the thing\nIt's ... I was thinking oh wait a minute I Wonder if you could pick me up from wind next time he goes because people go to the gym during the day\nAll the time but what's what's people people run errands all the time just assume OK just to learn right that it's it's it's on company time and it's it's well the the the the state time in this case\nAnd it's um it's being done outside of his lunch hour it's not on his time that's the worst she got\nWell I'm assuming most attorney general's don't work eight to five\nI'm guessing there's just a few hours I'm assuming there's meetings there's speeches there's everything else that goes wind meetings as to why are they going to be a part time job [laughter] but I I again I don't know the specifics behind it but I just went ... and ... and that\nBut from an outsider you heard that you went that's a pretty weak well for an out of desperation that's pretty weak ... ... ...

they have lots of great blogs and videos they're a great website would be a part of the community at team run smart dot com by freight minor\n[noise] ah by the way this this uh just the keeps a growing overnight and then I'm Amazed that we haven't gotten any details on may rise we addressed it to start the the the the show a off with but a National Review and it's being picked up by\nYou know I'm a social media uh uh some different a conservative website said have picked it up and this is we're National Review ah wrote the\nArticle that said the pipe bomb or and powder delivered to CNN were harmless this is an article that came out a at nine nine PM from jak crow of National Review\nAnd the reference that he gives is the Associated Press story right into a link to that rights they link and is to write so we linked to the story\nAnd said okay because we didn't see that anywhere else and we said what does the Associated Press story says you know what what does it say and it's funny 'cause during our priest you'll meet him when I read it I said oh it's saying it and then I read in the second time I said well no it's not saying it\nBecause what it says is a law enforcement official such tests have determined that a powder found inside an envelope delivered to CNN along with a pipe bomb was harmless right\nRoute or out your harmless referring to the powder though that it that's the indication as the it refers to the powder not a pipe bomb now there is no indication as we've stayed to start to show off\nThe FBI has not we have not seen the words these raw act\nApplied bombs that could have gone off\nAnd we have seen what but the potentially quote potentially destructive devices and we've asked the question what is potentially destructive devices mean we've seen suspicious packages I'm looking at the last time I checked Fox News about twenty minutes ago they still have the headline suspicious packages\nUh we talked about the the Wall Street journal though actually are calling them mail bombs but not having a quote\nYou know from the FBI stating that they were mail bombs these little things and and again we're just two idiots overnight but these are the the little things that are picked up in different websites are not picking it up just quoting the national review story and not linked him to the Associated Press story\nThat you know that the that you know that the a package sent a to CNN was harmless we don't know whether it was or not we don't know if the the uh the the suspicious\nPackage separate from the powder in the envelope was harmless there's like there's nothing in the a P story according to their source that says that\nRight and that's what National Review has referenced right and they're headline pipe bomb and powder delivered to CNN were harmless\nAnd other websites are picking that up we don't know outside that Associated Press story that doesn't say that\nRight if you read the said yeah that's that's the point is that the the the story that their referencing doesn't actually say that they could turn out to be the case and maybe National Review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not using those ... from the a P right\nYou know so it's just because\nThe problem is is with with if you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false\nPremise so you know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah they were just an oversight here in my opinion because that's not what the Associated Press story all\nI can understand it because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here just about and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the scent\nWhat Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline habit that the powder that was sent along with all the owner was harmless you know along with the suspicious\nPackage was harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not past that and you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now\nPeople are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible move at the time I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm that's what I told us an earth they're saying the bomb was harmless right this is in our ... not on the air\nAnd then realized oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence and Associated Press separates the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb now again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were\nActive bombs that could have gone off and could have gone up and would have gone off and uh and you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever\nOr were they set to go off and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point you would look at it and the questions that you would ask ... ...\nThat's the gator would be different if they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm or\nThey were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent for a political statement would be the next question that you would ask right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we are when\nWe talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump\nFor all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony that they're saying the divisiveness must stop but yet they create the maximum divisive this\nBy blaming somebody throwing incident where they don't add the fact they don't know\nWe have no idea that the motivation behind the the the uh the person or persons\nNobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against the advice of this and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on the left doing that it's like [laughter] we're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nT.

I'm not ... yeah I'm I'm not you know the the whole fire in the belly is is is is built by a real passion or flaming hot Cheetos\nIf I if I really think that it is\nAbsolutely necessary for me to tell other adults who are listening to the show how to live their life and what to do and to follow my lead and do exactly what I Want than we are do\nWell [laughter] I Know that you know ... and that is it is funny to say that but but really\nUh [laughter] I'm not your leader no because I think people I think everyone if it's funny because I had a friend on social media question one day you just jokingly what don't you think you've got the you know the the makings of a leader\nAnd I I responded that I've known this guy you know a long long time and I said uh you know what I said uh I Believe people and I made a serious point in\nIn response to his ah the tongue in cheek a comment that he made I Believe people are capable of being leaders they all they do have the ability to be a leader yourself you lead you well\nYou know you mentioned that President a former President Obama speaking in Nevada the other day sounded like he was begging dying well right why didn't vote go on a boat we need to vote we need to vote I have never felt even when there's been downturns I've never felt\nThat I have to tell the people who I Am I Am\nTelling them why I Believe what I Believe ... I don't expect anybody\nTo automatically believe what I Believe and falling in lock step\nRight I wouldn't want\nListeners like that I Want listeners to you know\nOkay that's an opinion I I've heard it and\nIt's got some facts to back it up and let me see I'll check it out where men and and if you if you check it out because you and I've been always the first to say just don't take it for Moscow do your own research right\nRight uh because that's what we don't want\nWe appreciate all the compliments that we get most of the compliments that we get or the compliments that you guys really cover the issues and you cover really really well even if I disagree with you I understand where you stand completely that's about all I really care about as long as somebody says okay you've given me

[laughter] no I don't be may be ... and you can be a lot of things don't be mean but I\nNever felt the need or the or never even coming to my mind and when I used to do a lot more speeches I don't do a lot anymore because just because of the time shift\n... are used to do all the time you know public speaking I never have told people go out and vote ... ...\nBecause number one I never felt that was my real number two I never felt the people that were listening to what I had to say had to be encouraged about well\nThis is the great thing about especially our audience I I think the the the people that listen to our show and and and especially I think beyond or just new listeners the ones that have been with us for\nA while I Believe there you know we're all\nKind of standing in the in that same line ... ... were were part of that that same mentality and again they're they're leaving themselves I Know they need me to say it and they know they don't need me to say it and that's the great thing there is that uh that that understanding and\nAnd the only thing I I think I we might have discussed this before the the only thing that I think that you know were needed for is the fact that\nThere are busy doing their jobs\nThey've got their jobs they got their families\nAnd our job any of them were eating right now right in and and and our job is the fact that we have\nWe have time to pay attention to everything so we can articulate what's going on to them so in a in a condensed sense they can get an idea of what's going on every single day in what's going on in the issues in a different form that they get from anything else and and I would say that's about it now\nAnd I'm so glad that I can do that because I think that's a great thing to be able to do\nWell that's you know makes me feel useful [laughter] I mean that's that's what we are I mean the the the uh think of it as a concierge service of information that right I mean there are there people out there that it and

Missouri uh where\nWhere they had two guys talking and you know this was her campaign ads saying she's not like one of she felt like the crazy Democrats right and you know ... again that was the message that she wanted to put out there with her approval wasn't in an outside group doing\nThe actual commercial for it and we said that's really interesting because that means that in their polling\nThey realize and and as you said Eric to use the word crazy not extreme\nBut crazy right Claire McCaskill a mainstream Democrat found that in the last couple of weeks in an election where she's behind\nA\nStill a toss up but she's still behind that she needs to use the term\nCrazy Democrats rhyme not like one of those crazy Democrats and it was ... and I just happened to come upon this article here and I was just doing some scanning here a few moments ago\nFrom A Douglas shown who is the ... the the former Democratic pollster who's on Fox News all the time and just you know and and again since she's been a democratic pollster and he's identified\nA throughout his life as a as as a Democrat he says the Democrats have a problem or a serious problem\nBut one that they have yet to acknowledge fully or frankly at all what's the problem here it is Democrats Abou so far to the left the Republicans attacks on them for being an extremist and too far in the clutches of they're tired out of touch leadership have been working ...\nThe Republican campaign is now simple just focus on how far left the Democrats are\nAnd how beholden its candidates particularly congressional candidates are to the unpopular democratic leadership in both the house and the Senate\nI've argued here and elsewhere the Democrats need new leadership I've also suggested that those candidates were rejected their leadership are likely to do better than those who remain quiet take the money and suffer the political consequences\nBut right now as we head into the final two weeks will be election campaign it appears that both the Senate and potentially the house races are tightening and it appears that Donald Trump's attacks on the Democratic party for being out of touch with the electorate and too confrontational as well as led by two failed leaders of the past are working\nRest assured the Republicans have failed to take advantage of what\nHas been their principal opportunity which is to run on the economy\nAnd get credit for something that voters themselves be as improving and beneficial you what I've said the exact same thing the Republicans still and even the administration focused on things outside of where they have clear victories that are clear to the American public\nAnd at times decide to get into the mud when there is no reason to get into the mud right as we said you do for the win every single time once you get that when you move on to the next when you don't weaken your when\nA exist that being said the care of them currently moving from uh the Mexico Guatemala border towards the United states gets Trump's and the Republicans a chance to double down on immigration and issue the Democrats themselves remained vulnerable on\n\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration\nBecause they have not just about the attack that they are for open borders bingo\nWe've been saying for years and this is what we said pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and the earlier this week as well they have to be positioned very clearly the question has to be asked where do you stand on the border\nThey must be\nForced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do do support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want\nHe said again I've argued elsewhere the parties should have been raised an immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat any from a democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we said that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before on on the whole caravan thing this was a perfect opportunity\nFor the Republicans and the president to back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that but you can't\nWe have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on this show together the issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show\nThe first thing that we really discuss was a was a like a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm\nWhich was the amnesty that was two thousand five ... just ... they they made the decisions to a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years the Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do what with their plan be\nThinking about this and that by the way that say Republican failure mhm because of Republican should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it should be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said\n\nYou make the accusation Democrats wide open borders and when they cry you are a line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done issue than the challenge and that's what it was shown insane here that again they haven't had the answer\nThey haven't had to they don't then they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice\nJeep Grand Cherokee he's little over fifty five hundred dollars in savings these deals are just a few of the huge savings going on at Walker so

three brought to you by south coast tax\nAnd so as we've said we've discussed is a little bit and and gone\nThrough the different questions or as others have yesterday and and we we've asked the question that if it was it if they are life ... if they were alive bombs\nAnd and they would have gone off\nThen you have to look at that in a different way that if clearly none of them were alive bombs mhm that it would have either been an attempt to scare the war and attempt a possibility of an attempt to uh\nYou know\nLook at major figures in the Democratic party that are not like ... well by members of the right in this country\nAnd you know try to you know give the tried to send the message that they're out to get them ... or that you know ... if if it was you know if it was it was a real bombing that but if it was a fake bomb it would be was it sent by somebody on the left\nTo try to blame the right there is a whole bunch of different scenarios and questions you would ask is an investigator based on whether the bombs were actually live or whether they were fake bombs right\n[noise] yeah and we can only ... will only know that if and when they find the person who or persons who response right\nAnd that could be never so at the you can bet right now they have a number of great leads especially with the fact the nature of\nOf how males sorted or by the secret service uh in in terms of the the Clintons when you look at and and the Obamas when you look at that situation um that I think you have to take into consideration\nWhat they already know about that you know patterns of behavior by people who do such a thing and and the resources are there are probably on to some pretty solid leads right now then add to that of course cameras being everywhere\nSo you will you know as soon as we get information we can start having that discussion but we want to point that out that you're seeing that story from National Review go viral\nIt's important to have the discussion based on facts based on what we know right and there is a difference and we may learn that uh the authorities and and authorities will tell us or might tell us at some point that those devices were effectively harmless because they weren't set to go off\nBut that is not what you're seeing here and there's a pie report that was the source of the national review article\nWhich again just looking at social media overnight is gone it has gone viral that she wasn't we don't know that yet and I Associated Press story does not state that\nAnd it's important that you know facts were brought up I was reading the daily wire story where they they talked about the\nA reporter for CNN and that looked Martha ... who was interviewing\nOne of the one of the bomb experts right and this bomb expert gave out all the possibilities who said look could be somebody from the right ... you said it could be a you know it could be but you know a foreign state that is trying to destroy the you know they're trying to disrupt the election or\nAs you said it could be a false flag from somebody on the left mhm so what the CNN reporter put out was only the response from this expert of\nThat it was somebody on the left and left out when this expert said it can be somebody from the right ... it can be a foreign actor or it could be a false flag from somebody on the left because the election is just two weeks away when I brought up all the possibilities and investigator would bring out\nAnd what are the CNN reporter to eat out just deport they report that apparently media matters poured out which is a left leaning a or you know media organization media\nA truth organization where they only put out just his opinion you know on the left as if that's who he blamed\nAnd Martha mckell I'm like oh yeah absolutely yeah are fascinating something like that and she should have responded they all believe in somebody for fake news will know the fake news is the actual fact checking of the news you didn't include the entire statement right\n\nAnd which is our point on this entire thing with the national review and the difference between the story that they used as their stores\nIt's important we give a lot of credibility to the national review and have for a long long time\nBut it's important that as you as you you've got twelve days here before the election this is all going to be in terms of the discussion not the investigation but the discussion about it in social media is all politically driven and has been from the start\n\nYou don't win anything by repeating false information\n\nNo you don't win anything by now you know at media matters [laughter] by putting out incomplete information which indeed is fall if you don't include the entire statement\n\nThat's how we deal I mean that's the world really deal with you and I taught of talked about this many times that much we spend much more of our time just trying to disseminate what the truth is out there right\nAnd arguing the truth versus the conspiracy theories the half truths that are out there and and it does become frustrating at times\nNow I Will admit that the story that you know the national review story that when we read the Associated Press ... when I read it off and say you when I read it\nThe first I said while Eric look they're saying that the bottom and I read the first sentence\nAnd then I re read it again and went on and it's not what they're saying right now that wasn't on the air to see you know right and it was like no they're not saying that what they're saying is it's the powder that came with the the the ... they're not saying that both were harmless right\nThey're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the source said the powder was harmless they didn't even mention about the suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say either way\nRight on that one so uh again that's you know that's what we deal with\nAnd you know we saw yesterday but you saw it again you saw it from CNN you saw it from the the Democrats are you know we're picking were well you really couldn't pick and choose the facts because you didn't have any\nVery few very few windows ... we know these devices were sent we know who they were sent to we know what the authorities have told us already ... the problem when you start getting these so called experts and and and they are experts otherwise the you but you can't be an expert about the situation unless you're investigating it yourself\nAnd there were plenty of them on television\nBeing totally clueless are unaware that it's like I'd die you're just saying you're against the divisiveness\nYet you are committing the ultimate scent of divisive is like blaming somebody and you don't have any of the facts you don't know what the facts are and you've already come to a conclusion of who's to blame if that is the ultimate and being a divisive media outlet\nTell us where we're wrong

I\nI Will set it up with if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most\nIn that ad uh-huh uh it was terrorists yes and we've talked about the mid west it was something that we talked about yesterday ... that the the the the the farmer that is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly at because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so\nIt is something that we uh we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats\nTo help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad\nIt was terrorists twice here's the interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person on the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government dar\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the presence I guess in the state of the industry or the particular industry and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it even if you're not a farmer\nA noted ... yeah right well how would you know like you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they were in very vocal about it if you're in that state even if you're not a former\nAh you know again depending on the impacts that they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah\nWhich you know we'll see if if that point works or if if any of this works er here within two weeks\n[laughter] it\nIt I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party\nBecause keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her you heard her say she approves this message this is her campaign that she's not saying the people that are protesters\nShe's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members\nOf the party that she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know uh you know with my my party in it no so I wrote a writing again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation didn't say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme as you know in there that she doesn't she's it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put into that ad right where the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "25"}
