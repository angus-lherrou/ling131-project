only up by\nWho yeah and that's the margin of error for points very\nWell again this is not over\nAnd you're a Democrat and you should be absolutely worried about this because I I never in my lifetime

what happened last friday\nWhen Jeff Flake is confronted and the all of it and then those who confronted him later that day said this is why we go direct what it did was to justify and attempt to legitimize\nThe shouting of Ted Cruz out of a restaurant even though that same restaurant is not hired security guards it is they see it as well it worked and this is why we're going direct this is why we will keep doing this because\nThey believe again they're going to get the same reaction that they got out of Jeff Flake well\nNewsflash he admitted in the sixty minutes interview if he were up for reelection that would've never happened you never would have gotten him together with tunes that agreement to delay this thing and have an FBI background check this week\nWould never have happened he admitted it he doesn't care what the people of Arizona I think\nHe doesn't care what the people think he only cares what the people think if it's served him him\nAnd so this entire equation um ... is is the what they see is the momentum\nNow here's the problem the party has and by the way to the party we need to repeat these people don't care about you either\nThey don't they don't care that Jeff Flake had disdain as a Republican for Donald Trump after he got with Coons and they came up with this agreement to do this FBI background check they started screaming it's not enough\nAnd so they don't care about anybody in the party\nBut the future of the party is certainly in question when this kind of behavior drives that paints a picture for the rest of America and as you mentioned Gary

has been quiet over the last year came out in favor of Kavanaugh wow and ended in a very subtle way and I was like wow but if you actually talk to Democrats right now they're not happy with the way that ... that that this is actually going\nOr they won't come out publicly and criticize them\nAlready for what they're doing but they feel very uncomfortable they understand there is no evidence here they understand it and they see this just rolling and ... and that's the whole point\nThat many Republicans look at this and go wow you can either going down this path and now they're they're just taking anonymous sources and throwing it out I mean this is just so slimy and so dirty yeah or against Kavanaugh because there is no cooperating evidence there is no evidence\nAnd look people aren't stupid that will sit there and say this really stinks well and that's that's it because it does that they'll look at the forward and say\nAll these go find me accounts another now of what a million or over a million dollars\nWhat are the world's going on here the lawyers were pro bono you're talking about an airplane flight ... why is all this money being\nA rate it looks dirty yes it all looks dirty and the American public and that's why when you bring it up about the cooperation and when people actually look into it and you when you said it earlier to me uh uh off the air\nYou said this is really liked the experience that we have with Capra Nick but yeah we have no idea that cap regular it's about free speech while you're watching the ... well look I'm not angry it's just I don't prefer to watch it because of\nAnd you explain what he actually did and you explained the pig socks every single person that supported Kaepernick had no that that I've talked to and it's in the hundreds over the last year ... had no idea about the top ... once you bring that up to go it's a good point they had no idea about Michael Bennet ... no idea that Michael Bennett who was the catalyst\nOne of the catalysts last year and has become one of the leaders\nOf the movement who was also you know in the locker room yesterday for Philly ... got famous and became the poster person last year mhm to continue with because he lied about the Las Vegas police\nEvery single person that was supporting Kaepernick didn't know about that either and they went oh oh okay yeah that is bad and I'll leave it at that I won't judge them and but you can tell they know when you bring up things that are common sense to people\nWhen you bring up something like fairness\nAnd the preponderance of evidence before finding somebody guilty than it has\nTo exist somewhere there's a reason that NBC wouldn't run Mitchell's report why wouldn't they run it because they know that even there are a few listeners there doesn't listeners viewers that that are left\nEven if they're liberal would say\nYeah not not good right and\nWhy do you do that to adults why don't you want adults to know the truth right vibe we don't hide anything in the show there's nothing I Would hide\nAny news item I could care less I'll bring up anything that's going on out there why won't they right why will they hide things that are important\nTo a story and even if they disagree with it analyze it right but they they as we've talked about before we talked last week about lying through omission mhm and a lot of stories out there now right but if you lived through omission we just won't include parts of it\nAnd if and while they'll give an interview to somebody who's making claims that they as a news organization couldn't even corroborate right they will ignore\nA key piece to the actual an official piece of the actual procedure the actual process in place\nThey ignore it completely but when you give Americans when you start telling America's look here's what's going on with this case and you lay it out to them that's why all of a sudden you go to\nYou know sixty percent say oh or fifty percent ... percent say oh we didn't know okay\nYeah that that's that's wrong if there is no cooperation well and if the FBI finds out there is no one sixty percent of Americans believe that that's almost all of independence mhm yeah and that's what you're looking for that's what you're looking for in any election and we always get this and we talked about the administration\nAnd said look you could have more success is if you have a consistent solid message day in and day out because well you never convince the liberal that's not\nYour goal that'll not your goal and and you know it's like Jeff Flake saying\nYou know what I'm saying when I went to Coons I I was just I was telling them this is tearing our country apart we have to we have to do something well who's responsible for the damage try you're going to the person that's tearing the country apart yes and telling them you have to stop telling them you're coming over to his side dry or his position\nRight then and and then he then Coons goals you know Jeff Flake the hero really\nWho's tearing the country apart who was engaged in this kind of behavior outside of Kavanaugh outside of\nTrump even if the left who\nShaming people out of restaurants the left even people that work at those restaurants shaming people out of restaurants\nThat that behavior tolerated by the left it's not the right doing that that's the left\nSo if anyone sees us as a divided

and you're breaking up on us but I but but you you you know we've asked ourselves that question a you know where do they go from here remember after twenty sixteen after Trump won in a again ah you know as a as a a former President Obama said there was always a twenty percent\n[laughter] after the election and do that like I Know it's a hundred percent I'm Out of the smartest\nPresident that we ever had one of the room right to understand that it's a hundred percent because he won a uh but you know they were remember all the self reflection that happened at that time\nEric and I went into

said he went through [laughter] what's his name Brian Williams I don't think it was [laughter] but but [laughter] you know you don't even have to I mean that but it it is a very basic point that how can you be doing\nAnalysis real analysis not the opinion how can you be doing that\nIn an election year if you really don't know what the sentiment is\nI'm not expecting them to have the same and turtles that a campaign without or that a party would have but I Would expect that they would certainly have somebody maybe inside those campaigns are parties\nThat would see some things and say okay is there are real because Obama is always a twenty percent chance he said that after the election but really you know it was a couple of idiots overnight said\nDon't don't buy the hype in Pennsylvania

economics and trade everybody picks their own little corner and they stick with it instead of saying okay what is a result when you raise prices overall and that's what the president has done in the free trade agreement and our trade negotiators have done he has made cars more expensive\nTo buy in Mexico in the United states and in Canada were all in it together you know the cost of buying a car in the United states Canada and Mexico will go up in price at a time as you mentioned yesterday Eric you mentioned it yesterday I don't know why I focused and said Eric\n... uh but as you said yesterday or the and you and I've been doing some some uh uh reading an analysis on this\nIs at her prices are going up people can't afford to buy cars they run out of ways to finance them and so what are people looking to do that looking to buy used vehicles yes and that's driving by market right now which when there was a greater demand for that group of vehicles the used vehicles and the price goes up\nAnd so for some people out there they believe this is ... none of it's personal it's all economics how does it work I Can't tell you how the president things because of president or even in this trade deal has done some good things and done some bad things ... and that's one of the bad things is automobile now it could have been a lot worse from what he was promoting before\nBut the fact is it didn't affect probably Ninety eight percent of the free trade between the countries and that's a good thing\nAs we said what happened we had predicted look who's going to be all this hype all the soup ... and what we're going to basically get\nIs the same kind of deal a little bit of nuances here or there they get a little victory and timber we get a little victory and dairy the big problem with it is what the president and what the trade negotiators did on raising the cost of all cars manufactured in the United states in Canada and Mexico that you the consumer\nGoing to have to pay and it means we are less likely to ship cars from the United states anywhere else\nAnd the president's use that as a great victory for the United states but doesn't explain why it's a great victory\nRight yeah and I I think if you look here's where the tell will be you'll see certain industries that the reason the automobile industry has\nHis key to the economy is because you look at the the the how often now people purchase vehicles right or more and more they're holding on to their cars\nSo that hurts the ... because well they want the stuff off the assembly line to be so\nYou make that more expensive you start hurting it industry you start seeing layoffs as a result of that then and then also make the used cars by default more expensive and you're going to see not just the automobile industry but of course all the dealerships\nAnd all of the uh if if you look at the finance arms\nOf those companies they're all going to suffer as a result of that because people will choose as they're doing now to hold onto their car for longer periods of time because that's the cost of government that's not the cost of anything else we're not talking about well\nWhether it's steel and aluminum or the parts going into the car or electronics or anything else we're not saying that this stuff is scarce that it's hard to come by it that a small group of people have decided to get together and determine\nHow expensive it's going to be for us that's the difference\nAnd we view it as a victory and as we've said nobody can explain to us why\nThat's a victory now as we said the other things when you look at the dairy you know again that's that's moving in and in some of the agriculture stuff where we do have more free trade now because of it\nAnd we had in Canada was able to knock down some of the barriers that's fine but it's almost as if we make the victory over there and then we shoot ourselves in the foot on automobiles now the other good thing is\nCanada will like this be was mentioned with the timber\nThat the president in all likelihood will be lifting the tear if they put on timber and now that has to go to a panel to decide whether\nA candidate is subsidizing it not the president to make the decision on his own which should sheep and construction in the United states because that timber will be coming over\nAnd that was a fear of builders that housing prices were going to sky rocket another construction from the use of of woods because of the Canadian timber and hopefully in the next year that will bring those prices down so there's wins and there was lost his across the board but but overall if the president is stating\nThat the threat of tariffs on Canada and the and and and Mexico and the steel tariffs on the aluminum terrorists made it worthwhile for this he's going to have to show me the numbers on it\nWell and that's that's again it's it's it's the second largest purchase that people make and if people are homeowners it's the first largest purchase on on vehicles\nAnd you start seeing that slide you start seeing the economy's slide and that will be your tell this is what the the Bush administration saw steel terrorists they saw companies leaving\nThe country and they said this can't stand we cannot keep this going you can't we cannot do this because the the job loss\nWill be well who knows what it would have been had they not ended those steel terrorists ah prematurely\nBut overall the vast majority of products unchanged right\nAnd so uh you know the president which is called a victory fine we just do the analysis on the reality of economic slump he\nGives me when you get ... he's got my support if if we're going to stand strong against China there's the than in and by the way politically you can get away with that all day long to it's going to it is going to hurt but if they're not going to play by\nThe world Trade Organization rules then not only the U.S but all of our allies and other trade partners with China need to get in line and putting the pressure on them that's a very real strategy\nAnd it is going it it has to be effective because I don't know how you can put a cost on on China

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n... radio he's are currently I'm Gary McNamara asking the question should future Supreme Court nominees be judged all the way back to the womb as the last the last democratic called yeah\nAw let us head to you we go to Jack in Ithaca New York just kidding we're not really asking that question we may have to Sunday though jak welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show\nGood morning I Wonder if some sixteen year old to night posted something on\nTwitter or Instagram that will keep them from becoming a judge forty five years from now but my point is that Senator Flake man actually ... the Republican Horton by calling\nYou're a senator in a a purple shall we say state or a state where your reelection is a tough one uh\nNow can say hey look I was kind of go towards not going for them\nOr I was leaning towards voting for him I wasn't sure I sat through the hearings and like so many Americans I couldn't make up my mind when we called them the FBI they did a full investigation and any reasonable person would say that there's no real conclusion after that investigation I'm going to vote for him so I think this is that's the day she\nGives some cover to Republicans\nWho may have been afraid to alienate some of their female voters and then gives them a little political cover to vote yes\nWell there's this only works if they if the polls since Thursday which will start rolling in over the next couple of days that by the ... by the end of the week those polls show that the American people are not with them that the but more importantly the senators in those states especially where it's close\nOr are not getting the support of their voters and they're staged a and ultimately it only works if the vote is to confirm Kavanaugh because it doesn't work for the Republicans if he does not get confirmed or it becomes still a very very much so an uphill battle\nOr even in November even though I Do believe that this whether he's confirmed or not will work for them politically I don't know too what effect in November at the ...\nAnd I think the Democrats plant is it doesn't really matter what happens with Ford anymore it's let's get at whatever other allegations that we have to try to delaying that's yet they want yeah\nYeah they want further delay they're going to want Ramirez to have a hearing or\nYou know there will be a coal somewhere along the way when they know the boat is inevitable and the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying on Monday that there will be a vote this week and so we don't know when that's going to be I'm assuming Saturday there could be a vote on the floor but we don't know\nUm he said it's time for delays I'm hurt his ... yeah so they could\nDo that Sunday and get a cabinet seated on a Monday morning he would only miss a week of SCOTUS material and could easily get caught up we'll see if that happens [noise]\n\n\n... radio on Westwood One\nMissing show listen anywhere at any time on
