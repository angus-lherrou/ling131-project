granted and whether they help them or not it's it's a relevant they are using them for them to get power [noise]\nSo I Want you to comment to continue in common and any of those stories that I reviewed tonight at eight six six Ninety red eye and and let me know what you're thinking and I go with where you want to go there is a hot topic uh after our topic I'll go to that pretty quickly\nEight six six nine seven thirty three thirty nine is is the same number a digitally\nBut colors also mentioned the reaction of some of their friends this kind of always comes out a little bit some of their friends and family members to ah if their political beliefs are on the conservative or you know you call them on the right I guess\nAnd a friend of mine Scott who used to live in California now lives in Colorado I'll leave that his last name because I didn't get permission to use his last name\nSo this is what he posted on Facebook yesterday he was the friend did just because of his political beliefs\nAnd he thought I I thought he wrote a thoughtful commentary which I Am going to just read from is pretty quick a and from what I remember by the way he's a moderate Republican not even a conservative like me here's this quote we continue to learn life set lessons in many ways today I had a friend who I've known since\nAn friend me she was always known me as a nice person in fact I helped her out in school and gave her job to provide her additional Lincoln\nNothing has changed as far as who I Am but today she unfriendly to me not because I was nasty to her or because they was mean to anyone she knew about the cause I posted a political post\nThat she disagreed with\nKeep in mind that she posts political commentary that I disagree with and some I find very offensive she asked me to never let the other stuff and yet she comments on mine\nBut sadly this is a way of our politics we can do people for years even all of our lives yet they have no tolerance for a different political view than their own it's so angers them that you have a different opinion that then there's that they will not talk to you anymore\nPersonally I find that beyond said today I've only an friend than one person mainly because they're noxious and intellectually dishonest\nAs most no I guess people know him I Will debate anyone on any issue and I've changed my mind than issues and vote at others change their mind you I appreciate that too when colors of done that in the past\nAnd you'll see me say sometimes you know that's a good point I didn't consider that but today it just seems that we're starting to forget the whole of a person is not just measured by their political views and if the ... if you've had a lifetime of friendship that it should be more important than a different view on one area\nHe should have said in one area of your life\nI think I'm more saddened by the fact that my experience today is more symptomatic of what our society's becoming than about losing a Facebook friends if we can find a way to be more civil to each other and then we're in for a bumpy road ahead I actually think he's under doing it\nUh and by the way the same thing happened to me a couple of years ago so I used to do in a show in Los Angeles with two Democrats two Republicans discussing the issues in the news whatever came up that we can\nThe audience and the guess loved it some of the gifts I they greet each other and a future show and I said how do you know ... oh we became good friends because of your show mark up and I I was really that touched me a despite their differing views they become friends socially and otherwise and kept in touch\nI'd love to reprise that show at some point if I was given the opportunity because of the audience loved it I loved it it it was just a lot of fun we didn't have very professional way you know\nBut one of the guests moved to Tennessee and posted on Facebook was one of the other gets the more you see what he did he posted in on Facebook after Trump won that he was defending anyone who is evil enough to vote for President Trump\nYour host included obviously well he wouldn't friendly no he did\nIn all of his appearances on my show he was one of the milder very friendly and plus and guess on the other side any chair he shares vice with me when I was dumb enough to run for office in California which\nYou can imagine for Republicans waste the time so I was pretty surprised when he posted his letter saying goodbye to all of us now evil human beings I'm not sure you said the word evil but that's what he was implying\nForget his past interactions with me or others he thought were his friends they thought he was there for his friend so I Want to know from you what has been your experience when people find out your views if you're a Republican or a conservative or maybe you keep your politics quiet as I Do with my teaching job\nOne of the reasons I'm getting lower now I'm probably still teaching is the left just about never listens to the other side\nSo they have no idea that I'm a talk show host if they knew that might be the end of me but here uh several anecdotes you might appreciate on election day when President Trump was running it was the first day of new class of my school so I was texting a lot to see the election results\nAnd I remember I I tears roll down my eyes when he a Trump won Pennsylvania which was always a Republican fool's gold always stay we might win but when it counted like with Romney we always came up short so when he won Pennsylvania real is he was like you going to be president\nIt was unbelievable even though I predict that morning I predict on Facebook that I thought he was going to win so what does some students do and these are adults students they went to the system principle to complain that I was texting a lot\nSo she called the inter office at the end of the night and she said you know what mark I defended you to the students because all of us were so upset with the results that it was not surprising that was a lot of tax thing going on [noise] it didn't even cross or mine for second that I could be on the other side\nAnd another time there was a teacher's meeting and the ... a teacher trainer who's running the meeting said you know we have some time why don't we go around the room to all your teachers and you could tell us something that would be interesting that we don't know about you\nDo you think for a second I Would tell them about my other career life I Would have been the end of me and a final anecdote was when Justice Scalia die than another teacher said mark let's play knock knock joke so I've played along and his answer to who was there was just a Justice Scalia just died and he said that was funny enough\nI probably didn't hide my look of dismay 'cause he shot me because you immediately walked away having no idea that I adore Justice Scalia and he was my favorite judge so now you know why I'm Still teaching in the public school system it's kind of like the McCarthy Era to reverse but\nI have to keep quiet about my political views I Want to know what you do if you have to keep a quiet at your job what happens if you discuss politics with their family or friends were on the opposite side you better not do that a Thanksgiving is the end of that dinner\nAnd if you're a Democrat or ... left us I Want to hear from you too but I strongly suspect that you are not disowned by conservatives among your family or friends if you even have such people you're friendly with I just don't think we do that on our side because we think your views are misguided and you think we are evil\nSo I Want to hear from people of all political persuasion on your experiences with people because of your political views\nI must be honest I've often wondered how Mary metal and you know that there she's married to a James Carville how can they be happily married with their views there so far apart [noise] do you think you can you might want to consider this do you think you can marry someone who held strong political beliefs opposite of yours\nSo I Want to hear about your experience with people who disagree with you politically at eight six six Ninety red eye\nAnd uh you know whatever they were I I did this once before in a national short stories were heart wrenching to hear people have lost their friends and family that won't talk to them eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine is the other way to dial the number\nI Marcus or sitting

America you know together and I will have to say I'm not trying to figure out but the Republicans in the right wing or almost just as bad about it is the left\nYeah I don't see that and so by the way I was thinking I was listening to what you're saying and you said snowflake and I'm thinking like it's not like calling someone a racist or a big hit you people and I it and you could be a snowflake can be on the Republican side just means\nYou know things offend you got upset easily and you can handle things I don't mind being called a snowflake it's not anything like being called a racist for um a homophobic or anything else and stuff like well the thing that I even like snowflakes so even your comparison excess [laughter] so you're laughing you agree with me\nI mean I understand um you know that that is a good point uh I guess I didn't think of it that way but you know also I think a lot of you know from what I see that the problem stem\nFrom also a kind of I'm not really being able to hold your candidate accountable\nAnd I think that's one thing that you know Republicans and the right we could do to\nFurther their message and I think it would hook up so much more to kind of get your ideas out there of course is just my opinion but a caller earlier had you know commented on the second amendment and I'm very pro Second Amendment\nBut you know you had a right wing or is like you said that really already Second Amendment we you know if that's what you agree and you want to ban bump stocks and you want to raise you know the age of Twenty one and that's fine but that's not something you agree with me now holds your candidates accountable to that I Would think\nIt's it's funny you say that because it's funny I have a different view I think that Republicans do turn on their own much more than Democrats to ... ah remember at the health care vote it was all Democrats not one Republican\nA Bill Clinton in the impeachment the none of the Democrats would sign on Kavanaugh you had one Democrat who the Trump won by forty points in West Virginia so you can understand why he may have voted for his nomination\nThey the Democrats the left that really stick together whereas we I don't know you've never heard me before but George W.

she was always the one being told hey take your sister with your debt out everywhere I had to go you know my sister when I look back now and I absolutely love that you know and um\nBut we're really tight all the way through and I'm a similar I think it was my senior year my parents got divorced and so we've got a little you know a state of my dad and mom and and we got a little separation but we never let the distance or I'm\nGetting between us we stayed in contact and uh she became a flight attendant for a while for gene a flight attendant excuse me and you know she would let me use or passes we would fly ... yeah\nAnd um and then you know slowly as family comes in you know you maybe don't talk as much but we always talk and um\nAnd we always had the same views for the longest time you know maybe a couple of little differences here and there but um she started traveling a lot to Europe and this and that and coming back started talking about how you know America does the U.S does this wrong or the u._s. should\nBe more like this country and this and that is so you know it's just a little kind of like OK okay whatever [noise] well um\nWe never really talked about politics until this past election and um and still during the primaries um you know I hadn't made my choice that I think like most people you know they had made their choices are and that was between crews and trout and as she was more of a Bernie Sanders\nShe was all about Bernie Sanders and um she was happy with Hillary and so as it got closer and closer when I actually started leaning orders Trump we we started I think this serious serious debates you know and then I'm In June my son\nMy youngest son was graduating and she was supposed to come out to the graduation and um\nMy son and her just had a tremendous tremendous um a relationship and um\nTwo weeks prior to the um to the graduation we had a conversation on the phone and were like hey you know what where do you get here when I got to talk about politics of this is about politics is about my son graduation and um and then the week before the graduation she called\nAnd she said because I'm a Trump supporter she can't come to my house and we have not spoken since that day I've reached down in ... or a couple of ... and\nA couple of times you know trying to al ... is a a a relationship with my nephew doing nothing nothing\nI feel so sorry few I I you know it just breaks my heart and and you have to wonder what what about your son I mean she didn't seem to care about that either that the the fact that you had poor Trump was enough to break go all the relationship between the brother and sister in huge here so much over those years\nIt is incredible what's going on out there and I just a ... a cliche but it is hard to even hear the story\nThough don't give up maybe someday she'll come around the she obviously got an ... billion socialism in Europe and what's going on there if you ask most of your opinions I don't think many of them be happy with what's going on I don't know what she saw a but it it's depressing hanging there my friend okay it'll it'll come around some time\nJust hang in there um I was just thinking of a you know people are funny that way I worked at a at a station ... in Los Angeles as I said I don't want to say too much about it except for one of the whole was had a\n... we have there's a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to see what he did but it was pretty famous and is in this day\nAnd they didn't talk for a I don't know Twenty years or something and then um one day a host said to me you know mark a\nHer father died and she didn't even know it and I had to tell her the news and she said a whole wow I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that\nFinally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him\nBecause she disowned him all those years before it ever personal reasons so one has to think that eventually hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short\nBut when you hear the family stories a brother and sister daughter whenever that because of politics\nThey disown their parent\nOr their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship\nJust over politics and you see that almost always on on the left hand side\nVery discouraging but are brought up the topic because it does happen is this something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nAnd mark is great to talk to you I'm I'm a Republican and conservative my whole life and I went into the military right after high school and um it most of the people um that I met in the military where we care because they felt like\nThe Republicans were the only one that would ever support\nA raise for you know the military pay that kind of you know it's just that okay well that's there for me than I Am for them um and then as time went on um when I'm\nThe first um oh go walk him about um I just remember listening to the radio and and just being like I Need to find someone that talking about this 'cause\nAt the time I was driving a lot and and the spending a lot of time in the car and I'm just want it to listen and you know I found conservative radio and\nYou know I haven't really talked about it with other people until people started asking me who you're going to vote for oh why are you voting for them and it was like people started coming to me and points\nOut of me I wasn't I was pushing anything on them\nAnd um\nWhen it came down to trumpet with like for a lot of people around me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and they just walked away from their friends and relatives just stop paying my friend and I and they just how can you you know for somebody who's\nJust you know terrible and I'm just like you're going to stand I can you mad at Republicans for Twenty years for letting the media and the and the Democrats walk all over I mean this guy won't let anyone walk all over him\nAnd he still conservative say anything to make our country better and you know I still see people rallied against him and I'm just like wait a minute we'll be great if the economy in that we in the country's ever seen you know we have I mean the jobs for a truck driver so that keeps five thousand\nDollar bonuses for somebody to start that job\nYou know I mean she jobs that are just they don't have enough people to do them and they and you know these tech jobs that pay huge amount of money so you know if you get the right to ... you get a great job if you if you don't have a degree you get Dr driving a truck working construction and\nBack with you again and hang in there don't\nGive up we're going to take your calls a ... in the next day or two cars this topic is is really moving me even though I came up with it a shell the Elgin, Illinois you're on the mark\n... [noise]\n\nHow to talk about the issue that will destroy each other essentially\n\nGo ahead you're on your on the air with mark\nThat side I couldn't carry my mother is eighty six ... six eight ...\nOr ... or ...\nOr ... like the model electro college she'd never heard of okay fine well it's such a problem with the people that are full center this ... my ... educated needed special\nLight out every day that's terrible that's part of the market there originally because she thought that I Would have that profile and she they cut me off\nBecause they couldn't handle anything I was saying I was trying so hard not to know what I thought they caught me by\nThe thing that amazed me or like ... and says you're the shortest person I Know how well they have quite a ways stupid support that that are [laughter] [noise] and then\nAs you add sugar fat and discover because we never talk politics that my friends all of them supporting Trump\nHighly educated hysterical so\nI'm not supposed to be highly you\nYeah you're not supposed to be highly educated and and not be able to see that he's awful and terrible\nAnd this is a disaster and personally is even worse\nHow could you not see that because you see I've never thought that much of a degrees or what people call intelligence as much as I look for wisdom what can I learn from you\nAnd so the degrees don't mean much to me and I have only a master's degree but it so I don't care I'm not impressed by degrees I met and know people have PHD's I'm not impressed by them\nSo that that doesn't concern me but they the leaders of the country they think they figured it all out especially where I live in California and in New York and places like that that how could you ever vote for this disaster the fact is I'm not going to go over the list I did on Monday I think all the things he's done\nA the difference he's made has been huge and some colors and said that the best president they've seen in their life lifetime\nSo I I

about what's going to happen in the streets to\nUh the left us already crazy and and so far out there let's see uh butch in Denver you're on with mark\nMark how're you doing well good good\nHey I just wanted to follow up with something you had mentioned um briefly a little while ago about a social media and the effect it as having all the relationships friends\nFamily colleagues um I've had experiences where I I quit ... five years ago because I just couldn't take reading some of the things people are writing and you know it was opposing me but I thought I don't want to\nJump in here and and you know say something I'd like to regret or anything but I Know people that don't even talk to me because\nIt was revealed on Facebook how I felt you know\nBack when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good a with a lot of relationships you know\nStarted to go in your direction first of all I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kind of stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use Facebook that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned to like you can indicate\nI've learned not to say much about politics in ... when they know all the talk shows and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave you alone it's their chance to you know try to see all kinds of things that they can see if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I got to control myself sometimes simply gets me so sad\nAnd I think I Am going to comment on this but in general or I Try to stay away from it I think the social media right\nAnd that does some good but the uh like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever used Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the radio there are a lot of fun\nIs I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious when the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things were hacked into finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you have ... five years and I admire that\nTom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on with mark\nHello mark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color out you're still listening I uh I I listen to a lot of community radio up here where I'm at and she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know all that up KBC CBS NBC or just\nRegurgitate it everything\nThere is a bright spot and let the Canadians weren't aware that the U.S electorate we're going to do it fast can not get the candidate that the media was trying to ...\nAnd that worked out in the end show all that horrific stuff that came off of a a Paul Kennedy and I'm a\nAt a Charles Adler and uh and right and uh and and green or all of that probably helped a\nJet or Obama or get a Trump elected because it was trying to hurt for we're coming down from Canada like that and uh but the reason I called was so we'd already been told\nA for your Twenty years Thirty years that ah you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and yoga racial issues that we had to confront\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected he ignored his mandate anywhere\nHey mark how ya doing ah I'm Seventy six years old I have some a lifelong friends from college\nOr we when we've gone through a lot together or I was a godfather to one of their shows and that was best man up their wedding or the girl's been like a sister to me like family and I called recently to check in because she's going through a bout with cancer\nAnd then or a ... and in fact they were at the doctor's office at that time and her husband is for me she said that on the less Irene now Donald Trump\nAnd with no longer speak to me\nAnd one thing they were outraged about was that I guess Donald Trump said that this Don Lemon character I'd never seen him a is ignorant\nAnd uh she said they said that's very insulting to call a black person ... what most people I Know why you know most black people are ignorant expected this Don went anyway\nI have a two other life long friends\nThat are very liberal or over the years they've always known that I lean to the right I'm a former marine and they kind of expect it out of me but they're like family will we don't discuss politics much but I really love getting in touch with him\nYou know they live in different cities all these people but anyway [laughter]\nI thought well maybe if I could get\nMy two friends two ... we'll talk radio maybe they kind of get readjusted you know but I wasn't really hurt but I just kind of amazed\nWell for everything I'm hearing none of it surprises me you know what you ought to do you want to make a deal with them\nThat um you tell them the listener read our radio or whatever you choose and then you'll listen to some of their stuff for you know read a book that you believe in that might influence them and they can do the same to you try to open it up it was when I\nI yeah but they they sit and listen renounced Donald Trump they don't get in you know\nI I just even love the term unless you renounce toppled Trump I don't know what does that make me think of ... are now in Sierra you know I actually have an extra ... or something you you got to renounce denounce everything to do with Donald Trump all this stuff is just\nBeyond the pale and so the question is I don't know if I'm right why did I hate them so much it's not us policies because many of them would agree that the country's doing better if they if you went over to this to stick to the numbers the lowest level of black unemployment\nI'm the same thing with a you know Hispanics women are doing pretty well but if you talk about a salary increases wage increases highest than they've been in years ah unemployment rate for everybody is very low jobs you can't even fill jobs there are so many jobs available now into his economy\nAnd you just go one thing after another so they can look at facts it's kind of emotion I think the guy just above\nA and he doesn't have his own cause some of the tweets I get that\nBut this district is worse than George W.
