I Know I Know maybe I should have brought booze\nOr but if you have John Bolton by your side as national security advisor if you have a Nikki Haley in places you in the bathroom my question is how do you feel Nikki Haley shoes I Know what you and ambassador and it's\nOne of those um jobs where you know you're kind of just basically in this case you are the the mouthpiece for the president you're going to you're going to go out to the world to the other nations and you're going to\nI'm a ... advised them as to what the policy is going to be\nBut in the scenario where you have a John Bolton and you have a my palm pay of that I get that one right um the [laughter]\nThe strength I think right now of this cabinet and staff or it and and I put Nikki Haley in there is is is right now I mean ... and we could maybe in the first year you could go in and you could poke holes and and people did with Tillerson\nA as secretary of state saying ... not the right guy and ultimately he wasn't but if you look at it right now where it's set up and I'm Talking about national security wise and where we are with countries like Iran North Korea\nUh and and and even some of our um you know of Saudi Arabia you know the president's stance on the Saudis recently um I think it requires somebody of significant strength I'm not saying there's not\nAnyone there what it's going to have to be somebody who has that strength that can go to the un and do what you\nI I don't mean to downplay the importance of the UN ambassador\nBut it is somebody who can if if you're looking for quality ... you're you're not necessarily looking for a quality of the normal presidential spokesperson\n... and and I'm not talking about Sarah Sanders ... I'm Talking about the normal one where you know if you look at all the you know the the ... the presidential spokespeople over the last you know just about Twenty years later you look at them and you just said because remember their their parenting what the administration wants their pare down their message right\nAnd and the thing that made Sarah Sanders how can be so great is she's directed in your face ... that is actually the way and and you want to project the image of the president of the United states that you represent mhm so imagery of being able to take what the president says\nAnd speak at the un with that same kind of force that she did\nIs what you're looking for and I can't tell you because I haven't seen you know I I really haven't seen in that setting any of the the people that I hear so far maybe up or I've never see them I've never witnessed them speaking in that particular matter one thing that I wanted to say about a a Nikki Haley though\nUh and and just shows you how the the the mainstream media is just nuts\nBecause they would always ask her and I love this question it rarely is asked to anybody who serves in a Democrat presidents or a cabinet and but\nWell what would you disagree with the president how do you deal with it of course I'm going to disagree with the president because my job is not to promote what I Believe it's to promote what the president believes right so of course we're going to have differences but if we have differences we talk about it but it's his administration that I serve in\nIt's like you arrive ... one of the reasons we would have trouble ever worked right in any administration\nIs because we have a we would have a problem promoting something that we didn't believe in right and there are there are people that and and again I have nothing against people who do that that's your job\nYour job is to ... what the administration wants you repeat what the administration wants to the world when you are you in a you know UN ambassador the problem with the human eyes we've been talk show hosts too long we just\nWe couldn't we probably couldn't do that or we will get frustrated that are doing that even if the president was even if we thought the president was Ninety percent right we want to get our ten percent in well you can't do that when you're\nA UN ambassador you have\nTo have you know the national security advisor to be said to be in that position I mean not only that that he that he talks with the public but he's an advisor as opposed to someone who\nIt's mimicking or or relaying\nA mess and and vote and said the same thing you know because when when they asked him well you know a mile or a [laughter] job John [laughter] job I was asked that he's he's always as he said well look when when you were ... when when\nYou were ah you know when you were whatever a ...\nFive years ago you said this and now you're saying this and he said well this is what the president which do I was a private citizen back then the president believes that everything has changed at this point did I Do it but look\nI give the president advice the president I disagree right I give him advice what he does it is like I'm the national security advisor advisor then I Lived in a row white I tell him what should I tell them this is what I think you should do but he doesn't necessarily have to follow it and then when he says let's go and do it but then I tell you what the the plan is\nThat the the president and I sit there and I'm just want to pull my hair out saying why are we going through this because everybody knows that already well ...\nWhat do they in a nation where they can't name the three branches of government\nWell no there you know I think the reporters do it because they want\nTo they they're trying to find anything to show that there is discord within the administration yes yes it is ... and they attempted to do that with Nikki Haley as you mentioned earlier and I I think to your point the earlier point you may as well on\nThe list of a possible abilities and and the possible people who might take her her spot I probably wouldn't have seen a Nikki Haley\nUh in that position as strong as she has been when she was governor I probably wouldn't have been able to say wow she's going to go to the un and she's really going to Iraq some noise you know I don't think glow points so anybody I Know lift could be you know just the strongest stronger as as she's been and\nI trust the president now or maybe not the worst year so much but I trust the president now and it also trust the situation\nAnd we said this in his second year as he moved into a second year of a presidency\nWe talked about how people who were going to work with him I either on staff or in the cabinet would know what they rent for [laughter] after that first year and so anybody who accepts that role knows what they're in for which means they're up for that job as well from their perspective\nWe have a

I'm Mary McNamara longer they're hardly eight six six Ninety or red eye meteorologist Tom hale joins us right\nNow on to get a get caught up on hurricane Michael good morning Tom good morning I'm anyhow you guys doing doing well ah what do we know about\nMy goal or in the current conditions and what do we expect over the next uh twelve to twenty four hours\nWell I I Wish I could say that this is going to be a pretty picture but it it's not um I Am encouraged by a number of the reports that have indicated a lot of people have evacuated Panama City [noise]\nAh also a down all the way through St or a saint Joe\nAn app Appalachian coal and and that southern point a then of course from their up to Tallahassee now folks in Tallahassee I\nSome of them have been boarding up and all that but what we can expect is really simple right now it is a category three\nHurricane that means sustained winds at a hundred and twenty five miles an hour and for those of you who are kind of geeky can write this down the minimum pressure is nine forty seven nine forty seven Mila bars and it's moving to the north it\nAt twelve miles an hour right now it is two hundred and twenty miles to the south south west of Panama City now\nIt's in the ... direction so for it to actually hit the target which right now is estimated between Panama City and the tip of Appalachia cola\nOr it's going to have to make a little bit of a right turn and so in simple terms what people are going to expect is in some significant or whether that they have not seen in their lifetime\nUm well it's not totally fair to say that well no I I guess it really is [noise] um because I expected\nIn the next advisory to go up five or six miles an hour if it goes up six miles an hour a look qualify as a category for hurricane\nAnd a category for hurricane hitting this coast according to the national weather service outta Tallahassee would be the strongest hurricane on record to hit the Florida Panhandle coastline\nYeah so\nYeah and and that's ... that's the strongest down yet on record yeah we we had talked earlier that you know ... down the coast a little bit into the category five hitting in sixty nine\nThat just under state of that that that part so you have an idea of what wins\nAnd and and that's the point when you talk about you know you get to a category of of for hurricane you're talking about winds over a hundred and thirty one miles an hour as a little different than maybe you're a hurricane one where you may have eighty mile an hour winds arena five mile an hour winds so it's a completely different ball game is right\nExactly and when we get to the category three it changes we call it a major hurricane a category one and two are not major hurricanes but they're still I mean we saw a\nCategory to Florence\nA it was a category three briefly but we saw Florence come in and get it we did coverage here on right on the radio for four days with Lawrence and that puppy just hung along the coastline\nAnd this is not going to be the case here by tomorrow or as this moves its way out of here it's wins will be affecting the Florida and south and North Carolina shoreline and in fact\nThe last time there was a storm of that kind of situation that came through was Kate in Nineteen eighty five and Kate's case Kate at the same time\nIt's wins wrapping around the giant Winfield were causing storms and um and tornados along the Carolinas and the Carolinas have got a\nPretty good chance of of multiple tornadoes associated with this and and you know anyone in this entire area of the Big Bend and the panhandle uh are are going to basically relate to\nA cake which happened to be in Nineteen eighty five um but this is gonna ... water\nTom in terms of the the the danger coming ashore because I think a lot of people may be who are looking at you know the I coming ashore but I mean the where the danger and the potentially life threatening\nYou can start what is that timeline where is that window and and what should we expect during that time line\nOkay when it comes to the timeline on what you should expect 'em by tomorrow morning it's still should be offshore\nAnd it will be ... bill a category three but darn close to a category for it I wouldn't be shocked if in the next ... in in a in one hour from now I may be upgraded\nBut by Wednesday evening it should be on shore and so that would be in line with Tallahassee would be coming across Tallahassee by Thursday evening it shouldn't be\nEntering the Carolinas and cutting right across the middle of the Carolinas\nAnd so the eastern side of it will be the onshore winds and rain and the storms so Charlotte and and up the coast and they don't need any more uh destruction or anything now wins are going to be around\nForty five miles an hour or when it gets to the Carolinas and that's going to be Thursday morning but on Wednesday today or we're going to have wins in Tallahassee tonight of at least eighty miles an hour\nAnd a and a probably sustained winds up to forty or fifty miles an hour going through Tallahassee um we're looking at wins that are going to be up to a hundred miles an hour or when we get to a coming onshore and the storm surges the other really bad situation [noise]\nAh from pretty much\nI don't want to include Panama City Panama City six to nine foot storm surge\nAnd that's in part because their shoreline faces a little more to the southwest and so uh when it comes in if it comes in to the east the winds are going to be backing so it will reduce that effect\nBut you get past that to saint Joe which is on the peninsula they're swinging around toward Appalachia cola ah we're looking at a storm surge that will run all the way around through the entire big band that doesn't include cedar key um\nOf nine to Thirteen feet\nWow yeah nine to Thirteen feet um obviously once your past three feet cars float\n... yeah and and and so we're talking about a ... again in\nTerms of that immediate threat really the greatest threat right now in those areas along the shoreline we're talking storm surge correct\nI storm surges is clearly from the you know there's a storm surge warning in effect from Panama City past crystal river and and so as an example um we're looking at Panama City tonight\nThey'll start seeing wins moving their way up to fifty miles an hour and all the way through an average of fifty miles an hour through Wednesday night\nFollowing a the top of the hour more of your\nYou can comment you see the story that mortgage rates are going up yep and uh what uh five percent now Mm wow the mortgage rates out there as a article he remember when they went down to like seven percent or ... I don't know you weren't a homeowner yet were you when they were in that range when ... when I when I became a homeowner\nThis would have been two thousand seven ... a January two thousand seven\nIs when I bought my first home I'd write all over the country and never you know never settled down so I finally bought one\nIt was five I Believe was five point six or five point seven percent while while on a Fifteen year I Would say yes then I\nYou know ... ... you know re did for I think it was like four point three and then the last one I mean I won't be doing it again about a five years ago or four years ago whatever it was three three point too\nYeah and and you look at the I remember one time refinancing a property this was years ago on a ten year no that four and a quarter and I was dancing around the house I was so happy to to reach four and a quarter\nA the the point being is that I mean you know historically you look at the rates and where they were high I mean back when when we started I'm borrowing more or getting mortgages\nIt was in the seven to eight percent range and we felt lucky or you know but the this is going to ... this will affect a revised that will affect a purchase as to what extent\nYou know the remains to be seen because right now you also have a pretty\nA healthy economy and so how does it affect a thirty year no for younger people it's not a it's not the same consideration for people in our age group or because of the fact that we'd like to get paid off before we\nYou know right off into the retirement sunset um but um that it is I think we can expect this from the feds if you listen to what the fed chairman was saying the other day by the way\nIt didn't really make the news because the Kavanaugh thing but the fed chairman saying it is really an and I'm paraphrasing it's going it's it's almost too good to be true how good the economy is right now it's unbelievably good um uh there was a there was one I'm\nA comment or a a a guy who's regularly on CNBC\nEarlier this week saying at least for the next two years is a good economy so those things override some times the a mortgage because yeah the fact that we're spreading it out

south cuts tax after a contentious confirmation new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh was on the bench to hear his first arguments\nYou know we ... I I think about yesterday where they said okay we're going to be a little bit of rain and it just poured here so yeah we had in fact we had to some some flooding just based on on rain right I'm In our area so you think you think of when it's when it's a hurricane and then turn that\nThen you know downgrades to a tropical storm but who really knows in what areas how much rain\nOr you're you're going to get but an extremely extremely a dangerous storm now the update or here at one am central or two am eastern time a hurricane Michael now a category for yeah stream Lee dangerous\nA hurricane now headed a really the bulls eye right now and I don't believe that has changed at all we'll find out a little bit here when we talk to me the meteorologist John trout but right\nYou know heading towards Panama City yeah when you when you when you look back on the ... I guess the history of\nA major hurricanes or there will be names that that that the rise to the top there is no doubt that based on what we know about Michael already that in the years to come they will look back on on Michael as one of those again historic storms\nBased on the size of it and and the amount of damage it caused a so we'll be following this and we'll talk to meteorologist John trout are later this hour a day and get his take on this and and the latest information that he has\nAnd of course we multitask here on the show on a consistent basis in in one of the things now just a\nLittle less than four weeks before election day is after the Kavanaugh hearings you know one of the poll doing and you and I really looking forward to what we're going to see a over the next to a couple of days by the time we get to you know this Friday and we start seeing polls from the actual\nConfirmation a vote in colon speech and and how does that affect certain races out there uh we do have a a a few new polls out there are ... and again it just\nIt we don't we don't believe that there are any absolutes when it comes to polling but it does can give you an idea or at least a snap shot as to what's going on up looking at the Nevada Senate race\nRight a Jacky Rosen the Democrat against a Dean Heller of the ... or a Republican where a in of all the previous polls that were done in September\nA Rosen was up a early ah one poll done in in the early September a she was up by one the grab this poll a mid September she was up by two or by the time the CNN poll came and these are all likely voter polls\nAre from nine twenty five to nine twenty nine she was up for ...\nWell the latest NBC News ... poll done\nNine thirty ten three so you're really through all the hearings at that point\nA again five hundred and Seventy four likely voters\nA Heller is now up to now all of these really are in the margin of error even when she was in the lead mhm so it's all in the margin of error but if you wish to look at it from one poll to another and again they're sampling can be different\nBut you know what you see is a a six point swing in that particular race still in the margin of error but still we ... what we're looking for is\nAny type of momentum or any type of uh I I think a a change in the polls movement in the polls which could be perceived to be based on the excitement level\nOf people wanting to go out and vote right we're likely voter\nIn these polls would say you know a likely voter we said yeah I'm I'm a likely voter and and I'm fifty percent sure that I'm going to go out and vote this time where it's I'm going out and I'm voting sure and somehow that that ends up changing the the polls are moving at\nA in another direction so uh that one in Nevada you know you and I were looking at other polls of of other polls are out there um and\nWhat what's interesting is looking I was looking at the Florida Senate race between Bill Nelson and Rick Scott\nAnd if you look at that right now you have a you you've got a couple of the polls at the ... the average showing a Nelson up\nA a to point for but it really has been a if you look at it uh uh just say a\nReally a tie because it's well within the margin of error\nA on a number\nOf polls with the exception of one of the Quinnipiac poll that had Nelson a plus seven but you look at ah other polls here a Mason Dixon poll or from nine twenty four to nine twenty seven and Nelson up by one a W C. T. V. poll\nThat was taken nine Seventeen to nine thirty which would have included a few days after the uh the the the Senate hearing\nUm they would that has Nelson up by one\nAll within the margin of boom way and the margin of error because of an air bubbles poses is three and a half away and so\nIt it it really is a it really is a dead heat there in Florida\nAnd I think you I think it'll be interesting to watch ah where where the where that goes\nUm I I just think that the\nThe polls between over the next few weeks everything from Kavanaugh the Capitol hearing\nA and the vote is is going to settle in\nAnd we don't know which side it motivates more doesn't motivate the Democrats to get out more to to try and hold the line on the on the Senate race and and ah in in in order to make an attempt to block Trump\nOr down the road for a possible third a nominee for ...\nAnd so we have uh the the latest uh in the Indiana Senate\nBrown versus a Donnelly a Donnelly not vote for a Kavanaugh\nAnd ... he was up by a by three at the end of August the Fox news poll nine twenty nine to ten to has Donnelly up by two well within the margin of error three point to a five percent a year and now they have there are three of a different candidates are in this race including the libertarian\nYeah so uh but right now it's forty three forty one or a you know Donnelly with the lead but uh again excuse me yes Donnelly with the the lead the Democrat\nIn there but then again that really you look at that that is another a dead heat that exist out there and then we go to Missouri and uh the uh latest Fox News poll nine twenty nine to tend to and that is a dead tied how bad is before the actual vote took place\nAnd before calling speech and everything else so that's the kind of thing that we're looking for the polls coming out of it may be here in the next couple of days or early next week and as we get closer to see the effect that that that has had there there are a ton of these races that are a statistical tie\nWith even in a statistical tie\nDemocrats maybe up a point or two and a and so this is something that I'm sure as being very carefully watched\nAnd again when you go into and we're not pollsters you know we're not pollsters we can read them but I mean the methodology\nOf of each and every poll has different nuances and it it all depends on you know what the sample is do they interview more Democrats than actually are in a you know that normally vote in a particular race or not or did they over sample Republicans\nRight and and so you look at it but overall when you look at at the the generalized polls are a ton of the Senate races\nThat are extremely close and so\nA lot of eyes are watching to see okay what's the excitement level going to be the voter excitement level\nOut of the Capitol hearing which I Do believe will have an impact sure\nYeah and so there's a rare right now looking at some of the\nThe the Senate races up uh you you look at the the race with Rick Scott it's interesting dynamic and and and frankly hurricane Michael a and how it's handled will be part of that discussion and campaigning\nOn both sides uh uh you know for the next few weeks um it it may seem like an unfortunate situation to many but that's that's how politics runs in the ... the United states and it may it can make or break a candidate depending on how it's handled and while you know a senator or isn't going to have\nA control if he were to become a senator or over what's going on in that state necessarily um ... like a governor ... during an emergency situation how he handles it\nWill be closely watched over the next few days because it's going to be it's going to be a very politically sensitive situation I'm sure a many from his capital tell you well we're not focused on that right now nor should they be but people outside that a camp court focused on that and will\nBe one of the reality is that if Florence wasn't handled properly by the Trump Administration Democrats would be using ... yes and and you'd end up being that is used in political races and and as you and I talked about from the very beginning and I watched a lot more\nOf the of of Florence are coming in than I have so far of of this particular race\nBut when you watch on the weather channel you came across with a great opinion of the federal government and\nHow they were how they were handling yes it'll be interesting to see if the same thing happens you know here because it will be used yes no doubt eight six six Ninety ...\nIf you have driven over

Fifteen twenty minutes we'll hear from a meteorologist\nJohn ... latest on hurricane Michael which is now hurricane for\nA you know we talked about on CNN yesterday and it was it was just a useless conversation about defining the word Martin and and all that but but it does get to the uh you know the whole thing of not being civil you know Rand Paul calling Cory Booker ... saying get up in the face of Congress people and\nRand Paul and his wife remember last week\nA a running a letter and and and state or an op ed piece in stating\nYou know she sleeps with a gun that remember Rand Paul was attacked yup I'm actually in his in his yard by by a neighbor and what they're saying would you know and look it's coming out and saying look\nYou know what you're what you're doing you're ratcheting up the rhetoric now of of complete and total instability in the end the beautiful part is ... you know\nJust are are we a month past the the uh uh a funeral John McCain right now are when they were talking about stability in you and I know this isn't gonna last Hillary decided to get involved in it you have ... ready for this car I've got Hillary by the way let us know announced Hillary is back\nThere cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house hand or the Senate that twin civility can start again\nLet me ask you this because we we know that the left right now we we we know that ... whether it's Ted Cruz being in a restaurant and whether it's Mitch McConnell being at an at an airport and the mob mentality that exist now let's get a mob and to intimidate people\nMhm do they believe that's going to be effective yes they believe it's working that's my I guess that would be my point to ... to begin with that they believe\nNow Hillary of course when it's well established that the instability and mob mentality now exists then she jumps on board oh yeah I'm going to join join now how many months later right yeah uh and\nShe's no Maxie modest but still there's this again\nIs where we we talk about that they believe that that they believe it's going to be affected either they believe there's one or two things either they believe it's going to be effective\nOr they're just so so enraged they have nothing less nothing left to substance to offer the people so they just that's the natural I guess outlet is range\nAnd get in people's face wherever they are and their own private time whatever ... and what they believe that's going to intimidate Republicans or conservatives really believe that you really believe\nAre if you're on the left you honestly believe oh if we do this then they'll be scared and they'll back off right do you really\nBelieve that the ... do they believe that it's going to change the support\nOf a Ted Cruz no oh wait\nWait wait wait it is it's going to further motivate them it's going to take people who might have decided or maybe just to have been sitting on the fence maybe haven't been in ... think about getting out and voting\nI mean conservatives or Republicans get is going to absolutely motivate them I was actually\nA online and and I was seeing a number of people that we're talking about early voting you know here's where to find out where early where the when the early voting starts in your area\nThat means they're chomping at the bit now we don't make predictions but we know right now both sides are motivated the question is which site is motivated more and historically where's that greater turnout did did you see the NBC\nReporter who went to the college in California ... and there was like thirty people waiting for a bus at a college all young people ... and all of them sitting right there and he said is anybody voting yeah in the mid term not one person raised their hand right finally they found a bench they found one person ... are they found two people have said yeah we're going to vote or what's your concern\nWell you know college and costs to college or\n... what about the rational things on the Russian busted ah we don't even know what's going on we don't know tension of that stuff that out I\nMean it was it was ... it was really really interesting but I I guess the point think about this now because Hillary now coming to board\nAs we said with with everything that went on the insanity\nFrom the mainstream of the Democratic party now that the mainstream the Democrat Party thinks it's okay to say due process doesn't matter that Hillary can jump aboard and say a civility now it's gone till we take over ... not to be civil vogue and civility when we get our way right\nRight we're not we're not we're not going to be civil and and think about what it's about now you're not simple because you believe in what due process and\nA presumption of innocence ... that you look at any case a political case a civil case or a criminal case and you judge it by what the evidence that exist\nBecause you believe that and that's where it's all coalescing now it's it's it's getting right to that point now that you believe that you may never\nBe treated civil again we will find you wherever you are you've heard that call already will mind or wherever you are will stock you wherever you are at your restaurant at your home nothing is off limits why because you believe in due process\nAnd you believe that's going to change people that believe and due process under the law that people that believe in the constitution of people that believe in fairness are going to be intimidated because you attempt to get in their face\nYou actually believe that you're a budget any it didn't you believe that's going to change the opposition this it's going to do the exact opposite yours don't fit people for thinking\nThat yes you are and\nBy the way please keep it up and thank you Hillary who by the way her version of due process is to\nGive money to her lawyers Perkins ... so they can hire fusion GPS so they can hire Christopher Steele should go get salacious and unverified information on her opposition her opponents in twenty sixteen and then have her friends in the Justice Department use it\nTo get a warrant on somebody in her opponent's campaign that due process for Hillary Clinton by the way how did that work out for her\nIt did there was always a twenty percent chance she was going to die but I mean that's that's really the thing that's\n... ... ... ... ... ... is the defense now of instability\nFor those ... to to attack and go after those people or whatever where they are in their personal lives because they believe in due process under the law and that thoughts but in my head since last week thinking\nA meteorologist John trout and I guess we're expecting another uh update here in just a little over two hours from the national Hurricane Center\nYeah we'll get another one and by then we'll know whether it should arrive as a cat three or cat for but I don't want people to split hairs on that when we categorize tornadoes we're only talking about the wind speed we saw from Hurricane Florence or a couple of weeks ago and we saw last year from Hurricane Harvey\nThat the category does not matter as much when we're talking about flooding because only the wind speeds or part of the categories one of the things I dislike about this effort Simpson scale the real killer here is never the wind it's always the flooding people think they can get through the roadways they can they can ride it out but ah [noise]\nThose floodwaters are very destructive very dangerous and very unpredictable\nCertainly a meteorologist a John ah the trial will be following the story of course and and the storm ah in ah throughout the day and then ah it\nHas it's half continues inland and by the way what should we expect are we still on target or to see a few inches of rain for those areas in the Carolinas affected by foreign\nA little less than we talked about yesterday I mentioned or possibly a foot of rain that's been scaled back by a couple inches but Ah yes those areas locally or could see a some a ... foot rainfall total amounts into Georgia\nEnd of the Carolinas and North Carolina and again don't forget the potential for tornadoes spawn from this system\nAll right John John trapper John John we appreciate it will actually at work and uh so he'll be following this information are of course a throughout the day but as John mentioned and you need to heed the warnings\nAnd any of the directors given by local officials and just keep in mind that the other ... going to be a number of things that he first responders from getting to you\nAnd so that's the point a and also uh at at some point you could lose power or may not be safe to drink water ah from the tap and so there are a number of things that could become\nExtremely problematic and of course uh the officials and all of us want you to be safe and and to be able to survive this that things can be replaced the people kinda\nIt was just a fifty five minutes ago that the uh the new advisory came out from the national hurricane service on hurricane or center excuse me on hurricane or the Michael ...\nAnd I am central time advisory that it was up to a strength for hurricane and sit in a maximum sustained winds now a hundred and thirty miles an hour or so it is a strength for hurricane yeah which is extremely dangerous and will be\nA on on modern records the the biggest hurricane ever to hit if it stays that of or I even believe it was a three and maybe the\nThe the biggest ever to hit their the strongest ever right yeah the pan handle\nMore than ... in terms of the wind and John brings up a great point about those a spin off tornadoes in those areas which can also be destructive as well will follow the story and coming up next our in fact we'll talk with meteorologist Tom held get an update from him

Twenty years so Hillary now calling for ... you know instability number one we talked about the fact that\nThey actually think this is an effective way to go to the actually\nThink that politicians you know calling for it now to the point of Hillary Clinton saying can have civility which is to call for instability mhm which is the calls to harass people in their private life\nAnd\nI that was the first thing that hit me was was they think this is going to be effective\nBut then you get to the point of Hillary now bringing it up where she feels comfortable saying it looks Hillary's a follower she'll be asked you and not take an opinion on anything if she believes\nThat it is perceived as radical at all to anybody in her base ... we've seen it before remember\nWhen she was up in Canada yeah and she was asked about the pipeline right I'm not going to comment on that because other people right now are making a decision look you're running for president it\nThis is still a a an issue we need to know what your thoughts on it are and she didn't want to take a side right and so now here's Hillary Clinton calling for instability\nAnd and and think think about this\nSo now it's becoming mainstream in the end and what why instability over what what is the issue you're calling for due process\nYou're calling for presumption of innocence you're calling for preponderance of evidence you're saying where's the evidence\nYou're coming out because this is and we talked about this yesterday what came out of this whole thing ah you know from from Democrats is if you believe in due process than you are enabling rapists and therefore you deserve no stability because of it\nWhich is of course that's their definition\nThe definition of people that believe and due process under the law people to believe and due process under the law obviously\nAre not advocating rape or sexual assault now any other crime right and that's the point and so I think about it that it's very important to get to the actual issue what is the point that they view that it's so radical\nThat the writers taking were instability must lead and it's that simple point\nThe belief in due process\nAnd evidence in any case to show the guilt of anybody and not\nJust an allegation that is what has set off even the mainstream now of the Democratic party to call for in the ability this is\nHow far how low\nWe always wonder we always that's the question how would they go you know calling somebody and not see you know and and and saying that that's been for a long time but you get to the point now where they're calling for instability based\nOn people's opinion on the other side that evidence is how you judge somebody's guilt right due process should apply and all of these cases which means\nYou look for the evidence to find somebody who's skilled you don't believe anybody because of their demographic because of their gender because of their race because of their age\nYou believe people because the evidence backs what they what they say now you can believe that you can sit there and why I think it sounded credible\nIt doesn't mean that that person that you look at them and called him a rapist because that's what they were doing they were calling him arenas and the gang rapist yes I Believe her which means they believe you did it yes\nThey believe cabin on to it at the evidence isn't there right never been there right yet that's what their state and because you don't agree with them\nBecause you say no I Believe in the preponderance of evidence I Believe in the presumption\nOf of uh of of innocence I don't believe anybody just because they say if\nI Need evidence and when somebody stories change I'm suspicious\nThose are all rational critical thinking commonsense arguments and

[noise]\nIn ...\nAnd ...\n\nThose ...\nWe have lots of insomniacs out there\nAnd thank you for listening yeah yeah\nLook I have insomnia and I have vowed I Will not sleep until I find the cause of it is yeah we'll we'll we'll talk or mostly coming up or an ... an ... in a little bit more important things out there that are much more important meteorologist Tom hills year\nI'd get caught up on hurricane Michael and a ... a good morning again Tom as you predicted hurricane Michael now without a gory for\nYes yes it is category for I agree with you on the sleep\nPart but either way [laughter] I said you were working things I'm awake in fact right now but I was very there's a reason\nIs what the storms do and uh you know ... every once in a while you get to be able to capitalize on that adrenalin rush 'em because you know a meteorologist one of the few things that we get to do and as broadcasters in our lifetime is maybe save a life yeah\nAnd and and and here we have an opportunity because we were being heard from one end of the coast to the other side of the United states and every one of these people who are listening right now have family and friends or know someone who has family and friends hurt along this coast\nAnd and so I'm making the suggestion that you\nGet in touch with your family and friends and make sure that they're doing the right thing\nA simple example in Panama City beach\nThere are six possibly now seven shelters that are open so if you've decided to stay along\nThe beach front um and and not move inland\nMaybe a ... you don't have to you can you can move inland to to a little town called fountain up\nTo a two thirty one or or you can take it a little bit further and and head on up to a interstate twenty if you want to go that's only an hour drive up the road to an interstate excuse me interstate ten I'm\nA simple thing is that you need to get out of harm's way and um\nWhen we talk about a category for storm I Want to put this in perspective and and and and not a slow moving storm like we saw was large\nIt was a category ... storm that hit Puerto Rico last year called Irma\nAnd we've all seen the pictures and the devastation now devastation is relative to what it hits so if it's a rotted tree\nIt it could take a breeze to take that thing out um if the homes are not built to handle hurricanes or they haven't had hurricanes a long time and the building standards and become lax guess what\nThe same story you get greater amounts of devastation [noise] um here this is something that they have not seen along this coastline historically period um\nAlong the ... the Panama City beach to Tallahassee Pensacola Beach simply put the panhandle and then the Big Bend area that's the area that swoops around and and and swings down to cedar key\nUh there hasn't been a category for storm hit and so that's in itself\nSomething that nobody can relate to and when you can't relate to something you relate to what your cat and what you can uh if somebody has been around since Nineteen eighty five [noise] that would be caked and\nAnd and and Kate was quite a devastating storm a and at that point you have to say to yourself well if you haven't been around for Kate you know what other things have come by well\nAh there's been very few October storms to begin with I'm\nThis storm is an October storm math he was an October storm\nAnd there was a a Celia but a Celia was a major all these are major storms but Ophelia was offshore and so it didn't have that kind of a an effect\nOn Florida and so right now if you're listening or if you have family and friends along that area you need to understand that that on Wednesday evening one hundred mile an hour gusts are going to be common and that's after it's come onshore\nUm tomorrow evening because we're expecting a still a landfall sometime around three to four o'clock and that means that it'll speed up a little bit before it comes to shore\nRight now it's gone gone to the north of twelve so\n... and of course ah you know it's been pointed out time and time again not just the wins in in the destruction of property in and present danger to humans but but really the flooding in the storm surge here the water that comes along with a storm like this\nAre being a potentially life threatening in fact that his life threatening and is often deadly\nUm and and that\nIs something to be aware of it is not just the strength of the storm in terms of wins but also the water that it's going to deliver a both and storm surge and rainfall\nWell yeah you know remember that the ... in in the past used to be lightning lightning was like the number one whether killer in you know wide lightning isn't the number one whether killer ... because we convinced everybody to go out in the lightning\nIn right right [laughter] okay yeah indoors it's lightning right\nBut you know we've done a really lousy job at convincing people to use common sense when they're on the road and they're driving and and we had over thirty people in the Carolinas\nDrowned because they decided they were going to be tougher and they knew what they were doing better than the people who are telling them to stay off the road right now and and\nAnd and so yeah a a storm surge is usually felt along the coast and let's say maybe five to ten miles inland wherever there's a waterway that that water from the Gulf of Mexico can move its way in\nAnd so whether you're an Appalachian cola or you are in Panama City\nOr you're swinging around uh uh toward the coastline just south of Perry and the Big Bend that you're looking at a storm surge that's going to be easily nine feet and\nCouldn't be less right can be up to nine feet or even Thirteen actually the weather service has got a plot at nine to Thirteen feet in that area\nSome ... for those of us who have never witnessed that first and I just described the dynamics of a storm surge especially one with the potential of a nine to twelve feet or more as you mention\nThat because you know we've seen in a recent video from the ... in Indonesia and we know so we can see that kind of force in terms of a storm surge I mean one of the dynamics of that what I describe that too is what takes place during the storm\nYeah because I'm ... and here I'm looking here like it at Panama City beach for example that's you know are you right there I mean there's no there's no barrier it's not one of the bays it's right there what is what is the effect how far I mean that goes in a pretty long way doesn't it\nThe five o'clock

with her and her only eight six six Ninety run I let's get caught up\nOn the latest on hurricane Michael as we go to a meteorologist Tom hale good morning Tom good morning alright what ... what do we know about a hurricane Michael at this point and when we expect another update\nOkay we should expect an update in one hour from now I actually we should expect an update\nAnd a half an hour out of our yeah mhm yeah and uh and then the second question\nAnd so what is I I guess give us the latest on that uh what do we know about what's the status of Michael right now and when do we expect Michael to hit the shore in the panhandle of Florida\nOkay well the first thing is you know normally the national weather service can be kind of conservative in regards to its language\nBut the national weather service or the national Hurricane Center in this case describes Michael as an extremely dangerous category for hurricane life threatening storm surge hurricane force winds\nHeavy rain expected along the northeastern Gulf Coast\nAnd it's located a hundred and eighty miles to the southwest of Panama City\nAnd it is one it is a one hundred and Seventy miles to the southwest of Appalachia cola and of course when Spain's or a hundred and thirty miles an hour and it's moving to the north at twelve miles an hour now taking a look at at some of the a radar um\nOr indications it's a if you've been watching any of the TV stations with their radar indications that shows a little bit of ... to it [noise] um and it actually looks like it may be starting to\nMake a little bit of a turn maybe one or two degrees ah in the direction of Panama City um and and so it's most likely going to come ashore right in between Panama City\nBeach and down to Appalachian coal Callaway is a town along the airport in St Joe is also along that same areas a category for and this is the official definition of a category for\nA category for hurricanes have sustained winds of a hundred and thirty up to a hundred and fifty six miles an hour obviously Puerto Rico side of the higher end of that scale\nBut well built framed homes can will ah sustain severe damage and loss of most of their roof and and possibly some exterior walls wow trees will be snapped\nOr uprooted and power lines down fallen trees and power lines will isolate residents\nAnd power outages will last for potentially a several weeks a and they have in here or possibly months now they're writing it for the worst case scenario here but ah several months was Puerto Rico's case um and most of the area will be\nUninhabitable for weeks or months while\nNow that's the definition of a category four yeah that's a while um and so you know what can I tell you I'm\nI work for a company that has a group of television stations all around the country of fairly large company called grey TV [laughter] and the company I work for has a TV station that's in Panama City\nAnd I'm In a in a short time from now a a W. J. H. G. channel seven down there is going to be going wall to wall coverage [noise] uh and uh and they are twenty feet I called and talked to him just a minute ago\nUh therefore their team of four meteorologist or are in their weather center and uh they're getting ready to start their wall to wall coverage and they are twenty feet above sea level and now they're\nOptimistic that they won't see a storm surge um that will get up to the station right and there are also optimistic that the generators or continue the ... power generator or work in the station is fortified sufficient enough to handle this and we won't know that until\nA later this afternoon right um but obviously I tomorrow if we talk um maybe we'll see if we can get a phone call into them\nAnd a half after it has passed by right um but I I think\nOur prayers need to be with all the people who are\nUp and down that coastline there are there because they realize that even though the majority of people of evacuating it out of a given area that there are still some people behind\nAnd while they're not going to be able to go out and do anything once the winds up over forty miles an hour and they become tropical storm wins um\nBut that being said\nEven though they're not going to be able to do anything when it's over with they're going to be in there in force I Know are surrounding a Panama City they've got I think six hundred staged power company people were going to swarm in there the governor of Florida\nHas called out I think it's fourteen hundred a National Guards uh\nOr it's when or guards folks ah [laughter] and uh the same is true 'em up and down the up and down the coast three states of of basically um declared a you know a disaster urgency\nRight let let me let me just ask you this big because you did or you had predicted a before the last ah advisory\nThat showed that went to a category of for you predicted that it would go up a couple of ... of a of a more miles per hour from a hundred and twenty five two hundred and thirty and you hit it right you expected to get any stronger or do you see you'd weakening as it gets closer to shore\nAh no I don't see a weakening is gets closer to shore\nIn this particular case um the uh the water hasn't been touched\nSo we're looking at eighty five degree average water temperature um the other thing that's going on is that unlike a lot of these storms where we've got a cold front that might come in from the continental United States bringing in a little bit drier air\nThere is a cold front out there but it's it's moving through the Dallas area right now it's it's nowhere near\nThis and so uh in in terms of what we know in the United states and in in the mid west and so forth we call it the worm sector that's the area head of the cold front\n... that warm sector is a couple of hundred miles long and they're in the heart of that warm sector they have all the fuel all the moisture and in the heat and heat in the water that's necessary so it won't it won't die down\nOr whatever it gains it will carry to shore and then once it hits the friction of the shore then it will start to\nDegenerate a little bit so Tallahassee could be seeing routine I'm\nEighty two maybe a little more than that mile an hour gusts with sustained winds of fifty miles an hour while Appalachian coal a and Panama City beach will have one hundred plus mile an hour winds as it's coming ashore this afternoon", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "10"}
