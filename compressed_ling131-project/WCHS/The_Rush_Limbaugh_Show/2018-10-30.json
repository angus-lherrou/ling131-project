I'll admit it ... I was livid and of course as a lone voice at the time I was a little alarmed can they make this that\nAnd of course they weren't able to and even now a certain members of the drive by caution everybody to remind people Clinton try when Clinton was called on it by the way Clinton's hey [laughter] when I was talking about [laughter]\nAs talking about that [laughter] Michigan Militia shortwave radio do the right Michigan Militia short wave radio network that's what they said they were talking it blew up in their faces and this continues to too but let's get the birthright citizenship this\nI think is a follow want it to Donald Trump following through\nOn one of the primary commitments he made as a candidate which I think is responsible for his election and that is his promise to build a wall to get a handle on illegal immigration\nAnd to stop it because of its for ever changing consequences to this country\nBut primarily what Trump is a law and order issue as it is with all the rest of us it's simply a law and order issue we have laws defining legal and illegal immigration we have a political party that is pushing illegal immigration\nAnd actually both parties have to the extent of promoting programs that have amnesty involved for all of them are both parties have different reasons for supporting in the meantime the very definition of what America is and what our culture is is under assault\nAnd the politicians in Washington don't seem to care because they think they're always going to be insulated from whatever negative changes result\nAnd in some cases it's even worse than that\nThe left wants those changes the left wants this country over thrown from the days of its founding\nTo the left America as illegitimate it's immoral it's in decent because we were a slave nation\nAnd we discriminated in the original white privilege was the founding fathers there were no founding mothers only founding fathers and their bunch of white privilege rich white guys they set up a country for themselves and their descendents so goes the argument leaving everybody else out\nAnd it's time to overthrow them and change it and it's a serious movement and it's it's a\n... you can trace the educational roots for this back to the Nineteen seventies Nineteen seventies as a [noise] an offshoot of the radicalism of the sixties is where\nThe changing premise of education for America's kids actually began but I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here in the details of the story\nDonald Trump and let me just give you the New York times version they're headline Trump claims he can defy constitution and end the birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump offered a dramatic if legally dubious promise in a new interviewed ... unilaterally and birthright citizenship ratcheting up his hard line immigration rhetoric with a week to go before the critical mid term elections Trump's vow\nTo enter the rights of citizenship for children of non citizens alum authorized immigrants born in America came in an interview with ... was released yesterday Trump did not say when he would sign on the order\nAnd some of his past promises use executive action of gone unfulfilled but whether he bottles throwing his threat or not the issue joins a string of actions intended to thrust the matter\nImmigration ended the front of voters' minds as they have the polls next week folks as I said throughout the first year of Trump's presidency this is what pushing back looks like it was never going to be clean and it was never going to be quiet\nPushing back against the liberal order of the day was always going to be noisy and it was going to be potentially violent dangerous\nAfter all these are people who do not accept election results anymore and you know what that means ... you know was held this country together all these years is the honoring of a lecture results yeah have a heated campaign you may have\nPolitical parties and elements that really don't like each other but whoever won the election decided who had a chance at running the country and both sides acknowledge that and it wasn't that long ago you can go back to two thousand two when the Democrats lost those mid term elections in shock\nGeorge W Bush's first midterm elections after winning in two thousand a drive by is on the left were convinced\nThat they were going to sweep the house the way they were going to sweep the Senate away if people were fed up with the Florida recount remember all that Al Gore got jobs the Democrats got cheated and Democrats were loaded for bear out what happened the Republicans won an added seats in an off year election\nWhat the Democrats they accepted it for the most part and they started talking about how well we're gonna have to modify some of what we believe a lot of values a base just because the exit poll showed that values were a large factor in why people voted Republican\nWell fast forward it two thousand six than there is no knowledge with the Trump won they do not accept\nAre citizens of the United states and the state where he may resign which means the draft or is it the fourteenth amendment had no intention of conferring citizenship I'm the children of aliens who happened to be born here in fact the very author of the citizenship clause senator Jake I'm Howard of Michigan\nExpressly said this is why the original intent of founding documents is so important quote\nThis meaning the fourteenth amendment this will not of course include person who was born in the United states who are foreigners who are aliens who belong to the families\nOf ambassadors or foreign ministers it was expressly intended to confer citizenship to slaves and their descendants\nThere was an Eighteen eighty four case elk versus Wilkins Supreme Court ruled the fourteenth amendment did not even couldn't for citizenship on Native Americans because they were subject to the tribal jurisdiction not us jurisdiction will an illegal alien here\nIs not subject to us jurisdiction there under the jurisdiction of where they came from it they're here illegally gas when this all changed\nIn the Nineteen sixties concomitant with senator\nToday wanting your we all we had shut down all immigration from Twenty one sixty five along comes Senator Kennedy in a pre Chappaquiddick days wanting to reopen it for the express purpose of

be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I think reasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are and it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they\nDo\nAnd it's ... refusal to accept this not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy I don't feel good and when they feel bad and something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

chess\n[noise]\n\nAnd back to the phones we go this is Dan and Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThat get Russia I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment for team because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are on in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame them it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\nYeah ... ... ... it it's ... we're we're dealing with mass\nIll education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night they team sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restrictive the blacks\nThat essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game that we're going to formally recognized former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the those black coaches were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be appalled in the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made this why he should\nDo this and that's his point people have looked into this\nMay have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who are involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never\nIntended to confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors or foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten to converse citizenship on slaves\nAnd now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties when this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them\nThat as a nation we suspended for the most part I may never there's always been\nA people being granted citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties\nPretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans they didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen and they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods\nAre Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians the ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture that ... of which there is a distinct and unique\nAmerican culture which is rooted in western civilization that's what's different now there's no interest in that\nWe don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan rising\nIf they use this term tribal but we're more organizing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it and for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution to re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points that the guy who\nFrom Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate God surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got a company got we got to do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being set up as being set in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you have ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually show that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah\nIt'll it'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that in the Senate ah look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen\nThere there there needs to be a pretty big re education of the American population in general on the whole subject of immigration and so Trump and his ... the roots\nOf an executive order is good but there's the you know there's going to be a judge\nThat's going to bring it to a screeching halt everybody knows that\nI mean that'll happen within hours of Trump's signing the executive order everybody involved no it was that's going to happen that then begins the process and it probably will end up at the Supreme Court unless Congress does writing legislation in dealing with a constitutional amendment\nOr it may take more than just the statutory act\nAnd the left\nAnd they've got plenty of judges out there are going to be using every damn what I've been to try to shut down every effort here\nTo see this is how folks this is how we end up having a chance to win by shining the light on the left and who they are and what they do by forcing them out of the shadows and making them do it\n\nSanctuary cities isn't good educational tool people can find exactly what these people are but where after the people responsible for the people that are believing in sanctuary cities for some out make 'em defend it make a run for office ... the virtues of sanctuary some make the left\nSpeak make them behave make them stand up and support what it is they believed him\nAnd so this conversation starter on the fourteenth amendment and ending birthright said make them stand up and make polo sea and Schumer and whoever else saw them make the case that in\nEverybody born in the United states should be able to make them make the case\nThat's how we're going to defeat him folks and it's going to be a long process\nDon't fit the left has gotten away for years by being able to lie and camouflage themselves and make themselves look like people they arms and make themselves look like they support things they don't\nThey haven't been on the body like Trump and elected Republican politics forcing the left out this way and\nAs it happens the immediate goal is more and more bonkers because they know what's going on\n\nAnd it's it's forcing everybody to see that the media isn't the media the media is the Democratic party\nAnd\nAll of these things are why the people I talked to who think that there is not going to be a blue wave\nAnd they can do to stop that he's got to stop it because they they come up and they have these babies and I have another situation I can tell you that way you know our country has caught where they had a Fifteen year old girl at the border seven months pregnant and they let her across they sent the other sixteen teams with our back\nOn my stomach so they can't say we don't have heart they do see a situation they know need help\nBut you know even Hispanic girls that thought Trump was horrible that he was to send all these people that they realize now that he is doing what the country\nWell we'll take them you know whatever they realize it is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's a\nOnce you understand what's going on it's impossible to support\nIt's it's just it's impossible to support our little less you have particular political notions of what the United States purpose in the world is and what we owe\nAnd so forth but in in terms of being the best policy for the United states it isn't anyway appreciate\nThe jam thanks much will take a break and be back at\nThose human Russia\nI'm ...

links between Trump's comments on the actions of the bomber and the synagogue sugar\nIn Nineteen Ninety five when Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that their political speech isn't allowed anymore because there was a direct connection between political speech and violence that they're very serious thing to do that\nJihad as terrorists lone wolf carries out an attack\nWe always ask what radicalized and what inspired him to go to violence we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are as long as they're as you can not divorced the actions of the sec individuals' from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nThat's max boats Max Boot used to be as conservative as anybody you know uh in the Washington establishment something you may think that's not very conservative but he certainly wasn't this\nWe have to answer the same thing\nAbout these right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic terrorists you can't divorce the actions of the sick people from the sick rhetoric\nThat you're hearing\nSo what he's talking about is you have an a jihadi who walked into a mosque one day was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward any buddy walks into a mosque starts listening to your mom preaching and comes out of their Osama bin Laden junior\n\nAnd he's saying that's exactly what's happening in the Sunday Donald Trump is is

being\nNobody on our side doing this is ridiculous\n\nIt's the comparison alone and it comes from the never Trump ers who are frustrated that they have been able\nTo diffuse Trump they'd been unable to dispatch Trump\nAnd it's always a one way street we never heard about Bernie Sanders radicalizing the guy that shot up\nThe Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftists and Hillary Clinton right it's always just one way street there's always you know what it is rooted in bugs it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms\nOf this program dating back to Nineteen eighty eight was that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots and I\n... valley and I am telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted in it's rooted in\nThe presumption of superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots who cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood\nAnd they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nOh I did was repeat what all of you had been saying to each other\nBut you ... you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laugh damp or criticized made fun of mocked but you were never\nGiven any respect whatsoever than this program came along and it reflected\nWhat you think and what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto it would not because you were sitting up there in your relative ignorance day in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and you're so mindless\nThat's been golly it's can tell you how do you think or tell you when to start blowing things up or window started shooting people and that we've even got never Trump conservatives or out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down you know what I keep the essence of things that ... ...\nWhere is there real anger at directed that you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you who voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express it and the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump there seems to be tied\nYour is the reason that this was all going because you have the stupidity of voting for the guy and now you're blowing things up and you're shooting people\nJust deeply darkly insulting it's not promoting civility it's not promoting unity\nQuick phone

never taken away preexisting conditions\nIt's like the Republicans are never kicked Susan citizens that let our houses either and they've never taken away their Social Security and have the left promised democratic voters for fifty years but that's what Republicans were going to do now they're doing it in a pre existing conditions are right\nHere they've thrown in fear and making promises they connect Keith and they don't keep well they don't tend to\nJust promises they can't they connect Cape and they were selling something that isn't even viable because Medicare requires the private sector insurance without the private sector insurance there's no Medicare Medicaid for a great example that veterans programs\nYeah but see what what you're illustrating is is something that we've been talking about today they the mallard ill education of people since well I don't know when you went on I ...

Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama has been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level and there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as\nAs well and so gas if if if what the media dead the to the state of Indiana is gas lie thing is if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it and er and accepted and it's this arrogance\nAnd this is the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's you have\nA synagogue shooting while the obvious the obvious explanation is that Donald Trump and his conservative medium posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is an everybody thinks this is crucial for the media the weather report these things to make it look like\nThey are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition split numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media is right in their facilitating isn't that I'm telling you it isn't\nIt used to work like a charm and on many people still\nDoes we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding\nBy virtue of whether the media as being nice to 'em or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there but the\nElectoral results just in the past two years indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that\nUh to see what [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ...
