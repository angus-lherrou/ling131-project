was a mistake and I thought it would have happened yesterday Sunday Morning on his program reliable sources talking about Trump\nThe president of the United states is the country's biggest promoter of

Trump's new media appearances so confusion in division ... Trump wise all the time\nIt's usually in definitely a good thing for the press to have more access to a powerful people but with Trump the downside of that access to the saying so much stuff that's on through that it's so there's confusion and division\nThat's why USA Today that by running the presidential off at the other day full of ... and that's what Fox and friends that by putting up on the phone for forty six minutes and then not correct in many of their students\nTo read a little little Brian is speaking for all of the media what he's saying is damn it yeah but we can't find a way to tell people how\nTrump's lying and spreading misinformation he's not giving us a chance to do our jobs he is expressing frustration Trump is sucking all the oxygen up another room\nNever have I heard this before the drive by media whining and complaining that there's too much access the president's talking too much because he is\nThing may your bread and the states all\nWorld join hands make a law trying to break through or even does Streisand [noise]\nMe to bring all the big [noise]\nHow to have these\nRun our test as the only with a fresh twist at a clenched fist\nJohnny goes from a um a John good found\nWe are good balance and if you don't agree\nWith it and read the paper where am I ready to go [noise]\nIn dogs on let me know\nHow many new alone you know run our tests do they show the question is can push a record year we wouldn't have gone back and concussion bailout NBA games in bail bondsmen everywhere through that [noise]\nMichael Jackson as a buffer rotation\nBlood on the dance floor with some proper fall and obviously it's\nGreat to have you ever hear a telephone number eight hundred to eight to ... age okay look at this this headline from\nDome bird knows Mahler ready general every kid findings in his Trump pro ... sources say\nDo they think that we are idiots\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings encore aspects of this Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections as he faces in and set fire to pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed but we don't even know if they're alive U.S officials\n\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something anything it has got to be in tents\nEverything has blown up autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus on us in her latest blew up on 'em Hillary blow up on 'em Stormy Daniels blow up on 'em every attempt in October surprise this year alone previous October's is blown up and now\nYou know they've thought all along the mother is going to get\nThe goods on how Trump's Foley election by cheating including what the Russians\nAnd when this story broke that Mahler is not going to deliver his key findings adult after the election you man Jimmy anger and the frustration not so much for the like the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the game here but\nThey're they're low tech the rain psychologically screwed up base is probably beside itself because this is really ballgame for this is what they have been counting on they have been they've bought it\nThey drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump jaded with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished\nAfter them in terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this books\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\nInclude that air report such as this from a special counsel will not be released\nWithin this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated rural India is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise to me it's a it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure that a bombshell report if any\nNature will be held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing or if not that leak yet if it's got things in it that they like which the ladder is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies in the drive by media\nRather than ... ...\nThe rules and release the report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing they're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\nSources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that ... Don rollers wrapped it up while I was a big garden smaller is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment are going to be talking about\nBefore the midterms in hopes in the hopes this is what they're hoping they're hoping that the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done\nWe'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's stole the election is imminent that\nIs what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to\nBelieve that it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they will create\nThis cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger\nThat port handles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be trouble be removed after the midterms\nWouldn't blow it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiving just see who will be running Congress before he decides to really enjoy\nThis because his report goal is to Rosenstein who is technically\nHis bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is decided whether or not\nThat it is made public certainly the Democrats do when the house they're going to insist that Muller not\nConclude the investigate particularly if he hasn't found any collusion of the Democrats win the house they're going to tell why don't we got\nTime man we can all the time in the world keep getting\nWe don't need your report right now we read any one house and we didn't mean your report so you keep digging\nHint hint you keep dig until you find that proof ... meaning\nSince we're on the show you're not going to need any proof all you need to do is highly speculate that had happened we'll take care of the rest that's going to be the Democratic message if they went in the house\nIf the Republicans when the house\nWhile there's a whole new ballgame in terms of what mother will do and how he will do it and whether he will and that wrap it up issue is report or not\nBut there is no reason\nOther than political reasons there's no reason for smaller to say for anybody to leak\nThat he's ready to deliver key findings\nNo reason to do that other than to have been used as\nA change agent in the upcoming midterms\nSpecifically Muller is close to rendering judgment on to the most explosive aspects of his inquiry\nWhether they ever clear incidence of collusion between Russia and ... [laughter] believe me that one of the league long ago there isn't any of that and the second thing is whether the president took any action as it comes to the obstruction of justice\n\nAnd Bloomberg goes on to say some things that make it look like they're pretending that there's even more being investigated besides collusion an obstruction\nBut there is and then they say there's the question of timing is critical mothers work won't be concluded a head of the midterm elections when Democrats hope to take control the house and and Trump's one party hold on washing but this time line raises questions about the future of the pro it sells\nTrump single he may replace Jeff Sessions after the election and move it could bring in a new boss for Muller Rosenstein my also resign or be fired by Trump after the election but you notice here\nVoters work won't be included a head on November six mid term elections when Democrats hope to take control that not every news story is written from the perspective of its impact on the Democrats\n\nOther words his work won't be concluded ahead of the November six mid term elections when Republicans corn maintain control about no that would never think of writing that\nThis is out there to create the illusion that Mahler has been gardens and it's only a matter of time before the world is officially told at Trump loaded that's what they hope to create with this\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't read your audience that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration in the U.S is with a news media and many people in the same boat\nWho are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me that was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people going to go out and vote and they have no idea they hired newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are a well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you is the reason\nThey are but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them are wages going up what am I ever seen anything\nMy point is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all\nOf this and that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you can be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can to hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with the lizard with Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievements\n[laughter] take a break for that has that much about suicide rush obligated by being met for\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy were larger I Want you to get a PIN and I want you to write this information down\nIf your age Seventy five year old and I'm a hundred thousand dollar larger life policy did you know you can convert them my policy in the cash right now I'm not kidding you can turn your life insurance policy and the cold hard cash\nI Know the economy has been a struggle for many people need cash they need it right away\nAnd you can get cash right away for your life ... give your over Seventy five number one hundred thousand dollar or larger life moments you don't want you to write this number down giving smokes because it's all free get rid of those insurance premium stopping those turned that policy and the cash right in this number down ... for for\nWe buy Seventy five use the cash to pay bills medical bills whatever call ... ... ...

good or not what about you play the game what's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up the Mahler it's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to reveal this release it or or

Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion I don't think there's anything in it on

pull quotes as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now higher than are tied with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep describing\nTrump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more Trump's low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to him\nAnother pull quotes\nAt this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing\nAnd that was after the failed pork yeah was\nIt was after the signing of Obamacare and after the signing of Dodd Frank and other policies highly antagonistic to Republicans Trump on the other hand\nGets approval from only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving of Obama the Democrats have been if Trump\nSo who actually is being divisive\nTrump with a GOP or the Democrats who will hate Trump no matter what he does\nI have to think that the drive by are fully\nAware of this may not want to admit that Trump's approval numbers really much stronger than it's being reported and is a much higher here is that story certainly you didn't believe it Daily Beast Democrats fear Obama going soft for the midterms\nHe's not out they're not going soft\nHe's not it was you know don't doubt me on this during his presidency he did not like campaigning for house races it was so nice the office of the president's\nEating his mind he didn't want any part of it\nI think there is a bigger reason now I I don't think Obama's confident than he can pull anybody across the finish line coat tails and all that\nEvidence is exactly the way it is during the Obama
