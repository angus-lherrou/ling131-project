somebody is making this happened somebody set this up\n... obviously is a bunch of ...\nSince ... up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is that makes them think they are going to win massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it is and it's not a caravan it's a mob it's uh bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way\nTo win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think organically natural really exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on is massive\nTrump hatred massive Trump resentments\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues in our own individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back the things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting\nTrump fear Trump hatred promoting it [laughter] and exacerbating it or what have you and it's\nIt's silly it's not the way you build a movement now\nLet me share with you a couple of uh\nStories today on the polling leading up to the mid term because it is all over the place and it is contradictory as it can be FiveThirtyEight this is the adored do and the indispensable and the eagerly anticipated Nate Silver\nWho has now said the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning control of the house of representatives\nThe Republicans have only a fourteen and a half percent chance of keeping the house\nThis is almost identical\nTo five thirty it's forecasting two weeks before the presidential election in two thousand six Dan where Hillary Clinton had anywhere from an eighty eight percent or Ninety two percent chance of winning the presidency and Trump had what twelve percent to ... percent chance of winning\nWhich was effectively zero and even on election day throughout the day and that is how five thirty eight and the New York\nTimes reported and we all know what happened Charlie Cook considered the dean of political analysts and this company\nAnalyzes races individual house races and Senate races hand reports on\nWhich way they're going to go the cook Political Report today has shifted eight house racist toward Democrats and two in favor of Republicans with fourteen days to go before the midterm election the non partisan election forecast and there is no such thing\nAnd Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan\nCharlie Cook cares about the outcome of this stuff Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan but that's how this stuff gets reported the nonpartisan election forecaster Charlie Cook Political Report rejected Democrats will have an edge in key swing districts following the party's massive\nFund raising hall in the third quarter of this year\nSo those are the two stories but then\nIf you turn to NBC News and the wall Street Journal bloom wave collapsing early voting shows geo pie out pacing Democrats in key states\n\nIn this story is even is even prepared in a written as another sign that this so called blue way am eagerly anticipated blue wave could end up disappointing people next month if it arrives at all NBC News\nHas looked at early voting day and it provided by a company called target smart in eight states and found that GOP affiliated voters are out pacing democratic voters in seven of those including North Carolina\nGOP affiliated voters have surpassed Democrat voters in early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee Texas also North Carolina\nOnly in Nevada have\nDemocrat affiliated voters ... Republican affiliated voters so far in the early voting the latest data deserve NBC\nSuggest robust in a fool's Yaz him among early eight Republican voters that couldn't put a dent in Democrat hopes for a blue wave Republicans typically dominate early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to have the advantage with it in person early voting\nSo for example the entire early voting picture in Florida which is you have to begin in person voting is incomplete\n\nNow that that somewhat above the important point there because it's it's not just that the Republicans are doing better than Democrats in the states\nIs is that early voting almost always favors Democrats the usual pattern for all this stuff is that for Democrats are drawn up in the early ...\nBecause of early voting and the Republicans after them make up for that on election day itself but that's not what we're seeing here and they gave us was NBC News\nSo the question here ... hard to apply this to actual election outcomes too much we don't know but one thing we do know this is not this is not according to mention was a conventional wisdom is and conventional wisdom has been the Republican enthusiasm is kind of suppressed\nThat Democrat enthusiasm is off the charts that the Democrats have been so motivated ever since they got screwed in\nTwo thousand sixty ever since Trump and the Russians stole that election and from the Democrats have been motivated or like you can't believe the get out there and make this right\n\nThis is the kind of result that kind of thing that's happening but nobody in conventional Washington\nElitist establishment Washington would you ever think would happen these people come up with their story they stick with it if it even if it means they're lying to themselves about it like for example if they if they get it in their heads everybody hates Trump and that hatred\nFor Trump has grown in and magnified over two years ... therefore there's going to be this massive\nTurnout among Democrats can't wait to vote energized and they get that in their heads and they believe it and then the exact opposite happens\nAnd they don't know what to do about it and they get\nNon plus and a little concerned about which is where\nThey are now\nAnd I've shared with you yesterday there's a there's a ... a lot of stories are about the blue wave not happening that it simply doesn't look like it is materialize and here is the Washington Post battleground house district remained close\nIn a new poll over here we got the cook report eight\nMore seats flip Democrats how many seats left to flip to ever have you listen to cook report every state's gone democratic by now\n\nAnd if you listen to Nate Silver eighty five eighty six percent chance the Republicans lose the house eighty six percent chance of Democrats when how does all this fit together\nWell it doesn't obviously\nIf Republican early voting is out distancing Democrat early voting and Democrats have always owned that\nSay gun control or abortion I'd be happy to talk about any of those subjects and so let's go back to the phones are actually we have John on both the liberal and conservative line or John you're on the time national show\nI don't care how many times you leave a message on my ... I'm just not going to I I'm not coming on your show I only going to crash a large important places where I can get faced [noise] well\nUm I guess that's the bad rap set up for the\nTom Daschle off um our\nThis is Tom Daschle will a liberal message on the radio\nI'm reaching out to America\nIf you have only one of our yes Liz\n... will seem like a year [noise]\nIs looking back it's Rush Limbaugh right the happier they excellence in broadcasting network where we meet and surpass audience expectations every day our telephone number if you want to join us ...\nI'm going to a two to eight eight to email address I'll rush ... S C I being that got us and yes I'm going to get to Obama in Nevada you know the the CNN graphic that's been running all day Trump spreads lives in stokes fear ahead of election\nI don't care what Donald Trump lives about mistakes are there is no body in Iraq Obama's league in terms of purposely lying\nTo deceive people such as you like your doctor you keep your doctor if you don't like your health plan you get to keep your health plan with\nObamacare your average annual premium will be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars\nThose lives were told over and over and over again to dupe on winning Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to essential Eby\nCost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they like their doctor in plan there wasn't going to be any change and we later found out of course we knew from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody he was\nLying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about\nSuch things so much hope was invested in Obama\nMisplaced as it turns out those lives again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant to deceive people\nThose lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's status takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives\nIf you control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you control them\nYou can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line at the doctor and this is exactly what Obama and the Democrats were doing it didn't get a single Republican vote did the media run\nBanner headlines Obama spreads lies and stokes fear to pass Obamacare [laughter]\nNo way how about the Benghazi disaster with Obama and Hillary lying for months\nThat have video produced by somebody nobody ever heard of cause the unrest that led to the riots and men gutsy knowing all along that it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\nThose are the lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protest himself\nAnd Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn fool decision how about the law is Obama told about drawing a red lines in Syria\nThe Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the polls in record numbers starting at the two thousands hadn't been germs\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody\nWhat would you think about it was great to government knew remember who started or remember\nWho and he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like he's gone to like you got to look up to him but you're you're so far beneath them you can't see you just look it up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where it is critical I'm going to strike for rock Obama according\nTo create these economic circumstances if his life depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe what has happened in the last two years was possible\nBut beyond that he did not want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf that if they stand aside and led government take care of things\nThis guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years\nAbout Obama colluding with Russia on getting rid of American nuclear weapons or an open Mike after the twenty ... right before the twenty twelve presidential election Obama's overheard\nTalking to ... number one the aid he says you tell Vladimir to be patient I'll have a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meaning I'm up to run again and so I'll be able to even get rid of more nukes in our stock pile then I could be for\nThe guy was just an auditor disaster that the American people quickly realized as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nThat it was okay to vote against\nThe interest of the first African American president than the country began its recovery\n\nThe American people when it came to voting for Obama they couldn't pull a trigger not do it but when it came to voting against Democrats they did it in droves every chance they got starting in two thousand Sam\nPut a picture up we've got a picture for even a digital camera going to send us up to Rush Limbaugh not can we have

does folks\nNot that every leftist hates America but the leftists either no right to alert or at ...\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a

in a viable Hi oh David Europe first today high\nI rushed thanks for taking my call Yes sir this morning I was listening\nTo NPR and Steve [laughter] hey a reference to the mall but he didn't want to call 'em all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then\nI take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality\nSaying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the border Johnson the stench of snow ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mark they used when I whenever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people when it's good for them but when it's like it when they want to use the humanitarian side\nIt's such a disaster but there's\nYou know thousands of people on the line went on they couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so ah your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's at great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to you that for that day listen to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for\nWhenever it means for them and that meant it they can [noise] that for\nWe've got a bad we got a a a a bad a connection here uh about the only time I've interested in NPR is when they run and pieces to translate what I've said\nUh for the audience and and that happens\nWhen I get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\nA but of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and ah [noise] ...\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day he was signing to leave and they\nJust they just they just they just human beings I guess it does have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted what are these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying we're talking about Trump being you know an SOB screwed Trump Trump simpler Trump's a Nazi this there's no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm\nA they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of deny the entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but that there is no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape\nOf what's this guy's Jorge way most are Ramos or whatever\nIt is it is what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell tell them no but what is it Univision right and he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob\nWhere packs of three and four or walking by and by the way\nFolks [laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you want to run into you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at I'm behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder and he's managing for\nHe's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that they're decent people and all they want is a better life and that we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how wouldn't work and this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him\nThat these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America bees\nAre beyond reproach and he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and it's doing everything he can to advocate for this lunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nBut to sit there and to try to vouch for eight thousand people have to tell his audience\nWho they all are and why we owe them and why we need to open our borders to them\nWas just silly and it just illustrated the political nature of this\nAnd the objective and the objective is to do great damage to the United states the objective here is harm to the United states and our people that's exactly what this caravans purpose is this is\nInnovation if there isn't a caravan you call it a mob if you want but is it has a full fledged invasion of what I like about it in one sense is that it\nIt is a microcosm of what's been going on every day for years people flooding the border getting in becoming illegal aliens in the process with no stopping them or\nWhen you mentioned stopping them all hell breaks loose and they make stick together but on the phones here Omaha

little uncomfortable and I didn't really care for how the media just plug every policy he wanted to push was the greatest thing since sliced bread and and now all of a sudden you know they're turning

going to be reminded by the media of all the things that the media wants them to be reminded of about how we're all Trump is\nAh we had something bad happened\nOn your connection right as you're making your point not short list is much lower ... why are they on hinged where they're going to be reminded that the media what\nWell every day when they when they the media is telling them every day how horrible Trump ism and that's their that's their uh their heads are at their soft ... so every day that reminded of the guy they hate us an office and all the bad things he's doing so well we were

is this about why in the world we're we're talking about a percentage of the population it's not even one percent here\nAnd yet it's become a this group of people has become a major major support group of the American the left and the American media for what purpose\n\nDefining janitors says the New York times as a condition determines strictly by a person's genitalia is based on a notion that doctors and scientists abandoned long ago as oversimplified and often medically\nMeaningless are you kidding me determining whether somebody is male or female determined by a person's genitals is old fashioned is no longer applicable\nAnd needs to be abandoned because it has been upended long ago by sensible scientists so this is the party of science or Democratic Party science consensus of scientists and so forth climate change\n\nResearchers who studied gender issues and provided health care to people who do not fit the typical male female pigeon holed said that the Trump administration's latest plan to define gender goes beyond the limits of scientific knowledge\nQuote\nDr Joshua was safer and in wrote endocrinologist and executive director of the center for transgender medicine and surgery at Mount Sinai health system in New York says the idea\nThat a person sex is determined by their anatomy at birth is simply not true and we've known that it's not true for decades\n[noise] so you have a baby and your baby has male genitalia but we've known for a long time that you're a baby is not male not necessarily\nThe same thing when you have a baby that has female genitalia but no it's not necessarily female as we've known this for decades\n\nAre anatomy does not say what it says\nSo then the New York times asked well then what does determine gender identity a person's powerful core knowledge of who they are is not so clear\nHere again is the doctor from\nMount Sinai in New York we know that there are a and there is a significant durable biological underpinning to gender identity what we don't know are all of the biological factors at play that explained gender identity\nAs far as we in the mainstream biological medical community understand it in two thousand Eighteen it is hard wired it is biological it is not entirely hormonal and we don't\nHave identified dean so we cannot specifically say that it is genetic\nGenetics plays a role in determining your a gender\nHas a in studies of twins\nIf one is transgender the other is far more likely to also be transgender if they're identical rather than fraternal identical twins are ... what is going on here\n\nAnatomy does not determine gender experts say a companion story here\nThat's also in the this is NBC News US President Donald Trump said Monday the transgender issues were in flux in that he aims to protect the country after a report that his administration was considering defining\nGender as male or female based on genitalia at birth and that drew widespread condemnation\n\nTrump's that we have a lot of different concepts right now a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now asked about a campaign promise to protect\nThe L G B. T. Q. humidity Trump said I'm protecting everybody I Want to protect our country under a proposal first reported by the New York times on Sunday the Trump Administration would narrow the definition of gender male or female at birth than it would be on changeable later in life\n[noise] okay\nYou're asking what's going on let me very simple eighth and yet very controversial Italy explain what's going on here\nThis is all politics\nPure and simple total politics disguised as something else the Democratic party has embraced\nAll of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities\nAnd is in the process of trying to normalize them all by in shrine ing them as policy planks or issues\nIn the Democratic party platform and this is how we we end up with people that represent two tenths of one percent of the population being given the whole\nWave of the Democratic party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which they otherwise vast majority can end up being bullied into submission\nI have\nHave long believed that\nI just didn't have a ... not stumbled across the correct way of expressing it but I finally did and I really do believe that\nThere are many psychological disorders out there that have been adopted by the Democratic party as political issues that are then used\nAs a as as\nThe joined the list of demands on government the government fix that government acknowledge that government or deal with other government funded a that government protect and this of course then turns the Democratic party coalition in to an even larger group of minorities\nBut it it conveys political issue status\nTo things that\nProbably have no business being involved in politics it's a way to further and this is that what we are the fundamental points by embracing all these various problems and and making them political issues it's another classic way\nOf bullying and forcing\nThings on a majority that you're trying to overthrow or unseat and you do it by characterizing them as insincere\nA on feeling as racist sex is they get home before or or what have you\n\nKnow this way the story I miss the headline fed to draft plan to discard Obama's transgender at the olive tree\nTrump's Justice Department will soon decide if agencies must follow biology when they document the legal sects of American women and girls and men and boys according to a document leaked to the New York times the policy would protect American civil rights\nFrom the trans gender idiotic gee which insists\nThat everybody has an FBI enforced federal right just switch their legal sex regardless of their biology when entering sports competitions K. through twelve bathrooms hospitals Jim showers the military or a single sex civic society groups the transgender any allergy\nWas promoted in two thousand sixteen by Obama as being imposed by many federal and state judges\nDespite visceral public opposition and scientists criticism so it's it's part and parcel of the left caps away by the Democrat Party to force\n\nWhat is by definition by simple numbers abnormal to force that on the rest of society and kind of for normalcy upon it and it is primarily to upset and to throw out of kilter\n\nWhat is considered normal or dissent has has been popularly understood by people through the ages it is an attack\n\nThat is focused on the values that were present at the founding of the country and have survived sense that continue to define America's exceptionalism and greatness all of this the transgender the allergy\nTransgender ... and the reason by transgender the algae has become a big thing is because the ideology behind political militant homosexuality has been successful there's not too much to fight over that got gay marriage they've got\nWho is paying for it Nancy Pelosi hot it was okay to fly friends and family and associates to Washington and to Copenhagen so that they could be near her honest mistakes happen all the time as Governor Paterson\nWho sent a couple a state troopers to\nDo a woman's house to deliver a hallmark card of sympathy and it was mistakenly\nUh caught up in the press has some ... [laughter] ... well I say all that to say this that honest mistakes are made every day by Democrats everywhere wants a few degrees then temperature either way cut me some slack\nJoin us next time as we once again save more rebel more junior [noise]\n\n\nLet me try this one more way why is trans gender stuff in the news anyway\nOaks normalizing psychosis is what the modern day in Democratic Party has been about what what is what is more fitting proof of what we have been saying\nHow about how the Democrats agenda is driven by people with mental disorders and and uh when I say this I said this with\nAll compassion towards people with mental disorders the Democrat Party is converting those mental disorders and really lying to these people they're converting these mental disorders which needs to be treated\nBy professionals are converting them into political issues they're whipping up a bunch of anger\nAnd they're convincing these people that the mental disorder is really the result of Republican conservative mistreatment and lack of government sympathy and so they're going to get even with people are going to get whatever is troubling people fits that are going to punish people who are responsible for it\nThe Democrats used cabin on the whip up the women's vote\nThe Democrats think that every one of their voter groups can be whipped up into action by pointing out the mistreatment of conservatives Republicans or what have you\nThey are using immigration and this caravan mob to whip up the Hispanic vote because they can see that Hispanic voter approval for Trump is skyrocketing\nThey are using the ... story to try to whip up the Muslim and Middle Eastern votes and of course the journalist vote which they don't have to do much whipping up there because they own the journalist boat but all of these issues are being used to focus hatred on Donald Trump\nAnd to try to convince people that Trump is responsible for all of these things and a half people so upset and so angry and now they're using transgender to whip up the gay boat and and other related people in the Democratic party who are running around thinking but life is filled with nothing but unfair discrimination\nYou just you wait let's see you wait till the first male conservative Republican candidate decides to self identify as a woman\nTo get votes and let's see how tolerant the drive by media and the rest of the Democrats are when a transgender conservative pops up if such thing\nWould happen [noise]\nYou just wait and see what kind of tolerance for just like there's tolerance for black conservatives and there's tolerance for females who are not feminists that you know how that works out and there is not any tolerance for homosexuals who are not part of a leftist\nMeant if you will [noise] by the way my pants [noise]\nSays that the Honduran president told him that Venezuela is funding this mob say Breitbart story vice president Mike Pence that ice other Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez told him that the migrant mob marching toward the U.S Mexico border is financed by Venezuela [noise]\nNot I've got serious quite Venezuelans have any money but I take that back\nI take that back the Venezuelan government it's Michael sorry [laughter] [noise] it's the Venezuelan people that don't have anything because their government has ... all my bad Venezuela couldn't be funding this\nNow has made the allegation while defending Trump's assertion that middle Easterners make up part of why by the white why is have you noticed that Dr buys are outraged by that Trump is saying that there's some Middle East there are some middle Easterners and his care of and they've been identified we've got people down there invented in this thing\nThere are people from all over the place in this caravan they're not just from Honduras Guatemala and they're not just Hispanic or Latino but why get mad about that\nWhat what what's the point to me there's middle Easterners or why wasn't why does the median go bad crazy trying to deny that what's wrong with middle Easterners being in a caravan to destroy us immigration system\n\nHas made this allegation while defending Trump's assertion in an interview with Robert Costa of the Washington Post Pence said it's inconceivable\nThat there are not people admitted Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than seven thousand people advancing toward the border\nIn the last fiscal year we apprehended more than ten terrorists and suspected terrorists with our southern border from countries referred to end the lexicon as other than my uncle that means from the middle east region vice president\nRevealed that her name just told him the leftist groups from Venezuela organized the caravan financed by Venezuela
