and data rates may apply call star star three to four\nDonald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this is an organized bought and paid for invasion and it's growing so obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here\nVery close to the election and for Trump just sick ice on them and the border patrol on them and to deny them entry or to separate the children from the adult\nSo that's a drive by media can then kick into gear with stories that are already ...\nThat are all ready taped\nInterviews with people on the caravan all ready in the can where these people will say they're shocked they came to America to save their lives were their children and to improve their latest they won't let the man is is unlike anything they ever heard about the cuts of pictures of Trump smiling\nAs people are denied entry Democrats think\nThis\nYou know I I Would think that if somebody politically did this would be a conservative group might do this\nTo promote Republican turnout\nThat we don't have anybody on our side who thinks that way but it makes more sense that way or am I missing something somehow a massive group of four thousand people growing including kids\nMarching toward the United states with no attempt just making patently obvious what it is is your nine people fleeing anything

it's planned this morning paper somehow this is supposed to end up making the United states look bad\n\nI'm I'm not ... that's the way these people are figuring it going to play out now we have the mother report\nThat\nWill not be released before the election what we're being told that it is nearing completion and that it is ready to go I went through yesterday what the what the hope here is uh the hope here\nIs to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative\nAnd to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof being released\nWhether we can't do it before the election because of regulations and this is something we're not going to influence the outcome of elections but Muller is ready to go at once in a while I've been doing well Mueller has been looking for

opposite\nLoving ... prosecutors want to define they clearly avoided looking for the real criminal activity but here's her next line is President Trump hold all the cards right now\nAnd here's why\nThe White House has seen enough of the actual documents to know the real conspirators were willing to destroy the constitution and the innocent lives to elect Hillary Clinton protect Iraq Obama and destroyed Donald Trump\nAs Congressman John Ratcliffe explained to Maria but Jerome all these documents were classified only to protect the wrong doors not national security\n\nIndeed each time documents have been on redacted we've seen even more evidence of agree just wrong doing now for the country to recover from this previously unfathomable cover up of Clinton's crimes and the criminalization of our entire election process justice system\nEvery person whose fingerprints appear on any of these crimes must be publicly exposed and held to account the deliberate and subversive conduct of all these people involved were not only crimes against Trump\nLabor crimes against the constitution of crimes against law enforcement\nCrimes against federal courts crimes against every American and crimes against the rule of law writ large and that is why she's advocating again\nHere for Trump to declassify every one of these documents for the sake of the American people\nSmall

went through this the other day but I Am continuing to see this is what makes me suspicious of this story folks you know I read my tech blog news\nI read everything\nThere are still people attempting\nVia they're reporting\nTo suggest that there was a recording of the murder of ... from his apple watch\nMy friend's ... this\nIs item number one that aroused says my suspicion about this there's even a tech blog ...\nOut there called apple insider this tech blog has been misappropriated as a source for this in certain on Google searches they have run a piece of apple insider denying any\nRelation any any complicity in this story so\nWhoever is behind this idea that the murder and the conversations that took place prior to it and during it were recorded by the show is apple watch and are now somewhere on iCloud\nA\n... when you find out that a tech blog that has a famous name has been this appropriated\n\nAnd has been falsely accused of reporting this in order to give it legitimacy in certain Google searches then I started to question a lot of things about this story\nNot very briefly here's why the the apple watch angle this doesn't work\nI Know that most of you don't have apple watches and let me just briefly explain to you how they work there are three ways that an apple watch can receive and transmit data\nAnd the biggest one the one with the longest range the one that is most capable is not even available in Turkey and that is el he or cellular signals two years ago\nWhen apple in well actually uh fourteen months when apple introduced the series three watch they activated L T E cellular service which for the first time made the watch independent of the phone\nYou could\nTake it out of work out you can do anything you can take it away from the phone and have it operate it would still get emails and messages and they're recording your workout data and so forth if you could receive a self said we didn't need your phone nearby\nSo it was the first time that the the watch\nFailed to do that just ceased to be a slave to the phone\nThe other two ways or blow to and why those are the three ways\nThat day they can get to watch and David can leave a watch\nYou take out he\nOut of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey and there there there's no watch\nNo apple watching the world and that it's an apple watched they claim he was wearing\nThe story is that his fiance has his phone out in the car in the parking lot at the consulate there was only one way that watch could communicate with that phone while there's two ways there'd be why and\nBlow to blow to if you have to blow to this week by design it doesn't have much rain sixty feet max\nYou get into an embassy the shielding the ... are the protections against other nations being able\nTo monitor and over here and steal signal there's no way that the Bluetooth component of a watch\nWould be able to permeate the protection of than an embassy would have to protect itself from just that there's ... ... that couldn't happen so the only other way would be why\nBut that one only work if\nThe wife fine network password of the embassy or consulate had been answered\nAnd the wife I connection on work\nJust because the phone connects to why when the phone does the watch automatically comebacks but not the wife I can next to the phone it's a slave to the phones now if the watch knows why fi network because of the phone it's parents who uses it then like if you're at home or your ... your your phone is\nInside you have to go outside to walk the dogs\nYou'll come back to the wife I network on your property even if your phones out of range if you've entered the password to the wife I network on your watch as well as on your phone I just don't think she'll be did that he was probably noted that would um I don't\nKnow that they would give them the password how'd he get the password of the Saudi Saudi constantly wife I Know the idea that that watch\nWas recording whatever happened to your show and then somehow transmitted up the cloud is\nJust so outside the realm of possibility has to be next to impossible and yet somebody is still pushing this there are still\nPushing that that recording exist that it's somewhere in why fire iCloud into Turkish\nOfficials are doing everything they can to listen to it and make decisions and the sharing of the United states\nIf there is a recording of this I'm not denying that the that could've easily been a recording that the that the Saudis made themselves but not from ... watch that just it I don't see how\nIn the world given the technological limitations\nThat could be but they continue to push that now the balance of this story is being used to tarnish\nPresident Trump but I'll tell you how successful it is I'll tell you it's an ...

that train of thought going or whatever [noise]\nSo I Want to show you something a little cam I got an email here this is about yard signs you know what I've been hearing\nIs that people all over the country are afraid to put yard signs out because literally afraid of leftist knobs\nComing to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses and so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs I remember we had a call here I just maybe three weeks ago now from a caller who said Russia I'm worried I'm not seeing any yard signs\nWe saw Trump yard signs everywhere in two thousand six you know I'm not seeing any yard signs at all\nI said well that camp that camp that looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist\nThe hell out of a lot of people and if that frightened also\nIncludes scaring them not to go vote\nThere are a lot of people scared to death with these maniacs and that's\nWhy yard signs and are being put out I I just part of me understands it another part of me she's afraid of the yard signs are you kidding [laughter] from the country that stormed the beaches of Normandy we're afraid of a yard sign\nBlocked it's a different era and these people on the left or crazed or making\nDoing good job of making themselves look that way so I have a video taken by it tend crew was worker I Can't I'm

I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help the Democrats get votes\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand illegal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\nRight before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying for this somebody\nThey have to eat they have to be drinking things they've got to be using facilities somebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used here\nI guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who\nThinks that this caravan arriving within a week say\nOf the mid term election date helps Democrats by itself how does this help that this is what got Donald Trump elected\nThis is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion at the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop so what's the calculation\nHere where we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be that there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on attracting it's gotta be somebody gets sick\nThere has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody um this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incidents of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse and maybe start invite Trump law enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if that's the that's the game plan but I'm struggling to see\nOther than just the general chaos it's creating and maybe the Democrats things that people want to stop this chaos into this chaos is only because of the Trump the Trump weren't there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\n\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this\nWhite they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp Lennie head back to the phones got time to work some in here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in and this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waiting so you're up next\nThat afternoon rush\nAs for the Hannity interviewed I'm sure being broadcast professionally knocked it out of the park\nUm if you lived in ... and just a second I'd like to say I love it to my wife Kym who's always told me to call you I should call your call you will finally I got through rush my my point is all these illegals coming up from South America nobody's talking about the fact of the diseases they bring along with them if they're not immunized\nAnd if you've been low reform reports recently yeah the new diseases out called little not a new disease is a disease out this has an outfit called ... town and it's a polio like oh yeah it's disabling and also killing American\nChildren back twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen I was out free ... let me say that the CDC right as of now has not said they're not sure where it came from\nYeah twenty fourteen twenty sixteen we had a similar outbreak yeah\nAnd I'm hiding a tough time finding the leaks out of the Internet because it's just if you get the scrubbed but on January fourth of twenty six key on a website called natural news the headline read and Carol virus the sixty eight linked to illegal immigration behind fatal polio like illness killing America's Choice\nRight right right now\nThe CDC is not coming out and people aren't coming out because it leads to much crazy to Trump's call for a while if somebody was actually telling the truth and the drive by needed don't you think that this would have some effect on those moms with small children [noise]\nUh\nYeah I Do I this is another really good point the news it's it's amazing how these things remain isolated we are here in the midst of an invasion of people\nFrom various backgrounds various countries in Central America and South America\nAnd just independently and some days separation of park there's a story of a shockingly unforeseen increase any polio cases in the United states\nAnd the stories feature medical professionals who are stumped they can't figure out why this was happening\nThey they they can't they can't even make educated guesses as to what might be the origins of this\nAnd then a couple of days go by and there's another story of a mass numbers of people from various parts of the country a world South America Central America there's no question these things are related well I said there's no question common sense tells you there's\nA relationship here but you're you're absolutely right there cannot be any official ... ...\nYou have the CDC or anybody else establishments the fact that the new cases of polio or other diseases that we have previously Georgia stamped out and now they're showing up again if there were ever official linkage to undocumented people arriving ... wow\nI Can't have that camp have that at all so\nThe connection isn't made its left for people to conclude themselves if they\nIf they do but you see it goes even beyond that I remember one\nOf the things I mentioned the Hannity today he he was reciting all of the economic improvements statistically and other things\nThat have happened during the Trump presidency and\nAt some point toward the end of I stopped him and I said you know you're going to realize something though that there's an entire political\nParty to whom the news you just mentioned is bad\nIt makes them and they're angry about it they're trying to suppress this they\nThey're not happy with good economic news they're not happy that people's lives are improving they're not happy that there are jobs go or to choose from they're not happy that wages are going up that people are getting bonuses they are not happy\nThat more people are working and if they're not happy the economy\nIs growing to the point of um storming all the new people that want jobs so why in fat who in the world could be unhappy by this who could be made unhappy by this the answer is very clear I don't want to give it away but I told him that I think\nWhatever arguments we're having here they are still all circling and focused on the age old argument between conservative and liberalism and that is the role of government and people's lives\nAnd the answer to why people on the left are unhappy at great economic news is because they can't claim credit for it and it threatens their whole existence where in people are not capable of this and need to vote Democrat to basically live\nThey need to vote Democrat need to continue to vote Democrat because only the government can provide for people only the government can protect people against injustice discrimination and so\nAs as looney tunes as a as the Democratic party is getting and as they have incorporated more and more psychological disorders that people have and now are turning those disorders into political causes\nThat then demand the government fix we have an impossible situation the government cannot fix psychological disorders the government's not responsible for fixing all of these\nThose companies and we're proud of in West Virginia and it's a company that I Know\nYou weren't too Joe Manchin has received nearly three hundred thousand dollars in campaign cash from my mind and that's just the start mentions

A. and then tried to convert it into legitimate intelligence to get by the warrants to spy on Trump expecting honesty out of this bunch\nYou know we don't expect honesty and the reason ... she needs the Democratic party to back up reports\nMother does mother needs Democrats back back up these reports meaning they if they win the majority of my house that make it back up a report exactly what what otherwise but what if they don't win the Senate one for Republicans hold the Senate and even gain ground there\nWell he just he just can't release anything here that way because there is no evidence and if the Democrats somehow when the house he he's got to have a report that's going to be ... to the president if they don't we won't hear much on them all\nI look I I understand your thinking on this\nBut I think the reports going to be scaling regardless\nAnd I think it's going to be gay thing in terms of the judge mental\nInnuendo [noise] I don't believe that will be any evidence of collusion because we know that it didn't happen\nWe know that liberal writers one writer spent two years the past two years researching a book he wanted to be first out of the box with a book\nBefore them on a report detailing the collusion he hasn't found a shred of evidence in two years the report is\nGoing to castigate Trump's personality it's going to castigate his staffing decisions it is going to talk about how Trump's infant tile immaturity and the lack\nOf intelligence and experience has exposed the United states so they're very kind of collusion mother was investigating but didn't fine but even though we didn't find any Trump has made it much more likely and much more easy for anybody to that's the kind of stuff\nThat's going to be an regardless who wins regardless Republicans or Democrats all the house this report is going\nWhen's the last time you ever heard of a special counsel for anything at the end of the investigation riding along reports saying nothing to see here folks we've looked at every day for two years we haven't found diddly squat there has yet to be such a report written\nHe's gonna have to justify what he did he's going to have to feed the beast when this was all over Mahler wants to be the continued star of the establishment you've got to excoriated Trump\nAnd he can do it\nEven with out alleging actual criminal act I just saw a tire on graphic up there on CNN and it was about vice president bite me any sounds they're saying that he doesn't want Trump impeached too soon\nWe need to take our time impeaching Trump by\n\nThis is all predicated of course on the fact that the Democrats are going to win\nThe house and I guess the Senate because if the Republicans hold the Senate there's never going to be any impeachment or conviction ... billion page so Biden's thinking they're going to win at all and uh he is and we got a whole lot we don't want to impeach him too soon\nIt's kinda like in a football game and you're driving to either tied the score or go ahead by two or three points you don't want to score too soon you don't want to give the other team too much time to come back and kick a field goal it can be I guess that's what made me as a suggesting here\nJim in homes Dale, Pennsylvania welcome I'm Glad you called sir high", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "18"}
