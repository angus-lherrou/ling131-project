most amazing thing and this story is another great illustration of the divide that exist between same an insane in this country\nAnd how the people on the insane side had literally no sense of humor have none no perception what\nSo ever of humor\n\nHillary Clinton fired back at President Trump yesterday after reclaimed today earlier that Clinton had engaged in a conspiracy with Russia during Wednesday nights campaign rally in Pennsylvania Trump\nTold the crowd there had been collusion he said well if you look at it when you think of it there was no collusion between Hillary and the Democrats in Russia there was collusion there was a lot of collusion with Russia and lots of other people by the way\nAnd he's right what he's talking about here is the Clinton campaign of Democratic National committee hired fusion GPS founded by Glenn Simpson who's refusing subpoenaed to testify to Congress claiming the Fifth Amendment\nFusion GPS took the money from the Clinton campaign the DNC\nAnd went to a law firm cut out called Perkins call wave this was done to make Hillary and the DNC is money to look like they were buying a legal advice and campaign advice but the law firms then funnel money\nAfter laundering it through Christopher Steele and he then went out and created this lying stinking phony dot CA\nThe one that has the story that Trump hired a bunch of prostitutes in Moscow to urinate on a bad ... that had been slept in Bible rock Hussein all and Michelle my bell\nOh\nThe ... is is not a single bit of it as ever been corroborated like balls he poured story\nNot a single bit of corroborate ... no evidence whatsoever and yet that dot CA was used to get a finds a warrant the spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd that dot CA is what kicked off in truth ... special counsel investigation to try to find collusion between Trump and Russia to many of his old news but that's what Trump's were loaded into and Trump does exactly right the collusion here between anybody in Russia is the Hillary Clinton campaign the DNC\nAnd the route is Hillary Clinton DNC to I'm a fusion\nGPS then under Perkins collie and then to steal from the money's still got went through a bunch of different layers before he got it but they essentially commissioned an opposition research hit piece on Trump that they tried to celebrate but it was legitimate entails Trump's more to miss out\nHe'll rate goes bananas she\nCan't believe the truth is being told about her she can't believe it they can't let this day and so she has to\nTrump is the guy that asked the rushes to heck we he did it on national TV Trump is the guy that he would and they have tried to make this case\nIt's the funniest thing in the world Trump was down in Miami of his resort down there to route and this was in a period of time where Hillary's emails never sixty thousand a total on her server\nAnd she told that that were legal or illegal server private server private address while she ... state\nThis was discovered new and it was Hillary was told you had to turn some of those over ... well half of these are personal and their nobody's business there about Chelsea's wedding reception and her registry and yeah\nThe lessons at all that so I'm not going to let you see those she turned over thirty thousand do investigators leaving thirty thousand still unseen she tried to tell everybody neighbor to lead\nThis caused a frenzy in the media and elsewhere to try to find them and the media kept making a big deal out of it and a lot of other people were too so Trump decided to have a little fun\nIn the middle of the news cycle where Hillary's missing thirty thousand emails were prominently disgust Trump said hey Russia Russia if you're listening maybe you can find Hillary's missing emails and then you can tell us media they might be very interested although I doubt\nThat moment that I\nI'm laughing myself silly when I hear on this is it that is my favorite kind of humor this Ramadan right down their faces and making satire out of what they do this is this is their Dan serious about Trump is mocking him and laughing out they converted this\nEnds with Donald Trump\nOpenly asking the Russians to hack Hillary's server and they tried to say that that was evidence of Trump collusion with Russia and Trump was simply doing what Trump does he was laughing at them at\nThe futility that none of the greatest investigative agencies in America can find Hillary's emails the media could not find Hillary's emails the best investigators but nosy as people and nobody can Trump didn't believe nobody could find them Trump believes everybody was shielding them in protecting Hillary\nSo he said hey Russia maybe you can find them none of our people seem to know where they are maybe you jewelry is still look like this\nYou asked Russia hacked me on national TV\nShe went to Twitter to make that point and Trump did no such thing if anybody would even the slightest sense of humor would realize\nHe was making a blindingly obvious when he said the news media\nWhat reward Russia for finding Hillary's emails before Trump quote is Russia if you're listening I Hope you're able to find the thirty thousand emails that are missing I think you'll probably be rewarded mightily by our press was being sarcastic because everybody was trying to hide those emails because there's no doubt they

John Harris is one of the founders of political used to be the Washington Post\nMe and so these are you know these are not chump change obscure wacko ... well they may be that but I mean they're not they're widely no they're they're highly respected right in the mainstream of left wing activist journals\nAnd they had in mind that this story Trump may not be crazy but the rest of us are getting their fast\n\nI I I don't know where to start with this I mean even the first the first line here CNN before lovemaking is not his idea of a turn on\nBut she can hardly turn it off in gross that she is in the latest unnerving gyrations of Washington so obviously these are psychologist stories psychologist couches are filling up as Americans seek relief from Trump anxiety disorder that's the ... I\nI don't believe this for a minute\nThink this may be the case in Washington it certainly will be the case the Upper West side and probably in a lot of Hollywood but nationwide people are not seeing shrinks to deal with Trump anxiety disorder but yet this guy these two people think well all of America is if it's happening in Washington or New York and it's happening everywhere\n\nSo a psychologist tail here CNN before lovemaking not his idea of a turn on but his wife she can't turn CNN off\nSo engrossed\nIn the latest unnerving gyrations of Washington who else to blame for this but Donald Trump the president who excites hot feelings in many quarters\nHas cooled them considerably in the bed rule ... above Philadelphia ... so you got people who are going to psychiatry now blaming Trump for the fact that they both gone frigid\n\nBlaming Trump for the fact that they have lost interest in sex lovemaking quite as however you refer to it so there's still do if you're a couple of sought counseling\nIn part because the agitated state of American politics was causing strain in their marriage\nThe couple story was related to political by their therapist on condition of anonymity\nBut they're travails according to national surveys in interviews with mental health professionals are not as an anomalous as one might suppose though no\nEven when the symptoms are not sexual in nature and there is a London evidence that Trump and his daily upper ours are galloping into the inner life of American\nI'm telling you these people are bonkers\nNow we've known this on the fringes you know John Kerry would lose the election and down here in South Florida a enterprising psychologists was open temporary offices\nUh advertising if you're if you're suffering from Bush arrangement syndrome please come see us after John Kerry lost in two thousand form and this kind of stuff has been\nYou know since Florida to a thousand it's been somewhat common here but it's it's reaching new heights new lows empirical\nData bolsters the anecdotal reports from practitioners the American Psychiatric Association and I'm a survey\nFound it thirty nine percent of people said their anxiety level have risen over the previous year fifty six percent were either extremely anxious or somewhat anxious about the impact of politics on daily life uh twenty Seventeen study found that two thirds of Americans the the nation's future\nAs a very or somewhat significant source\nOf stress\nOr more plausible interpretation for all of this in the view of some psychological experts is that Trump has been cultivating adapting and prospering from his distinctive brand of provocation brinksmanship and self drama\nFor the past Seventy two years what we're seeing is merely the president's own definition of normal\nIt's only the audience who finds the performance disorienting and what words Trump's not crazy about the rest of us are getting their fast\nAnd people are going to psychiatry and paying money to be told this week tone Trump is driving them crazy\nHe literally is causing and they'll lose their sanity you thought I'd been joking or the exaggerating about this and I'm not we're dealing with people\nWho are genuinely on here and\nThey haven't gotten over the fact that Trump won they can't get over the fact that they're people can't get rid of Trump the intelligence agencies the FBI that the OJ the deep state powerful people in Washington the Democrat Party\nOver liable as like Dianne Feinstein Chuck Schumer can't lay a glove on Trump and there beside themselves getting rid of Republicans has never been as hard\n\nTrump signed legislation to clean up millions of tons of garbage from the world's oceans Obama didn't do as\nPresident Donald Trump added his signature till the save our sees act on Thursday green lighting and initiative to clean up eight million tons of data Bree from the planets oceans\nSponsored by Alaska Republican senator Dan Sullivan the bill aims to promote better domestic millennials are going to go nuts over this\nThis is the big deal to them or as a big deal this is a stain the ability of their life providing and supporting planet and Obama didn't do it from doing it they're going to be so conflicted\nThey want to applaud this they want to support this may want to thank Trump for doing this\nBut they just can't think Trump oh my God I'm telling you it's funny to watch this and it's funny parts of it are dangerous too because we're not talking about\nPeople in the fringe we're talking about a whole lot\nOf mainstream Democrats who are losing their minds here and the number\nIs growing exponentially back to the phones Paula in wiping jurors falls New York it's great the way that you waited thank you and

people coming into the office falling apart because of Trump it's just not really happening sometimes it gets mentioned in passing but but um it's not really happening and when people mention anything that triggers a stress response it really isn't the\nThe stress or that's the problem it's helping people to manage their own ability to deal with stress because they could they could have problems

left hopes that this is a\nTraditional here party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls would say that's exactly what's going to happen then you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope\nThey're reporting hoping hoping that reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to\nTell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities or reading of certain theatres it's God's nails\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ...\nMurders in Philadelphia got away with a wand and murder of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys now\nWhat's the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought of and\nCategorized as something other than what it is the media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much\nThere have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the like and Marcy on hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and sixty\nDifferent articles so the trick has been how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in\nMovie equals Hollywood how do you get stars I think people will start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made then how do you get a distributed then how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits of thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine\nBut they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of karma guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime and the cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating a PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of\nHardly any abhorrent Gore and\nViolence in the movie it's [noise] it's depicted in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is\nA movie\nIn a responsible way to do things in movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe informed it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can't avoid the politics but\nIt is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murder\nHe was a mass murderer of people in the womb that nobody on the\nLeft wanted anybody to know about what he did ... guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even and his trial it was said that he was\nCharming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy directed this and I don't know anything about directing movies\nBut I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie a target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered but you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that and so the\nWay I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just eat let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up the story\nItself has all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the\nLeft abortion is not even human and some Bible tissue mass or what have you uh it's got\nStars people that you know people who put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies\nBut identified with is dean Cain is one of the uh the actor who plays\nA guy's now himself as a as an actor and I think ... commercials name is Earl Billings and for somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one\nHeck of a job it's probably the finest\nRole that he's played for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess a as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to it's PG Thirteen we're not talking ... we're not we're not even talking ours here so you're not\nGonna be immersed in a bunch of\nRepulsive Gore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell the story the story itself hell's itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have\nPut everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made a lot of people to put their careers in the line of agreeing to appear and start even Searcy a directing\nThe film [noise] ah\nI've ... I it it it's it's powerfully done and it opens tonight and if if you don't know about ... now if you're not heard the name of it doesn't ring a bell you by all means should say this if you do know who guys mail is and if you think you know the story\nYou should see this\nAnd it's also good which as I say it follows a procedural format\nSo you're you're not watching a political documentary here you're watching a movie portrayal of a real life and ... and it's treated as a real life about as any other would be without a lot of political preaching\n\nBecause it's felt it's not necessary and it isn't the story itself has\nHeart stopping enough as it is so guys now the trial of America's biggest serial killer opening today they've had they've had a red carpet premieres and so forth and\nPeople who have seen it our our raving about it just so you know brief time out we'll be back and continue after\nYou in law worked at a mainstream American media just gold rush but he I be men were\nTwo weeks only left to get the Ginia cell sunspot correct or free or sunspots eight spots and even reading blamed patches\nI loved the junior cell sunspot correct or it's like go to product every day\nI have sun spots at eight spots and\nCan see a definite difference in my skin's and using it that's Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Ginia cell sunspot correct or and for the next two weeks only you can still get this sunspot miracle free but time is running out watch your sunspot Spanish and your bags and puffing is gone tamper\nResults in as little as twelve hours the genius el immediate effects is also yours free\nBuilt a genius L. dot com now or call eight hundred eight two to five nine four one still thinking about it we'll order this weekend receive Germany's a luxury micro Durham abrasion also free\nReached Juba Natan unplug poor sport instantly radiate baby soft skin and these two weeks shipping is also free called eight hundred eight two to five nine for one or go to genius L. dot com that's the genius L. dot com genius L. dot com\nTonight ten nine central on ABC finish the sentence for millennia Trump is the first\nLady the interview ten women in the me too movement call you a supporter of no question this is off limits you're not the first first lady to have to deal with her husband's alleged infidelity has just put a strain on your marriage tonight what Romani to Trump's say let's talk about the jacket this why did you wear being ...
