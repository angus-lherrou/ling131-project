make everybody think right off the bat\nThat some Tea Party or did it or some talk radio fan did it or some Fox News viewer did it turns out it's never ever the case not one of these bombs went off\nAnd if a democratic operatives purpose here is to make it look like hey you know there are mobs everywhere to the moms are not just Democrats mobs I mean look at this you got people here trying

with events like this happen I always wonder what the ah reaction is going to be from people who are actively engaged in in these events each and every day and informed about them and the reaction gives me a gives me great solace and comfort because your reaction is pure commonsense\nIf somebody really wanted to hurt somebody with a bomb there's ways to do it this is not how you do at this

Wondering and I don't know if we'll ever know this what is bombs intended to be discovered in screening\nAnd if you\nYou want to send a bomb and you want to get coverage on it but you don't want anything to happen you do it so I guess discovered but the bombs a bomb and up the postal service discovers that bond that has the address Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton rock Obama on it you know\nIt it's going to make news I I like the Sacramento airport they've got that sign out there and it it's a it's a ... it's a bomb but a few is coming out of it\nLike a World War two or civil war cannonball with a few is coming out of it with a line wrong through it telling everybody bombs are not allowed was there one of those stickers on these pipe bombs\nWarning wash your hands and fingers danger hazard as voltage inside but what they were discovered we're now told by the way that in addition to Debbie lab or mouth shoals that Eric Holder was\nSent a specific suspicious package\nEric Holder\nWell now that he was just in the news it was just in the news is telling Democrats that this is all bogus that we engage them civil late\nIf they hit us we capture him he said or something something like that post office X\nRays all packages for bombs this is very well known\nSo whoever did this is either an idiot or wanted to be caught 'cause yeah if these are real\nWhoever whoever is

have a dangerous dreams right winger out there putting\nThese bombs in the mail you know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be run by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYeah that that information it's just not out there for the masses to obtain you know quite being there was never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right away to point fingers and certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't stoop to everything from they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and muggy video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't stoop to something that's whoa it tell\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way\nIt doesn't make any sense\nFor a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\n\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip\nThat flip that around\nWould you make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because\nThings are not working out the way they thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's the that's attached to this\nThis is not going the way they have a short us for the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls or tell them is a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their hands and they believe it then they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like think Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border vi\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the sweet here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously have set up as a wedge issue\nIt is time for the Democrats the step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose [noise]\nThere's a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here\nYou Democrats have got to stop posing Trump just do opposed Trump\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and paid for this if that if that's true\nThen Venezuela also means Iran and the ... smokes\nA lot of people on our side have jumped St George Soros yeah maybe but if Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying as Venezuela if its\nIt's ... it's also Iran and the ... regardless we had this mob of people\nStorming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates didn't let those people and for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not where the American people are right now\nThe only commonsense nickel thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they were in favor of it they are that demands that what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore ... he is saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security that's doesn't help us\nA mob of seven thousand ten thousand people starving to gauge demanding to be let in that doesn't help us
