R. FM\nSunday confirmation Paula\nThe nation but what are you going to drop out rate the when I was a\nTremendous victory for our nation\nAfter angry testimony this whole week effort has been in the morning just ready to get angry debate this system on at the\nGym [noise] not anger at the FBI investigation\nThat's an investigation [noise]\nWhat effect will this nasty battle have on the poor the Senate and the November election joining me this morning Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and democratic Senator Chris\nOf Delaware was the capital bike and me to\nJoined the Marines I was on\nNBC News the Capitol Hill going against the Republican strategist\nDanielle one of the American Enterprise Institute and NBC News presidential historian Michael Beschloss woke up this Sunday kids meet the press\nGood Sunday morning in a in a closely divided country elected they closely divided Senate which took it closely divided vote that is left the country you're just a closely divided\nBut Kavanaugh is confirmed by the Senate fifty to forty eight like yesterday and sworn in later after the closest Supreme Court boats in Stanley math you of course remember him he was confirmed in Eighteen eighty one\nThe book came after an ugly confirmation battle that pitted Republicans against Democrats men against when the accused against the accuser and Trump loyalists against Trump detractors and do the confirmation fight is over the bitterness and mutual resentment it created is likely to winter\nAnd so are the questions were like what Kavanaugh's confirmation green an even bigger blue way than anticipated among Democrats will the attempt to derail the nomination backfire generating Republican come back\nTo the Supreme Court's legitimately be permanently damage by the manner in which capital made it across the finish line and by his behavior at that Senate hearing last week\nAnd we'll cabin I'll find themselves to target a future investigations of Democrats to win back control of Congress\nAnd the other was a ... week for just one person\nPresident Trump but almost everything that everyone else involved in this episode is worse off than before the Supreme Court United States Senate wrecked capital\nWon't want to wait a minute the we have never had a requirement of the practice has always been the judicial nominations were approved by fifty one votes there's never been a Supreme Court justice who had to get sixty votes with the exception of Abe Fortas even Clarence Thomas\nWas fifty two to forty Chuck Schumer was the one under George W Bush who insisted that George Bush's nominees get sixty votes\nR. I. A. so obviously and I was at the age I but I Do know is the one who say they're never had one of the store though the sixty votes threshold to end debate which would force more consensus nominee no\nNot for nominations because we never had that we are another example of federal district judges in the history the United States Senate\nNo federal district judge has ever been denied his or her seat by sixty votes requirement they've all been majority vote and I I Know because with Mitch McConnell wanted to do that once and I stopped him by getting another enough Republicans to do\nYou think that what's the unintended consequences of the judiciary that is Fifteen that is made up of judges that were confirmed fifty one forty nine depending on which\nAre well if you consider the United states of America is a success then that's the right way to do it because ever since we've had the United States Senate with Thomas Jefferson judges have been approved by fifty one votes remember Clarence Thomas was fifty to two forty eight you could have required sixty votes but no one ever did\nCenter Alexander I'm gonna leave it there for ... thank you to deceive\nJoining me now from Wilmington for perspective from the other side is democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware senator Coontz welcome back to me the presser\nThank you check good to be on with you again I'm this morning Brett Kavanaugh as associate justice of the Supreme Court Democrats made a lot of arguments against him to try to stop and it was an election year the committee process was flawed his record was outside the mainstream he lied under oath credible allegation of sexual misconduct by\nThe Democrats lose all of those arguments\nWell frankly I felt like this process was unfair from the very outset of the way that we were prevented from seeing literally millions of pages of judge Kavanaugh's record from his service in the Bush administration um\nIt's the foothills of the preposterous it's going to end up being a memorable phrase I I Do think that um he's correct that there was a widespread a response or certainly on the Republican side that these were not credible allegations\nUm I tried to focus my questioning of judge Kavanaugh on issues that were directly related uh first to his judicial philosophy his extreme views on presidential power and individual liberty and ways in which I'm convinced till overturned Justice Kennedy's most important recent decisions\nUh and then to focus on issues that fitness and candor um so I Do think what was important about the last few weeks was trying to find a bipartisan focus on facts and the larger question Chuck here is you know how do we move forward how do we heal the divisions in the Senate\nSo I take it if you're talking that way that the house Democrats that are talking about re investigating calving off they get control of the house possibly looking at impeachment uh what do you make of those pledges coming from some House Democrats\nI I think that's premature I think you know frankly we are just less than a month away from an election of folks who feel very strongly a one way or the other about the issues in front of us should get out and vote and participate um there's only ever been one justice that's been impeached and I think talking about it at this point\nI'm isn't necessarily healing us in moving forward okay a check to send its role in our in our politics is not to just reflect the country but to help heal and leave the country and that's the course we should be on\nAll right senator Coons Democrat from Delaware thanks for coming up sharing your means as well thank you ... when we come back is there\nAny way to heal the wounds from the confirmation by how might this all play out in November [noise]\nIf the Republican Party realizes how that this is going to play out over the longer term with the way that women have felt about this because there were people that I talked to a day in and day out who really felt as though\nThis was the highest levels of our institutions doing exactly what they have been fighting against which is they came forward they told their stories in the institution set to then you don't matter\nListen dysfunction has pet had gone before Donald Trump got to the White House in Congress but it's reached new levels the appeal to people slower instincts now by both basis of\nCosts things like violence industry each demonstration on both sides like that go beyond the pale a you know as a recent book that came out about America from Eighteen thirty two Eighteen sixty of feel the blood and how that\nLed to the civil war in America I'm not sure we're not leading to a coal civil war and I'm not too sure during the Trump era that thinks won't good worst parents so we uh we're sorry nation need to for your there so\nI'm here to promote his book I just have a book just showed up yesterday at my house I ordered that book 'cause I Want to read it and I\nThink the problem here is the case he I I understand that there was a lot of unhappiness\nAbout the vote but the notion that one person or one a spokesman speak for all women or that all women or appalled by her\nI can tell you I was appalled by this because the notion that somebody can bring down somebody's career on their word alone is the kind of license in our society that I think is hugely dangerous\nMothers who have young sons they can look at them going to school and anybody can bring them down what kind of a precedent are we sending what kind of agency a weed denying women what kind what kind of action we taking against people who are survivors of sexual assault and who have been hurt by this\nBecause someone who wasn't really credible stood up and didn't have the corroborating evidence from the people she suggested she had it from\nI think that that perception from some of these women is that to Christians made this point about the job interview but you know for many women they are the essay grow up there they are sent the message that you better do it cleaner and better than that guy because if you're the one who screwed up you're going to pay the price and I think there was a sense that judge Kavanaugh never and his wife had that kind of constantly All right\nI'm going to posit airway actually going to get ... and other side of the discussion out of

lotto she sat on this week and then went to sleep\nIf you've been sexually harassed or assaulted right me too as a reply to this tweet\nWell she woke up to tens of thousands of responses and the realization ... kick started the quote me too\nAnd I did actually it was founded in two thousand six by the activists Toronto her well both mulatto and Bert ... at the Capitol hearing last week to support Christine Blasey Ford with mulatto easily seen on TV sitting behind capital\nAnd joining me now from Southern California is Alyssa mulatto and from New York, Toronto Burke welcome to both of you thanks for coming up\nThank you so much for having us I'm trying to break let me start with you and you heard me play earlier the quote from Christine Blasey Ford where she talked about or fear of coming out and simply stepping in front of a train that was already headed to its destination\nUm what are the repercussions of that\nWell I mean the repercussions are will be will remain to be seen but I think her stepping out was something that we needed to have happen in this movement it's been largely focused on Hollywood and on individual bad actors\nAnd I think her coming forward really set the stage for survivors to have a different role in this movement\nOver the last year um all of them a lot of the journalists Sally Quinn wrote in her memoir last year about an attempted rape\nBy now deceased Senator John tower when she was a college student in the sixties\nWhen John Tower was nominated to be the defense secretary in in Nineteen eighty nine she was asked about it and she declined to talk about it with the FBI\nWell a reporter for New Yorker Susan Glasser asked her about it and let me play a let me show you what I'm Susan Glasser what she said I called Sally Quinn the night before Christine Blasey Ford's testimony to ask what she thought about her own experience all these years later\nAnd she goes I could have been Anita Hill she pointed out but I didn't want to I didn't want to ruin my life\nNothing has changed since Anita Hill not a damn thing she writes\nI think a lot has changed but I also think a lot hasn't changed and yesterday we we may have lost a political battle but I Do think we are winning the cultural battle and often I don't fight for the when I'm fighting so that generations\nI don't have to deal with the abuses of power that that we've had to deal with so and ... and enter respect I think she is right but then I Do think that there's a lot going on and I think this this this cultural shift that we're feeling this collective pain that we're feeling from survivors\nComing forward it's going to be able to be translated into a collective power or to say that we're not going to be silenced any longer\nTrying to work you know Susan Collins said that she was really angry at the leaker about this story that it put it forced Dr Ford into the public square and maybe she wasn't ready or maybe it wasn't handled right um do you think the United States Senate and in particular Senator Feinstein\nDid didn't handle this correctly from the outset and may Dr Ford more vulnerable than necessary\nI wouldn't say she didn't handle it right she followed the leadership on the survivor people shouldn't have to be forced out of an ... to tell their story and so she acts were privacy I understand why Senator Feinstein decided to respect that privacy\nHe went probably to your coach that had him enough food teams cow Wednesday afternoons at one on Charles things ESPN Radio one oh six point seven FM hand for dean the\nImpact of capital cap on the mid term Senate is where would we might see it for Senate races that I Want to show you examples of before Kavanaugh and after first Missouri before the cabin all allegations in hearings the race was tied\nThe racist let's look at Montana\nBefore gesture with about a two point lead their most recent poll since that's where the four point lead to no real change their but let me go to some darker red states Tennessee\nSo brightest and had a five point lead before the Kavanaugh hearings and now look the most recent poll asked Marsha Blackburn the Republican up by the big swing there and then of course North Dakota before the cabin on hearings began she was down for a margin of error race after it\nDouble digits full point race Al Cardenas is this how your party sees it that that whenever you think of it this is fired up the base\nWhere I live here so we see if we see it as highly secure to shine a majority in November Eighteen for all the research you've stated do they get stuck in Korea much Democrats aren't going to win the Senate very much non I mean there are going to be a couple of streets that are going to go war were the other but the Democrats in each five to seven remaining\nCompetitive seats and I just don't see it happening in the house you know they're twenty three seats Republican troll that Hillary Clinton won\nI think that'll help Democrats and I you know I just don't know what top shelf I think the majority is likely to be democratic now sort of leading Democrat banks in spite of the things that you've stated regarding you know French away you know it's very frustrating\nCases that live view on the hill that basically yeah this is helping Republicans in the Senate and it's only making it easier for the Democrats and al\nYeah that's emerging conventional wisdom I think particularly in a place like kind of see on the hook into both senators actually from Tennessee about this uh briefly and you know I think there's a sense that it really helped\nMarsha Blackburn there um but I Do think one thing for Democrats to to take away from this as well Mitch McConnell called the protesters a mob and he said that the mob was able to do ... I couldn't see myself\nWhich is Republicans energized and invested so what was a clear win for Democrats on enthusiasts on it now I definitely something of a toss up but\nI Do think on the in the house you can be looking at instead of a twenty three twenty four twenty five the majority for Democrats you could be looking at much higher numbers which I think actually could have pretty significant application\nDating we were talking about something else earlier in the in the break and I actually want to bring it here and it's how the president is transformed Justice Party let's entire town everybody now conduct politics at his image fight fight fight then I didn't I didn't I just take it to your opponent whatever\nI mean it the I don't think that there's a word but the vulgar rise Asian 'em or something that was pretty vulgar to start with American American politics it's it's really unbelievable because Donald Trump has not\nBeen isolated by his style or in this manner or his antipathy towards so much of a the political landscape rather she has just she's she's taking them along with it\nAnd the irony here is just to come back to the midterms for quite a for a second the irony is I think that people eat and almost two years into Donald Trump's presidency don't understand what helps Donald Trump [laughter] it is to have and all stuff them into it helps him\nHe was the big the big winners here are Michael I Want to transition to your book\nBecause as you pointed out you said how do we transition your book yesterday presidents got to do two things appoint Supreme Court justices to decide whether we go to war in your book presidents of war\nAnd as a historian when you get a front page scoop in the New York times that's pretty darn good it sounds like you did some interesting little historical a ticket and this is about nuclear a nuclear response of general Westmoreland as if to add to his legacy apparently wanted to bring nukes to Vietnam War what happen\nLBJ who obviously made so many terrible mistakes in Vietnam here in this case there is this hidden story where he tells Westmoreland no I don't want nuclear weapons in South Vietnam that could quickly they could quickly they use you know this could be the end of the world get them outta here\nAnd it was all secret until decades later in the last documents came out just the last couple of years what\nShould the president brought you in to brief him on his book in and say why should I read your book what can I learn from what can you learn from it wouldn't you hope President Trump or more from your book\nA number one you'll get to experience the saga of two hundred years of what it's like to be a war president you know be marriages are things president you know these emotional breakdown where they live more important I think what I Would like to say to win is\nRemember no president should start a war for political reasons in President Trump's case he would send out tweets in two thousand eleven warning Americans watch out President Obama is going to start a war to win the election next election not a great idea for a president can close to\nA line Michael's book presidents of war congrats before we go I Want to remind everyone that today we're excited that we're kicking off the second annual meet the press don't festival with the American Film Institute's\nTickets are sold out and Washington botch you can see most of the film online on NBC News dot com slash MTV film or you can check out NBC News on demand if you cut the cord error it's on your cable box if you haven't got the quarter Apple TV fire t._v. or ... ... that's all for today\nProduce more immune to\nShe said she would free the AR ...\nWest Virginia radio corporation sleep", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "07"}
