listen to this program the podcasts and check the website and then you watch a Trump rally and you hear Trump say things that you\nHeard or read on the podcast or at my website is that right\nOh yeah I mean I hear him say specific things that I Know he you know he's smart that he doesn't come up with himself but so I Know I mean I can see him listening to your podcast like in the morning when he gets gets up at the White House and things like that would be the most efficient way\nI can honestly say that I Do not know if the president listens to the podcast now he's\nTold me he listens to the program and it gets a chance and he is is that\nBut you know who knows but he's told me he does I I I I'm very flattered by by your comment can I ask you a question before we go on I'm sure I'm just I Want people to hear it how\nDo you get the podcast every day of your range to receive it\nWell I have your app and I download your podcast\nRight there right there on the app right it's it's and it's not complicated as it you were able to figure it out\nNo no no I was not able to I mean I'm Sorry I was able to figure it out um I think you had fixed a few bucks which which are good the releases you fix were good\nAnd we're constantly working on bug fixes we uh what the ... a new wave of them I've I've spent up just the other day that the developer yeah and I said get this fixed I'm tired of waiting on it\nYeah it used to be if you were in your car and you're listening to our one and then our one runs out it wouldn't go automatically to our two\nWell that now that interestingly that was not exclusive to us that\nHappened to be the way they ended up being bad and the\nAnti we did have to change the way they got to have them download 'til you want to play back in the proper order but that wasn't just our pod cast it was any number of people that originally it was an ... problem it was the way I tunes organize them\nAh we're we're actually able to overcome that with our with our own ... did you use I tunes of all you got them straight for the ap\nYeah I mean in fact I bought my first iPod yeah I didn't even know what it was right and I bought it because that's how you're cast\n... doesn't want to people here that I Want to hear how easy it is and the prime cast is well how would you describe the pod cast\nTo what is it how would I describe it yeah what is it what are you listening to when you listen to the podcast\nOh well I mean I'm listening for what you say but you know it's not broken up by the commercials and things like that so I'm I'm getting your whole show I can get all the information about what's going on like you say I mean you\nKnow what does it take you about an hour and a half to listen to the whole show our forty minutes\nYeah I mean it's great 'cause like I listen to it on the way home from war\nBecause Romney commercials in the past right it's just me\nYeah it's just you know and then I can knock out and listen to you know your whole show in and out\nAnd a half isn't that amazing thing isn't that amazing that's been going on we don't double dip on our sponsors [laughter]\nAnd it's an ... it's a benefit for people that joining become members are Rush Limbaugh's on comic view on the program is free bow there it is in podcast more\nYeah I I it's it's great I'm\nWell I'm happy to hear your taking advantage of the of the of the opportunity we were among the first to make\nTo make content available in this program available via podcast all these people out there with their podcast these days cereal this and breakfast look that and all that we were at the front of the gang of people doing podcasts\nYeah and I'm Glad I'm Glad I I guess in some other cats but I don't know a lot of ... them and um so I just listened to yours right\nNow it's up on a pod cast is is the is a transmission of uh of audio on what was an iPod pod cast is how it got to the original name now they I pot has been incorporated into the iPhone and the eye pad\nAnd even now downloadable on a laptop that was the name just held but it was related to\nBeing able to download audio content like songs and music on an iPod tense podcast\n[noise] great thanks for explaining that to me ... as long as I can hear you that you know that's all I mean\nThat's that's awesome I appreciate it but I just to answer your question are we can't divulge members I wouldn't\nTell anybody you remember you know you never know who's gonna do what are we guard that information we promise a everybody that is a member that we're going to protect their identity and their privacy will work very hard at it by the way I mean not just from\nA third party agitator is and so forth so that's why can't tells you whether or not the president and it wouldn't be just the president you know you can you can maybe have the office of the president's communication shopping a number of them couldn't be subscribers I just can't say\nBut\nBut I Am just I'm just flattered that that ah I I appreciate your comments that let me just leaving it that I appreciate it very much thank you so much as we are and I was also we're constantly\nDealing with bugs a little tweaks to be the entire app and I'm I'm constantly I've I've got a list of things I Want the developer\nTo add a I [noise] you wouldn't you wouldn't believe [laughter] [noise] you wouldn't believe the excuses\nAnd the reasons they are they okay if you want to do that half a million to half a million dollars for an apple and Apple TV and sixteen weeks to do what are you kidding me that's what it will be no it isn't there is no way an app is a half million dollars on Apple TV and sixteen weeks to read it\nBut that's what we deal with some work but my point is we're constantly trying to improve this in terms of of user intuition just having it be as natural an easy to use\nWithout a manual and without on the instructions and our developers are really hot spot on the ball a ... edits it we we we draw a lot at them because I Want it to be as good as it can be I Want us to be the\nBest I mean I Am L. rush of all and I can't sit here you know with a half baked tap and so we don't and\nAll the

Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh\nOut of eagerness to show a pattern up such behavior\nMayor told\nElle magazine and her recollection of the Thomas hearings as James yeah so\nHaving watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps to stab me she was telling the truth when there's a standoff there wasn't a pattern this is amazing she ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless\nIn my attempt to explain this the first story that was Ron about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true justice ... pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation we get from Boise Ford or be for Ramirez or from Avon ladies client\nWas her name swept Nick I mean this is a flat\nOut admitted yeah we made up a second story well than use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story alleging it\nAnd of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on that yeah we needed to show a pattern here is Krista Smith of Ohio your next I'm graduated high\nHigh right very very cool to talk to you thank you um so\nI was just wondering I was concerned and mine to get your thoughts invention that fun of it yesterday but with his mom rule as it is and let's Hillary claiming that they're partying neatness civility right now I'm\nI just get worried with the mom and they left and the accident\nAnd then fattening or if they begin to help people um it just had me worried about provoking violence um you know to the point where we don't do anything ... on fire but Trump stickers in our yard on our cars\nBecause we truly are the silent majority we're not out there showing it I mean I've been to rally but um it gets hadn't really scared and worried you know living my day each day\nIt's totally understandable you you mean you need your your your support for Trump has not wavering but you don't\nYou don't feel safe publicly demonstrating that are showing of is that basically right correct couldn't I don't blame you a bit\nThe only guy who worry me is if you said you were thinking about dropping support for Trump just to make\nOh no [laughter] no no no I just it it worries me when I'm\nI get a lot of people are worried about this and I'll tell you I think you I think there are a lot of people like you who just don't want to call attention to themselves 'cause this is an insane group of people and they're showing a willingness to assault and attempts have intact anybody and you're right to think that violence is just around the corner\nAnd who wants to bring that on so your point is that there are a lot of people like you who are going to vote the way Trump would want them to vote for him I ... for Republicans coming up in this election that nobody maybe counting\nYes um you know nobody's got signed in science and a yard sale everybody I talked to is a hundred percent mad though Trump and now they talk about it and it's almost like you know we live for about it like ... are are you all have a ... oh\nYes it's out in the old in the old Soviet Union people would go to the bathrooms in their house to whisper to each other what they really thought because they were afraid that the state if the regime was listening to them\nAnd so you're basically this driving describing the same thing the difference is that in in twenty sixteen there were Trump yard signs everywhere you went in states across this country they're not there now without Trump isn't on the ballot leader so\nYou you might not be all that many Trump signs to be put in yards but but your point is the outward support for Donald Trump\nIs is being suppressed by people to not call attention themselves right\nWhere you're concerned about violence is Sharon let me grab soundbite number nine listen to this ... this is Rand Paul it was on Fox and friends\nToday and uh it was only usually Earhart\nUh so you have a big fear about this rhetoric your fear is that somebody's going to get killed\nSomeone almost do it I was there at the ball field when Stevens police almost died\nFrom a very very angry violent man who was inside and really by rhetoric on the left
