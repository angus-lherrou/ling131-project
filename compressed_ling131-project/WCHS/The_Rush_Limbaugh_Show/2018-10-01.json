S. M. C. A. as in the United states Mexico Canada agreement a new name for what was NAFTA the president says this one will benefit the American worker\nThe deal includes a substantial increase in our farmers opportunities to export American we poultry eggs and dairy including milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream to name a few\nWall Street reacting positively the Dow is up two hundred sixty points the prosecutor brought on by Republican senators the question and one of the women accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of a sexual assault so she wouldn't bring charges against him if last week's hearing with testimony from Christine Bobby forward would have been a criminal proceeding\nNow there's an FBI investigation and democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut says it is not a broad enough the\nWhite House seems to be micromanaging and scrape taxing and investigation that must uncover\nAnd evidence necessary determine whether Brett Kavanaugh is qualified to sit on the highest court in the land\nKavanaugh denied sexually assaulting anyone in his past today marks one year since the deadliest mass shooting in modern us history a government in Las Vegas open fire at a

the\nThroughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe even longer than maybe forty five minutes or\nYou know an extended statement\nOnly recently started taking questions from the time when Trump was doing here which is something to live a long advocated he wasn't just announcing that\nDeal got done he was teaching why it was important including to the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nUh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi and Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works and how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of\nAmerican leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then it promotes good relations with our allies and Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back pockets\nPicket there's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy that doesn't mean because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not have ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trade works why it is important how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other\nType people about whom Washington thinks not very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question\nThat Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process\nAnd in discussing this substance and the details of this new agreement just it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as announcing is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this cut that cut this reform that required a lot of people to know what they're talking but I got scared to death\nAt lesson hasn't been learned by none other than a dozen all of this Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us it's kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking but both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nOr ... or in the\nRespect of others it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump's turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us\nWe're the world economy where the future of the world economy where the future of world freedom and liberty to the days of the America as the world's piggy bank are\nSteel will also imposes new standards requiring at least Seventy five percent of every automobile to be made in North America in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets it's a privilege for them to do business with us and I'm not talking about Mexican\nIt was a mountain lake clear to me what all of this is and it simply about one word folks it's about the way the way and delay\nAnd with each new revelation the need to continue to do away it's secondarily about Kavanaugh that yeah oh they're still targeting cabin offered total nuclear destruction\nThat's part and parcel of this to the way it worked very simple you have Jeff Flake said he ...

I ... I Need to react I Need to respond to this outrage just allegations that I or my staff had lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just asked my staff I just asked my staff in any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[laughter]\nBut what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her\nAnd she starts now that we can't hear what she said 'cause it's off Mike but she's obviously asking them did anybody here to leak it she turns or did you did you look at ... she turns back to the camera we didn't make it\nThis is a German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy say oh is this how we're going to determine who leak something she turned her staff and asked them and they deny it and that it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and has to undergo his seventh FBI background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it and Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff hey did any of your leaked this letter and like oh no I don't know what was the last one who does\nShe turns back around so we we didn't do it and listen to him and as the case closed it wasn't us they had done it it was strategic just like what happened on friday was to teach it strategic\nLadies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday\nOf a transcript of a conference call\nThat have occurred last week among and between Democrats activists who were planning exactly what happened on friday it's laid out in this thing now unfortunately I Can't\nReproduce this and put it at Rush Limbaugh dot com because I don't legally habit but I've got it\nI'm not going to mention any names but the names of the Democrat front groups in organizations are here and the strategies that they use and it\nMakes it crystal clear that they were going to target Jeff Flake that he was seen as the most malleable and the easiest to intimidate the elevator\nIncident where just happened\nThat to nearly insane anti Kavanaugh pro democratic activists ended up there in flakes elevator with us CNN camera right there to catch what happened and they started shouting and they started accusing and they started pointing fingers he got scared to death\nIt was all part of the strategy to turn him\nAnd it was never there was a three point strategies a

percent Democrats sixty nine percent independents with only forty five percent Republicans\nWho are the smart ones\n\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent fought\nKavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both ... if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible in fifty percent found him to be\nWhat the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor instead the question comes down to cooperation as the standard for

I prefer to the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArguments like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenient on whether or not having to get through I think this whole situation is really fired up Republican voters\nSo once again somebody else you can't blame 'em folks don't get mad at him because my original production was everywhere I literally all over the world it was an Saudi\nTV was on the BBC it was on Russian television I think even a North Korea is\nThe little patently dictator mentioned it in his Saturday Night message to the people it was everywhere\nWhen Rush Limbaugh says Republicans are going to take it into shorts everybody in the media covers it and I again I made that production at at at a time where it looked like they were getting ready to bail\nOn the entire nomination and\nWhen that didn't happen when the Democrats win a couple of steps too far and caused the Republicans do engage them in this than I revise their production\nSo I'm gonna take a brief time out here a I've got the Trump soundbites from the press conference in the rose garden following as announcer the NAFTA deal when the drive by started squaring him about capital you've got to hear the so we'll do that in the right after that we'll get back\nTo the parents Rush Limbaugh dot com ask for your iPhone your eye pad or your Android device just makes accessing this program and for all of its content as easy as it's ever been\nGet all this and more with the Russia bad rash twenty four seven of edible at the apple store Google place or Rush Limbaugh dot com you are listening to the E R B network\nWhat is it costing us vet bills for that convenience of just pulling open a bag of formulated\nExtra rooted trash cereal batch that cost a\nTon of money anyway how do you feed your dog to derive not only energy but a good coach bright eyes and great added to come to China for help\nAnd I'll be I ...

I'm telling you no matter how this if the FBI exonerate Kevin all whenever they do it do you really think the Democrats because okay fine like we we we we got what we wanted number prepared to go about do you think that's going to be the result it will not be\nNow folks [noise] one of the thing here\n[noise] we just had a caller who said that we don't want to become them but it's time to start playing this game the way\nThey do\nI made the point you don't have to become them to beat them at this game we didn't have to become Hitler win World War two we didn't have to become the Japanese emperor when World War two and specific\nTheater\nThat's always been a bogus we cannot go after these people would risk ... coming who they are a lot of crap that's nothing more than some limitation that's in other denial of people who are already\nFound to be of a\nFine character you you can you can you can enter into tough battles without losing your morality and your moral character and so forth\nBut\nAs an example of how we almost do it now and then but then we pulled back I call your attention last week the window Lindsey Graham on loaded on the Democrats\n\nHe on loaded on him and he was a thousand percent right in every allegation he made a couple of other Republicans echoed gram but with no passion and with no energy they just echo ... grams said\nIntellectually now\nTo our caller that should have been the starting point people should have been picked up on grams opener and run with it and it should it be calm the daily identifier of the Republican Party they should've been throwing back firing back right at the Democrats in their faces\nEvery hour of every day exactly what Graham did make that the ongoing battle\nThem on the defensive make the media repeat these charges ... Graham laid out but instead it was a standalone\nRamps that it it was great it was impassioned\nAnd that was the end of it it was never to be heard again out of the mouth of any Republican\n\nAnd solve grams impassioned allegation of the Democrats\nWas followed by agreement with Jeff Flake [noise]\nTo me that the FBI we allowed to do one way to get their fight and all of fine senator Graham's point and he even went along with what's like\nYou can't do these things as one offs\nIf you're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country and what's really going on here you have to do it every day and you're going to have to do it multiple times a day it's going to have to become the central focus of your strategy on a day to day basis\nBut it never does we've had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republicans done a one off like that and it's been great and we have celebrated in we shared it with your way to go and it dies except for here on TALK radio or maybe on Fox News but it dies\n\nWell Lindsey Graham didn't have to become them to do what he did he just had to be honest and he was\nLindsey Graham didn't have to worry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people and by the when did you notice not one of them on the Democrats I cared aware about what Graham said none of even got mad at it\nNot a single one of them even want to refute if they didn't care when they got a rise out of them was winning Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter\nSo she turned around and asked her staff did you guys get but no they said they didn't Lincoln Mr general we didn't Lincoln I just asked my staff they said they did oh what about an investigation huh well Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein ever going to invest in some of these other things that needs to be followed up on\nTheir needs to be follow through but I for one I Know investigations are innocent but I'm getting tired because all they are for or delay\n\nHow hard is it the stand up and say Brett Kavanaugh is credible and there's denial\nHow why if it's so hard she didn't have any evidence that she made a credible witness how well she was really suffering and in may so\n\nNone of that is tablets just credibility\n\nAn attitude doesn't give us credit Beverly pain and suffering doesn't equal credibility Democrats are always in pain and suffering over something\nNow want to go back to my production [noise]\nMy original prediction was that if the Republicans do not vote on this\nIf they don't vote out Kevin on that committee him he doesn't get voted on he's if he's not confirmed Republicans are going to have held up pay because voters are going to be fit to be tied up being led down again than the Democrats kept pulling stunts and it became\nConventional wisdom this keeps up Republican voters are going to get some kicked off Republican women and mothers are going to get so mad because they've got sons and they hate seeing what's happening in the capital and they don't want imagine it happening their own and they're going to show up in droves or I Want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something\nThis is Sharon in ... can't lift ships Pennsylvania how are you pronounce where you are committed limits good [laughter] good what's happening\nI rushed thank you for taking my call you bet um I I've been curious about since about the ... the beginning of this year several times you mentioned that uh an incident or in the current has yet to happen that will affect or seriously affect the near term\nI was curious to hear if you think this Kavanaugh's nomination that's gone sour is\nThat incident\nWell could be I mean that that the the point was uh I didn't have anything specific in mind it's just that we got a poll in June or a poll and mayor even July and it tells us what the\nPublic is thinking of doing and the November elections in my point was this is silly this poll doesn't mean anything there's anybody remember the pole in July of two thousand sixteen or in August that doesn't mean anything 'cause it's not when the election is and I said the\n... the events are going to shape the midterms haven't happened yet I said that in July August September a\nAnd this is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind but there's going to be something beyond this oh dear\nThis is going to get resolved one way or the other depending on how it's resolved yeah it's going to affect turnout it's going to affect votes\nIf the Democrats Lewis this uh if Kavanaugh gets confirmed a than\nWhat a democratic voters going to do it I guess it's going to be really rage didn't show up and vote are they going to be mad depressed and sit home who knows what this thing is going to get rid of if this if this is not resolved before the election and it's a defeat anyway because all the Democrats want to hear is delayed delayed delayed\nBy my only point was that those pools in the summer are largely irrelevant because there are things are going to happen much closer to the election nobody can predict that are going to have a great impact on it this is one of those things yes but I don't know if it's\nThe [laughter] somebody has to have much to say is Russia's probably ... be met for [noise]\nSimply say if there's another one of our great success stories

what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's never had a bit statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number

the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was a set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trapped accusing Trump and the White House up trying to limit the FBI's go because you see there are things to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI and it's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump ... I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK thank\nYou Mr solve it needs to go two weeks we're going to go to waste the southern White Houses now claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and\nTweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC is why of course\nAre lying it was a set up and so now it's out\nThere but we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news at the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow but then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI has finished talking to everybody who to talk to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and or are are are do they move on it will just tell you if this ends tomorrow this is all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be rigged and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was read\nThey're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we left them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday it won't be long enough besides Trump said\nHe's not going to be limits on the FBI so why did they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels I went to the response as well they found nothing you know a hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n\nUh let's see let's let's skip forward here to um [noise] audio soundbite number thirty reporter about judge Kavanaugh there are concerns\nThat might have lied or mischaracterized as drinking while he was testifying if they find that capital lied about his drinking or if he lied about other things do you think that that bars him from being your nominee to the Supreme Court\nI was surprised at how locally was about the fact that he likes beer\nAnd he's had a little bit of difficulty I mean he talked about things that happened when he drank this is not a man that said that alcohol was ... that he was perfect with respect to alcohol look at some of these people asking the questions okay look at Blumenthal he lied about Vietnam he didn't just say hey I went to Vietnam no no\nFor Fifteen Years he said he was a war hero he fought in Da Nang\nProvince we call them ... Richard downing that's just stick them done a he never went to Vietnam take a look at Cory Booker he ran Newark New Jersey into the ground\nHe was a horrible in there and he made statements that when he was in high school or college while he was doing he actually made the statements and now he's talking about judge Kavanaugh and I could go through a whole list of okay looking Dianne Feinstein\nAnd he starts talking about Feinstein with the Chinese by on her staff for ... years\nAnd then he tells a story about how Dianne Feinstein of short everybody\nThat her staff didn't week the balls and Ford ladder is right there in the middle way hearing she turned around and ask them camera was on her and she turned or did did did you wasted your lead in a mess with German\nMy staff tells me that do we didn't leak do we I didn't know legally my steps as David Was so normally still we read it on a path that\nJust like Kavanaugh said he didn't do what she says but no that's not good enough you'll need the FBI you'd eat everything you can get to find out of Kevin O's line but we're just supposed to sit there and except die fi you say and your staff say in a period of five to ten seconds that you didn't leak it\nAnd that's that in Trump is so right\nAbout about Richard Blumenthal this guy folks\nThis is why you know I don't understand [noise] democratic voters\nIt can't be an substance this guy oh why you claim for Fifteen Years he was a medal winning war heroes strong with valor in Vietnam you never been there\nHe had to call a press conference with tears to explain why and what happens\nThere is not a single Republican alive for the media would allow do survive\nHeadache congestion\nAnd you wonder is it allergy sinus infection Dr\nBob Ballard at ear nose and throat positions of Charleston\nWill be on this Friday after the effort to talk about sinus and allergy problem with an emphasis on managing mode allergies on preventing infection during mode allergy season how your questions ready and call three four or five fifty eight fifty eight\nFriday at age twenty ... the effort with Dr Bob Pollard an ear nose and throat physicians of Charleston on definitely see a ...\nRaise your space in science IQ every Sunday night with planetary radio on five eighty WC H.

at\nWhat am I see what is the lead to headline on the Drudge Report let me read it to your\nWhite House expands FBI problem is that what the hell is that so I clicked on a lake here what it is [noise]\nRight here at my formerly nicotine saying the fingers in New York Times working in tandem with NBC News\nHeadline of White House tells FBI to interview anyone necessary for Kevin on inquiry this is because of what they claimed Trump said\nAt his press conference today where he's now I don't want to limit anything I said I thought that this that they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigations or not that's fake news so then they've got a record Trump not limiting invest which means you can go on and on and on and on\nAnd now they're broadcasting and everywhere White House tells FBI interview when he wasn't necessarily [noise] and right on schedule CNN reports that the Democrats are submitted a list of twenty four people they want the FBI\nTo talk to this after Fox News had an earlier today was the FBI is about to wrap up tomorrow\n\n[noise] this is gonna have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all this is is delayed delayed delayed the way and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named just somehow insufficient\nIf somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides it needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with the woman who doesn't remember where\nOr when what ever happened to her happen and there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promote it\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because it's not real the Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything unlike Bob Mueller they stop\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this\nSomebody on the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start voucher thing where the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of bread capital somebody needs to speak up for him\nSomebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they haven't been thorough and they haven't found anything or you wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\nBut that's not happening somehow were letting the media get away with\nIdea that the
