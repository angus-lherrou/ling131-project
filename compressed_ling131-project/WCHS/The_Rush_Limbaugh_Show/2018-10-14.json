with just nine democratic and one independent and Democrats are the ones bullish about their prospects on that side of the ledger\nSo we want to talk to some of the challengers in these races and we have to with us this morning say the ... the Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia and Republican Josh ...\nThe is challenging Claire McCaskill for a Senate seat in Missouri both candidates joining we're going to begin with Josh howling in Columbia, Missouri or Mr attorney general welcome to the show thanks for having me let\nThe question about erase this way if you win is it fair to say the number one issue on on voters' minds was judges and an injustice Kavanaugh and if you come up short\nAnd Senator McCaskill wins reelection is it fair to say the number one issue in voters' minds with health care is it fair to say that you both have two different views of what the most important issue is to Missouri in St\nPaul I do think we have different views jak and I do think that ah the debacle with justice justice Kavanaugh what the Senate Democrats did in that case is hugely motivating to Missouri voters they cannot believe\nThe conduct of the Senate Democrats they can't believe the smear campaign that they launched and by the way how they drug Dr forward through the mud as well and now this bomb behavior that we're seeing all over the country it is motivating folks\nBut of course a health care as well Missourians are paying outrageous healthcare costs up a hundred and forty five percent price increases in this state they want to see that change Claire McCaskill is responsible\nLet me ask you this if you get elected are you going to vote to repeal and replace Obamacare yes I Would\nI think it's absolutely vital that we get rid of the failures of Obamacare we bring down costs we protect people with preexisting conditions in the law with a mandate Chuck that ensures that we do it but that we multiply options for families you know I've had family after family in this state\nCome up to me and say look we can't afford health insurance we're having to get a second jobs and espouse back to work it shouldn't have to be that way it is it that way because of Senator McCaskill\nBut as you know if you get rid of this law you also get rid of the protection of pre existing conditions and and well I I Know that if you believe that can be passed but frankly it never has been as you know I'm In your lawsuit as attorney general you thought you could have\nSevered the issue of a pre existing conditions how do you plan on protecting preexisting conditions\nYou a check I think that we can do their ... number of ways to do to protect folks with preexisting conditions Congress should mandated my position is insurance companies should be required by law to protect folks with preexisting conditions my own son I've got two little boys at home\nDo you think that five year old ... year old by the way\nI Do I Do absolutely I Do what's what's not constitutional is the requirement that people buy health insurance\nThey don't want but it's absolutely constitutional say that insurers have to cover people with preexisting conditions Congress should mandate it people like my little boy who has a preexisting condition should be covered under the law but apart from Obamacare we don't have to have Obama Care to do it and that's the big difference here Claire McCaskill wants to protect Obamacare\nBy with any condition by any means necessary I think we need to clear away the failure of Obamacare and put patients back in charge of their health care\nAlright final question for you we found a clip of a TV ad you ran when you're running for attorney general in two thousand sixteen here's what you said in that at\n\n... he is full of career politicians just climbing the ladder using one office to get another I'm ... I think you deserve better\nYou within two years immediately ran for the U.S Senate what would you say to yourself\nIn that I Would say that the future of our countries and sick and I would say you could see it with the hearings and justice Kevin all you\nCan see it as what we're seeing out on the streets now the future of this country and our way of life years at stake and it's incumbent upon all of us to do all that we can I'm trying to do my part to make sure that we fight for the future this country and fight for Missouri Claire McCaskill has not but I Will All right\nJosh ... Republican nominee for the U.S Senate in Missouri appreciate your coming on and sharing your views be safe in the campaign trail with\nThank you so much sex joke you gotta thank you and joining me now from Atlanta is Stacey Abrams welcome to meet the press thank you for having me let me start\nWith the impact of hurricane Michael particularly in southwest Georgia I Know your opponent is going to be two in the area or this week and his capacity as secretary of state he says to just see how a local officials are gonna be able to see if they can handle the start of early voting tomorrow\nUh let me ask you what do you know uh about the area how things are going are they ready to to be worrying about early voting yet or do they need to be worried about getting POWER UP\nI I think it's going to be a combination of areas like Albany ore Glasgow county Carolyn parts of south west Georgia were very strongly devastated\nI Know that Georgia Power and the ... are doing the best they can to turn power back on and deliver it to many people as possible\nBut luckily early voting allows for major centers to except vote and I hope that the priority will be in terms of voting making sure that those places are ready but I Know all of our hearts are reaching out to everyone in those areas\nI've gone through hurricane it's a devastating process and it takes months for recovery to happen but I think that the governor and at the state leaders have done a great job of responding very quickly\nI'm curious what your message to residents of the area or you could be the governor and a cup you could be elected governor in a couple of weeks suddenly the task of rebuilding\nUm this part of Georgia is on a is on your to do list what your message to those voters of why you would be better prepared to lead the recovery than your opponent\nNumber one I've been through this myself I understand that it's not just the physical plant that's a problem it's making sure that people have access to the resources they need\nAnd often when the camera's turned off and when people go home and stop volunteering that's when the real trouble starts when people who have been unemployed are continuing to try to figure out how they can make a living and take care of their families and so I Will leverage the responsibility of the governor\nThe ability to connect with state and local officials and federal officials to make certain that resources don't just end when the memory of the storm passes for the average person\nAnd I think that's what you need someone who's thinking about this not as a three day or three weeks return but really as a ten month twelve months recovery period\nHall or for Democrats but certainly the winds have shifted closer narrowing in certain races and\nThat is not the message has a Democrat that certainly when it said that their chances are miniscule but they are diminishing and a lot of it has to do with Kevin I think the question is whether or not that energy that Republicans have can hold over the next several weeks\nUm because Democrats are also energized or in their own way but there's\nThere's definitely in that sense and even a center court and said I Believe on friday that there's a chance that Republicans could pick up the right in the Senate which would be highly unusual on and so there's there's a shift happening and whether it's just that between now and election day you know range they said\nI was just in Missouri for a few days and it it does feel as if that is just two different races\nThe Democrats are running a campaign on health care law ... the Republicans Josh Holly I could see it in his ads running a campaign about conservatives judges and and the importance of what the Senate majority means\nAnd Missouri's one of those states that has a red tend to it and it seems you can\nThe cabin off that are in real time no absolutely\nJosh Hawley Missouri mid term elections are a lot about\nConvincing voters what is it you're saying what is it you stand to lose and and for Republicans the pitches a Democratic Senate gets elected you're going to lose the judges for Democrats is it a Republican Senate gets elected you're going to lose Obamacare\nAnd that's why the pitch has focused you know just in health care so early and I think the challenges in some of these states Arizona Nevada you're starting to see the race creek away from Democrats and it's happened you know slow but steady fashion in Nevada jak euros and the Democrat has not been in I had had an public pool since the end of September\nIn Arizona you've got curious in cinema all this opposition research coming out on a recently being out of touch with Arizona so these races or clicking away but the men of narrative here is really about what do you stand to lose and I think Republicans are prosecuted decades\nAnd I think it's clear that the Democrats haven't really energized fair voters Hispanic voters have not been well you know reach out to you and many Hispanics especially in Texas really concerned about registering for anything whether they're legal or not they don't want any part of the company they're so afraid of ice and and it's\nReally rather than me angry by what's happening on immigration they really afraid of the government right now in registration and voting is being part of the government trying to get where you live [noise]\nThe other thing is millennials may not be as excited and energized as came across that help we're sick on the base where are these other issues that had an animating young people you know several months ago after Parkland and it can feel that the Republicans are regaining the Senate side\nYou know Peter when you look at this from thirty thousand feet which you were asked to do a lot in your position on a result that had Republicans gaining in the Senate and Democrats winning the house is actually pretty much emblematic of a divide in this country for all Americans in one place right which is where the Senate catalyst suburban America than another which is where the house by that's right and\nWhat we set up that is a two year period a complete and total gridlock and fighting and you think the cat was just imagine if you got split Congress\nA president who wants to play off of them to to to to benefit is impossible reelection twenty twenty possibly Democratic House it launches in the piece of inquiry it may not go all the way a further but certainly have a lot of subpoenas and investigations and so forth you thought the Kavanaugh\nThing was I Believe we only saw the pre season ... we're about to head into the mainstream\nI'm the president is doing sixty minutes and then something like that about ... Madison Loni you dramatically with a colleague at the Hoover Institute in Stamford of you with the president he has a talent when somebody is about to lose their job he says I think are kind of a Democrats the one time or referred to Rod Rosenstein that way\nWhen he was asked about the future of Jim Mattis a secular defense she said I don't know anything but you know I you know he may he's kind of a Democrats that well boy that's a tell it either\nNot not not that I've ever seen I mean I think this would be a staggering\nA finding to anybody can spend time around him and the look Jim Mattis has been a stabilizing force for national security policy during the ministry and he's been somebody that's presented for reason point of view I think a lot of people would be very nervous if Jim Mattis hr departments administration having but said it does seem like the writers on the line with respect to some of the towns that we're seeing now to present\nTheir relationship has been strange for some time I mean you can say the masses and then you know the level and cabinet member who is put forward very traditional physicians but the president hasn't really been listening to him for months in terms of whether it's on Iran or other issues and so there's been tensions in the relationship to begin with\nI Would work for them and help either out of it I think\nI'm gonna get mad if it was going to go voluntarily and so that's a situation where states is going to fire Jim Mattis are pushing now that's a bigger with eye and say Rex Tillerson\nHowever we with compound at state and when I have to make a Rick I doubt now at the White House chasing a policing the atmosphere certainly from Goldman and his deputy against Jim Mattis and that relationship as count points out has been very strange\nYou know I I think it's going to be hard to fire him but I think I think change is coming up in the near term and they are kind of thing that he says the\nThe term transition like nobody's ever seen before we say goodbye we'd like to know what's on the twenty Eighteen elections so if you want to get something off your chest and do it anonymously\nElection confessions dot com and check out what other voters are saying to you don't want to admit what you are believing admitted here I mean that's all we ever today for watch a movie about next week they\n\n[noise] [noise] when you choose your family\nWest Virginia radio corporations", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "14"}
