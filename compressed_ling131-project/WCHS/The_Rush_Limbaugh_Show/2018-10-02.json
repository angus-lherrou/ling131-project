no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of just ten year old daughter\nSame cartoonist is back [laughter] some public and the Illinois something Illinois journal or some such thing but the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter and parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching on the digital camera this is the cartoon\nIt has Kevin O's daughter praying at her bedside\nThe description the upper left hand corner Kevin O's daughter says another prayer\nAnd in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says dear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n\nNow as I say

reacting to it and I weighed whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets and I decided to go ahead and do it\nIn my never ending quest to have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men did did\nThey are\nThis is what passes for humor on the left this is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh cabin on his daughter says another prayer dear God\nForgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n[noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise] [noise] and it's just good flies in the face of decency you know you run out\nDescriptive adjectives\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some point in their lives of suffered psychological ... events that have led the psychological disorders and they found themselves now at the mainstream of the Democratic party\nAnd and the American left psychological disorders have become the identifying issue isn't characteristics of this party\n\nAnd they are attempting to become the majority on the basis of the psychological disorders which you're always somebody else's fault the disorders they suffer or simply said to be their political positions\nAnd their anger is that the country or specific groups like white man who need to die so that feminist can cast rate the corpses and feed them to pigs Georgetown University professor Dr Christine fair I mean these\nPeople are

that\nIs not being accused\nBy the Democrats and all these other there's a bunch of other people classmates at Yale\nAre claiming that the capital has lied about his binge drinking but\nThere aren't any witnesses that can show that in the wake of a\nKavanaugh's testimony before the committee last Thursday the media have doubled down on efforts to turn up evidence\nOf illicit behavior in school and college because they're trying to bolster for they're trying to find anything cause for doesn't have anything you've been trying to find anything to save her story\nAnd they can't they can't find

love you hearing we let you hearing\nThe city which you would come back\nWell you don't have a lot of friends in Kansas City and I have been bacteria like way but I Do it on the down low\nRight right well the reason I'm calling is I think sometimes I'm the only woman in the whole country that think that Dr Ford testimony or with not credible um that her whole demeanor\nAnd her body language I it was just stole rehearsed and coached I'm\n... from from the way she she acted behind the microphone like she had never seen one before in our life\nHer voice was quivering and ah I don't mean to sound cruel but I mean that was I Can't believe that you know an intelligent and well educated world traveler public speaker and microphone and act like it's like she was just\nThe most frail little Wilton flour and the world you\nKnow we had I didn't I didn't get to this yesterday I had a an audio cell by the Hollywood actress\nOr an actress somewhere that I've never heard of did a video impersonation of Dr Ford and it was so spot on and it was exactly uh what what I noticed her speech pattern those of us whose profession involved with a voice know very well uh the various vocal\nTechniques that professional vocalizing views\nAnd she used to a great effect\nWhat is called up talking or up speaking and that means the end every sentence on an up note it promotes the idea that your young an innocent and vulnerable and it's what you say was that the little girl type voice\nThis Hollywood actress in a perfect impersonation and is being destroyed she put it on Twitter she'd being destroyed she had to apologize for it and tell her body she supports not to report she just was amazing she wanted to do or impersonation to show her talent but he got taken down and I didn't get a chance to get to the video\nThat maybe we can drumming up from yesterday's archive in and play it for you but it's it's a perfect illustration of of ah\nHow she speaks I have to tell you something to him on you're not the only woman who doesn't believe her the female prosecuted Republicans hired\nA Rachel Mitchell has put together a devastating for granted that can now offices of Dr forged testimony and it is and I've got that here but it prints out the eight pages\nWhen there's there's there's no way I can I mean I guess I could share various excerpts of it with you [noise] um but I mean it is just devastating on the substance forget the way she spoke and how she appeared and so forth a and the the Democrats are acknowledging\nThis well this this each part is you know we can't we can't take seriously using the dead woman's as in there so rejecting\nIt but no you're not the only one who has your opinion\nAnd you know I just didn't buy it for a minute I really did affect that you're in your little\nAh yeah that's what she wanted us to believe she was and and also in her testimony or we we lost it all day long and we just couldn't get away from it but um her testimony or when he was talking about going into the Safeway store with her mother\nWent to an end to the store with yet another door and she can try and pay their she saw\nAs it is a judge yeah character that said that okay she said she went up to him and said Hi and with ... and how he just acted like he didn't want to have anything to feel after ... why would you say that I had\nDone what he's supposedly had done just a few weeks earlier and traumatized you why would you go up to him and tried to the friend then you know I I just I I I nobody has touched on that I thought oh\nI did it just to show your not alone on
