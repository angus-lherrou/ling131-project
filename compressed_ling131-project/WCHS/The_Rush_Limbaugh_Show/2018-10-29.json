who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have since Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up first ... thank you for calling hello\nThey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir hey\nI can tell you the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down eight to one\nAbout this thing happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented and then you have but Mayor Bill Clinton was very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop that's what we need is more gun control\nI mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control law cancer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the ones who tells you but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWould ever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes because you see it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's about something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that can't but other than that you got oh freedom of speech with us leftist [noise] ah yeah and you want to have a gun you're going to have a gun except in east or because of it but but but well we're all for freedom if we define that he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with um [noise] Trump himself this is this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews it used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business\nWell it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by the unified them all the cotton joint base\nWhere multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked at for Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter\nSaid Mr President do you think you need to revisit seem\nSo a guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill and the first question\nA drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws\nBy the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things an anti\nSemitism they think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd tell you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway\nThe reporters just Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws this has\nLittle to do with it if you take a look if they had protection inside\nAs a result would have been\nThe speed that will always exist I suspect but\nSome kind of a protection inside the deaf\nMaybe you could have been a very much different situation they did\nHe was able to do things that unfortunately shouldn't have been able to do\nAnd next up after Chuck Todd of meet the press who thought that the Russians were behind the pipe bomber a Cesar ... shuts onto the Russians might be behind that this guy that\nThat also gets more curious as time unfolds this guy was was uh [noise]\nYou ever have you ever heard of a routine failure you ever known anybody that was always on the verge of a big score hit ... being and never amounted to edit that apparently was this guy\n... dog anyway we'll get back there but the minute here is the mayor of Pittsburgh with Chuck Todd on meet the press on his name is William ... due to an F Chuck said is there anything the president personally can do if there's something you'd like to see him do\nPersonally about see see how this works [noise] see him somebody clearly mentally unstable who has been a nut case for a number of years who hates Trump by the way because he thinks Trump is a sellout\nTo the Jewish people and here's an object\nOf asking the mayor of Pittsburgh is Trump responsible is Trump culpable is there something you'd like to see the Trump do personally about gun violence\nI brew long to an organization of bipartisan organization called ... again still legal guns\nI don't think that the answer to this problem is solved by having our synagogues mosques and churches\nFilled with armed guards for schools filled with armed guards I think\nWe were dealing with an irrational person who asked his rationally in trying to create laws around that is not the way that we should govern we should stop do you have your from happening in the forefront and not try to create laws around a rational behavior to contest\nThat's all they do is create laws to justify irrational behavior and force on the rest of us in the mainstream of culture and acceptance of irrational behavior and they try to tell us that it's normal and we're the big it's or whatever if we reject that as normal\nWho can do anything wrong are conservative African Americans they're not going to get on Obama for hanging around an anti Semite like Farrakhan agenda Reverend Jackson Al Sharpton are busy promoting all those people\n\nThey feel sorry for them to get right down to brass tacks they feel sorry for them they think that\nBecause of the ancient history of America with slavery discrimination and all that ... that that really we we we can't hold them accountable we may have excuses you know we can look the other way not exaggerating on that but the point still remains\nThat Obama was chummy with Farrakhan and Al Sharpton and the Reverend Jackson are as well\nAnd there was fire count standing right next to them all a theory the Franklin funeral and none of them seem to want to not be in the photo with him\nAnd many\nDrive by news organizations crop Farrah Khan out of the photo\nWhen they said that\nTheir news wires so they know but it's ... this is the point we have a two tiered justice system and we clearly have a two tiered political system we have criminalized\nRight wing or conservative Republican politics and policy and at the same time exempted\nFrom any criticism or criminality uh most of the\nPolicies of the politics of the

more disagreeing with the politics is associated with with Israel as a poke because if they're inside the religion that's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform of orthodox and and and other branches how\nMany different flavors [laughter] but um yeah but\nI don't I used to I used to feel that way I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheist I Need the the anti

I called my final summation that happened on friday about why we're suspicious\nOf the drive by media and the left in general\nThey have made me suspicious and all of you that attempt this ongoing attempt to destroy Donald Trump to overturn the election results to thousands sixteen and it was codified epitomize if you will in what they tried to Brett Kavanaugh it's no different\nAnd they aren't going to stop I don't need to be told reminded how fit to be tied enraged they are over their failure to get rid of the Trump\nI Know they're psychology\nI Know these people in the media and I know that these Democrats they are just folks beside themselves that everything they've got in their arsenal of weapons hasn't worked\nSo given that this is the sum total of\nIntelligence guided by experience I don't believe\nI'm not gonna believe just because I'm told that something happened the way it did\nAnd that's a shame it's a shame that the highest levels of our government have gotten to the point where this trusting them is a common sense ethical thing to do but they've brought this on\nAll of these nameless faceless anonymous sources with all of this order be ass\nEvery day for two years New York times CNN intelligence community resources and former American intelligence officials tell the New York times ... blah blah blah blah blah blah every day sometimes many times a day for a\nYear two years\nStuff's made up out of whole cloth news stories literally made up all to advance advance the agenda\nOf essentially canceling the election results from two thousand sixteen and finding a way to get Donald Trump out of office and it was to people\nDemocrats Republicans moderates independents never Trump voters on the conservative side the whole of the Washington establishment so\nHere we are two weeks before the midterm elections the Democrats\n[noise] we have to win it\n\nThey've told everybody to the American people are tired at Trump and they want to get rid of him they realize their mistake they've been telling everybody there's going to be a blue wave it's fate accompli Nate Silver eighty five\nPercent chance two weeks out a bunch of bombs start showing up in places that the media can say that they are being received by Trump targets I'm Sorry I\nDidn't fall off the turnip truck ever and certainly not yesterday and the world of October surprises coupled with all the other realities I just expose them I think it only makes sense to be\nSuspicious and demanding of proof for whatever where we're going to be told\nMe because\nEverything's been so politicized everything now is being reported with in the context of how can it hurt Trump how does it hurt ... does it hurt\nAnd it happened we obviously people now back to the phones and go to stand point Idaho Casey graduated high\nHigh rests pleasure speaking with you today you bet great to have you here\nYou I wanted to refresh mercenaries memories of back in two thousand sixteen in Philadelphia at the Democratic convention were first day there were no American flags president there but there was\nPalestinian Craig present any side while outside they were burning Israeli flag and American flag Hillary Clinton get not condemn this to the point Donald Trump came out and black that her for not condemning immediately so what side inciting violence\nI Know I mean you can ... this is my ... you can cite examples like this all day long that are part of her ignored or not even referenced at all\nIt is is a a a clear one way street\nAnd if there are ever extremists on the left that the media makes a great effort to disassociate them from the mainstream of the Democratic party\nWhich they ah they aren't but see we can we can spend the whole day recounting instances from the past that point out the hypocrisy\nOf all that's being said about Republicans and tromp over these two ends of the the the fact remains here that despite\nEverything the media is hell bent on politicizing this or anything that will assist them in creating an anti Trump Senate heading into the midterms and that's how they first report these things like I say that this tragedy hit the synagogue and scroll hill\nSection of Pittsburgh I mean after reporting as many of the details as we're known men were often they're right on how Trump was responsible and how Trump may benefit or may get hurt by this and we hope that it changes people's minds as they head to the polls in a couple of weeks or what have you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "29"}
