you when we appreciate you being here with us today so we're going to get rid of him to this you're about six months or so I'm told them to your position with Cincinnati USA's convention and visitors bureau but you're certainly not new to the city itself so as you're working and you put your mark on Cincinnati travel and tourism what are you finding is the single biggest drawn to the city of these days and weeks\nWell again I really appreciate the opportunity\nTo an end to talk about this and certainly talking about this study is one of the most\nEverything that I get to do and when we think about tourism and we think about visitors Matty you know what really stands out for us I think it will be surprising to a lot of people as how strong arts and culture is here in the season when you look at the performance organizations that we have we have arts organizations\nTheater stage is it really a rivals like what you're going to find in Philadelphia Chicago and even sometimes right outside of New York's the Broadway shows the place that we get here it really just aren't that\nSound yeah it really is not in this with our history with our heritage and it is really one of those things that we see people coming more and more for overnight does its products in our culture\nJulie a little over a decade ago I'd say the nightlife him including restaurants in this uh in Cincinnati was\nPretty much nonexistent but today not only is there a happy nightlife with tons of new restaurants I've never seen unique museum like the American sign museum and someone I'm thinking of the city's flushed with new hotels and people I I think it really return to the downtown area and a big way and I know is on the planet name Cincinnati is one of the ten destinations to make its twenty Eighteen\nBest in the U. S. list that's huge could this be why\nIt's absolutely why we have made a concerted effort so much investment in our downtown core from our riverfront you know twenty blocks north of the two are over the rice area who really create a sense of vitamin C. sense of a\nPlace for Cincinnati in in the restaurants and the entrepreneur would like to call them are set to yours are that are popping up and he's really great faces and drug architecture all over town to create an experience\nThat you know when you come and it says that he needed it feels like a major metropolitan cities you don't feel like you're in the mid west are chef so when words every single day so we just had Ryan Santos from\nPlease take over the James Beard house in New York about a month ago and created a Cincinnati night it was one of the only nice it's sold out all year so\nFar at the gym the or at home and it's certainly just five and the feeling of\nReally just electricity and just gauge but that's happening in a\nLot going on there sure yeah so what we'll switch gears just a bit for the business travelers are already in Cincinnati and Delta Airlines you know there's certainly synonymous will make the city's also draw for some of the top design shops in the country you're also home to major corporations like Proctor and gamble Macy's kroger's and you have the pro sports teams like the reds and the bangles\nSo how influential are all these companies and teams and raising the profile of Cincinnati was travelers\nWhat you know you mentioned are two sports teams now up to you know cracking the we now have three professional fans\nHi so what we're talking major league soccer correct right on the pocket\nSo you know we we just got that designation back a day you know all these things have to work together from the tourism industry that this industry civic you need to really grow the reputation the vibrancy of of the city and when we look it will be happier now these\nAll these groups are engaged in a very big way to really grow the vibrancy of it's also a huge opportunity for us to bring more talent you know into the streets and there's a huge push among many of the corporations that are going to the day to bring more jobs in what town here and there was possibly that we have is the hospitality industry\nKeep ourselves vibrant investing classes because nobody wants to see that they hadn't exactly that is really important\nFor us to the restaurant the arts and culture the nightlife all those things to come to count the tractors and and we do our responsibility isn't that\nBefore we run out of time I'd love for you to briefly touched on entered ... junction and the nearby Kentucky I placed the ark and counter\nEntertaining junction about Fifteen miles north of Cincinnati\nAll the trains sip your a train enthusiasts like the history of all that that's certainly the place to be in a holiday thing you know the slaves and and what not to babysit surveys and out of it and then about city twenty miles\nSouth of society is ark and counter that is a replica of the ark and all sorts of things to do down there in terms of learning about history to fly and they have all sorts of things family individuals\nAnd I would say that they are the two two items that were surprised people don't Cincinnati which is always a question we like to end on so we're going to leave that there are some thanks very much for your time Julie ... and folks you can find out more and since the U.

in the world Scott McCartney as the middle seat column for the wall Street Journal is in front of the show and a frequent guest delight and a friend of mine delighted to have him on and he just flew the longest flight in the world easier to tell us about it Scott welcome to the show\nGreat to be with you Rudy alright what airline did you fly what can the aircraft and where did you go to\nSingapore Airlines have reclaimed the title of the longest flight in the world and this trip is from Newark to Singapore and saying that since coming back um it's more than Ninety five hundred miles and uh basically um to the other side of the world and they're using a brand new Airbus\nA three fifty dash nine hundred jet I'm that's configured for ultra long flying uh they've Airbus has modified the fuel system they restricted the cargo load a little bit on it\nUh and uh and it can um uh they face a fly for twenty hours um this this flight is scheduled at Eighteen hours forty five minutes and ... when I did it we had some favorable wind so it was a mere Eighteen hours\nIn the airplanes and it's interesting there are no regular economy seats uh you you wrote in your column that they're sixty seven business class eats a Ninety four premium economy seats and from the photographs\nI'm On a at least on on line a company with your column the seats are fairly I mean certainly better than the average economy plus seat in the U.S airlines\nYes yes there is a difference between premium economy particular with the international airlines and and what we think of is economy plus or the extra leg room you get on the domestic us airlines um premium economy on on on Singapore\nI'm In and it is nice and you're right they don't have regular economy because they think that would really be too cruel to wed somebody into a small fee for Eighteen hours\nUm but ... so this seat has an inch more with than a typical a three twenty Nineteen inches inside the armrest instead of Eighteen Inches um and in about six extra inches of leg room\nYou get a little bit more recline and it's actually if you if you think about it it's it's not all that is similar to what business class used to be long before the whole flatbed\nRevolution I'm so it's\nYou know it it was a comfortable seat um Singapore actually has um a specially designed that seat with some features for this particular flight it for ultra long flying um where there are extra supports for um for your cab as your legs things that will hum\nA reduced tension hum but you know at the end of the day I Can't sleep sitting up on an airplane um and I know many people\nCan see and it was the flight full you know it was I was\nFull I mean it's interesting with the premium calmly feeding 'em a it's two seats together on the side and that's that's nice and kind of spacious 'em before seats in the middle so you've got you know middle seats in the middle of the airplane\nAnd I think the people in that middle section in particular um you know it kind of trip where\nUh you know after about fourteen or Fifteen hours you get really restless and humid there\nYou had some specific tips we only have about ... with us from civilian switches drink more water which we hear a lot but really getting up every few hours even if you have to set your your iPhone or I've had to set an alarm so you walk around right\nYeah I think that's really important really important for circulation really important for fatigue um it it\nIt and it's a it is a good thing to do you know every two or three hours particularly if you're not sleeping or just you know if you're watching a movie you got to get up after the movie it's interesting one of the things they recommended actually drinking or\nA coffee and
