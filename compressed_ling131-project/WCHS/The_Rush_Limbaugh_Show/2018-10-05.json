the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd\nI don't think for for as far as flake is concerned he voted today for\nKavanaugh in us it's not technically a vote for Kevin lots of vote to go to a final vote\nAnd the rule of thumb always says that as these procedural votes goes so goes the final vote but the but like you can't make book on that simply because of the abject real frightening threat to these people are getting\nAnd I think the vote for flight today was really hard I'll tell you why he went from being a yes vote to being harassed on the elevator\nTo becoming a yes vote with the FBI investigation he got what he wanted and they're still leaning on him he's leaving the Senate this was his final term\nOr the easy thing to do here would be to vote against Kavanaugh and receive the praise of the mob and received the praise of the Democrats that he went ahead and he voted\nIn what many of us think is the right way he did the right thing is going to be attacked

here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right\nThe leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee and in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth I I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats\nLike this may fifth to be tied now I think I have some might relate to it I\nGot an email last night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned everything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there\nThat the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns medium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it\nIf the Democrats in the media wanted to know who they voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know what the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo ah never Trump or his or anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be said of Republican political consultant so they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left at impugn didn't made fun of so I get a known for her last night\nAnd she is explaining\nTo me what the camping on hearings have meant\nAnd what has happened out there\nIn these areas she has studied and she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together\nNow a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand sixth game that they did so for very specific reasons among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue to vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the capital circumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms\nIn other words in her study of things just contests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy our rainy all your favorite music all your favorite scene and offering\nMe a break from the world open the rainy lap dog a playlist

Delaware at the time the letter was written McLean former FBI spokesperson also worked for ...\nThe reason I'm going through all this is the balls the Ford is is using people that are tired and linked ... hip and the heart and the brain to Democratic Party activism from the FBI to the department of justice to the Senate Judiciary committee\nNow Monica McLean lawyer happens to be a guy named David Wasserman according to the Washington Post David I'm off men helped oversee\nThe investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server problem which she was exonerated\n... also helped oversee about Russian interference in the Trump election or campaign in two thousand six neat\nSo how is it ... balls the Ford ends up in the home of a woman who is tied\nTo the D. O. J. and the FBI\nAnd characters who weren't involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Trump Russia collusion investigation how does that happen\nIf you're just a woman out in Santa Cruz or Paolo Alto and you'll see that Brett Kavanaugh has been nominated to be on the Supreme Court\nAnd you don't think you should be because you think one time he\nAttacked you you send a letter to Dianne Feinstein to the next thing you know\nWell no no no that ... you sound fine signed a letter after traveling to Delaware to meet with your buddy Monica McClain\nWho probably writes the letter for you because of the inclusion of Cleveland Kaiser as a he is not a woman which she is\nSo you're just you're a beach bam a psychology professor whatever from California and you end up writing a letter after traveling to Delaware after saying you're afraid of flying\nAnd their lawyers don't tell you that the committee's willing to fly out to California to interview you\n\nI I I Want I didn't know I I ... I I Will you I Would have ... view in my home if you had ...\nI don't even think I buy this\nThey she didn't want them to come out there because she was going to go to Delaware to meet with McLean\nShe didn't want the committee seeing who she was meeting with\n\nThis whole thing required her to come to Washington for this to pull off she had become to Washington\n\nSo we look at Hillary Clinton's email server investigation and the Trump Russia collusion what are we find a woman who happens to be\nHelping balls the Ford defeat Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd his nomination to the Supreme Court
