last ... or the governor's answer on that is he thinks justice Lockerbie should step aside the governor calling that the right thing to do\nBut but governor justice at this point hesitant to call a special session until he hears what the house and the Senate wants to do a essentially saying the ball is and legislators courts\nOr what what I heard it described that I thought well that's that's a bit of a different approach than the governor might have had his first year or he was he was sometimes maybe too willing to say what he thought should happen and maybe should have allowed the other

want to find out more here is a number for you star star three to four that star star three to four messaging data rates may apply called star star three to four\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all Huffington puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated\nFamilies the board and how Trump didn't like the narrative and didn't want to last and so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this despite\nEverything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans at look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there are so you're about PCS the they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually you're not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that would do the Trump there's one the issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters began to\nI don't no doubt is the right word but they would be my\nTotally disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this\nCaravan is not going to get him if if if if some Republicans are behind this then there's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be somebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance in Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day\nJust decided to start walking to the United states to thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what conveyor politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because the money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so\nYou've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom we don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly think but I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams what would the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the ... in the street and they got maps in San Francisco for tourists can blame the piles of human feces\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with ...\nRemember they're vowing to begin or just hit the southern border may go they're vowing to get here by mid\nTerm election day so I don't walk enough to know\nHow many miles a day you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop and slow down and rest for the next day\nThat people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\n\nA hundred days for those are real Linda that's over three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for\nWhat two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nThe caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's\nYeah trials are expensive to make\nSure I can get your speaking gig if you don't mind performing for Chinese businessman who speaks no English\nOr he didn't have to understand but you'll get paid and then I Want you to contribute half of the money to our charity foundation is find the\nRight cause it will help rehabilitate your image and after they started sniffing around Terry McAuliffe we can't take any chances but\nYeah you're right Mike at Ninety per se you need a lot of help with your image\nJoin us next time on my group ... take you behind the scenes jewelry for president [laughter]\n\n\nAnd we're back great to have your Rush Limbaugh kicking off a brand new weak and broadcast excellence here and eight hundred to eight two to eight eight to [noise]\nOne more of a Louie Gohmert he is from Texas He's on with the bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill ... says\nMike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them are also deeply concerned with the violence provoked by some members of the group as well\nAs the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way the [noise] the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into my gold claiming they were inciting violence pond pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their right\nMind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people just storm the boarder who in the world wouldn't want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica\nWhat ever the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else\nSo Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what states\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember of the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they've they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nPolitical world it's so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting in one\nOf the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best\nFor being driven solely by emotion govern stolen by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a may I ask a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and said to the world come on it\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party has calculated that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democratic party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who think that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense take a look at the things they\nThe ... take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this and frankly I don't\nThink they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking them for generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage that the American people realize their mistake electing trumpeter Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason\nThe two thousands actually in midterms the American people were all of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't believe it but we got media narratives that a gigantic blue way of what's going to happen\nAnd we have that media narrative go on from December last year all the way through\nSeptember of this year\nAnd then and then the generic ballot started tightening and\nThen it began to look maybe it won't be as big\nA blue wave\nAnd Republicans look like they might actually gain seats in the Senate and oh no now the president's approval numbers is higher than it's ever been CNN's own poll forty four percent Rasmussen has trumpet fifty one\nThere is nothing happening that suggests say blue wave it's habit I frankly don't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth I\nEat election day people have to start revealing in these Madden cat for addictions projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can for the sake of their business\nIf they're in the polling business they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all of that's the case who would hire them\n\nSo now we're told well there's been a shift a little man it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways that Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republicans can hold the house foreign ways they could lose the house well a month ago there was no way the Republicans were going to hold outs\nNow all of a sudden we're starting to see that the blue wave may not I don't think they ever did I don't think you'd ever did exist I think it made up\nManufactured you'll get the poll result you want depending on when you take the pole and who you decide\nTo put in your sample there is no way\nThere is simply no way that a political party openly promoting this invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide when\nThe American people are not angry that we have not\n\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family is all that on good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nBecause of the optics I don't care if you're a militarized is the border if they bomb rushed the border like it down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and Senate back in the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to ... deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean you you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is the by the people who planned this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own she needs to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape bond film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer\nAnd Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot of different ways will be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nHave to get away with it or to Russian by be Mitt work\nVoter used to have a choice on election day

Honduras El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country in the coming illegal to the U.S we will now began cutting off or substantially reducing\nThe massive foreign aid routinely given two of them let me grab a phone call quickly this is Steven Gorman, California\nAnd that that that that uh [noise] after this I Want to go up to a line to Steve great great to have you how you doing sir doing good how are you sir fine and dandy great to have you on the program today\nHey great but I talk to your call screener and what I see is public Democrat Partridge injury because they had a problem and twenty sixteen spandex came out and voted for Trump looked at one of them too\nI've seen some stories that they are going to do at the time because the pocketbook issues\nWhen making good money taxes are lower jobs so if you park a whole thousands and thousands of people on that border and start running the storage we're talking about where the suffering there's no food is this and that is that you're looking at people who are the Ken banger country man maybe the extent of nieces and nephews\nAnd while you go to the polls that week beforehand and look at those stores warned about the ... level I think if there are dealt them with their strong sense of family I daddy into coming back to the party even though they know in their own interest they should vote Republican\nOkay All right so let's let's let's walk through this\nUnderstood correctly you think that this is a Democratic Party\nShouldn't be cause the Democrats are having problems with Hispanic turnout that happens to be true\nIt happens to be that more and and this is this is a presidential approval polling numbers Hispanics and African Americans are rating Trump's performance higher than anybody ever in their wildest dreams imagined it would be\nAnd in pre election polls the ... vote is trending Republican more than anybody ever thought it would be the Democrats are panicking over this and so if you're right than what they've done is put together this caravan\nOf Hispanics and Latinos hoping\nTo show how they are mistreated so that the Hispanics trending for Republicans will\nChange their mind and not vote Republican because these people will not be allowed in\nWhere is it written and the other but I go into where is it written that every Hispanic thinks like every other segment where is it written\nThat just because scientists panic limbs in the United states that every other Hispanic or to be allowed in\nWhere is it written\nThis is what it what identity politics gets us this is what the Democratic Party and the American media alliance around identity politics politics guesses every female thinks identically alike every woman thinks the same every Hispanic take whatever demographic group you're talking about and they're monolithic\n\nAnd so the caravan is designed to uh get some of the Hispanic vote tending toward Republican to change its mind\nI guess it's possible I I I I think the design behind this is much\nBroader than that I think there's a\nSeveral intentions here combined in this whole operation and I think the Democrats are are are missing the mark again as his ... is the case with practically everything they do it's it's it's packed with the seat\nThere's not there's not a single thing up front honest here\nThis this whole thing is a manufactured event it has to be this could not there's no way this spontaneous especially for the expressed reasons that were being given other escaping poverty and fill at war as well they don't have to go twenty five hundred miles to escape that\nNumber one\nNumber two they can't legally apply for asylum in the United states because they're supposed to do that in the first country they reach after escaping their own and none of them are doing that so it is clear that this is an invasion\nAnd it is it is clear that the purpose of this invasion it's just one prong of a wide strategy\nTo unwind the United states and transform it from the way it was founded\nThis is an invasion this is an attack this is an assault on the United states of America for the express purpose of transforming it into a gigantic welfare state\nThat has Democrats and the leftist in power in perpetuity that is the project that this caravan learnt this mob is participating in there or not\nThe whole ball of wax they're just the latest incarnation of this attempt\n\nInstead of their pride filling your tires with C.

the answer to me in the original rock rib conservative dead green ... he's loving to by everybody outside Texas thirty eight million dollars he raised in a court except there's a problem and that is it Ted Cruz has been creeping\nAhead in even the polling data and it's it's being acknowledged by the Democrats that that it is real and yet they have continued to maintain that Beto O'Rourke gonna be the guy and it can take out Ted Cruz\nHas anybody found a hundred thousand people trying to get into a Beto O'Rourke event\nYou have a venue that whole Seventeen thousand people who have anywhere between Seventy five thousand in a hundred thousand people who want to get to and that is not the kind of thing that happens with in a political party that is losing\nLosing favor losing support losing elections every where Trump goes these rallies\nYou know I'm not opposed this Rush Limbaugh dot com I have some friends\nAre out in a in the Phoenix area and that the Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona they thought about going through it until they got there and found out how impossible it would be they sent me a video that they took their iPhone tennis max\nDriving along the entire a line in order to make the video fit\nTo be in a size they could email to me they had to run it at twice normal speed\nAnd it's still thirty five seconds long it never ends and then there's a note this is that just doesn't even\nShow the people's exacting through the parking lots to get in there was a mile long line of people to get him to\nSee Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in how many people are showing up in standing in line because if they did local media may I don't know national media CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did\nIt would put the lie to the notion of the all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these\nKinds of rallies these ... these kinds of people what the Democrats are doing is continuing to show up where Republicans are having dinner and harassed\n\nThe turtle and his wife are at a restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky and some mad kept asinine\nProtesters shows up and just start shouting things a turtle just sits there doesn't acknowledge him doesn't move doesn't say anything\nThe other patrons in a restaurant or just watching all this go by but this guy's making a spectacle and I watched him talk about this on Fox today and they were talking about such and the weight loss to the show for it\nAnd this isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave and I said\nDecent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in a decent seat which is what we're up against the on the Democratic side or whatever you want to call a lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes\nPositive outlook\nThese are people enraged an angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\nThe ... the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me\nSomething\nThat's the number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump rally\nIs ten times the size of this mob\nThat is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures of the media is happy to show your those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture seven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can\nThat's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\nI Wish they'd use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play with a hundred thousand people in there\nSo you think that Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have march jumped through Mexico man walk out ... they are those people were really and we're supposed to sympathize with it they don't show you\nThe thousands upon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\n\nHow many of you by the way how many of you wouldn't joined a crowd of of of of Seventy five thousand people at a Seventeen or Eighteen thousand seat venue and yet they do I wouldn't I wouldn't if I drove by it's on the crowd that been from the get go home watch it on TV [noise] try to find it on\nTV that these people want to be there and you know who they are\nThey're not the elites they are the people who make this country work and they are the people that the Washington elites this day and\nThese are the people say they hate Trump for the same reason I don't like these people their average working people there from the working class there's nothing

unfortunate but this is what they this was what they take it all by taking this just\nYeah okay right so the responsibility for what happened to them has to be on them you would think the media is

whole bunch of emergencies in disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and now suddenly has become a just a static flat line\nJust a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever left us leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not\nBut the Santa would be great defense is is a is a Reagan night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump\nA but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing here and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward people have have ah\nExceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in

mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I Can't\nI Can't imagine people\nWho are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is supported\nBecause he's in the last line\nTo hold off on this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states\nCause they're deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to beat you got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democratic party of today wants to happen successful America needs to be punished whatever else is going on is still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes you are not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference\nAnd so more and more what they want by voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness the Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited extremism\nThe Democratic party has become the home of people sadly what psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed any way\nI mean this is just hands down at nist Andrew Gillum per se fantasize personify the exact total wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put but one of these up\nOn the digital camera if you're watching this is Joe Biden at a rally for Andrew Gillum the media is trying to hide the fact that nobody is showing up that is one view of a ... I don't know where this was that they have a chance to just grab some pictures here on the fly to break in the top of the hour\nThere are people standing single file on the second floor it is it looks like in the next picture you'll see a second look a high school gym\nAnd nobody's there and Joe Biden is the big draw and give them is sitting\nThere with somebody else in there watching bite and speak and there's no excitement in his room there's nothing anywhere near what happens if a Trump rally but these people believe that Biden is the answer\nThey believe by the answer to Trump at ... am not kidding you've seen as a news stories the last couple of weeks but the next picture up this was a a different shot of it a ... look at how tiny that you would put this Rush Limbaugh duck time I get these pictures up till you can see them um at our website eventually\nA tiny stage with Biden and give 'em there on the left is you're looking at it\nBut look at how how narrow the main floor is and how how few rose the the sides are and that's it and the Democrats the media just like they're not reporting the crowd size at Trump rallies and particularly the people\nCan't get in they're not talking about how few people are showing up at rallies lead and inspired by Joe Biden\nAnd I I'm telling you both of these are seriously under reported stories purposely this is the kind of crowd that you'll see at a party that's\nNot like the fires under I mean we we're hearing about how to Democrat based so motivated so inspired the Democratic base and affect the American people showing hate Trump they can't read the voter enthusiasm the media talks\nThe enthusiasm and the energy is all the Democrats ... well you can't see it\nAnywhere you look where there wouldn't be evidence of it\nThere isn't and where there is evidence\nOf massive energy massive desire massive expectations is on the Trump site and Trump happens to be on the Republican side and he's doing these rallies in tiny places other than\nJust recently except this one in Texas I mean he's been going into shore up the Senate help the house and so forth he's doing four or five of these a week now and everywhere he

difference is that we have a president who has the courage to do this well this is what he campaigned on this is what got him elected and it's it's not a gray area\nThe president of the United states
