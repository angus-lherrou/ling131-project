I Try to sit through it here there ... there are parts of all of this that just kind of make itch but you're trying to sift through it and and and I get it you don't\nLike the way the money was spent when it comes to the the senior status judges or you know the renovations in it mounted ministry nation that we've been talking about\n\nBut I've spent all along and there have been others who have told me that you may not like it but you know the that was all alters the rules they they\nAnd let's see what else we have here a than it did it to the Mollie Hemingway favorite part of Warren positively being one one thousand twenty fourth Native American is\nIt\nIs that her twenty twenty campaign is rolling it out as if it's not a complete\nSelf own how do they think this was a good idea I'll tell you how they think it's a good idea they say they're naming Trump wouldn't they think they're a balancing Trump remember Trump offered to donate a million dollars to focus on us as favorite\nCharity if she can prove that she were Native American so she's come out today and she is according to her doctor and sciences and so far she's established that\nShe is Native American and now she's asking Trump to pay off to the to the indigenous people circumcision for America group or whatever it is not very indigenous peoples uh circumcision information of resource that or some such thing\nAnd if Trump gives Trump's denying that he made the pledge even though we [laughter] she's just flat out denying it like ... ...\nA ... you ever had sex with that woman not a single time ever ... that's when Clinton was ... I I Do you need to go back and look what I said I did not say that at most Trump owns a oh it was one\nOne thousand twenty fourth of one million I run that number he always maybe most a thousand dollars\nIf he's going to pay a percentage of the million dollars\nThat equals her percentage of Native American that means he will do just a little over\nA thousand dollars if he wants to pay it let's go to the audio soundbites we have we have Elizabeth Warren herself this morning ah let's see this is on her website she released a video in titled Elizabeth Warren's family story\nIs it that Queen Elizabeth Warren's family's story in one part of the video poker hottest here talks to Stanford University professor of genetics Dr Carlos Bustamante and here is a portion of their conversation\nTalked to this to Montana please\nHunters genome did fine vibe segment of the Native American ancestry with very high complement where we believe in the air rain is less than what I saw um\nNow president like to call my mom a liar what is the\nFact that you have we have a Native American ancestry and you're just about half of all races\nWere needed\nDiscrimination neglected violence for generations and Trump can say whatever he wants to mocking Native Americans or any group in order to try to get me [noise]\nOkay\nNow I understand why Jim Messina and the rest of the gang it'll after all in a Twitter here because she is making at about her on a basically non story\nI mean this is the election coming up isn't there is a a single vote that has anything to do with her\nHasn't even announce for the president in fact she said just the opposite she says she's not going to run so given that why is she intruding here I'll tell you she thinks\nLike all they others on the left do they think if they can be the one to destroy Trump if they can be the one to illustrate that whatever they think of Trump is true that they will be Harold heroines are heroes they think they will be loves that adored that's there are so Trump focused their so Trump obsessed\nThat it is taking them off of their game again reminder New York times Elizabeth Warren is only ...\nWhen I but not he\nSaid that he was considering running for president got very alarmed and said look out for this\nGuy this guy could be the ... British people on our side this guy can be the sleeper this guy could run away with it and I looked at him it was on a golf course I said you guys are you sold her what you do last night and they insisted that they were serious so I bet\nI had to ask why in the world do you think this was just two or three weeks ago why in the world do you think Evan Na'vi it might be a month ago by now whatever yeah but not eat and you know what they told me he's there Trump rush that digs\nMichael ... is the Donald Trump of ... of what are you talking about\nHe's ... he's a phony\nHe's or Charlotte didn't he's a publicity hound\nHe's got no morals what I said that's what you think the Trump\nThat's why you think Trump got the ... oh yeah and this and they folks they were ... people on our side really fought the ... because in their minds Trump is an example of how the entire political system is deteriorating absolute chaos\nI just looked at him you know I don't know you guys I really don't know you guys I cannot\nMichael ... he's a joke everybody knows he's a joke issues of one percent here I Can't wait to tell the guys on the golf course out his weight within there'll be stunned anyway\nThey're showing that it's hopeless for Republicans just plug steel yourself for this this is predictable it was going to happen and they're also going to say that it's all based around Trump it's all based on Trump hatred it's all based on people rip regretting their vote for Trump\nA reading the direction America is going in all of that I just saw it happen on CNN\nA independent voters switching math ... Democrats in the run up to mid term elections\nAnd if I were you I've I've hold off on on believing it and as we get closer here I Know there's early voting going on we're going to tackle some of this\nI you know in an added to it in a way I Can't wait until the week before the election for a full court press because of the early voting that that is uh that that's happening out there so\nIt's just it's an ongoing effort to try to dispel people of popular myth\nThat the left bands together you don't ... I think one of the most effective ways of getting people to think about this\nHow many people have you heard people say this is the most important election of our lives and that's why\nIt's not this is not the most important election of our lives two thousand sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that's the kind of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now in the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho would be running various cabinet posts and the agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing\nIf you had people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of the elections um the the the drive by us have their formula\nAnd it's rooted in the desire they have it everybody hate Trump and so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result of polling data\nAnd since the media is so have strong they want everybody else to therefore the trans is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have a wake up and realize what a mistake they made voting for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks in the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in the history of landslides a Democrat Party deserves to get\nBy\nFor the tactics they have engaged in for the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nIt's just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and in a sand society they wouldn't be punished greatly\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the suppose it hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us\nWell I I mean what's ally we have wonderful relationship is a lot of people but we don't teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union no mine was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade\nTennis what they've done is hot and yet they it's not hostile sounds hobby you know some of the way they treat us what somebody can't in daily went in and the stupid country for so many years are you willing to get rid of that western alliance now I like they don't then is fine\nBut you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on re electing a don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but just so hostile hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean it sounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left we\nWant to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still\nFunctioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we should be forthcoming\nAnd tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves\nAnd this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises which say what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises that I don't know how big of a scoring points that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on it it will review says he's going to do something he's going to do it or\nDie trying we don't have a wall yet but not for lack of trying and we don't have the full repeal of Obamacare yet but not for lack of trying now the Democrats are often running here on a couple of 'em read birth issues I don't know if you've noticed it or not but all of\nA sudden Trump wants to once again take away health insurance\nFrom people with pre existing conditions where did this come from\nOut of thin air it came out of ...\nThere's no way Trump wants to do this there's no Republican I Want this is the reason the Republicans didn't go for a full repeal of Obamacare is pre existing conditions\nWhich you get down to brass tacks preexisting conditions being covered it's not even insurance there's no way you can get insurance\nIf your house catches fire and then go buy insurance nobody's going to sell you insurance wants to houses on the wire or after it's\nBeen robbed so we're not even talking about insurance but we are as far\nAs the general public is concerned so I don't know where all of a sudden Donald Trump and every Republican candidate for the house in the Senate wants\nTo take away health insurance or preexisting conditions when did this happen no Republicans out there saying that\nIt's sort of like when Joe ... a ... a George Stephanopoulos was interviewing 'em a while questioning Mitt Romney in a debate and he asked and you think that states should be able to ban contraception Romney looked the rest of what\nNobody is talking about that stuff and I I don't care for that he's talking about that one on one you think should ... right to ban contraception Ravi looks around I guess what we're not talking about ... George I don't think anybody I don't think anybody would even think of this I don't know why are you asking me I just want an answer quit stalling you states\nWill eventually Romney answered it\nAnd it didn't matter what the answer was it allowed the media Romney discusses states banning contraception [laughter] that's all it took and the Republican war on women was reborn and that's what this pre existing condition garbage let me see what the real issue with\nThe real issue that is raising its head out there that the Democrats don't want to talk about is immigration illegal immigration that remains the issue that color lessons\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussion is in the media came on\nThe part I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerated in some of the things that I Would tell him but my opinions of the media he said to her I had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest media until I ran for president\nI had no idea I being really serious with you you said\nAnd I I think that's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York media where it was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's made fun of him and they laugh but when he was a big gap appeared everywhere and they loved it\nGreat front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post when he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about Trump there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran and he was surprised in the white kind of like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised by this honest that's the word he uses instead of biased\nAnd I can tell you that that's true now what else have you learned that he didn't know but he knew\nBefore he ran for office and I think a lot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you an idea but now since he suffered the treatment he fully\nRush Limbaugh middle\nShiite fees network\nThey folks the IRS does not mess around you know this they have the power to take everything your bank accounts your paycheck even your home in business\nNow if you own back taxes it's about to get worse the IRS has added a small army of private tax collectors and their job is to find you to track you down\nYou need to call optimal tax relief they're the good guys the experts who do this best\nThey're experts in the fresh start initiative that's a special IRS program that could save you thousands even tens of thousands if you're qualified\nOne call can start the process just stop the demands letters stop the aggressive collection actions optimum has resolved over a half billion in tax debt for their clients\nThey are a plus rated with the better Business Bureau called for your free consultation now it's free calling you have options eight hundred nine seven three Seventy seven hundred eight hundred nine seven three Seventy seven hundred\nThirty years ago the tradition started we buy cars if we buy cars every day at Laredo since about themselves\nWant to sell your car or truck these so you're far truck for\nOver three decades we've been buying cars and trucks to give us a traveler dolphins auto sales located the notch run for on the Web and Larry dolphins dot com all three of four seven to seven four six four three or four seven to seven zero for six\nAt Thomas health we're your personal choice for wellness from quality can focusing on your individual house today\nThat's why our outpatient services are here to get you better faster already had an order from your doctor bring\nIt to us and we'll schedule your appointment for you it's not easy for more information check us out at Thomas ...

Obama certainly didn't for separation of just didn't get reported because Obama was cool and couldn't do anything wrong and if it was happening when Obama dead at dinner had to be good reasons for it\nRemember we've got a\nTwo tier system of justice in this country and we have a two tier system of media\n\nWe'll see if it was on the books but he didn't enforce it what is that what\nYou mean it was on the books that Obama didn't enforce the law but Trump he has enforce it but the Trump didn't make the law\nThe Democrats Leslie stall included attempted to make people think that Donald Trump\nPurposely wrote a law or just enacted one that's separate they don't run from their family the ... and you wouldn't believe the number of brain dead people actually believe this happened\nI was watching an episode of law and order in your S. U. V. the other night and they had a whole\nPremise some guy keeping abandoned kids in his basement in a cage was a hero because he was saving these kids after Trump policy him force them to be at the end and he was saving\nThem and he was just running child sex rings with them but they tried to make this guy out to be somewhat of a hero\nBecause the whole point of the episode was to bash Trump for separating families when it's a law that he inherited I've looked explain why the law exists and it's above and beyond they're having to be consequences for coming here illegally has to do with the quest for asylum and the fact that\nWhere the parents are taken while their cases are decided is not suitable for kids the kids were put in much better surroundings and Sanders while their their family their their their adult parents cases are being adjudicate there's nothing\nThere's nothing me this is the United states of America we do not do the kids what these people are trying to tell you the Republican Party does the kids it's quite the exact opposite it's just more in a smear\nThat the Democrats on the left of engaged in an Trump does not back down from it and even as I say for writing magazine was stunned that Trump got away with dominating even with these questions a couple of more before the break up next she says do you think that climate change is a hoax\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose\nMillions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage I Wish you can go to Greenland watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the oceans raising the sea level and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know\nExactly and you don't know that it doesn't happen all the time anyway you don't know\nWhen it started you don't want it and did you don't know how natural it might be\nBut did you hear her say that the chunks of ice falling into the ocean or raising sea levels\nI remember one time on this program way way back in the nineties discussing this in fact there are two things the first I pointed out because I read it and the Heritage Foundation are actual report that this was during the spotted owl earth first\nA natural forest station controversy that was all part of a global warming craze in the early nineties and I pointed out that there were more acreage there was a more acreage of trees are more trees\nIn America then in Nineteen Ninety ... at our founding\nThe left we're fatty they said I was insane that couldn't possibly be true that we had come along and we had shot down trees and we haven't replaced them and make things out of the trees and they thought I was just insane I\nPointed out you people misunderstand something yeah we cut down a lot of trees but you know what we plant for trees this is\nThe wood industry they need what right do you get what you have to grow trees\nIt's not a finite resource and for every tree it's cut down for new ones are planted it's part of the policy a warehouse there is one of the big companies that was doing this they wouldn't they wouldn't listen to it that didn't compute they couldn't begin to fathom that\nThey couldn't understand anybody seriously claim more trees more forest more forested acreage in Nineteen Ninety two than it was in the Seventeen hundreds\nDidn't make sense to them because they don't understand capitalism or economics everything's in zero sum game if a company came along and dropped out a bunch of three years to build a bunch of houses or whatever and and that's that was trees that were gone forever it's why they don't want your cut down the redwoods that ever come back you know I'm the same token\nI remember saying it's still true today there was another report just last week that there are more trees forest and acres in America today than there were even fifty years ago the second one was when when I um when I pointed out\nThat are falling ice\nFrom a glacier or light green them is going to raise sea level I send us like ice in a glass melting I said it's not going to raise the sea levels I said those ice cubes being jumped into the ocean and not going to raise ...\nYou're crazy it's crazy you know what you're talking about of course it's going to raise ... no it\nIt was a national outrage mind when cotton jacking up the price of

by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop you can be called black\nWhat that's exactly right intersection holiday requires quantification yeah\nAnd so when we need to know how much of a percentage oppressor you are versus oppressed\nThis ... this this world is is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives is about her future run she needs to tell her base\nI'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of across her to\n[noise] would you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists\nConcept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define that\nLet glad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so you're more than welcome that's on a good host I have ever that no one little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection out comes straight out of Marxism march said that at every one is either on a presser or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl a target\nAt its later it's now being adopted to the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how oppressed and how much of an approach where you are\nIt's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other it spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's red intersection Natalie for me\nGreat honor to wash your you're talking you're you're\nSpeaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that is why it's so successful\nUm yes any intersection adult eight actually has basically something that has been constructed by these marches just saying that all of these different leftist organizations Meek somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that I'm\nA cohabitation it's with that with militant Islamic lists that then with illegal immigrants and their activism and we're all of these people intersect is why they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops up some\nAbsolutely so now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim that particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old pressed she's asked him anyway she's a woman therefore he's oppressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth India and she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know I if I could say you know I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you'd never see me but believe me I'm whites\nHowever what I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa\nWell that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professorship in African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times more of a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American his\n... just submitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor\nAfrikaners are not black uh I well I I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to black skin okay All right\nI just want to ... because a sub Saharan this is somebody what do you mean ... what is it what it was it and then you start to talk of the sub continent than some people really get confused you're jumping from from India\nOr overt sub Saharan Africa is below those arid desert or which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it\nThere is some north of this arid desert as well now I get I I I get your point a and\nHer reason for doing this all of that not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this\nBecause they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything but distract\nFrom the mid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow a away and so there are some people who are on the left are claiming that she selfish and and trying to haul good what is a lot of light being shined on politics right now because of the\nBecause the elections I I think a lot of his is rooted in they have Trump ISIS many of them do\nAnd they live and breathe to expose Trump for whatever they think he is to the point that people have bands and\nI'm Glad you waited a Scott\nVery much thanks so much John in Tacoma, Washington your next I'm Glad you waited too high\nOh thank you and make it through those from under the shadow mount Rainier sir\nI appreciate um thank you\nWrote them and just wanted to uh talk about the the movie guys now I heard you on your Thursday and friday show last week you were you were speaking about that movie so I decided to go check it out\nThat would be friday I was ... yes yes yes\nSo I got a moment after work I raised over to the theater I I I watched it over there but um [noise]\nI wanted to I I I just want to portray how ... and he was he was a very very powerful movie you can to illustrate that I just want to share the experience of what happened after the movie\nI'm normally when you go to a movie theater you watch a movie and then the the credit start rolling in the music playing and you see people they they start getting up and filing out of the theater and they're talking to each other and stuff\nBut this did not happen at the end of the movie guys now\nAfter the after in the movie was over the the credits began to roll and the music played and and after after a while all all the credits finished and the music stopped and everybody was still seated\nThey're smoking I Need to ask you this because there's one thing about this I'm I'm I made a calculation when I was talking about those on friday to not mentioned something about this movie because I did not want to frighten people or deter them from going to see it\nOh God what but but what I'm not asking you know identify that but what if anything surprise you that you didn't know or just just surprised you period even if you think you didn't know what about\nThe movie what did you learn you didn't know\n[noise] [noise] well I I didn't know about who Mr guys now was um I ... I was not familiar with the case or anything like that um but that wasn't that wasn't really the the the powerful peace about it but I guess the\nThe\nWhat what made it what made everybody if they were all feeling like me and all sitting down and not moving after the movie was over ... was it was it was about an abortion doctor yes but this this was a movie about a murder trial and but during the murder trial the um there\nNow and that's just to deal rush my\nMy grandfather was one quarter it was his grandmother my mother was one eight I Am one sixteen but if you're not on the Cherokee rolls and the only tribe in Oklahoma that doesn't live in a if you don't if you're not in the world and it was shameful\nAnd so what do you think she is doing what he thinks what she's doing with is Susan\nIt's it's Barbara Streisand rush\nI'm a sixteenth I'm sixty four years old almost in the weeks if she were it but it doesn't matter if your mother or your grandmother great grandmother didn't Cherokee are the only tribe in Oklahoma you had to sign the road and it was shameful\nFor a Indian woman to marry a white man and they didn't think they wouldn't sign up it was shameful\nWhat about the hot chick bugs businesses that ah that's\nBaloney [noise] I Am one sixteenth rush and I can't be a Cherokee and I didn't want any of their benefits I was just kind of kind of proud of it but if your name is not on the road you're not a Cherokee and then well\nIt just it just goes to show me here you are one sixteenth and you're not eligible is what you're saying if I'm hearing you right she's one thousand one of one thousand twenty fourth it's all about the identity politics with these people she wants\nThat to say something significant about her what would that be I mean it it it it it [noise] it's all silly and that the people denying that she used this for employment I think that's the sole reason she did it\nTo be able to demonstrate she had some minority blood qualify her to be hired at Harvard\nRush Limbaugh simply really tell me ER be worse\nHey folks the IRS does not mess around you know that they have the power to take everything your bank accounts your paycheck even your home in business\nNow if you all back taxes it's about to get worse the IRS has added a small army of private tax collectors and their job is to find you to track you down\nYou need to co opt them a tax relief they're the good guys the experts who do this best\nThey're experts in the fresh start initiative that's a special IRS program that could save you thousands even tens of thousands if you're qualified\nOne call can start the process to stop the demands letters stop the aggressive collection actions optimum has resolved over a half billion in tax debt for their clients\nThey are a plus rated with the better Business Bureau call for your free consultation now it's free calling you have options eight hundred nine seven three Seventy seven hundred eight hundred nine seven three Seventy seven hundred\n\nIt's October and the temperatures are dropping wanted Walker Chrysler dawn gee Bram the deals are just starting to heat up\nWalker is West Virginia is number one ... leadership and they are overrun with inventory Walker has its largest to lecture the majority since they've been in Oregon with over four hundred vehicle to choose from Jean and Ryan have\nA new car you were looking for with prices you can turn down come check out our own new completely redesigned twenty Nineteen ram Fifteen\nHundred group they're big on upgrade that old for sure if he could get over ten thousand dollars off Amazon ...
