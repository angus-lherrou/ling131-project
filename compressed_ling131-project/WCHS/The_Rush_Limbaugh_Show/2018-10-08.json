B.\nI. documents released she wants a full fledged\nInvestigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking talking about Jerrold Nadler of a house Judiciary Committee ranking member of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house 'cause they're gonna impeach cabinet they're going to investigate them getting thrown off the court\nThey're not they're not going to let this side this cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging\nIn what you and I would call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I Know it's not even tried like ... ... we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not folks that I that I don't I don't want to fall back on that to suggest that this\nAnger they feel is not legitimate if legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a democratic voters is less than what we think it is\nBecause some people have announced that they accepted money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing and twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the Democrat rages real and it's been a real sense election night\nTwo thousand sixty and they thought they are going to win that aren't they gonna win at a landslide they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the electorate and consequences\nThey censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it they simply cannot deal with it and rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it rather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why I Am\nThe Democrats think that this is gonna win spy or turn out that it's going to win ... buyer of all kinds of enthusiasm\n[noise] what else might be doing there are a lot of people folks who are not\nEven worse than the sword daily and the ebb and flow of politics and these people largely believed that Democrats are\nSilent and quiet reasonable and tolerance and caring and compassionate and look out for the little guy you know all the old cliches\nDonald Trump\nAnd by the way a lot of people think Susan Collins was the turning point no Susan Collins was not the turning point Susan Collins ... didn't change any votes but she did something far more important than the votes Robert cast by the time she gave her speech on friday afternoon she did something\nFar more important than that which will discuss as the program unfold and I want to turn this was Trump\nTrump and his rally where he was accused of mocking Dr Ford you didn't mock Dr Ford he didn't imitate her he didn't make fun of her\nHe's simply repeated the truth of her testimony she doesn't know who what when where why she doesn't know how she doesn't know when she wearing happened what for a second what ruins she didn't know any of that\nThe reason that was important is because nobody reads that drive by media know any of that in the hearings Christine Ford's assertions were not challenged\nThe initiation and it lasts for a while not until the next justice shows up but it last for a while but Sotomayor is not going to be getting in his\nCoffee and he's not going to be demanding in fact he named his law clerks you know he's the only Supreme Court justice ever with for female law clerks\nAnd of course do you think that it's garnering him any credit with a weapon it's exact opposite they're saying well he wants to easy pickings\nWell that is that's\nHow they're reacting to what he wants to easy pickings he's not any of the ... we all know who have it all is here's this woman and he wants four of them right there on the on line that's how they're reacting to bad\nAerial dumb ass also criticized Kevin offer invoking his family in the wall Street Journal op ed she wrote it's not automatically moral achievement there'd be a son a husband that daddy it's biology illegal decision in biology again\nPlenty ... I Can't read but she says that a family show\nAnd then she admitted she was emotionally shattered by the current state of affairs which just proves the theory that Democrats are mentally disturbed people who project or mental problems on to the public on the politics that is exactly what is happening here\nDo not underestimate that and don't think that I'm I'm I'm being flippant or exaggeration or to make a point I really do believe that we're talking about mainstream mental and psychological disorders becoming standard operating procedure politics\nThe American but there's no other way to explain this\n\nNow folks to show you how to range and this is I have in the stack today I have um two maybe three one night when called teachable\nMoment things they are opinion pieces that appear in the mainstream media both today and over the weekend\nThey are related to Kevin ...\nButton they\nThe pieces attempt to say what all of this means for America and of course for the\nFor the Democrats and much of it is I mean I just saw dead wrong in the simple recitation of the facts of all this because it stuns me\nThat people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and reacted them they continued to react to what they think has gone on based on how they feel and these are some of the standard bearers of American journalism on the left\nOne of them is a is John Harris at Politico one of the founders Democrats fear of there are a wet rag party you know what this piece was about this piece is about how the Democrats get their rear end handed to them every time because no the Democrats are a bunch of cowards\nThe Democrats have no guts\nThe Democrats are a bunch of paper tigers Democrats what Republicans walk all over\nNow how many of you think it's the exact opposite this is pretty common to there are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side is among Cho was\nBut I don't know how anybody paying attention on the left can think that their side to a bunch of ... but the fact that they do is fascinating to me\nNow here's another such pace and we have a site that this woman once before I don't remember specifically when her name is Alexis Grinnell she has written on gender and politics for the New York daily news the Washington Post and other outlets\nShe had a piece on Saturday in New York Times it may have been actually published on Sunday and released on the Web on Saturday Night the dates I told her sex since I don't read the paper anymore I don't know when this stuff actually shows up in the print edition\nSo my guess is this thing was released Saturday Night on the Web to be published in the Sunday paper but it could have been on a Saturday papers well doesn't matter white women come get your people\n\nI I don't even know where women who is thoughts are this convoluted you're going to hear\nI don't know where they come from I\nDon't know who's responsible for creating the molding would I think it's gender studies I think it's a combination of feminism and gender studies\nThat\nLiterally corrupt young minds in fact there is a there's a there's another link the piece today\n\nThat describes a hoax three self described leftists\nRan on active duty\nIn a nutshell three academics self described left winners\nAre doing a kind of project Vera tossed like ... of how left wing journals except crazy studies as long as they contain the right buzz words and support leftist doctrine and they've got moved journals\nOf higher learning in applied disciplines of the academy to accept auditor nonsense\n\nAnd one example of this as a feminist journal in academia accepted an anti male rewrite of mine comp these hoax jurors reroute a free thousand word essay\nOf mind comp\n\nAnd tool that as anti male pro women feminism and this journal accepted\nSo basically they accepted a piece an excerpt from Adolf Hitler's mind comp read too old to have terms that would be buzz words and knee jerk reaction causes to them and they ended up falling forward left\nHook line and sinker ... the reason why I left wing or is there doing this because they're worried that the disciplines\nThat they trust and believe in our being shattered by a bunch of absolute gobbledygook insanity and so they have prepared a series of hoax essays and papers and presented for peer review journals of higher learning on the academy\n\nThere are obvious hoaxes the anybody who knows anything about the origins of the papers that served as the basis in this case mine calm\nBut this group of women accepted an essay right out of mind comp with just a couple or three words your terms changed to make it look like it was an anti male pro feminist piece\n\nOrderly embarrass the details of this or long and detailed in in the weeds\n\nBut it is that kind of thinking it makes me wonder or makes me realize where people like a Lexus Grinnell come from\nWhite women come and get your people let me give you a sample poll quote given idea what I'm Talking about white women benefit from patriarchy by trading on their whiteness\nTo monopolize resources for mutual game in return they're placed on a pedestal divvy cherished and revered as Speaker

don't believe in a blue wave either but\nIf they do yeah our country is based upon a very fragile tension almost\nOh I agree with you totally his point I'm only taking\nOver here 'cause I got twenty seconds and and I'm a communication specialist a say a few words as possible uh David here is worried that despite victory here the left has gotten so deranged that they threaten the very structure of America with that range and with violence\nAnd bullying in can't they intend to basically strip away\nEverything democratically\nElected simply because they don't like it using violence and bullying and it's a legitimate concern there's that's why they have to be defeated at the ballot box to start with anyway it's a good point uh at we will elaborate on that today I intend to do anyway no\nRush

nothing new about it but particularly its in its relevance its power\nAnd it's important has been magnified in this current cabinet fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that\nThat was forced on the American people by a leftist activist judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively they need\nActivist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the point what they\nBelieve in\nThe idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their

and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and massage sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively are you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review this everything they want everything they\nHave achieved outside

the whole process because hearing and then if you have time I'll tell you how you converted my wife's from my mom and listen to one of your most loyal fans which is a crazy story but\nAnyway with a with a capital hearings which so\nSinister and ironic and all this is if you remember back to Bill Clinton and and the accusations that came out against him in the early days of not not out early but we are\nFor the accusations with him on the media Saturday Night live a every talk show on the news outlets they totally destroy these women may lead followed her looks they make fun of the way\nThey marched through stories of the faith discredit them they questioned the motives on what Dr Ford were uh you have someone that doesn't remember anything you have victims remember in particular leader Broderick the time the place to who what where when ...\nI'm In the army is so disgusting and there's no political motive\nWith with a Bill Clinton's victims because they were members of his own party\nAnd that's the sickness of all this and I think the senators and this whole process now have perfect\nWeapon to use a and I hate to call it a weapon but the the perfect reality slap is to bring this up and and and call it out I mean a polo see Schumer I'm a bourbon and number of them would even take a call from ... to ... a member of their own party\nYeah ... ... they had the chance to do that and and uh they didn't want to go there because they couldn't take the risk of offending people who believe bossy\nBut the fact of the matter is and I will say it again the Democrats don't care about sexual assault\nAs evidenced by your recitation of the facts of what happened to women who accused Bill Clinton they weren't destroyed and Hillary Clinton ran the unit that did the destroying it was called the ... rupture in June and it was Hillary in Sea Bright\nBob Menendez Democrat Senator ten void reelection Lee New Jersey was caught\nRunning around with one of his donors in the Dominican

you name it it was just the vehicle they have tried it with Clarence Thomas Anita Hill got close so they wanted to relive history and try this again\nUm I don't think any of it ... was real when you look at the Democratic activists that were involved with ... forward I think the whole thing was strategize\nNow it's interesting you bring up the Clintons grab audio soundbites ten and eleven Saturday Michael Smerconish has a show on CNN his gas was James Carville and James Carville as the guy in discussing Paula Jones during the Clinton years\nUh Paula Jones sued and Clinton for for a number of things and that's where Clinton got in trouble by some warning perjury uh and lying under oath and a grand jury testimony lost his law license for a year ah it was James Carville\nSaid drag

bill a hundred dollar bill\nRight while they wait cargo still proud of the remark\n\nHere's the question what does it have been better for the GOP if Kavanaugh had failed because then the base wouldn't be so mad so ticked off they all come out to vote in November\nYeah that's the money question and I just found myself today than the Democrats Kavanaugh's is worth a lot more alive and dead this is not going to go away they're not going to stop doing stories on Kavanaugh that can you know they're going to keep in front and center and he's not going to go away in ... defeated him\nThey would have just pick someone equally is right wing his cabinet on at a random through in a in a lame duck session and I think today's and solve this problem with that if you could help all Kavanaugh is going to be an issue in two thousand Eighteen is going to be an issue in twenty twenty\nThe Democrats are going to keep digging up stop the presses not going to stop all of the things that they're working on about ... well\nIt sure sounds to me like there is a coordinated effort to continue destroying Kavanaugh\nAnd here's carnival as a matter of fact we got all that they have that guy on a coke and he's I've got a call waiting and keep looking at it I got ...\n\n... is ram somebody else and they have cameras all had had been beaten ram somebody else in the lame duck session and we
