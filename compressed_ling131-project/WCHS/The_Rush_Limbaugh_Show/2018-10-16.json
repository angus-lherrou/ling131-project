it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously\nKnown and told you about and most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about\nThe Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but then if you look at\nThe reality\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq who's saying all in two thousand ten [noise] do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama go through the two thousand four team in terms\nOf the Democratic party lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships\nA you even go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over\nA hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more in the end the dance that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nI'm not a real lecture tomorrow we're going to sweep big never going to wipe out the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had it they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination\nSomebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed older polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue Joe Louis to the point that after the two thousand sixteen elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties\n\nNow the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago\nSo from two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nRock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party\nNobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen what is it that has stopped the trend\nPeople in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean they're having the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people have been voting against you\nHe told me the judge threw it out on the basis that it was a bogus\nLawsuit it had no merit a carnival Barker third rate one lawyer this creepy ever not a guy\nWho some people were actually thinking could end up being the Democratic presidential nominee in twenty twenty\nI went through this you have to there are some prominent Republican analysts to really think that it could have I been boggles\nThe mind but it's rooted in Trump patriot by the way it's thinking you have a lot it can be the Democrat nominee is rooted in being a never Trump or at any rate\nNo matter how you slice it in real life on the ground however you want them to tournament determine reality of defined it described it the Democrat Party has not been winning elections and they have not been triumph thing\nIn enterprise is they have undertaken to persuade the American people to agree with them like Kevin all with Dr balls e Ford\nAnd now Elizabeth Warren make no mistake they misread dislike you can't mystery in anything I'm sure that Elizabeth Warren as if Democrats told you have to live with that she's doing this three weeks out from the terms\nDon't buy that they're ... they're limited it's blowing up in their face this was one of many are sober surprises these people have been\n[noise] what's the word\nAll rationality to the extent that they ever have any has been a raced Trump is driving them literally crazy they're acting talking behaving in ways so counterproductive they've lost their cool I'm sure that there\nWas a national outrage mind when\nCotton jacking up the price of

when the different times yesterday about this\n\nNow I'm not a denizen of Twitter\nBut I Know a lot of people who are and in the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown when you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people\nTwenty times attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making\nBut what was it themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studies to focus on us this DNA did not actually use samples of Native American\nDNA the Boston Globe quotes and make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr\nCarlos ... samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for native\nAmericans now she's out there touting that it's true or she is an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth [noise]\nAnd there wasn't even any Indiana Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to I mean it's laughable it is the static\nAnd I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each and every now they're saying\nThat what Bill Clinton did with Monica ... no no no no no that was not abuse that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\n\nSo Hillary Clinton is making it and I asked him or herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out\nIn order to save both herself and her husband or soon to be marking on what\nA stadium chore Oh yes bill\nAnd Hillary aren't going to mark a nationwide stadium to or were they are going to go and hopefully draw crowds at twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged them like this I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do it anybody can do it they're going to try to get\nIn on it there's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say\nNot like people care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say there is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor that Trump\nHas the Hillary certainly does and they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent have it and I'm Talking about this ... type of charisma\nBack in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had it and they believe the aura was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\n\nThe lake a Donald Trump you know what this is why does it like the Democrats trying that come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring and Gary Hart parents\nSome ... some of the state treasurer of Texas they gave a radio show Mario the pious they gave her radio show in the media\nHighlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who'd never done it before as the rush killer every one of them was anointed end inaugurated as the Democrat that\nWas going to steal the limelight away from this program then Air America came along and uh and they did the same thing and it\nNever has happened every attempt to supplant take over\nRelegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds and the one that you may think rush there are enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks\nYou may think that\nWhat we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't draw applies to a campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people in\nThe country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons\nCompanies not waiting with bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a brief moment to this\nThis notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple of audio soundbites\nNate Silver this is the guru David analyst on the left who used to be the New York times and then he went to ESPN and then he\nWent to five thirty eight and then he went to vox back to five or five thirty eight is his company any took into various places\nAnd the Democrats the rank and file Democrats live and die by what Nate Silver tells them for example Nate Silver on election night two thousand sixty five PM\nGave Hillary Clinton and playing an eighty nine percent chance of being elected president so they were all thinking it was over in the same thing is happening now Democrats Seventy three percent chance of retaking the house of representatives\n\nDemocratic voters breathing is huge sigh of relief Nate Silver is continuing report that he was on um\nThe FiveThirtyEight dot com politics podcast and the host was Jody ever gotten who is a guy and the question has the\nGender gap increased since\nKevin ... a lot of takes on Kavanaugh on the effect that he had are drawn by like male pundits who are in her most social\nNetworks right especially for Republicans where the Republican kind of consultant and pollster and an expert community is very male journalists are pretty male has hasn't changed that much maybe a little bit improved after the conventional wisdom about like the effects Kevin I Will have I think are governed by that\nA lot in our forecast you now see a clear split between the house in the Senate where the G ... summit chances continue to improve but the Democrats house chances actually are back on the upswing now kind of since the Kavanaugh nomination\nA ... it's it's kind of not like it's kind of just the Kavanaugh fight has energized Republicans far more than Democrats and all of these house races\nThat the Democrats are assuring their voters are they want\nThey're too close to call right now there's a whole bunch of 'em that are too close to call this is it in the bag for them but they're voters need to be told that it is they've set that up\nThey've been on this blue wave business for so long that if they come off of them even a bit that causes a crisis of confidence among the Democrat voting base they can't do that but folks I'm telling you I'm I'm maybe I'm even asking for your input here\nVery briefly again starting in two thousand ten rock Obama being done the destruction of the Democratic party as an electoral apparatus they lost twelve hundred seats between two thousand ten and two thousand sixteen\nThey continue to lose seats in the two thousand sixteen race which Trump one which they thought was a walk landslide win for them\nThe last elections that approach what's coming up where the two thousand

if I Want a previous visit he had logged into their wife I work with a password then his watch would connect to be a wife fight if he had also entered\nThe wife I network password on his watch that's just the phone is not\nNearby I just don't think any of that happened\nI don't know how proficient this guy was with tech ... it is possible that his watch could have recorded everything\nOn why fight if he had actually answered the consulates wife fi network password independently on his watch just because the the phone has has been long gone with the password does not mean that the watch as\nEvery device connecting to a wide find out more half to go through the password nothing is automatic now Apple's got really simplified here you know you'll people may not notice ... and may have happened to you to know what I'm saying let's say that you are going over to uncles IQ sauce\nAnd uncles IQ has a wife I network and you're going over there and when you get to uncle leaks house you ask ... or the password to his wife you don't have to do that anymore all you have to do is make sure uncles IQ is in the room with you in whatever room you are in the house\nAnd then on your phone you go and turn on the wife I network find a wife I network at the minute you do that ... will get it alerts saying do you want to share your wife I network with others in your house and my uncles equal click yes\nAnd that will send the password for his wife I network to your phone you are big estimate it will do this automatically that way hosts do not have to remember their passwords and do

idiot proof and simplify all this\nBut I'm just telling you that ... would have had to have entered the wife I network password to the Saudi consulates ... on his watch even if it was already done on his phone even if needed to do it on his watch in order to activate the wife I network or access it\nIf he done that if his watch works on why fight in that constantly then he would have been able to

not sure you log into it you're watching is not logging on to the network your ... your watch is connecting to the phone the phone controls your watch as long as the Turin range\nThe phone determines

the wife find out what kind of conflict and it would have had to have a password entered on that watch\nI'm saying the odds of this\nI don't think most people with a watch nowhere to go into the password nor how to do it you can't dictate that you have to you have to use the rebel app and use your finger to draw individually every character that's in the password\nAnd if you try to make AT T and it comes out as a plus sign you have to know to back it up as you did it wrong it's not an easy thing to do\nAnd I just I don't I I Am a long way of saying I Would be really really shocked if
