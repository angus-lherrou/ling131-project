those three D. photos hacked on Facebook\nOur money to his moments away it's ten free things at every Amazon Prime member gets you don't want to miss this and back to the phones we go with a let's see him in young ville Louisiana\nEither him hey how are you I'm fantastic how can I help you today sir\nI got a three part question right here I'm\nIn Boston for ... all along reputation management mhm I guess my first let them or be like what would be the best all around that I can find for small medical office\nAnd also what I was looking at it those old or a I'm a software that you ... and then the the F yelled at such an engine optimization have to go to all all L\nAll right well let's talk a little bit so so what's going on with your business on line\nWell the problem now than what some of it but it's obviously what most of us have is you know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out of the bed ridden balance it out\nBut obviously it doesn't work that way you know are the people who have experience it's usually doesn't go online and put post there the\nPositive experiences have with you at your business [noise] so what I'm up here it's mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses so what I needed to find something for someone to neutralize the negative responses that's happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation type management farm okay is I Would encourage you to do this yourself because\nYou are may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this all works okay\nBecause as a as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too is that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody to do the job when you've already done the job right [noise] right and so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp or where where is it going to last for all the\nMedical school it's like ... grade a car okay all lady they use excel\nAnd get so OK you a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nPhil anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay because I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for\nYou know if they had a great time they're happy to do that and you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before because they you know can you help on line and\nJust drop some wrapping up there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now out weighing the negative reviews okay okay so that's the ... the other thing you can get let me finish\nThe other thing you can do is with health grades is drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it\nAnd what I have heard is that when you do this is that health grades will remove it health grades also has a program called recognize Dr status\nAnd that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay um there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam I get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business you'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to accentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization and to learn\nWhat it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say over five thousand dollars we'll put you at the top of the Google Search results\nThat well right All right well you know you can be at the top of the Google Search results right now and it's not going to cost you a lot of money because you can do a cost per click campaign so somebody types in whatever your medical profession is in your town within the ZIP codes\nHe may be pay ten cents for every click but you're not going to be at the bottom of page you're not going to be on page too so you start thinking of different ways that you can market your business instead of putting that money and depending upon somebody else to quote unquote get rid of the bad stuff on line\nOkay does that make sense\nIf it does it say um I I Do promote customers or try to us than to\nOn and put on a positive review forest is just to get them to do it as like a should I Try to at a pet or something\nYes and that's a rank them then they can you do it here now\nYeah you put it I've had right there exactly ah that's really smart and\nNumber you know and you could have a former they fill out you know positive and then they check a box that says this this can you know this goes up to health grades or whatever it may be\nBut the other thing too is you can have a basket their gift basket and every thirty days we pick a winner from that gift basket okay\nSo we pick a winner from somebody who did who left a positive review or somebody who left agreed review for us light\nAnd so and that's that can be on that little cart or that can be on the printed receive\nThat could be part of the email confirmation or the text that they get confirming appointments and you know so you start you know sit down and just make a list of all the different touch points that you have with that particular customer\nAnd then think of different ways that you can give them an incentive\nYou know maybe they write a negative review that's okay if you learn something from it you know you move on you make itself better but ... and you start telling them what you want and that's the thing about people most people want to help you most people are really good nature\nBut they may not know that this is what you need and so if you tell them at least four times 'cause the average person has to hear something four times before they act\nAs that hopefully they'll get in there and do that now if for some reason this doesn't work and thirty days and want you to give me a call back and we'll go to the next level but I think you'll find that people will give you that review as long as you ask for and thank you for your call\nOr let's talk about one of our great sponsors I drive dot com and I always get super

twenty five years we've known each other but when I think of all the places we've been over the years Birmingham certainly near the top for us as a parent company and we also own syndicates the wrecking ball the show\nAnd we have for nearly Fifteen Years so there's so much about Birmingham that makes it a great place for travelers whether you're a history buff\nWhether you enjoy great golf you know we're other sports in outdoor activities like yours you the botanical garden or stay parked even medical tourism with your terrific doctors in the army has been so what are you most enjoy about Birmingham and experience communities John\nI just I think the one of the many of the things that are so unique about Birmingham and makes such a unique a travel experience for for people is there's\nSuch a wealth of different things to do for all types of people here\nOn our website which is it's a and Birmingham dot com we have about twenty different because I didn't really for visitors to experience and from everything shopping to outdoor activities girls weekends out temporary is sports of course\nGolf so many different one of the kind of unique opportunity experience\nHere and in a in a region you know you mentioned it earlier that the Birmingham is a area that many southern cities have undergone as you know great renaissance last a couple of decades and we are certainly not an exception to that we have\nExperienced so much growth and there's so much interest in our destination because of all the different things about\nUm I think that one of the things that were very very proud of what we have a bird as as we become one of the leading food destination country a lot of people don't know that about\nWhen we talk about that a lot don't even ... travel really go together and that's actually what I wanted you to touch on so take it away I tell everybody about this because we know we've had wonderful experiences in Birmingham is that\nWell we'd like to call ourselves a dinner table this out and the reason that we do that as we over\nThe last I guess the teen years we've had an emerging foods and that is just really really\nA a amazingly a great experience for so many people and the uh we were just recently honored with the Birmingham is the only city you can\nBasically go to now at this year and experience the best restaurant in America at selected by the James Beard foundation and that's the highlands boring real that are five points out that in an area\nWhich is a great restaurant huge honor yeah it is John I Want to ask you this

... you know with highland park as you mentioned that fits into the the downtown area has experienced great revitalization who's the new ballpark there's a number of hotel\nYou know you've got the civil rights museum the convention center and that's all helping to kind of fuel your airport to grow so what do you think is the biggest enhanced meant to Birmingham for travelers in recent years\nI think that the the renaissance that happened down touted as a downtown spirits it started with the development of railroad park and\nRailroad park you mentioned the ball park which is of course we just feel right next to it but a a railroad park\nBeautiful green space by ten acre park that has a a\nA surrounding neighborhood and Los\n... being developed a great brew pub craft breweries are

is a co founder and owner of ... company that to rate strips where people but also does what he calls surprise trips or surprise adventures really it's a flexible budget option and we're going to talk about that now\nAre we find him on the streets in Mexico city Nico welcome to show nice to have you here\nHi great to be here thanks where to\nAll right so let me get this straight someone goes your website or calls you whenever and says surprise me and they I Know they fill out a questionnaire um but what do you have in ... and ... and you're going to take them away for a weekend or weekend is is it a fixed amount of time or is that is that in the ...\nThat's right so the idea is to use that as possible budget option at pretty much also flexibility across across the board so what what are we kind of started there yeah what's ... travels a lot of people have more you\nHave an idea of more or less what they want to do and how much they want to spend but not necessarily work to go and do a lot of people here to have the choice overloaded and you don't really know where to begin to research and so the idea is that there's a lot of packaged\nUm tours and and and travel at dinner pretty out there being sold online but there really isn't just a a questionnaire that you're just about yourself where it's kind of on questions like what your travel so what do you prioritize when you travel will never be the structure you comfortable with um what are you looking to do on that trip\nAnd and then you know you can kind of give them the first time that gender and\nWhat we started was was applied strips yeah this idea that you just got descriptions of photos and do get a very solid idea of what you're gonna be experiencing but you don't know exactly where it is and of course the question on the questionnaires ask you if there's any place that you've already been do you do want to go back through so you ensure that nobody has a really good experience somewhere else\nAnd I presume you tell them whether it's a warm climate or is winter climate or whether hiking is involved in things so they can pack pack intelligently\nExactly so we thought we'd give law period um died was trying to tell them what they once they get to that situation what they can do to hit the ground running and we give them a best practice has got his role in terms of what a lot to be ready for 'em so the dogs here there for the love and care for whatever confidence her face yeah\nAnd when did they learn their destination\nSo we have we send them a package where they are told to open at once they get to the airport so they know what time they have to be at the airport and then once I got there they open it and they get their flight number and I could see where it is they're going so Thomas nothing is pretty\nPretty last minute and um and yeah it's exhilarating for for for the people that want something um something different so it's funny 'cause we've got a blend of people that are well traveled by want somebody else would you also get the novice who just doesn't want to do any of the trouble finding himself or herself and just wants to outsource that whole experience I just

married or higher holiday ham and some of the other talk rooms out there on not purposely forgetting them but let's begin with you shoot exactly what southern living hotel collection and does the collection cover the entire south eastern portion of the country\nUh it does we've worked very hard to bring together a hand picked group of around twenty two independently owned boutique hotels I'm that includes in bed and breakfast\nFrom small ends in some larger property but that is um that's how we kind of discovered these folks is through our southern living stories that we cover as we traveled a full region of the south and we invited these folks to become members of arson wording hotel collection just a few years ago so it's relatively new for us but growing rapidly\nGood to hear so from what I understand you have sort of a wide mix of properties you've got some new properties as well as uh\nSome of the older more iconic hotels that I Would think are deeply rooted in some good old fashioned southern traditions I'm curious for our listeners who have not traveled er stayed in the southern region of our country can you just described some of that old world sort of southern hospitality that you look for in these properties\nSure I'm In southern living our bags are always back we love to travel but we like to experience very different\nVery regionally specific um parts of the south and hospitality as always number one when we're thinking about what\nProperties would belong in this collection so for instance you could go to greater Ashville area in the mountains of North Carolina maybe for some beautiful fall color like I think like eighty percent of southern living people um consumers book a trip just to go to the fall color and she's got seven\nRooms all decorated\n... it looks like the pages that suddenly the magazine and the food that she served\nIs based on the other living recipes and her hospitality Salinas the owner and operator and it's like you're saying with a friend and that's the perfect example of a small mountain that have breakfast\nAnd then on on the flip side you could go to wall in Tennessee just outside of Knoxville and blackberry farm which is the complete opposite end of the spectrum all little cottages there's no you know vertical inner hotel like\nYou would traditionally think of their all beautifully decorated little cottages and the restaurant is and it's an incredible barn that it sounds rustic but it's absolutely seven star Ella\nAll these properties and I'm looking at here I mean there is a cross section so who's never worse than the hotels for inclusion in the southern women collection and you know what are some of those features that you look for require besides the obvious was married just mentioned southern hospitality I split\nMhm or food and beverage is a big driver it has a lot of the car and they'll\nDrive anywhere to taste some incredible regional fair so food and beverage is a very big part of our criteria um the decor and the architectural integrity and does it speak to the region\nThough the Anchorage Seventy Seventy and view for South Carolina looks over the river it's incredible an old stately homes beautifully done\nAround looking at right now it's going if you call ...\n... incredible Frank and Frank and Amy or the owners and they're just great people but the hotel itself is just a fee through the eyes it's architecturally beautiful right there on the river I Love each of these speak to that\nI Love that these are hand packs that's a great way to describe it so Chris and we have about a minute left a United in hospitality for a long time you work in a hotel granting I'm sure we could ask you a lot of questions but I'm curious and these are sort of more luxury and certainly boutique type hotels\nWhat's the single biggest factor if you had to choose one that you think today's luxury brand is hotels really need to get right for the traveler\nYou know it's all about the people you have to feel like you want to go back there again and again and what makes it memorable is that experience and these folks that own these properties they get into the details and making that trip special for you you might be there on a whim for a weekend or an anniversary but it's going to be a place you want to go back to that\nWhat is so hard to put on paper but that's what makes these places special every single one of them\nYou know anybody who was on a memorable experience yeah they will agree with that we're hearing about world Christian listen we could go on and on a number of these properties union ruler rural written orange Virginia\nA lot of folks are going to get on the Web surfers southern living hotel collection dot com southern living hotel
