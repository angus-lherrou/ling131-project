runner made famous as a celebrity\nBy a a\nLifestyles of the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer and that the source of his wealth which is made to look like a jet setting\nParty animal by Robin Leach so whether whether\nJamal casualties are related to him and I couldn't even find outages habit Jamal ... as a critic\nOf Mohammed bin selmont Mohammed bin some on as the crown prince\nIn Saudi Arabia his father is the king king ...\nHe is the brother of the late deceased king king Abdullah their father grandfather uh started the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many sons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son and he has the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king as such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically\nTo reform the some of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and a oil\nFocused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends in the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know is wind and dying the Google guys he's winding dying to Facebook guys spend a lotta time an apple\nHe wants to build a brand new\nCity out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off the Arab garb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a very attractive short little stocky but he represents if he is being truthful\nMajor reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women he is the guy who wants to relax\n\nAll kinds of cultural rules on an Saudi women and open up speech to them all but not being able to drive a go places on their own without male the company but this made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past them last night I think it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the elite\nOf Saudi well some of them even among the royal family and took over\nThe Ritz Carlton\nHotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage\nOf their wealth on the basis they had stolen it\nDo the corruption and connections and soon as he made a lot of enemies well Jamal ... has as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin Salman\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking\nToys and power away from it this reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont despite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticizing the government and keep your head\nYou don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees\nFor example your mom to show he wanted to get married he had to get a wedding like a marriage license he was in Turkey\nIn order to do that by the end it before the he had supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and and others in the Saudi royal family because of his open criticism of these reforms and other things so he goes into the Saudi

various diplomatic pouches and will never be seen again\nAnd you think they really hit of desperation if they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing any new policies to counter Trump's 'cause they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when there are pros the right lose it when we're silent and they they for so

the stock market's been kind of see song has been a roller coaster ring and Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something books there are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced would willingly take a bit of a financial hit\nTo their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not that well but they would they would they would incur some pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on not to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there are enough looney tunes on the left who would willingly do this\nI think they're that desperate as a previous caller said and of course it\nFlies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say well it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it there believe it looking our polling data\nPeople obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried that this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans in the midterms\nAnd so there's a monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was ... pointed out to him that yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that's what I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or at four point two percent\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression that was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [laughter] I'm paying interest\nA high rate because of our heads and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake translation\nIs worry and maybe accusing the Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why and let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy is a great performing and growing economies so threatening\nTo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed do they leak\nThey leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets if these people think the feds are going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully\nTo slow down the economy\nAt the time totally unnecessary for it right before the election and he's calling them out he's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump run the no you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of\nTommy leftists as they are many financial institutions are not going to particularly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning the cause of\nDrunk so Trump calling them out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election soybeans down so they react to it\nAnd and this rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day roller coaster I\nThink there's positive action today I Will I Will check it's ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah a ... heart\nSo your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust that you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are working are there are some that I I'm not in love with yes and

was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump She overcame putting she overcame the Olive Garden she overcame Russian that's what their plan was\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede\nRemember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russians stole it\nAnd to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama this\nStory New York magazine they think they're doing an anti boy here and they think they're really praising Obama they are

go ... go ahead I'm Sorry [noise] [noise]\nYeah I'm I made the same point when I heard they don't drunk and cook combing exonerated her before even interviewing her\nJudge jury and probation officer\nRight and and we all know the reason why she was a Democrat nominee their jobs and futures end\nThe shenanigans they have pulled\nRequired her to win burns them to stay employed in front of the tricks they unfold on Trump to remain unknown so she had to be exonerated she had to be found not guilty and not even charged in relation to the emails and the ... and the trafficking in classify

Committee\nAre hell bent on getting to the bottom of this\nAnd not letting these people get away with it they have been on the investigated that's not the right word they haven't even been invest they hadn't been looked at you've got the special counsel what'd you think nor ring the real crimes and criminality that's taken place while spending all of this time trying to find the crime\nThat they can lay on Trump and they haven't been able to\nIt's frustrating this is why by the way there isn't creating frustration at the president for not declassify these documents little answer\nThe question you're asking don't understand why why the president is protecting Rosen stain the guy who in a meeting suggested wearing a wire in his next meeting with Trump to try to get incriminating evidence that Trump's unfit\nThey were going to gather the cabinet after Rosen's dean had\nHad a conversation with Trump which supposedly was going to show that Trump is insane and unfair never going to play that for the cabinet to try to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment Rosen stance I'm just kidding I just it was the people in the meeting say he was not getting none of us were\nAnd I believe that I Believe these people back then were hell bent on getting rid of Trump\nI think they still are I I think I think official Washington the political media complex of washing it is still\nInside out and upside down over Trump and I think what every success and every smile on Trump space with every piece of\nEvidence that Trump is enjoying this I think they go a little further insane each and every time\nThe Trump succeeds at something that Trump is not damaged by saying every effort everything they've done to take Trump out I think they are beyond frustrated that it hasn't worked\nAnd I don't think they are giving up on it I don't think they will give up on it now the Rosenstein Rosenstein however pronounces it heard it both ways\n[noise] this is really curious\nPat him a on the air force
