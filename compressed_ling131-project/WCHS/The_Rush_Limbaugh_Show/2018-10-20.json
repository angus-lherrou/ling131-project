lighting and music app so there are ways that you can still step up to a game\nAnd get that house ready for Halloween with all those lights and sounds and back to the phones we go with Charlie and a great bend Kansas Charlie\nKill great to talk to you thanks so much for your call today so it was going on I Would say I'm a small theater group\nOr we put on ... year than I Am an old movie theatre here in ... in oh how cool is that it's\nAwesome what a ... to ... we deserve a good on that\nOn the Hubble told is that uh we get our keys to the church to call them tractors to all these people and we never get a look to put it so we got the keys floating\nAll [laughter] running all over the county everybody's got to care [laughter]\nEverybody's got a dead young key to this place when we were having a hard time controlling it so our idea is to one of the doors we would like to put like a digital type law\nSure that we can program with codes and give the hotel now is the truth who lived to be able to set up the tapes automatically explode or twenty four dollars or ... or ... or ... whatever is needed for that and the second to the to it is\n... ... ... a little to do to to a program like the on site but it was a cooker but all such nobody stopped at all the time\nRight well we don't live ... you know the good news is that the technology exists\nThe even better news Charlie is that it's super simple to use okay also and so when you buy the smartest lock and that a couple of ways you can do it uh I actually have a I'm a ... house that I own\nIs that I Am I have a ... legs smart block okay\nAnd so when somebody books through ... ... I can go and I can put their name in and I can say this law is going to work on this I on Saturday from eleven AM to next Wednesday at four pm okay\nAnd you put the person's name and their and then what's also interesting is that you have a full log of when they when they come and go or eggs actually when they come into the building so you'll know exactly who's coming in at what time okay [noise]\nUm and you can program this remotely program this right on the Internet\nOr you can do it within an app I have found that the easiest way is to use the leg lock\nIf not the best of luck it's an inexpensive lock if you're looking for them all the best of luck with more bells and whistles there's something called the August pro Gen and the August ... is the best but\nWhen you start looking at locks that they have different system so you ... you can't just buy the lock and it goes on the Internet\nIs that you buy the lock and then it connects to a hub okay so you have like a smart things have or you have what what I have is the next year up okay\nAnd then within the next year Hubbard is where things have you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like if you wanted certain lights to come on and the middle you know say from eleven PM to six am when nobody's there so at least illuminates maybe it's less likely for somebody to break in is that\nYou can program the lives for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nAnd that there are water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so once you once you get the hub Charlie's what I'm saying is that once you get the hobby started thinking about OK\nWhat more can I add to that right yes okay absolutely\nYou know so if there are there any other things that we can for a couple of hundred bucks because that's all you're talking about\nRight that they are that's awesome audio\nYeah then it might be worth it okay so when you start looking at different products the smart things you know this is where it gets confusing is that\nYou've got the wave in the bay and those are different standards\nAre ... and that works with the smartest things next he ah everything works like um I have a a train air conditioner that I can control remotely\nKnow on the next USSR so ... so that's what I'm trying to so I'm trying to expand your horizons so once we had the ... what else can we do with it\nLots of things yeah it's exciting I mean it's really cool to doctors all states with the holograms turning Allegra\nAndhra don't you think that you and I would be excellent at doing like a theatre version of the game commando show absolutely agree making a musical\nWell I don't know I can think commando them he was one that I don't [laughter]\nI don't think we'd go past one ... just so anyways popular demand women I don't think in in great bend Kansas though was we didn't even make into like like why would weigh in Tempe that was it that's off off off off his runs wetter the ball\nIt's more intimate yeah absolutely [laughter] All right\nSo the next the assistance going to set you back eight dollars and Ninety nine cents a month or I'd say that's it not a big deal so I'll take a look at the the the the ... leg since and connect\nOK okay the next ... about sixty bucks the lock is going to touch back a hundred and fifty and then you're looking at say just for giggles ten bucks a month and then it allows you to program\nAll those codes get reports whose common and what's going on with that and then if you could set it for twenty four hours and then if somebody does do you think something was wrong you can just kill that code it killed ... automatically there's no delay\nYou can also you as like yeah you can\nSet up a code really ... you know if you're if you're doing anything remotely\nA really makes sense that you start looking at smart stuff and in order to be notified and get alerts and good things like that hey Charlie thank you for your call and keep us posted on what's going on and great band and how that locks working out for you [noise] All right speaking of homes\nWill talk a little bit about simply save longtime sponsor of the ... show and you know I remember when I first met Chad the founder of simply safe and he sat back and I walked upstairs to my office and I thought to myself well you know Chad the adventurous simply say if he's just one of those guys\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right but and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor I'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our businesses that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extent is that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself for my oral history and my role hygiene right so so\nI Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the website and see what kind of volume that you get\nAnd you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office that you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact\nTo getting the same question time and time again of which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be\nThose thirty questions later on but I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you'll engage will be people that you can convert to a a paying client\nBecause they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your side from scratch they have names like then desk chat is free uh there's also a live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the side or somebody building and for you\nA yes or the the we do have a a website it's already been billed than we have another company building or another website all over again but but when the media but third tempting has told me about that in this chat function\nAnd I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't let the third party do it yet I Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters seem kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also lift some of those questions under ethics issues as part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening in chats in box and things like that\nOr is that you're able to say you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you so much for your call come right back we're going to talk about browsing without all the bad stuff
