the final transfer\nWest Virginia outdoors with performance Saturday at seven AM and Sunday at five PM resented the paid more from our Vietnam deck and you're writing online and more from dot com\nOkay listen to it again this is Monday Night on CNN steak in a couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise]\nNon lemon lemon says it on Monday Night on CNN and\nIts noticed today and again he's talking ... about all the recent shooting\nAnd mailed the pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky and other white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threats in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nYou know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what is your reaction to this I mean this punks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban and that may be something that he individually holes with the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's that on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed\nIn the perverted view the American left it as white men who created this racist and bigoted unfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the uh Lenski days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from\nThe traditions in institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary and evidence the primary example are exhibit\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair they of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets mentioned whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration policy\nYou name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and Phil ... of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo ah to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more ground than that in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using a victim allergy and victimhood to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be a white men or continue to be the majority and they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it\n\nI think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people you\nNotice how quickly they want to do that notice how quickly on the left the people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always the result of environmental things and\nSo on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're going to if we're going to go down that road never going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it that's in raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\n\nAnd since these people are vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon ... or ... or Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't Republicans in that group look in the number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have\nBeen defended and explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well they're cops and they mistreat and they are racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound people Steve ... almost did die it's amazing these people the way they talk and the things they conveniently forget\nOr don't even register maybe in the first place\n\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or they Republicans nope many of them are very loyal Democrats voting bloc Muslim Americans\nIn fact maybe and even more reliable Democrat vote than black voters\n\nAccording to Forbes magazine of the three thousand three hundred and forty two people killed by terrorists in the U.S between Nineteen Ninety two in two thousand Seventeen Islamic terrorists are responsible for Ninety two percent of those murders and yeah Don Lemon on CNN says the\nProblem is white men we need a white\nMen than there is no white guy ban\nBusy no one must ever blame the left no one must ever blame the news media ... all one must ever blame the rest of the Democratic party for any of the attacks done by their rabbits like Occupy Wall street\nLike black lives matter like antifa the truth is\nIt isn't Republicans running around doing these things\nIt is a bunch of deranged people who are out of their minds and I'm telling you it can happen\nTo among the most feeble if there's just a steady diet of the negative upon negative drumbeat\nOn television today that is described as new as it is not news it is the Democrat Party agenda but it is not news it hasn't been news for quite\nAwhile audio soundbite number for David Robin

shooter have at Trump considered Trump a sellout precisely because he has a daughter to convert to Judaism that's not mentioned not Trump is ratcheting down his visa had been pedaled through the metal and here's the opinion of David Rodham gr\nWe ought to go back and think about you know how Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma say I'm Nineteen Ninety five and ... he doesn't go after the terrorists he doesn't sort of make a you know beat the drums\nOr to go out and stop the terrorists all around the country tried to heal and it was a turning point in his presidency he was embattled when he went to Oklahoma City that turned his presence around the very positive direction\nThis is how history revision has works\nThere David ... saying that Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma City in Nineteen Ninety five inhaled he didn't go after the terrorists he didn't sort of make a you know beat the drums didn't go out and stop the terrorists\nHeadline news maybe where Monday morning\nBoarded the headline

I. B. L. E. getting\nHere's Trump tweeting out at Paul Ryan pull ranchers be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out and gets a conversation started on eliminating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up\nCriticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but\nIt's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence up everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets and his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\nAs one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people\nIt's horrible what Trump said about Paul Ryan why\nIs it why isn't it when he gives it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters or what they are Mollie Hemingway as a great piece today speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the forward with her allegations that whatever capital I did that led to the fact that Kevin all the spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward claiming they have evidence\nOf it none of them ever present at any but\nThe media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh was named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... gets ... give a confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I Would have Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get one of those guys are rubber rate serial rapists where is all it just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other democratic leaders want to have any credibility in all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political stunt\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they'd continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kavanaugh if all of that was legit\nIf if everything Kavanaugh was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why aren't they doing that there is a big campaign going Kevin all of us have been rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion of cabinet did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching cabinet where are these questions\nThe reason those questions are being asked are the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every damn one of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin officer it was all manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end of a Hail Mary if Woolsey Ford were actually telling the truth she would have\nBeen one of the first witnesses she would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of capital but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy make humbling eyes terrified here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nHis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYour Republicans running for office if you have these debates left you need to start asking the Democrat opponents they still oppose Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kavanaugh or oppose Kevin ... asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign and we've got a week it's not too late to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded\nLet's pretend that some of the momentum was lost all okay we've got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nWho did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there is not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh to hurt Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\n\nHere's another one is that Kevin on confirmation circus we're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means which there'll be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nGetting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul raped by Kevin ... is the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is justice not being soft\nAny longer\nAnd the answer to the question is it was never about the women\nBecause none of the women had any evidence it was about one thing only and that was killing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh even if it meant destroying his family and his career his future and his life\nAnd they failed so now it's on to whatever is next and I guess it's we need a ban on white guys from Don Lemon\nThey real murderers in America the real problem is white men we've got a Muslim ban we've got this bad we don't have a ban on white guys that we need a ban on white guys white men have now become the primary issue in America according to the left\nAs X. told by John Lennon\nSo we're we're just drive by me anyway to give it everything we got on Capitol but now drop it and move on the other things now Trump responsible for pipe bombs now Trump responsible for Senate guy should Trump responds more Trump responsible for the airplane crash next week when they got around to that\nNone of it is real none of the news\nIs real it's all manufactured\nSo what does it mean what\nDoes it mean that we're not getting any updates from the drive by media about all of these women were so mistreated by Kevin ...\nWhat does it mean that the Democrats are not being asked by the media whether they support Kavanaugh's impeachment why is this all been dropped\n\nWhy have the media given up in the getting the story they obsessed over for nearly a month\nFor weeks September and October that's all the media talked about [noise]\nWhere's the follow up if Kavanaugh was as they say that story should not have gone away the women still suffered the women did not get justice cabinet got confirmed where is the news where is the continuing investigation will it doesn't exist\nBecause it was all made up about capital\nClassic Democratic Party media operation\nSo is the aftermath of the pipe bomb story and so as the aftermath of the Jewish synagogues story it's all media manufactured not the stories themselves in this case but the coverage the way it's being covered the fact that Trump is to blame Trump's responsible all of that manufactured all of its designed\nDrug epidemic is not only hurting does who use the number of the innocent victims of violent crime is growing as well as many drug users will do anything to fund their addiction now more than ever\nWe need a judge who will protect our families can be tough on crime candidate Philando let us

growth and it was Rick wired that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be helping we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans\nIt had to demonstrate that they love America it wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nYou had to learn about American history you have to

I'm not harping on Mr trend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you here's Beth gas but now he's given you every reason in the world is ... ... to ... you can think of where they're not that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear how about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter] but that's just me you know being smart alec\nOr in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia get Tammy is possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggest\nBut what about the Nineteen representative John Faso is up by a point that the president is job approval is that a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so\nTrump's on the ballot or he isn't is it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things\nAnd then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been the massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke\nChallenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a outer Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead and the generic ballot which asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress now normally this will be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score\nThat are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related are the errors\nMeaning how about when I Am all our mistakes and then the next ...\nAre we're relying too much on one poster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next ... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately\nThey can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over we're not counting votes so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people have voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election\nIs over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this day largely irrelevant which is why I continue to\nRail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens so it wasn't going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\nWhat else is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate cool competitive districts but take argument to and then realized that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob what all in Georgia seventh um [noise]\nWe don't however no how big a problem that says right now or even if it is a problem I

talking about it all into why our on our part so God awful\nYou know it's an interesting question up there is there's an average there's just something that people believe\nAs a as a practitioner of the spoken word form of mass communications one thing I have to deal with is that if people see it written\nIt could be in a rag tabloid it can be in an obscure website it could be the New York ... if they see it written they automatically think it's true it's just it's it's I don't know if it's it's a\nLifetime generational conditioning I don't know if it's psychological but if you see it it's true if you see it on TV you tend to believe that if there's a picture a company in the words you really believe it\nHoping fair foul why don't they don't they are on\nA doubt how many people now wait

Republican is mentioned by a comedian or by anybody and\nThe audience there starts laughing or or booming or what have you well it it doesn't matter what\nFollows all the ... the word Republican triggered a bunch of boring in laughter among a certain people in an audience that's branding that'd be the Republicans have a branding problem in addition to other than the Democrats have their own version of branding problems with the\nWell how do you overcome that how do you ever come up a bunch of people who've grown up\nAnd been taught that Republicans hate X Y and Z and oppose X Y and Z how do you deal with that how do you you're doing you you think people being stupid or blindly obedient or what have you here\nThey don't they think they're very smart they think they're really up to
