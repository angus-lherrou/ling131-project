I think many of the Republicans have bought the idea that Trump was not to be gone or a before now I I\nThey are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets I I think first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\n\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans that Trump is the guy and the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if\nThis story on the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a palm pale left Saudi Arabia after having met when king Solomon and Mohammed bin so I'm On the crown prince even flew to Mexico\nAnd they have to know the Trump is not going to put up with this and I think that was the message ... talk\nSo I got one report from a peanut the caravan has turned around now if that's true whoever is paying for this is gonna have to keep paying for those people to go wherever they go next are they going to go back to Honduras they're going to go back to Guatemala are they going to go to a holding places in weight\nTo try to do the caravan all over are they going to try to sneak them in in smaller groups rather than as part of this gigantic\nMob only time will\nTell thanks again Todd this is Jeremy in Mayfield, Kentucky you our next I'm open line friday Hi\nThanks for taking my call Russian my coming in loud and clear\nYou are sir here you're just fine\nThanks it's a sixty dollar Samsung so you know whatever but uh yeah you know we\nAll have our obstacles to bear in life and your your overcoming us pretty well I hear you pretty well\nThank you uh you know I'm a Trump voted for Trump from Avon Trump voter and America First and most historic sense and I'm an American patriot so take that in contact with my question here how can the United states the allies with countries and you mentioned this in the first part of your monologue we're allies with the\nSaudi Arabia and Israel\nHow can we be allies with Saudi Arabia when the Pentagon papers released and twenty six team showed that they funded nine eleven also Israel has attacked us in the past like a used his liberty with all of unfair can you clear that are forming\nWell on the Saudi side yeah the uh the the the Israeli spy on us to everybody spies on everybody you know Jonathan Pollard\nIt was an Israeli spider got caught and the Israelis wanted him back on harmed we said screw you you know where your benefactor spy on us and I said yes we do and we're going to continue the spy 'cause we can't trust anybody where Israel\nAnd uh particularly when Democrats are in the White House and that's a factor now when it comes to the Saudis I Want to share with you because your question here is really good\nI remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned that\nIt was either all Nineteen or white Ninety percent eighty percent of the Nineteen hijackers were Saudi\nI remember I was talking to William has luckily junior about number thing not just this and I brought that up and I remember him getting frustrated with me about it he said what does it ever doing anything I was\nA little worse than the Saudi Government supposedly is an ally and yet these hijackers come from Saudi Arabia are you saying the Saudi royal family is behind this\nNo they just a continuation the answer the question is Jared Kushner has been instrumental in working\nWith Mohammed have been some on on these reforms\nAnd and it would make sense make far more sense to be allied with Saudi Arabia if they are as a government going to distance themselves from the walk hobby or Islam that was largely behind\nThe nine eleven hijackers and they're in their motivation that would be a big deal\nBut as I say those reforms have been brought to a screeching halt with the murder of democracy Yogi which happened in Turkey [noise] it\nDidn't happen in Saudi Arabia didn't happen at Washington happening in Turkey which is also an Islamic country not happy with the way the Saudis are running Islam\n[noise] there's so much more to this then the drive by is are\nSuggesting because the drive by just want to use this to get Trump\nTo show Trump's ineffectiveness or the show Trump is aligned with tyrants or whatever I ...

committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats there's another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play and only about two or three Democrats the template Tony on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\n[noise] let me run through them and say this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this just walk a stuff\nAnd to me this is totally absent uh any any what what's the word personality or I mean there's just raw numbers\nAre based on data that is the result of polling and I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome\nOut of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixty and I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at ras my son was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here see what informs me what makes me make these kind of predictions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand four team and the election of ... thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there\nThat could be a factor Obama's gone so maybe the anti Democrats ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden I Want to elect Democrats again\nEverybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone Raj the Senate yeah we're probably pick up look up the house is gone and then they said because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this and these are real\nLee local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates\nHim [noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop\nRejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done a one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people\nLove them again well no not in adjusted insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow support their promoting rage and anger there promoting\nInsanity and lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump\nIs there's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters well that would have to\nBe what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his\nWell that went over like a land balloon and they died with it so they abandoned Matt\nAnd outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good\nHappening in America they haven't dad\nContinued to try and portray America\nAs this unfair on just on deserve\nExceptional superpower\nThat discriminates that violates that ... that [noise]\nIt's all negative so I'm just so where is this body of evidence that suggest that trend devoting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon Bram a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAlmost no polling shows that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think that they're coming from a with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomenon that the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy from voted to the shy breakfast votes is the kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve sheltered and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a\nReason why what was Limbaugh getting this I mean there's not a single pulled out of the shows this happening precisely my\nPoint it's not a single poll not a single poll shows\nSo from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C live and die by\nTheir gospel and I really think um if I Lived in Washington each and every I don't I couldn't I I wouldn't it be ostracized\nAfter not too long I just couldn't get with the program living there I have known that for for many many moons\nSo he'll just yeah I tend to agree but I'm a I think there's a lot of people don't tell the pollsters the truth a lot of people don't even answer when the pollsters call I think there's a lot of people not being contacted up next Kaylee Mac a name\nWho is the spokeswoman for the Republican National committee\nHave bought on selling the Rush Limbaugh about the so called hidden Trump voter I talked to a pollster who said to me that in the aftermath of the election he went out in Michigan and California\nAnd thirty seven percent of Trump voters said they refused to tell a pollster when they were called ... supported President Trump thirty seven percent has nearly a third of the Trump voter\nRight [noise] uh\nSo then we say Fox is able to find a couple of people who um [noise] I agree a ... minute it'll come and Shannon Bradley ... I'm a strategy behind this so I'm just I'm just answering the question what I think I've got no strategy I'm not trying to make people changed the way they're voting I I mean that that's not\nThe purpose of my comment here I was asked the question\nAnd I gave the answer to it and the answer is rooted in my instinct Dave\nDistrust of conventional wisdom conventional wisdom is group think even if it is right you know I'm I'm I'm reluctant to sign onto it just because the group thinks it has to be really right now\nHere's Trump this is a last night in Missoula, Montana this is Trump framing the mid term\nElection day Americans will remember Kavanaugh and they will remember all sorts of other things\nBecause that was a shameful\nAs there are many other shameful acts including what they're

of cabinet all the power of the law and order and common sense that's what it's going to be\nSo I had I had some people say this is not just Trump just as bad rash this is really Kavanaugh people don't know what that means what he's talking about capital\nSo what do you mean people don't know what he's talking about cabinet\nWe've got to explain what happened this is not Trump ought to be harping on this immigration will be harping on this in the specifics about what Kavanaugh's cabin on not just saying the word\nSo okay [noise] just to show you that there is some concern out there

we're really simple\nAnd you basically had a roll call and people just called in with their Yeh started a business is you know the small businesses and just talk about\nHow they're doing you know where they are in\nGeneral yeah yeah you know you don't want that was your ... your what you remember there was a a it was it was a period of time it was the early nineties\nSmokes and white collar employees are being laid off executives\nAnd magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy they were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executive it's finally white collar\nPeople and not blue collar people and so I decided we did three days of this we took calls uh it's\nAs best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and asked what they were doing about it right and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing that ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things I Love I finally have because of necessity I'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting\nA business or what have you and they were they were all amazingly upbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumps or angry or any of that\nRight now it was it was just it was just I mean it was like my second year in business so I remember I remember it well 'cause there was working in January one or ... or at least one maybe with another a rip off from that other three day\nThings that are right I just I just think it would be a good a good thing to try you know what I mean just maybe on a friday instead of doing you know Republican good Democrat bad stuff I mean which people stick to the people would want but um\nWell do this don't downplay the Republican or Democrat a bad thing because there's still\nA whole slew of people who don't get how bad the Democrats are but let me ask you something do you think that people need to hear business people calling in describing how great the economy as before they'll believe it\n\nIs that why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it or you as well are you thinking some people don't believe it or doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that run an operator own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I

I work a lot of hours and I'm I'm I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but\nUm it's just it's a good inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make make this country work\nYou know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that is the way I see it\nWell small business small business there's no question that small business is uh the vast majority of of employment in the country and some could say the backbone\nWell okay I I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and why\nThey they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do other hosts would maybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not\nThat week and I'm not I do not have any self doubt so I can take any kind of criticism for anyone and not take it personally\nSo don't ever fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George making this is Lloyd in in in\n... mosque in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi\nHow're you doing their young man why not just fine thank you\nAnyway yeah man I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was in Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but it ... there's not a Britain it's been all aimed at stopping anybody crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting it I remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump has a phony is not who he says he is and they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHow I don't think that could happen these done too much into a little\nTime oh I don't either get on the leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this caravan is\nUh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall but his point was how many continuing resolutions if we have independent budget deals if we had and then there's not and we have\nControl of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for it\n\nYet not serious money and certainly not serious construction there for his theory was\nThat the Democrats are trying to demonstrate that is never gonna happen to Trump doesn't even care than it isn't\nGoing to happen\nAnd what better way to illustrate isn't four thousand people storming the border and not being stopped\nAh let's see grabs sound bites number four team Nikki Haley she went to the Al Smith dinner in New York last night we aren't normally only hear about what happens is the Al Smith dinner during presidential elections at say it's a big dinner at the Waldorf hysteria\nAnd it's a Catholic charity organization\nAnd it is required that presidential candidate show up at this thing\nAnd it's always two to three weeks before the election\nAnd they do they they show up and it's a night of comedy Ninety five percent and the other the other five percent of the speeches um get serious and political and they all show up and it's incredible to that the Al Smith dinner\nOr at least the ones I've watched who ever writes the jokes for these candidates for this center is they they got to be among the best every candidate there have been some exception exceptions but it seems like every candidate just has some of the best funniest material\nAnd I you know I Wonder where they find it and it's obviously they're hiring joke writers but from where we don't know well Nikki Haley showed up at the Al Smith dinner last night I mean she didn't storm in there she was invited obviously but this is causing\nPeople to believe that Nikki Haley has got some residential perspiration\nGoing on and in fact she might Nikki\nPlease said do something last night we don't have this on tape or an audio but she chastised Trump last night\nShe standing in America\nAnd domestic politics we do not call our political opponents\nEvil\nAnd of course there are all the way\nWe do not call well who else does but Trump he calls the press evil\nAnd the Democrats evil and saw it that comment that that made people think aha she's she's actually going for going to go for the Republican nomination at some point maybe not twenty twenty twenty twenty four and she is beginning the process of distancing herself as a Republican from Trump", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "19"}
