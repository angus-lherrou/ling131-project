now\nTrump has a lot of people say this is crazy rush makers last week Trump was saying that she was credible entered testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump always eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that\nThat is box I have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump wasn't necessarily go out with a general opinion like I'm gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling\nAnd he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head and they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the meeting on the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and the step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he\nDid\nIt gives him the credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there have been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it than moving to the rights oh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what he thinks\nReally thinks it's a pattern it's a technique it said trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a stab wished\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on something that he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it that cannot tell you how ... irritates them see he shouldn't have survived

what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski and Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked both before Trump didn't\nHe just simply probably she she can't backup she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation from what she said why\nIs that not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accusing any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called

[noise]\nGood question the economy is perking along at a rate Obama never in the in fact Obama told everybody just couldn't happen the Democrats and Obama told everybody couldn't happen\n\nIn the politics of yesterday this would be all Trump needed to survive and\nWhat stand anything that's why the media is not reporting it CNBC has the details\nRip roaring hot jobs market seize private

[noise]\n\nLet's see why sports vine Sunday through friday evening to sit on the voice of Charleston five eighty double DCA Jeff [noise]\nBreathing so welcome back Rush Limbaugh the ivy network for your ear is the is the James is on the gym and\nGuarantee quote from a National Review um\nThe more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bed is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it that's what the\n... this this um ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you can even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the um [noise]\nOccupy Wall street movement look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people who for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes\nBecause the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people they capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under writes them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and that of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to get that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with\nThis\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up in debates about whether\nBoys\nWant to pretend to be a girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nThat's sick it ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nWalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop as of right every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat Party he's happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it\nAnd they never do they never that rage and they angered never ends it only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally it doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on and she\nJust lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim off record\nAnd the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mock she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine ...\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't\nKnow [noise] [noise] [noise]

Sorry not just Senator Kennedy for Louisiana this guy is a walking soundbite this guys out there he's saying things like some\nDemocrats have no soul their mothers must not a breast fed them they don't care who gets destroyed Dr Ford her confidentiality her family they don't care if capital gets\nDestroyed this is John Kennedy Republican U.S senator from Louisiana some of my colleagues on the Democrats' side are in good faith some I'm convinced\nDon't even have a soul their mothers didn't breast feed them they didn't have to they would their raw meat they went right to Rob me they don't care who gets destroyed Dr Ford or her confidentiality her family they don't care if Kavanaugh guess destroyed or his reputation\nAnd with Senator Kennedy said what I'm hearing from voters in Louisiana's enough is enough and right on cue from American greatness Democrats risk losing suburban women with Kevin ... attacks\nBy Julie Kelly I'm not a cry or one of my best friend's teases me to sit and cry is more than I Do my husband jokes about my six second to cry when I finally do shed some tears but as I watched Kevin O's opening statement a committee last Thursday I cried\nAnd for more than six seconds I wept for him for his crushed wife seeded behind it brings young daughters breeze friends for his parents I cried for our country\nIt was an emotional release of sympathy frustration and rage and I wasn't alone several of my friends admit that they have the same reaction Mollie Hemingway mirrored the feelings of millions of women when she choked up that ... interview with Tucker

and the presumption of innocence do not apply to men\nKatherine McKenna and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class at all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time after him\nThat the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her but she may literally believe that men don't have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her that's my point she may really believed it\nIt goes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you ever um ah you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the right hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine\nYeah look if not better I by the way here's this ... you're also right up it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it the me too movement supposedly include all women\nWomen on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement against their will it's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media\nOr making I think I Am from your young you're growing up I think you're

to Collins and Murkowski\nBut if they if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\n\nWell that would be embarrassing for them now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line\nRight that a reader of theirs\n\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself\nPresented\nThe power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic you created a chart in essence based on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and it\nIs the dates to varying dates the different dates of the sword did invent Dr ... says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story changed correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why the sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\n\nSalt\nThe charge here and try no tried served a difficult to convey but this is a text charge there is some uh some bars in this thing but it isn't titled Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\nIn the therapists notes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapist notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occur in not in the mid eighties but the late eighties\nIn her text message to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the mid eighties\nAnd heard a letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties\nIn the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school all summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could have been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she said it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that before\nShe had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties early\nEighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to these changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo endeavor cats the lawyer\n\nAnd hurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional performance\n\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes in her convenience first Ford's testimony the assault occurred in the summer of any two when she would just Fifteen\nConflicted with both her therapist notes and the text message\nHere is that President alert or your phones that are ... yeah I forgot to warn\nAbout this to Eighteen today there's an emergency warning system tests\nIt just happened my watch started going crazy\nAnd I'm going to lead a test it's just the past is not an Amber Alert it's just a test that if\nIf global warming had been cited or or or um sea levels had risen and there would be this massive warning or the alert from the president to tell everybody about it [laughter] and it's actually not from the president\nIt's not Trump on the other end of your phone or your device\nIt's the federal government they're required to test this once every three years this is the first test of it\nAnd they tested during my show when they know a majority of Americans are going to be locked onto a device\n\nIt makes perfect sense I
