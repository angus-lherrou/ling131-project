this morning democratic minority with Senator Dick\nSenate campaign committee Tom tell us of North Carolina was in the Republican post Kevin a surge real or we're just seeing a natural closing of the midterms we have a brand new NBC News Wall Street journal poll out this morning with some unusual resume\nThat should make both parties a little nervous\nTo work but if you want to be more insight on NBC News correspondent\nWashington Post columnist\nEugene Robinson Peggy Noonan a columnist for the wall Street Journal and David rosy cheeked political analyst for CBS News welcome to Sunday kids meet the press [noise]\nGood Sunday morning and welcome to the choose your own adventure mid term elections is there a democratic wave coming we've got data support that as a surge oppose Kavanaugh enthusiasm for Republicans turn back the Democrats momentum there's data to support that or could this be a typical midterm with Democrats making just modesty\nThere's data to support that too\nAnd we have plenty of new data this morning\nHere's what our brand new NBC News Wall Street journal poll shows with just over two weeks to go until the mid term among registered voters Democrats only seven point lead in the generic ballot forty forty one that is down significantly from the twelfth jointly Democrats held just a month ago pre Kavanaugh when it was fifty two forty but wait there's more\nAmong likely voters the Democrats league gross not shrinks grows to nine fifty to forty one here's why that's interesting\nIt's a first time ever in our polling that are likely voter model shows a better number for the Democrats than the registered voter number normally in midterms Republicans have the likely voter advantage so what's different this year it's the heightened enthusiasm for Democrats among millennials Latinos in younger women groups that historically\nHave had low turnout rate but are making it into a likely voter model the sheer\nSpell formerly expel the Saudi ambassador from the United states\nUntil there is a completion of a third party investigation into this kidnap murder and God Knows what followed that occurred in Istanbul and we should call on our allies to do the same unless the Saudi kingdom understands civilized countries around the world are going to reject this conduct and make sure that they pay a price for it they'll continue doing it\nThey have a fellow named ... ... a journalist who's currently in prison\nFor criticizing the Saudi regime there was another man will lead don't care who is also facing president and torture if necessary by them unless he changes his criticism of ... if we want them to stop this and make it clear we don't accept that we need to be decisive expelled the journalist\nStop or assistance to their war in Yemen let them know they're going to pay a price\nDo you believe the crown prince was ordered this killing Senator Corker uh this morning says he believes that the crown prince himself ordered this\nI Believe it's five of his top personal bodyguards or those among those currently accused in the Eighteen his personal bodyguards and one of them is said publicly a year ago I don't move with I don't think ... order from the executive\nThe crown prince says his fingerprints all over this and the fact that he is heading up the investigation makes it totally incredible\nAlright Senator Dick Durbin I'm going to leave it there senator I appreciate your time and for coming on and sharing your this much appreciate it struck joining me now is the vice chair of the committee in charge of getting Senate Republicans elected or reelected it's time to list of North Carolina senator tell us walking back to meet the press or\nGood morning let me start with the Saudi Arabia issue or an end to end the killing of Mr ... so do you probably may not have seen but at least heard that the timeline that took the Saudis Seventeen Days\nSame question that I had for Senator Durbin is there any part of the Saudi Government explanation that you find credible\nNo not at this point I agree with everything Dick Durban just said we've um we've got to get to the bottom of it in Saudi Arabia you do not do something of this magnitude without having clearance from the top we need to find out who that is and hold them accountable\nArgue is convinced is Senator Corker in Durban are as I just that that the crown prince himself ordered this telling\nWell it looks like it based on the people who were involved in the actual act I think that's why we need to help from the Turkish officials to get as much information as we have drawn conclusion and then there has to be a consequence for it\nWhat is a consequence to look like a ... is it ... and what is the goal of the consequences to get the Saudis the king to name a new crown prince what would be the goal of the punishment\nWell I think it is to hold people accountable who committed this horrible act and if it is the crown prince then I think that that is something that has to be explored I don't believe you can have someone\nWho would authorize the sort of an act being a position of power with a nation that's very important to us but we have to have limits as to how far away would go to work with them a in a very difficult complex part of the world and I think that we have to do the investigation with the intelligence\nCommunity with the Turkish officials Saudi officials outside of the crown prince to get to the bottom of it\nAre you at all concerned that the president seems to be um maybe more patient the necessary with the Saudi Government well I think\nThat oh you're saying as they are the public responds I Know that the state department the intelligence community in a number of other people are taking this seriously we've got a lot of resources focus on it and I think the president will take the appropriate action went all the facts around\nCan you imagine us having a relationship with the Saudi Government that's positive but the crown prince is still there\nNo I don't think so I think again if the facts lead to what we all suspect they will I think it'll be very problematic for our relationship going forward [noise]\nLet me move to the mid term the president says these midterms are about the following cabin on the care of and law and order and common sense you're the vice chair of the interests say is that the best summation or that you would advise Republican candidates to give up around the country I think\nThose are factors but I Believe historic job creation historically low unemployment among Latinos and African Americans the economic performance the the work that we've done to get NATO to contribute to our mutual defense there are a lot of things\nThat resonate with voters and again I look at the top one numbers that you gave earlier and a more specific why and how they're playing in states that were targeting and we're looking very good in a number of other states I fully expect we're going to add to our numbers in the Senate for the Republicans\nI Want to show you a column that or a conservative a rematch for new roof wrote in Bloomberg earlier this week\nAt the end of twenty Seventeen he was talking about the Republican agenda house Speaker Paul Ryan was pushing Republicans to take up well whatever form the Trump Administration talked up an infrastructure bill the party compromised by making a concerted effort on either but Republicans are asking for voters to augment that majority now and they still have no agenda\nWhat would you say is the case for re electing a Republican majority in the Senate going forward beyond just confirming judges I think\nYou go back to the age old question in elections do you feel better about your economic circumstances today than you did two years ago and I think the answer that question is absolutely yes I think that most voters about their pocket book I Do believe the Kavanaugh um\nEnded up increasing intensity on our side but uh only slightly we typically have greater intensity going into the off year elections but I think this is about\nAh economic security economic growth those are promises that we've made and we've fulfilled it's difficult to get some of the things done we want to continue to work on infrastructure but an F a a bill\nThat the jobs the economy those are those sorts of things matter to the voters and I think they're going to put us in a great position in the Senate\nOne issue you didn't mention that Senator Durbin a mention nonstop with health care and the issue of pre existing conditions and twenty fourteen you ran I remember covering your race down there it's when we first met you ran as a repeal and replace Obamacare Republican\nWhy aren't we hearing that this time around and we don't really hear Republicans talking about repeal and replace is it because of the popularity of the pre existing condition clause\nWhat for one thing it's a false narrative to say that we want to remove preexisting conditions I've ... I've got several cosponsors to try and and in the event that a lawsuit throws out the Affordable CARE Act we have to have a place\nIn September the ... the split between what who they want to be in control of Congress\nAll the negative on both parties was advantage Democrats but narrowly forty three thirty eight a look at this number here in October among those that are negative on both is suddenly a an open break here towards the Democrats fifty nine Seventeen\nUm that's what we saw with Donald Trump Peggy was narrow in September October came and the ... the ones that were negative on both broke heavily towards Donald ... what does that time\nAnd now it's breaking heavily towards the Democrats in general or does it towards that kind of thing um I don't know exactly what it means my sense in this campaign in a way to pop off something you said Katie is that there are a lot of different local issues coming up\nThat had something to do with the overall trend I'm also wondering if issues like Dick Durbin mentioned he started saying those Republicans are going to cut your Social Security they're going to cut air Medicare cutting their Medicaid that's something that's going to be coming up\nSo I and many people who would support in Donald Trump were very don't touch my Social Security Medicare Medicaid so maybe a little bit of that is going on\nI've had anecdotal evidence from some uh from some Republicans who say they're nervous at some Trump voters they vote democratic because they trusted Donald Trump and that's who they trust and they want to have a you know what punish the\nDon't really like the Republican Party or Republican gee I don't know what's happening\nOut in the campaign trail making at all about himself why you're saying I Am at the top of the ticket even though I'm not at the top of the ticket don't vote for Republicans are not voting for me it's making at about\nTrump or I guess I have to posit here but will pick it up we're going to get into the\nWeeds his race next time we bring back in ... when we come back on the revolving door and the Trump or the west\nWhite House counsel Don McGahn became the latest person to go through the door\nOne man that is here to tell us about what it's like\nTo go through the revolving door and worked for President Trump is Anthony Scaramucci he's but first here's more from my visits to Arizona and Nevada [noise]\nWell I haven't seen\nShe feels this year and I\nWhen he was fighting [noise]\nDid you ever look at the stains and your coffee cup and then realized that's exactly what happens to your teeth power swamps is the five minutes solution to get your teeth white without visiting the dentist this is John Green the c._e._o. of Paris robs interview teeth are stained from coffee tea or smoking all it takes is five minutes with power swabs in\nFive minutes you'll see an average of two shades wider teeth and in Seventy six shapes its clinically proven to white natural\nTeeth as well as caps Anthony years the secret is it to the church and that was developed by Dr Martin ... that live stains off of your teeth best of all there is no matter if you strip search trees that you have\nTo leave in your mouth for an hour just rub your teeth for five minutes and you're done to Dr parents rubbed risk free call one eight hundred\nSix seven eight nine ... nine six night that's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nights\nI guarantee you a bright white smile will have your friends talking about how great you look try risk free today one eight hundred\nSix seven eight nine ... nine six night that's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night\nNo matter\nHow modern your family might be if you're pedaling around bedrock and a gas engine vehicle you're living in the past\nMe yards the era the electric vehicle has a ride with instant acceleration electric cars are more fun to drive and more affordable than ever electric cars are here again to the president learn more and plug into the president dot com sponsored by boat flagging group of America\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you written a book and want to get it published page publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets\nThey handle all aspects of the publishing process for you printing ... publicity copyright an editing go eat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author ... should get that seat under advice zero one thirty six eighty nine for your free author certainly should get again eight hundred bonds or one thirty six eighty nine [noise]\nA British Chris Lawrence you're inviting you to join me every Saturday morning ...

of speculation and after successfully shepherding Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the U.S Supreme Court already the White House is on its second cheapest at its third national security advisor and its fifth communications director\nThe person with me or most no worthy and short stint in the west wing is one of those five Anthony Scaramucci will have the widest media shop protest eleven days he's out with a new book about his time though in President Trump's orbit particularly before he became President Trump the blue collar president\nAnd he joins me now Mr Scaramucci what can we press had to Sunday so the timing of your book are coming out comes as we got reports of a screaming match between a a former boss of yours John Kelly current chief of staff the national security adviser John Bolton was over\nThe issue of immigration was clear it was it according to our sources it was\nOver some comments that national security visor made to the secretary of homeland security a former deputy to the chief of staff\nJohn Kelly apparently walked out furious there were rumors of a [noise] a potential resignations out how to layer was at St how familiar with that same to you\nWas there any profanity I mean that could have been right so we weren't possibly some profanity look the sea is really not that familiar to me and you have to remember my incident was on a phone line with a reporter who I shouldn't have trusted and so that's my fault and I totally on that but I think with the more relevant thing is\nYou know people are playing in the NFL and verbal contacts and so people playing very hard for the president um I don't know what happened in that specific incident and um but you know I I Know that the west wing and the way the president set up the west wing it it's it's tough in there for ...\nYou were pretty tough though in General Kelly in your book I'm going to put up an extra pair the general style\nWould be in direct conflict with the way Mr Trump had always conducted business President Trump doesn't work in a precise way right never has never will it's been over a year since John Kelly became White House chief of staff but my scouting report early on proved to be quite accurate his personal in security has proven to be a poor match\nWith the self confident gregarious president look I think that's\nPretty self evident I mean just even this past week you know I applaud the general service of the country I'm obviously forty years in the U.S Marine Corps but this is a very different job this is a civilian based job and I think he's tried to apply\nMilitary like management style to a group of civilians and so that doesn't necessarily work and and\nAnd by the way you know the the president as a free wheeling style is very different from a\nA John Kelly's you feel personally mistreated by John Kelly you seem pretty you seem pretty upset at him and his book well listen not you know she didn't need to fire me the way fire me and I had this conversation with the president you could have done it in different manner totally I mean come on I gave a tremendous amount of money to campaign raised a tremendous amount of money\nOr did countless hours of media advocacy during the campaign and the transition and even after\nPresident was inaugurated a there was a better way to fire me but he was trying to make a spectacle out of it and so he got the spectacle that he wanted and it\nSaid it was it was upsetting at the time or I write about in the book um what I thought was an honest assessment of him and I'm I stand by the words in the book should the president even have a chief of staff given the way he likes to work\nOn the other side of is calling those who strongly disapprove of this president blame and none other than the president himself followed closely by the Republican Party but even among those with mutual feelings about President Trump's job performance\nThey still blame him for the country's division followed closely by the Democratic party and liberals and they throw us in the media in as well what it is not breaking news of the country is divided\nBut after being out on the road this week I felt there is a sense of exhaustion anxiety over this division and this whole proves it and until voters do punished politicians for creating these divides\nRight now there's no incentive for them to lead by example when we come back and game and why Democrats hope history\nA headache bidding I think\nA quota to the divide segment I just had the one thing we do agree upon in this country is that we are so divided uh we've had a couple of mob scenes where ... where leaders of the Democrats in of the Republicans were both publicly harassed here's this scene a with a house democratic leader Nancy Pelosi down in Miami earlier this week\nThey'd kind of Republican Party chairman actually apologized for the treatment of that meanwhile Mitch McConnell the Senate Republican leader a TMZ posted this video from friday night in a restaurant in law will where he is getting harassed take a listen\n\n\nYou know Peggy Noonan each each party and I've watched them and it really disgusts me they tried to weaponize these interest the these incidents on the other side saying look at what an angry mob saying on the left or what these angry people on the way we have been great people left and right that that made up its ugly it's bad and and I think leaders of both parties need to accept\nThat somebody's got to come down\nWe've got two weeks to go people are on edge there fighting the fact that we live in the media world we live and means everything taped so everybody can see it and everybody can get a little bit matter but I think somebody has to come forward maybe a group of people\nAnd say you know what everybody come down firmly that we're in a democracy that we can work this\nPresident of the United states when he was bragging about it\nLater he cannot do that he's not really in the position to he could be one of many voices that the\nPresident does it obviously a and it works with his base but at the same time look on the other side already I recalled or kick 'em right I mean yeah a Nancy Pelosi collateral damage Hillary Clinton where civilians they lack of\nSTART I think you have to acknowledge that that the heating up of the rhetoric and the and the anger and the punch him in the face and the body slam him that started when Donald Trump started campaigning and suddenly he moved to come to\nCongress saying well down for a while on animal area where he\nWas from an election but a lot of people to intensely about this will do it will come down here in Studio ... I'm not sure if\nThis is ... and we're coming back to the really important election and our constitution guarantees people the right to censor the meal but if you tell or if it's just what they\nSay is encouraged though ... it's it's encouraging every facet and you have an ... when you get on social media\nAll you see is this person is evil or that person is the devil and thank you so much for for hitting back at that person you stayed in every aspect of the ocean and I mean even when we do interviews I Know you don't even I have talked about this with without either person either side of the of the political spectrum\nYou'll have raw story coming out and saying oh Chuck Todd slams down or ripped apart why is it that it's the way we talk about they all", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "21"}
