by the ... and he uses it anyway\nAnd they don't say maybe drop is spreading false intel maybe he uses that phone to confuse nope they automatically assume that Trump is such an idiot such an eagle

with the mother investigation of Trump and ... what does that got to do with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there's not\nAnd and then they're preaching to us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about civility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying under Donald Trump needs to dial it back in Donald Trump's new

just a bit to talk about the caravan\n'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there John Case it and he is being\nInterviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter and interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who were legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter deal if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal now\nThey're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the ruse here or the technique here is moral equivalence\nThere\nBut for the grace of God go live Phil Donahue your students all the time Phil Donahue was hosting the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be he started preaching about the accent down some of his birth\nNo I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's what difference it made for me it if they started a stolen

Washington your next it's great to have you sir high\n[noise] creating trash from the right side of the once great the state of Washington and we're working here aren't you a unseat Murray chat well so she can spend more time hiking in mountain climbing his or her name was\nThat's a that's a great objective circuit graduation is a good luck\n[laughter] thank you hey I just wanted to know it seems like a um clock or you might be the perpetrator of these bombings and I wondered if you have any insight through your collection\nI Know you are in the ... you're the second person today I got an email asking me about clock boy and whatever happened to him you remember clock boy\nWas a fourteen year old Islamic student in a science project or a science fair made a clock\nA timer that looked like one that you would attach\nTo an explosive he ended up winning a science project prize a science project award for this thing I Believe and he was a fat had been taken to great like what did he go to the White House didn't Obama effect this kid\nDidn't Obama what am I ... didn't Obama didn't didn't didn't some government agency or official welcome to keep the washing of praise him for being an advanced scientific mind when essentially all his project was was a timer\nA a clock sometime\nI have an email here I got the call her out of the blue and I don't have email I have to get it during the break\nUm the email asking me about ... boy he was fourteen years old and it it was it became a costs to lead the kid was supposedly well beyond his years really in brilliant brilliant engineering mind\nAnd when everybody finally got to look at what he had done it was just a timer\nAnd it like the kind of time or that would be attached to some kind of a ... my memory was explosive device not his project was not a bomb or an explosive device but it turned out to be not nearly as technologically advanced as its height\nRight Obama I knew the Obama and Biden clock boy into the White House\nAnd made a big deal a out of his achievements and uh and so forth so the patient will will for the obvious question is if that guy could have perpetrated if a fourteen year old kid could have perpetrated a scam and his parents were in on it too\nHe got invitations to go to MIT and uh and the other schools and really the the device he put together was was not my memory is it was not advanced of all it was\nA it was almost the exact opposite it was almost so basic\nThat everybody was scratching their heads and wondering what was so remarkable about it a Steve I appreciate ... as I say I'll take it out but I have a chance to Jerry in Springfield, Massachusetts or next hello sir\nHi Raj cardio I'm good good good I just\nWanted to drop you know on your point about America giving more than any other nation I think what you were talking about was the government itself but you also get more than any other nation and the point is that\nI have the choice when I get to charity I give it to I don't have the right now my neighbor who they should give it to and that's actually what the government's doing they're telling us\nWho they're going to basically what they got from our tax dollars they don't give us a choice and that's my point\nIt's a good point too it's a classic illustration his reacting to the soundbites we play the John Case there was a ringing his hands and guilt over the fact that caravans coming and it's just for the grace of God that we're not in it\nAnd it because we're not in it but could be an except by the grace of God we've got to stop building walls because God doesn't want that and we've got to realize that that were just playing lucky it's kinda like written Richard got part the winners of lights lottery\nYou know we were just minding our own business one day and we got conceived in a womb may in America and we've got born into America and and man that's that's so much like that that we shouldn't feel were anything special or so the fact that we weren't conceived and warms down in Nicaragua Guatemala means that we all\nWe really do and we gotta we gotta learn to walk in the shoes of others and that's the wrong way to look at it we nobody has any trouble imagining\nWhat it's like to be poor that's why so many people strive not to be governor it is it's hard to imagine we don't have a lot of people in fact uh most people in this country go up and down in terms of annual income\nOr people that are in a lot of money and lose it all there are people that are in an average amount of money all their lives and that's it but basically people in this country no poverty\nIf they've never they've never been in it they certainly don't want to be they know enough to know not to be and that's the great thing about America if you don't want to be there are ways to avoid being in poverty poverty in this country by the way it was a relative thing\nCompared to poverty around the world United States poverty is not really poverty I got in trouble Everytime I point that out but it happens to be true\nUh statistically financially however you want to look at it but but the way to look at these disparities is not to simply say oh oh that could be me and then the run around and feeling guilty about it\nUh\nThe way to deal with this is not to run around constantly imagining\nWell you know if there's one accident and I could have been in that era man and then having that impact\nThe way you deal with it that doesn't help anybody it's not a ... but it does make you look like you have lots of compassion in lots of care but that's a great thing about liberalism it never solves anything\n[noise] liberalism as a\nIt let me tell you something on their country but you're so I brought this up last week last week there were stories\nOf the serious re appearances all the diseases previously wiped out an America polio like disease was one and other diseases and started affecting people that we had long ago Iran

just don't think the caravan is helpful to their cause because they have dropped it like a hot potato now they were hot the tried on the care of and at first because they could see their ... their eyes were watering their mouths were water they couldn't wait to say see Trump is heartless Trump\nIs coal he doesn't care they were hoping\nTo report Trump's promise to send to the military or
