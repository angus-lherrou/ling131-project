{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "Where everybody likes to Seventeen it's a popular number at a time when I see what happens to that you've been worried to death over there and what happens well\nFirst of all happy this is one of the better teams they've had to have eight seniors\nDo you know what I'm saying I Know and let me finish right All right [laughter]\nI have eight seniors juniors seniors in our fence and nine juniors seniors on defense so they're much more mature team they'd been even though [laughter] go on and take these foot off the gas\nThe most or fifty two\nIf he doesn't they may be in the sixties but I'll go fifty two Twenty one\nSo you're not as worried as you thought you were well what we get ahead and give you put the backup and and also I think our defense a little bit beat up right now\nOkay fifty two Twenty one so Steve or see what happens today\nWell I think ah we talked about a coup Williams is going to get his yard is it I don't think there's anything from out and their fans worry about he's going to break off for a scampering around it thirty five yard he's going to break out makes them guys Mitt but again it's about West Virginia forty six Seventeen and that can be exact score\nThere's a lot of the [laughter] ... shot I can\nSay I appreciate the confidence Brad what happens today well you\nKnow me guys I I'd I gave West Virginia the winning this game when the schedule came out so I had a year ago I said West Virginia wins I think what everybody is saying is what you should expect in this game the average score and the series is forty six to Nineteen so you ask why those scores are coming and that's about what it's been over the series\nI actually think I'm On the voice of reason here in this group [laughter] I've got it forty five Seventeen I've done the opposite of what I normally do normally I talk myself into the other teams I study them yeah I've gone the I think I'm under selling this but all old what I said earlier in the wake forty five Seventeen west\nVirginia so yeah you watch the tape on Kansas you just came in Kansas is terrible they're awful they're terrible but forty five Seventeen I mean that's a that's a dominant wind but that's not would you do better against a\nTerrible team I don't I mean that's a huge win forty five seven team that covers that hit the over that does what they need to do\nOkay All right um you know the Kansas is well two things I I think that the fact that West Virginia I got a second half scare you\nShould have been certainly ignited the coaches that ignited the players so they should give you at least three quarters today you know three three and a half quarters today um and\nUh that it's good to homecoming you're at home Kansas really other than ... who do you really have to worry about in this ball game so I think West Virginia has a has a dominant wind today and I think my ... production was fifty five Seventeen maybe there's a backdoor score they're fifty five twenty four something like that but\nAh my feeling all week has that been West Virginia gets to fifty somewhere in that range which is not out of the question and they should be able to against the skin decent\nDegree or disagree I won't eat shockingly you won't get an argument for me\nYou know I I don't think you can in this game but but this is the indicator today is completely on West Virginia and how West Virginia performs through we sweat three and a half court correct\nBecause I Do agree with the there's some defensive guy there's a couple of players that are decent but this western audience Allison\nWell we always talk players do what you're supposed to go to the next ... be who you are and if you're good as you think you are we should walk away with his game\nOkay alright got close I mean not say anything shocked shocked [laughter]\nAll right listen thanks for tuning in the game on some of you will see in three hours the

were not very effective and the second half all week you've been hearing about it right all week we've been hearing machine that\nYou took your foot off the gas you got like a days ago so I think as an offensive player you're anxious for your opportunity right\nYou want to get back out there you you're going to be able to see some things\nThat you can correct unfair I'm from the week before so this is the prime opportunity to get back out there and get it done you know the story going into last week happy we said when there's West Virginia gonna fat start fast\nThey had not done that in the first three games when I started fast last week that was an emphasis and it worked players listening and responding do they this week and put together a full game and did they start fat down the spurs

Honda\nThey got a little pressure on him and the defense of active nice job of bumping stills pushing his momentum to the back of the end zone and taking control that some credit them I think\n... gets over confidence ... some sort of things you can do it right in the coverage because he thinks deals will go and get it yeah great\nAll right so a Jeff Kansas now has the ball\nAnd this ... they go to the wildcat a and a ... and then there's a flag here so that's probably going to be a whole lot but they direct snapped up who got to see what the flag us year\nYeah probably hold but they did go wild cat and go to ... to\n... I get doesn't meet some neo see it a Kansas and credit I mean he gives you a lot of looks a lot of formations or at least trying stuff though to compensate for their lack of skill they get you in different formations I get more credit\nOh hold out West Virginia West Virginia yesterday that pushes the ball happy to uh the moving ahead here and now they're in a bender with the quarterbacking now happy vendors and so the ball is in the territory of West Virginia\nNo this is in this game and I know we've been dismissed in Kansas but this was actually a significant series you're West Virginia was on the verge of blowing this thing up completely\nKansas makes a play defense away now they're in West Virginia territory if they could happen to score you're I'm not saying that they're going to win but this is a pivotal early time in this game\nWell especially from a confidence standpoint from Kansas because you're right they were about to be completely down and out they have a little bit of life right here it still feels like a game where it's just a matter of time before it gets out of hand but you're right you would if you're West Virginia stop this thing right now to fall back\nYou know the musical chairs with the quarterbacks just blows my mind I did just regular guide I ... I only have any idea why they do or she'd have you ever saw anyway I ever getting the flow the game he gets pulled out every other place where you guys\nAre all want to say Florida that this was very or back when they are a lengthy Palmer or even before that this was ... and ah maybe ... um [noise] you know these guys are always better yeah they're not they're not as good as the Florida quarterbacks that\nThis is very difficult I mean as a as a quarterback how can you get to read them how can you get comfortable with the game\nBut if you guys have answered your own question I mean ... which is a three D. uh give the job to be seen anything from any of them that would show you hey it's my job I've got to everybody else go sit down no answer my question no\nThe answer to that for many other not just isn't just don't see that in any in college football like that just doesn't happen no it doesn't bother you might see to use the\nPlay one another and transfer so that's what really happens [laughter] just third and six or for Kansas at the west Virginia forty for your lawn\nAnd try to convert and you've got it yeah it looks like they're going to make a big catch here hop looks like he got his foot down that Johnson they're so big so pay vendor goes to courage Johnson for twenty six yards\nDown to the west Virginia Eighteen beat the west Virginia corner that's Washington the hero from last week got beat their by can't he did get a foot in\nDavid long was about a half a second away from laying out the quarterback just didn't get home that was in his past one of the kids live with the ... let's see if they ... on that as\nHe might've been a you know but what they're trying to get to snap off and there's nothing that comes here so they get that they do get to snap off\nBut nice play by Kansas and uh the Jay hawk to have a fresh set it down to your inside the twenty and that they're going to go to one of the big tied in God's split out and he catches a touchdown pass oh my yeah how 'bout that turn of events where the gentleman maven standards it's like he lined up outside it\nOK you had a big guy\nSo here's what happened is West Virginia I get the ball coming down or they're going to score again da da da and ... over confident forces the past and they're under pressure\nPicked off they run it out of the end zone a defense runs out of the end zone and they put together a very nice drive a very nice drive and get a touchdown pass\nTo ah make a day I'm One touchdown games\nHere in West Virginia is red zone defense had been doing a pretty good job keeping opponents out of there that is Fifteen red zone possessions eight touchdowns now for opponents\nFourteen seven now West Virginia weeds Kansas twelve seconds left to go in this quarter and game line continues after this\nJob training from your hands on training wishing for graduates are marching careers to be willing to say I have to stretch\nJak everything you know if you think you get points for you yeah for career speaking here for\nMore information and mission of training programs recruiting got shot point that guy for sending the job [noise]\nCharleston's ESPN is the home of college football and basketball major league baseball the NBA NBA NFL champions on me for fear of the college football playoff series\nEvery Wednesday at one tune in for a hyper local sports coverage on full force weekly with Jordan calling sports twenty four hours a day power by the white\nCharleston ESPN and one of six point seven and fourteen I sort of WB Network\nStill miss sports weekly with Jordan Polly um if you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen man of football the top ... game you know that\nThe Buffalo Bills sock and you can do that so I mean going on your teammates at halftime is is pretty lame especially since you didn't have the gall to stand up and look at them and say gosh I Can't do this anymore he went proudly to your coach and had him in up to the teams couch\nWednesday afternoons at one on Charles ...

West Virginia for one so this must be a point of emphasis\nYeah I mean I was just going to get a job that's a good one point after this really officials watch for parking of single exactly what's it called against Kansas and I am the same thing here against ... and you know they could\nBe interference vacating sometimes when you shift your defense of lumberjack or make a move call and sometimes you interfere with their cane so call to\nYeah they caught it on TALK or eat so that might be it they it might be exactly what have I used to do that [laughter]\nBut yeah there's a ... lab knew that is what it was done about it [laughter] it was so much like a new do this well there's no secrets\nOr ... said that the running back is by committee and guys they've already used for five different players and that ...\nAh again I think Kennedy McCoy is probably\nAsserted himself as the leader but lady brown today is look good yeah that's what you'll see lady brown took control that for a game they were really high on McCoy how he stayed in their ... bounced back and forth keep giving them all carries right get pet away and they're mix salmon for Russia's twelve carries the day for Seventy yards and\nWe'll Greer if not been a ... day but again there's that bar that set so high for Greer I mean these ten of fourteen hundred and forty three two touchdowns one intersection yeah\nWell that's the thing the bar so Chris Seventy percent completion and three Seventy we're going to go and I don't know what I'm saying that I I think the question guys now starts now so you're up Twenty one seven you're in control this game maybe should be more\nThis is where you get to All right what's this all fence look like does it keep throwing does it fine Giovanni Haskins again is west coast do involve you throwing the ball down feel what's the w._b. often to do now that the games in ...\nAnd ... isn't that what you want I mean as an explosive off and you have different weapons you have different uh versatility ... to be able to attack and defense so that's a very good situation for West Virginia moving forward\nAnd they're going to get there are going to get the ball back now gospel costs Kansas is going to punt\nA fourth and to nine twenty six left in the back in ... goes back to eat all that possession for Kansas we mentioned two we mentioned penetrate yeah he he also had a taco for lost and now\nIt's Kansas on the road we solved and go for four go forth down early and now they do it again guys look they're faking they're faking on the ... and they're going to get a first down wow\nThat's that's what you have to do and you're just trying to win for the first time I know I Love it when you put them to get to really turn\nTeam in round the fifty yard line it's probably a mistake could probably should've said ... regular deep and much\nYeah and I bought that run me how I Love it wow he argued that picked it up and he picks it up and throws it over [laughter]\nSo you had described that so the the guy snapping the ball was by himself they line everybody up to the far left yeah snapped it to the back on the far left and he had a wall in front of him idle idle that he had to do is look like exactly\n... that's all your money to get it all out\nThey're reviewing this oh let's you know they're reviewing it I Wonder did this I don't know if you sit review did this dinner pick it up before he threw it back I mean you get up before you throw\nBack some lateral ineligible\nGuys doing it if you're going to fill in the white guy doing it so they're going to review the entire play\nIt really on the field is the first time this guy this wrap this white haired guy you know he did about five thousand pushups\nThis lady about these ... ...

want to look your best friend would you should look like that no me either\nI don't have a memory that if you know I tell you what to say cuts kinda bummed me out here I don't blame Kansas for dinner but I but I Need will grow up with the ball back again here receipt I Want to see some moral sense of\nFireworks here yeah look lowered us down I think about what goes on West Virginia have Twenty one point but as fans and as viewers up this football game of following last Virginia you still you don't feel satisfied you know Twenty one point is there were early in the game\nYou should be happy with it but again that bar set so high you just want to see more and more of this often\nWhat was the call jazz dance on the field dancers the first down Kansas has it's a West Virginia forty eight yard

C. B. S. for it's been\nA ... I Know you're watching a lot of different things right now before we talk about this West Virginia game let's talk about this Texas Oklahoma game and a Texas up by Thirteen right now twenty three to town\nAnd just put the extra point on to make it twenty four and a ten so\nTexas does like three things well [laughter] and they're doing them all perfectly right now getting Sam Ellen gr\nGoing in the run game he just scored a touchdown for the long horn are going over the top ... Johnson getting a will join Humphrey involved and really what they've been doing is is just matching up front so they're they're winning with the game and then because Oklahoma's been playing few high safeties and trying to account for their wide receivers\nThat's opening up things underneath trait Watson on a touchdown earlier just on a little we'll route\nPutting them on a line backer well nine out of ten times you're going to have success with that\nAnd then on defense they're getting pressure on column Murray with just four guys or Texas really winning at the line of scrimmage and if there is a a reservation about Oklahoma we know they have speed we know they have a quick\nAnd that they can score but how do they do when they match up against a team that likes to play a little bit more inside of a phone booth likes to play had on hat or in the trenches with a little bit more power and physicality and that's really\nWhat they're up against taxes and they're really struggling to defend a Texas not doing anything complicated just winning at the line of scrimmage in dictating how this game is going so fourteen points certainly nothing that Oklahoma can't overcome\nBut somehow time adjustments definitely needed because I I don't really have any faith\nAt this point that Oklahoma can make the defense of adjustments necessary but they have to find some answers on often to try to keep pace yeah you're\nRight on that and it makes them the Maryland last protects us even more maddening if you're them so is this performance more about Texas is off fence or Oklahoma's deficiencies on defense\nIt's a little bit of both but I think what you're seeing out of Texas is more consistency and they're off and this is nothing new bride I mean you're in weeks six of the season you're not reinventing the wheel halfway through the year it's all it's the things that you've always been trying to do\nIt just can you do them a little bit better with the past few weeks with taxes\nYou'd get colon Johnson having a big game and then you wouldn't hear from them for the next game or you'd have a big quarter and then you wouldn't hear from them\nFor two quarters at a time now you're just seeing those play makers really establish their roles\nAre the diversity in which they you know they call these plays ... you're just starting to see it all come together again Oklahoma their deficiencies on defense you saw it against army having a hard time stopping teams that like to run the ball and play and really tight confined spaces\nNone of this is new it's just Texas executing it a better at this point\nBefore we talk about West Virginia quick thought Ben from you on the same alley or I mean he has accounted for almost two hundred yards of all since you're in the first half of the ...\n... ... you know they had that same elder shamed a shell a thing going on for about a little over a year and and finally they they just know that Ellen gr as the guy who's going to get it done because he can give them everything that they want\nThis off into reminds me a lot and this would make sense because Tom Hartmann was the ... coordinator for that national championship team at Ohio State\nAnd two thousand fourteen when they went from\nA a JC berets cardio Jones they don't run it at the same level that Ohio State was running it but it's the same idea which is get the the quarterback involved in the running game and then go deep down the field on your passes\nSo it's it's the same idea and that's why I say they're finally starting to heal themselves a little bit in terms of doing it\nLet me bring in a day weekly and Jeff Jenkins another pick\nBut yeah that own down on the gold on Fred he throws a an interception to a Hassan defense and he returned to sixty yards\nDown to the west Virginia forty five journalists to West Virginia had a third and go there were those who stuck in their steps in\nDavid ... Greer makes the touchdown staving hackle and he got up looking at his right hand which was kinda nervous they're so West Virginia playing defense Kansas just run up one play now they run a ... that can play an interception against Kansas so bender\nThrows an interception instead of they trade interception\nAnd we're going to get the miners hat on here again\nYeah so how how big is that played by Greer to make that stop on that intersection returned it saved it touched up\nAnd that was a hit keen daily guys they're keen Bailey with the interceptions you how to tackle for laws are for West Virginia by big load and a keen Bailey with a pickle yesterday and we'll get the ball back or after the break here at their own forty one yard line\nBack with them and a member of sitting here talking earlier it's Twenty one seven mountaineers mountaineers they control mouse years ago when uh but uh I don't know I guess we're selfish we're not really not really satisfied with his first half the appearance in what the ... been doing\nWell you know I we were talking before the game and it was asked about the national perception of this I mean what would this do for ... has been chances they keep role and do you just hold serve on this I'd say that this is the type of performance there now with Greer with a couple of interceptions when you really should be talking about touched on this is how you lose\nTrack in the highest in the race you you're not necessarily going to gain a whole bunch\nBy throwing for four hundred yards three or four touchdowns whatever against Kansas but you got to go out there and take care of your business when you start having multi interception game salty turn over again that's where you start to lose a little bit of ground and that ... certainly nothing that can't be made up later we all know that West Virginia's big stretch\nComes in November but this is really where you got to go out there and and rectify some of the mistakes that you made against Texas Tech and I saw that first interception in the end zone that that was and I know the protection was that on that play but he slid like right into that pass rush and then you throw a ball that never should have been thrown\nThose types of knocks on Greer that while I think he's obviously very very good\nSometimes his decision making in his willingness to throw balls that really shouldn't be there I think that's the one knock against him and it's showing up a little bit in the game\nBut in in your opinion and then what do you have to do the sixteen of twenty three two hundred and fourteen yards to scores to fix what does he have to do\nLet's say in the second half a to make book so yeah I had to pick but did you see what else he did\nYeah I I think he's just got to go out and clean it up and the second half\nAgain that they're not going to be a lot of eyeballs on this game so that is probably not going to be a ton of movement either way and you just got to go out do your thing\nShow why you're still one of the best quarterback in the country and and again I think at this point there it's really more about keeping pace or until you get to that November stretch because you're going to go up against taxes defense which is clearly very good based on what we've seen today\nGetting up against ISI you Gary Paterson's a great defensive line going up against Oklahoma that could be a shootout where you have to go uh you know across from column Murray and try to have the better game and not one so his opportunities are still ahead of him but right now I think you just got to go out there and and worry about cleaning up the mistakes that even making so far\nOnly about a good job we'll check in with the later okay All right there you go that's been critical CBS

[noise]\nSeem line continues\nNow back to the crew [noise]\nIf I can the game live where it halftime West Virginia on top Twenty one\nTo seven and talking about the first half and Dave and Jeff end it's just a as brand was saying during the break you know we'll Greer comes back in in half time they coach you must let him know what this safety is doing the walking down and and you correct that\nAnd we'll ... could still have a spectacular game\nYou know what to Fred ... and Dave ... West Virginia and Steve is that they've got to be able to run the football so I mean you look at you look at the stats here they got Ninety eight yards Bob roasters for Ninety eight years if they're going to be a complete offensive team they got to be able to run the ball when they want to run the ball so far they've not been able to do that\nI've always been critical that up but they know their personnel are there are a pass first team but today you just wonder what would have happened if they would've focus a little bit more once they go down there the goal on a run in the ... well\nI think you've got your answer I don't think they think they can that's why they're throwing it here guys that I mean let's be honest here there are very few teams jet that you look around and say yeah they've got everything you're looking for that just that's hard to get unless you're in Alabama even Georgia doesn't have that this year so\nI think they are what they are and I think it's more about the can you run it when you want to sure that'd be great\nBut I think you just have to have the threat or the appearance that you can run at times\nTo keep them off balance because really what what are we talking about her guys are talking about three bad decisions by will rare which you have to go back to Oklahoma State last year to find a game like this we had four packs and a loss\nYou don't see that very often you take a couple of those away and it's a totally different conversation than does right now so it's just really a total often chip breakdown or is it simply ... made a couple of bad decisions where he's tried to force it and make plays against a bad football but one of those\nBack I mean ... ... exactly\nEfficient going to be a special team that's what I'm going to focus on here this is a special year they've got to run the football better\nA lot I mean I don't I don't know I'll I'll get back to you in December on that I I don't I don't know that you have to\nWear the defensive lines are gonna be better than their plan today will\nShow me somebody in the big twelve it's well rounded and has every piece\nI mean that's what you're trying to do is want to make twelve title down the list of big twelve teams or give me a team that has every piece right in place because there isn't one right right there isn't one so now can you win the national championship and not no probably not but start with the big twelve title can you win a big twelve title without being a great running team yeah maybe we'll see\nIt is funny that here we are in the middle of October now well sort of October and the west Virginia hasn't played in a game yet where they've had to really run the ball you know pick up a key first down on a third downplay its you know here we are where you know a handful of games into the season\nThey really have an showed that they needed to run the ball yet but they're going to have\nTo I don't know you might go all year with that David ... who says on again to be devil's advocate here you know what if it's thirty three you've got titans now in the mix you got a guy out of the backfield that that may be this team's lot in life it may not be able to run it on third in one it it may have to throw the ball and that's why you're seeing tied ends introduced into this off as I mean those guys didn't just magically appear\nThere's a reason the ... coordinator Jake capital and Dana over ... wanted to mix titans in right there's a reason they needed that other auction\nOr there was not good enough up front of me is that where do I think you're seeing\nThat the last two weeks charge that you saw Texas Tech come right up the middle on west Virginian dominate him you're seeing Daniel wise in company get a lot of pressure up to date in the middle of that line\nI think again if we're seeing it now the west Virginia coaches knew this back in the summer they know their deficiencies better than anybody and I think you can say that interior line was a problem for them and they knew that early [noise]\nLooking at West Virginia's running here in the first half there's a difference between not being able to run in choosing not to run I mean on the drive where brown had a forty seven yard race into the red zone then he picks up by the Eighteen yards over the next play\nOn that series they ran the ball effectively the they open huge all their averaging five point for yards per carry here in the first time\nI think they just go it's just my opinion it's hard to criticize a team at school and so many points are running up so many yards but I Do think they go away from the run a little too fast I think they need to establish the\n... you have a part of the problem last week they went into the run too much in the second half even by their own admission and that's why they had the problem they did that against Baylor last year it led to the big comeback so I I just don't think you're going to the guys I think you're going to see the ... you saw in the first that is what the team's going to want to do moving forward good bad or indifferent or if it costs them this is what they are\nOut of your problems they all kinds of problems\nAs they live Twenty one and all other off and on the verge of ...\nOh hey listen how about the other thing I mean we spent all week talking about ... and he had I think fifty plus yards on his first to touch as\nHe's done nothing and outside of that he's done nothing I ... I think it's just an amazing with mountaineers defensively have done against\nGoogle Williams I brought up a story earlier here in broadcast about uh you know the incident that he had to go away and said he was nine years old I'm and mowing the yard with a cousin who was hurrying to get it done before storm\n... got in the way the lower ran over his foot severing all five toes the doctor said at the time he would never walk again it is amazing what this youngsters\nThough that's a great little nugget I'm getting with the coming up with that ... that's amazing that he's able to do what he does missing those says but you're right day but again Tony Gibson's been able to divide things that's not a single player at times so far in the first half they've held him and check and that's a great game plan and it just thought don't let poop could go crazy on you and make one of these three quarterbacks beat ya\nHis team mind now back to the hobby and the crew of am I going to a game line and the second half is underway\nAnd Jefferson day will bring you in right off the bat I mean Kansas just cannot get out of their own way ... run by ... only to have a block in the back I mean it's on and on and on\nYeah they do for a while you're only played the just the two minutes here they still have the ball but they face the Thirteen Fifteen and uh yeah they had a nice round pick ahead ten yards donor run in and as you mentioned the penalties and now it's come at third and Fifteen minutes after twenty of West Virginia who here\nUh the way to get the ball for the first time in the second half of it will be able to guys one\nNo Josh nor would end of the game remember he got out the first half due to targeting he is back in here at the start of the second half to get\nTo another plane make her back to this West Virginia defense so we discovered in Amsterdam he was probably getting dressed right Norwood yeah I mean I listen to sports language at night I did not realize you couldn't even be out on the sideline and the first time I know he couldn't Jeff when\nWe got there yeah huge play for Kansas 'cause they faced a big third down\nAnd they go to a vendor goes to Booker for thirty five yards down to the west Virginia forty five in Washington we didn't get beat a couple of times today got had their great game last week and dad got beat there and a third down place today advantage to the west Virginia forty five yard like hey look I don't go versus Gore here\nI don't know if you noticed yet they dropped eleven guys all of them are when we're at\nThe end or whether we'll thrown ball so the mountaineers\nJust to eat you keep them out here and you get the ball back and then you do it if you don't you do and what if you don't Twenty one fourteenth\nNation starts to take notice\nWhat nation they were the only ones watching the game well okay well so now I'm watching the game ... they start to watch it all you know I don't know I don't know I I still think the mouth of there's going to be fine things are going to win by a bunch I think you're going to cover\nA it's just I don't know it's one time it's the ... the next time it's the defense\nAnd but you got to give some credit a little bit of credit today to Kansas well as where she was saying for those on the defensive backs you do\nDecisions by will ... you don't see that very often to those defense of ... films that I've done that before Jenkins gets I'll get to hear what the Kansas all fence let's see if they can actually for before you start saying there's a gay\nAlright well see that's what I have to say that's fine but okay we're we'll let let's see here on this you know you haven't brought up what your score production was yet today and I know I haven't I haven't Fred but uh you know I mean can you can just credit there is a guy named oil her or Jay a\nGuy named Herbert that are running into the end zone for you and he did thirty one yard he was the guy last year remember the Old West Virginia had to do today it's come out play mistake free be solid ... and just like last week when the scores come up\nYou don't if they didn't even mention West Virginia and they move up to eighth and ninth and the polls right but what she hasn't done that today they haven't come out haven't been solid\nNow they give a touchdown they're down seven and they might win by bunch spread but you know right now now the off into what we got to go down to score and we'll see what happened what was your score production it was a what fifty five to everything fifty five Seventeen thank you Steve you Sunni five Seventy\nIt's a nice move by Herbert they're under ... pits looks like he had him stop just a little ... and he was gone\nBack and say well let's get a scoreboard uh [laughter] as

Oklahoma and Oklahoma got that late touched down to take a little bit of momentum into halftime but Texas is taken that ride back as a they've taken it right down the field on the first possession of

valuable bag visit their Web site at NBC banking dot com member up yeah I see\nLike a server and uh let me up to date you on one high school game underway right now in Parkersburg Catholic trying to go to seven and ... on the season the are leading in the second quarter against count and county eight to nothing All right Jeff bring me up to date\nWest Virginia's got the familiar scared to death you know I'm OK I'm All right I mean where she has got the football Fred then they're going to get a return here or by markets dams and they get it out to to the thirty five yard line or seems returns do we see this often come out and they\nYou know as you mentioned as you mentioned the numbers first half numbers for West Virginia three hundred and forty five total yours to forty seven through the Ninety eight rushing yours on third down there were two foster forty percent there and a average are\nReplaced Evan point three good you know that's good that\nThe only glaring thing in the first half was those three turnovers yeah really that's the only glaring thing now you have to respond right now the sheet I mean we we gave up a touchdown mountaineers did now they have to respond you want to\nGet back on track and let's not forget we brought it up already Texas Tech that last game it just leaves the sour taste in your mouth to play another bad have a good defense that you should absolutely what happened\nJeff I'm Sorry I'm Sorry what she's already there I just want to say they're reviewing that stems did fumble at the end they called it ... that he was on the ground but now they are going to take a look at\nYou know one thing which means not during his scoring from afar meaning we're not taking shots in the field very often and when we did we weren't very accurate ... that were big playoff things we have big play receivers we should take some\n... is that defensively you think you think they are preventing that I Know you can't see the total back in there but is that something they're doing coverage wise to prevent that\nThey may be but I I don't think so 'cause I think we have the speed and and the athleticism to beat anybody and didn't really matter to me\nShe\nSo we did hit on a big one earlier markets m's had the uh forty order I don't know I just feel like we're so spoiled we can ... and talk about the plays but I mean Twenty one point it yes you throw three picks and that first have they're still doing okay you take those three interceptions away and and they're in good shape\nI'd say review this uh and and I was looking down\nUm what'd you say but you can't you can't take those three turnovers away no no no no I'm saying if they review this last what they think ... might have been a fumble and you'd give the ball back to Kansas you talk about momentum shifting the all the way ... and it wouldn't be good\nAre less than ideal that are less rate idea wasn't it [laughter] that would not be good that's a course or in a TV Time out which is another seven eight minutes long so we just have to wait that out to see what happens there is a sad as many yards on that last drive\nYeah 'cause you don't write I mean you know this is so rare for him again you go back to Oklahoma State last year when he threw for pics in law that's what this type of game is not for West Virginia you gotta thank you overcome this and be the Kansas team but you just haven't seen this from the guy this is so unusual in a short time of year and a half career it just doesn't happen to\nThese un in West Virginia responded on the first downplay tackle for last against Kansas Kansas now facing a second Fifteen inside the six minute mark here in the third\nQuarter is this the first three bucks that we've seen from these guys\nI think I was reading David babies' lives on the sideline after that news it saved in my job saving my job\n[laughter] so we're go we're in a ... so another another tackle for last year by West Virginia so that David long to read it\nIn on the action or should they be mad to shorten these game a little bit then now big star downplay for them for a third and fourteen at the west Virginia forty they're trying to take advantage of the turnover western he's trying to shut them down here\nMatter of it yeah and then you get the ball back and give it back to we'll Greer and uh and see if he can start\nWow they went from ... to empty now they get five guys and a lot of scrimmage\nAnd so we said earlier meet some given some different looks here he'll throw a lot of formations that you\nAnd they're not going to pick up there yeah played little little swing pass out little lower little flank or screener receiver screen he was out on\nAn island and science is out here just limited though when you got you got ... Williams\nGot stems that can make some place but you just don't have a quarterback that that can make that many plays down the field so you just can't take advantage again from West Virginia committing the turnover there\nYeah that's just the safe call by Kansas same thing as a as a draw the sprint drop something like that not a dangerous path if he happened to break it gets some yards pick up the first downgrade if not you're safe she lived to play another play\nStevie go back to what we were talking about during halftime again if you want to talk about a a part of this mountaineer teamed today that's kind of lived up to what it had to do and and that's the defense or they've done a decent job so far they've even has six tackles for law they\nReally have Fred and considering there'd been a little banged up with an emphasis funded player and so ... for what they what they've done they've done exactly what they're supposed to\nNorwood back in there with him and I haven't even seen him and he uh he was out there earlier that for ... for Kansas he was in the case so he's he is back into the game\nProbably one of our best covered guys are\nDone about then agree yeah he he's definitely played well this year that's for certain mounted ears and another a break in the action leading Twenty one to fourteen again as we mentioned the Texas Oklahoma game has tightened backup thirty one twenty four Texas with the lead Oklahoma uh once again has the football so ah\nYou know you give them a chance and the again that one as a long way to go as Dave was saying what's the key here for the mountaineers of splits Jessica you and Dave\nIn a jump in first what's the key here now and third quarter as the third quarter is really starting to wind down some you're only leading by seven you need to make an impression that you think\nGot a hold on to the football yeah you know you've had four turnovers now but last Dr Jeff West Virginia established the run a little bit more probably tried to maybe a keep that going\nYeah are you what the I'm sure that the office of players are now looking at scoreboard starting to press a little bit uh it's only Twenty one fourteen ... not you know western his players the hey we're recognizing the country we got a squirrel scored a lot\nOf homecoming you're supposed to be four or five touchdowns\nWhen you ... you know the thing to you could it be for one deficit again just like it was a K state case it was so bad we got away with it at home we do this done two\nOr ... West Virginia needs as a play defensively you need a big play by your defense a turnover pick six something that's going to spark some light back into the office right now they haven't done anything with the football the last time they score was early in the second quarter so it's been a long time without in the office of production\nWell and you can also use it sees been calling for you could use a big play here from the west Virginia often get an easy sport pop that thing to twenty eight to fourteen 'cause you just haven't had many of those today this will be a good time for one\n... and to let this last play they finally gotten a bunch that which is going to want to tell Kansas that you better be careful claim ankles will pick you up\nYou know that was nice plans for the first down on the last play and now\nNow to do is go back to the run again and again wide open right up the middle and another first Diane lady brown with eleven yards for it and now he's a inching toward the one hundred yard mark he's he's averaging nine point six years a carry on bag got Ninety seven\nAnd afternoon right now and what she has nothing to vomit couldn't make out who that oh Jones the center Matt Jones right goes out Matt Jones Jeff right an engineer ramp\nThe wife had his toe pointing down\nFrustrating thing about this West Virginia often we've seen so many jobs start off a pretty fast on first down a lot of big run and then it just seems to slow down and that sort of mistake start to kick in\nYou know closer you get to the red zone where the mountaineers were perfect coming into this ball game seems like it just stops\nAt Brown nearly took that to the house\nYeah there's that Steve there's that middle of the field again if you can buster that first line you've got running room down the same ... safety\nIs there's nobody there I just got a hundred and seven yards on Jim Carey's and that that average Jeff Mack\nYeah ten point seven Twenty one yard that chance for thirty two yards in the last two place for brown feed him keep feeding him\nThat's that's the thing I mean we're we're we're running will and all of a sudden we just quit doing and start throwing the ball game\nYou well they're thinking [laughter] have you on the air down on that for\nA year to run to bring them [laughter] yeah you bring them in and all of a sudden boom they really shut it down\nBut you know if they keep burned a ball effectively they're going to force them to play single coverage from these receivers eventually which is going to open up one of those big place Brad\nWhich that's exactly what you want you want them to go one on one and led we'll rear work his magic whether it's with David bills or whoever he wants to throw to\nCJ Simmons that time for it and he picks up five yards Simmons has been targeted seven times a day and he's he's he's cut all seven ball based\nOn nice job here but I'm kind of interested in this day he didn't hit the big play for down the field but this is where West Virginians had some trouble recede we've been talking about as you get down into thirty that's one of the red zone the field compressed is All right let's see if West Virginia learned anything at the half there and was able to make an adjustment make a better decision from ... to get some points\nAt us what you need just better decision may [noise] excuse me better decision making about ... and uh understanding you don't have to force balls and the tight windows go ahead and take your second and third option\nI almost had his head and taken off the air and then he still gets the first time we was going to be a flag and we're going to have to go out of the game was that lady brown on the salary was that we're working on his ankle working on his ankle so pedal right angle Dana might get\nThrown out here if they don't call a flag on this will grow with the slide the hit around his head as he was going down to the ground which pop the helmet off that wouldn't be surprised if they in and goes a little bit bananas on this one\nThat was nine yards rushing by Greer is low blood happening up around the face and we're going to see\nThat backup quarterback I'd I'd I I went I called for it I knew it was going to have her later yeah but we're all good will come to the sideline and ah wipe off a little bit of the blood I\nYou see more helmets go off these days I Know they just let you gotta yeah they don't they item that watch the forums hit it's right on his head he gets hit on they had the hell is going to pop off occasionally\nI said why they took the time they take a timeout because then they come over to the U.S having a\nDiscussion there were the officials who you're franchise just got drilled there in the head\nYou know you do see how much go out more I you know back when I played in to the plate was before me I mean your your helmet fit so tight man you couldn't\nYou know they just don't do any leather strap flavored really tightened\nDown I have I mean now [laughter] you can't do that now\nA mouser there's yeah they'll get will grow back in there and but now the guys there in the ... ... ... people better it down in the area where you know what do you do\nRun it brought up on it yeah Ranit Allison's is what we throw this ball [laughter] Kansas City\nAnd they knew what he was going to get out of the thing is I wouldn't have been shocked had they'd\nThrowing the ball because ah Dana and Jake has inserted backup quarterback and thrown with them all on that first place so I wouldn't have been\nShot they have the one of the things they were concerned about Alison especially coming out of spring was that he was making so many turnovers they were trying to get him to settle down and make better decisions that's a heck of a trial by fire to get in\nThere and we got four turnovers already well you don't want to live in one more little five or ... years back in there right now so a with a minute twelve in his third quarter winding down the mountain tears nice wife a little bit of a Christian there and then get down to the throne yard line and this we're\nWell Kansas think they've intercepted in conflict ... who\nHad been a slot fest guys had an edited that in a flop fest he'd rather be an ugly\nAnd we'll go get a lot of phone calls today\nYou know he he should have ... around him his eyes off of it then you're looking at the defender he did it so now they face the Fred they face the third and twelve here so this ... this drive as a possibility of the\nThe boiling up all over the ground there are going to review the I'm telling you I'm not sure that ball hit the ground that turns into a pet I could hardly I'm Out turn into out here because I'm not so sure did you see the ball hit the ground\nI didn't see it around I Need to say it again well we're probably going to see it and lifting times well depends DVD could take another time out like oh man I'm not so sure the ball hit the ground but can't rule I tell you what I'm telling you\nI mean you can't see it if it's on the other side of the Sims calf here this might be a good angle 'cause look behind this cap\nBalls juggling it couldn't be it's going to be paid what do they ... they called it incomplete correct idea for the call on the field is incomplete is there enough evidence to overturn this yeah I think there is still yet to see it this will be an angle right here I still can't say oh let's say it was\nMidway through the third with Missouri leading South Carolina twenty three Twenty one so South Carolina closing the gap there with a third quarter touchdown hit U.S Open at ten point lead at home over Syracuse twenty seven\nTo Seventeen them that game's been delayed by weather up in Pittsburgh North Carolina state leading Boston College Twenty one to three that's the third quarter score they're update on those not news conference games fourth quarter were shepherd leaves on the road at West liberty Nineteen\nTo fourteen about nine minutes left in the game West Virginia Wesleyan leading the University of Charleston twenty to Eighteen that's the fourth quarter score and late in the first half when bill said\nLeading Concord twenty seven to Fifteen\nAnd that's the latest from the MVP banks scoreboard envy bank you're most valuable bank visit their Web site at MTV banking dot com member FDIC\nLike a kind of wages are guys let's get back up to date on what's going on with the west Virginia game or in the fourth quarter and Brad feeling a little more comfortable with a fourteen point laid\nOut what's her name is a nice job this year is it getting some penetration up front and ... Williams popped one around the outside just a second ago to play ago is equal rose was right there ... and ... turned on him in and around the ad\nThat looked a lot like Noel defined yeah it was a perfect meal divine play they say ... you kind of reminds you of the divine and he used to love to like ... which direction and that that's exactly what the what ... did they are but still wish you had a pretty nice job against him just had a couple of long runs but fifty seven yards on the day\nHe just hasn't had enough touches he hasn't had like a right\nTo you know he's he's had nine carry out an ad that one good kickoff return I guess they don't throw the ball although we did have six catches last week\n... their problem is they're all during all run team let's bring in a bin courage shovel the CBS Sports in bend a again watching this game the mountaineers\nSo they're going to win the ball game maybe not\nIn great great fashion however you your thoughts on this looks like Oklahoma was going to go down and you never know what's gonna happen it's possible it's possible for West Virginia not to play all that great today still win and move up in the in the end of the voting\nOh you think they're going to move up while I'm just saying if if ... Oklahoma gets beat and they're going to get beat uh what else is going to happen in in ... mostly on Saturday and could lose oh no they could lose lose how you you you might\nMove up but this is this is classic playing down to the opponent this uh this is like you could replace Kansas with Rutgers right now and and they would be sort of the same deal but [noise]\nI I still maintain that watching Texas right now this is no longer a to horse race and the big twelve guys right I mean we can say that no matter what happens today and obviously it looks like Texas is going to win that this is now a three team raised with with Texas firmly in the mix and\nTexas does a lot of the things that I think West Virginia struggles with it and they do a very good job running the ball\nWest Virginia is you know better upfront this year but it's still not the best part of their defense a Texas has defensive front for creates a lot of havoc and we've seen West Virginia is often become discombobulated when they have any kind of pressure\nThrown in their face so that is what is it November third game in Austin or uh I I think that we\nKnew that November stretch was going to be tough for the mountaineers I based on what we're seeing in the ... today and who knows this could be the super bowl for taxes and they could just go out and lose next week to Baylor and a classic let down but based on what we're seeing\nWith this team clicking about Eighteen gains into the Tom Herman era that's usually when things start to turn a corner for a new coach\nI this could be a really tough outing for West Virginia and I I really would not surprise me if this point forward if we see Texas or in that big tall championship game in Arlington in early December if they keep plan like this\nI I'm with you that as I look at this and again I I'm I Try and be careful to not assign trends further in the season but what I see from Texas stylistically seems to be will be more of a challenge for what's raven Oklahoma's defense will be against this western in the up and so I think you're right I think it's\nIt's clearly a free horse race I don't know that that's a total surprise a lot of people were high on Texas early in the season so yeah ... definitely got his work cut out for the first week of November\nI Would lose to Maryland in week one every year if this is how it's going to go and you know what do\nYou know what else you're seeing there'll be ... I at least I'm seeing failure is getting a lot of confidence in what he can do\nIs very confident because they're interesting him to make decisions and and we know that yes he can use a big powerful runners or he's going to run and we know that he trusts his big wide receivers in those one on one coverage is how many times of the hit college on his little plants right on the outside 'cause they just have confidence\nThat they can box out those smaller defensive back but I think it's also just him doing those little things\nThat and they just go to another touchdown they're probably putting this game out of hand but it's the little things to him going up to the line identifying ... that the defense of coverage is identifying you know where pressure is going to be coming from making adjustments based on that moving\nThe protection around the commands that he has of this off and now versus you know this time last year it it's really night and day and what have we always said about Texas\nThey're like good quarterback away from winning ten games the talent was there they just had to put all the pieces together all sense of ...\nAnd before we get back to the big twelve Jeff some uh some disturbing news there if you're West Virginia Kenny Bigelow down the training staff out ... and a ... tending to him it looked like a biceps shoulder arms situation for Bigelow\nYeah he's been he's been down a couple of times this year and you had to take a deep breath hoping that he'd be okay to be able to bounce back every time so this this isn't serious they took the brakes went to see what's happening here\nWhen vinyl flawed ah been before we let you go to and you were talking about Texas and in Texas when you look at before they get to West Virginia on November the third or after today next week they got Baylor at home then they go to Oklahoma State so it kind of sets up rather nice for them\nYeah it does and again there I think if they just keep doing what they're doing there are very hard team to defend because\nThey're not that classic big twelve team that likes to throw it all over the place go up tempo or you know score and and shootouts in when in the forties and in the fifties or they're really more of a team that\nLikes to play great defense slow it down a little bit grind it out with a running game in that forces other teams that are really prepared to see that I'm On a weekly basis to to have to a game plan around you and now they're just starting to dictate the game or a little bit more\nAnd you know Tom Hartmann the other part of this equation is he's been recruiting very well in Texas you know the past few years\nThey have not been winning those blue chip in state recruiting battles and they've been doing it more and more under Herman and specifically they've been getting those big physical not just on often defensive back sewer six one even six to ... those guys who\nCan match up with anybody on the outside and I think that sort of the un some difference in this game other than a you know big break by Hollywood brown down the field\nThose types of defensive actually does like Chris boy they're winning those battles because they can out match those do when they're paired up against them\nAll right by the good stuff as always we'll talk soon been tortured by sports thank you partner to take a break we're back with more on ...\nWhether you're a weekend warrior are\nGood enough to go pro that WVU sports medicine center can get you back in the game our physicians treat sports related injuries and issues like muscle and joint pain strains and concussions\nAnd patients have access to specialists throughout WVU Madison including orthopedic surgeons and spine experts WVU sports medicine at university town center called for an appointment eight five five WVU care\nRefreshingly Christian dating cool nights our favorite time of year is here at the company store dot com our thoughts of turning to the comforts of home like soft flannel sheets lofty down counterfeiters fluffy towels and cozy sleep where and with the company", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "06"}
