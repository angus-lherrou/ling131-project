DCA chess [noise]\nBy the way most little heads up here I'm going to continue today my at him and explaining\nThe divide that exist in the country specifically by explaining just who the left is what they've become what we're up\nAgainst uh to me it is the seminal issue that we all face we're talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as we know it\nI mean America is always going to be here don't misunderstand about this country's surviving as founded we're under assault it has never been worse\nOr they made of the civil war but but those were different circumstances\nA that was a specific arguments about cultural things regarding slavery that any and nobody\nOf any\nReason to attitude could ever support we find ourselves here in a multi layered multi faceted all out assault on the entire concept of America\nAs mound some people's sense it\nSome people are not aware of it and I I I've uh just sort of involved here into a\nPosition where I feel compelled to try to explain this sounds some warning ... and it may be present some\nAre solutions but they have to I have to be very careful I don't over do this I don't want to I don't want to you know me I'm In the nation's number one natural optimist and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the best way perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real\nThreats that we face are so that's coming up as the program unfolds back however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off apologizing to the nation\n\nApologizing to cabin all on the half of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him and they have an episode caught a size exactly what I think we're up against\nAnd it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas\nThe left is not interested in our ideas we're up again we're battling\nPeople who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing political arguments offered the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have\nNo limits on how low they will go on how the brave didn't perverted they will be in seeking their reality in all I Am convinced started on America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean do you go back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention with it because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born\nOr and so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't do it so the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this and I\nThought well if they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in that rise ideas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate and not even worthy of discussion or acknowledgment\n\nThat they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles and our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded this part of this country as far as their concert\nAnd it was all on display in the Capitol hearing everything that we are up against the abs since ... presumption of innocence Kavanaugh was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence cabinet was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required if you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do\nIf you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says buddies believable saying if then that's fine that's what we'll do\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nThen that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nThe rest of it the history on attacks the child

heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour\n\nBill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all this Trump action\nNow I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party tried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign\nAnd do not doubt me on this neither the Democrats in the media publicly acted on concerned on interested in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it's not that it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally\nPrivately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were Steve thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democrats' side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and those sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do what ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies\nTo her book signing ceremony Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd any weren't good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows\nBut seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death while they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but they're human\nBeings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy\nEnvy they have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside you couldn't get an wanted to get in ... with his airplane perfectly placed\nSo that Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made a speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe the show my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... that somebody's going to do this somebody's got\nTo try if they've got to be able to show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention as Trump can draw\nUp till now nobody on the Democratic side has even given it\nA prayer until the Clintons\nThe daily wire has the story Washington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that they are embarking on a nationwide stadium toured\nTaking the Clinton stage show to Thirteen cities this fall it's going to be called an evening with President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that's the actual title of the show\nIt'll feature the Clintons sharing stories and inspiring anecdotes that shape their historic careers\nIn

cost just over Seventy dollars\nThe Clintons are said to be more demand like Boston tickets will start at a hundred and twenty dollars and will cost that the high and seven hundred and forty five dollars and\nCents the tour will not make stops in Wisconsin\nAnd interesting oversight given Hillary Clinton's failed presidential campaign also didn't go to Wisconsin but Hillary and bill and the stadium tour will however visit Pennsylvania and Michigan I'm telling you what's going on here they're seething with jealousy\nBill and Hillary on those rare moments when they're home at the same time it together they sit there and they look at these Trump rallies don't doubt that they do they look at them they watch them and they just sit\nThere and they say to each other I Can't believe I Can't I Can't yeah I I thought we were popular back at it now is that we can draw a crowd like this we ... we could have done that hell we could have done it better troubling you believe that we\nAnd then they start talking about getting in on it and doing their own stadium tour so they call live nation which are rock music promote agency and ticket seller and so forth\nDoes anybody think including

U.

operations so then it became that he wouldn't be fair\nHe wouldn't be fair because of this whole experience because they're angry because of his extreme statements while he testified it would prove that he was only interested in revenge and therefore he became temperamental late on acceptable\n\nAnd then it became amplified ridge judicial temperament was just not permitted he doesn't have the values that we want on the Supreme Court\n\nSo he was accused of partisanship he was accused of judicial in temper but he was accused of sexual harassment none of those things stuck so it basically
