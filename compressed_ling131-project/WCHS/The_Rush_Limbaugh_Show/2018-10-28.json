Report and Joshua Johnson host of a warning on NPR\nWelcome to Sunday it's meet the press [noise]\nSunday Morning as our colleague journalists at O'Keefe wrote on Twitter late yesterday the worst anti Semitic attack in us history took place today just days after the largest attempted assassination of political leaders in us history but that thinking\nIt's a deeply unsettling assessment that has the disturbing advantage of being accurate this after a week of ethnic violence and political tear on friday a Florida Man Cesar ... was arrested and charged with sending as many as fourteen mail bombs to Democrats and other critics of President Trump\nAnd justice of the country tried to exhale as the male bombing danger seem to have passed we learned yesterday of the horror in Pittsburgh where a lot of\nPeople were shot and killed a ... a synagogue and the city's heavily Jewish world film they last night there were numerous vigils around the city in the country including this one in Pittsburg near the synagogue and remembered victims [noise] and our hyper partisan atmosphere\nWhere we will inevitably debate was the male bomber inspired in catalyzed by President Trump who kept his political opponents as enemies of the people or was he just alone are filled with anger and political resentments was the synagogue shooter\nIt was an anti Semitic act\nYou wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age but we just don't seem to learn from the past\nIt's that last sentence I'm curious for you to react to he said you wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age um is he right\nUnfortunately he's wrong on that I mean the anti ... we've been tracking anti Semitism for over a hundred years we look at anti Semitic incidents in two thousand seventeenth Chuck we saw a fifty seven percent surge\nOf acts of harassment vandalism in violence directed the Jewish community across the country it was the single largest spike we have ever seen\nAnd literally just last week\nWe released a report because we also monitor anti Semitism on line right and we've seen a marked uptick in anti Semitic harassment of political figures and other individuals simply based on their face\nSo we are living in a moment where anti Semitism is almost becoming normalized and that should shock and move all of us to act\nWell your state's normalize there was a time in this country was normalized\nI'm I trust me and my mother reminds me of it quite a bit uh in the in the forties fifties and sixties it went away after a while what\nWhat what's your explanation as to the re rise of this\nWell yeah I think it's worth pointing out I don't know that it ever went away I mean the HDL worked to fight it in the forties and fifties and sickness and today we are seeing this resurgence I think there were a few factors\nSo number one we are seeing an environment in which anti Semitism has moved from the margins into the mainstream as political candidates and people in public life now literally repeat the rhetoric of white supremacists\nAnd they think it's normal and permissible to talk about Jewish conspiracies manipulating events are Jewish and answers somehow controlling activities and that is it awful and secondly not only is the political environment contributing to this\nSocial media is amplifying and accelerating in shocking ways and so Silicon Valley as a part of the problem and needs to be a part of the solution\nOr I hear you on social media ... what about in the in the political and you talked about finance stairs\nOr George Soros uh is\nIs a democratic donor and he frequently is always described his religion is always included in the description other billionaires their religion isn't always included in their description when they contribute\nTo a candidates um what would you say to that\nLook the attacks on George Soros are appalling\nAnd the continued in vocation of classic anti Semitic themes I mean to see the way he this man is ms characterized on line is just repulsive now I don't agree with every donation he makes\nBut I also don't agree with every donation Sheldon Adelson makes but you see it from the left and sometimes from the right and it is all incredibly troublesome so I think whether you are\nYou know a an elected official bring the Holocaust denial or to the will of the house of representatives for the state of the union where you are a political candidate again invoking anti Semitic myths about Jewish conspiracies or frankly your religious leader who calls the juice termites\nReferring now she just got to ask you about a Louis Farrakhan and what and and the tolerance that some people on the left still half for him\nNow yeah this is an issue of left right it's about right and wrong and we should be able to speak truth to power whenever people in public life speak out with stereotypes in scapegoats that we know as you were alluding to before\nHad been used for hundreds and thousands of years not just to slander the Jewish people but to warn them and kill them\nSo like you said at the top of the show this was the single deadliest attack on the American Jewish community in our history and it's incumbent upon us to\nStand up and to speak out and just say we will not accept this not for another minute All right what could the president do in a perfect world\nWell you know whether you're the president of the United states or the president of a university or the president of your PTA I Would expect leaders to lead we would hope and we should all demand that those in elected office won't just\nYou know give platitudes after the fact that they will help ... back the rhetoric right now and they will you know if the white supremacist are saying and celebrating what you're doing is that

today and mentor elections before the event for the last Seventy two hours Republicans looked as if they had a solid hold a on at least controlling the Senate while Democrats remained particularly optimistic about taking back the house\nBut now it's possible the landscape maybe shifting beneath our feet\nAnd joining me now are the two men charged with getting members of their own party elected the chairs of the house campaign committees Republican Steve Stivers of Ohio and Democrat Ben ray Lujan of New Mexico uh and in the spirit of doing this together they both agree\nIt come on together and I appreciate that gentleman walking back to meet the press\nGreat to be on good morning good to be with you today I I Want you both to react to a\nA woman in Pittsburgh are reacting to yesterday's tragic events take a listen\nHave to stop that high leaders have to stop that it takes leadership to stop and our leaders are not stopping at too much we're civilized society we have to say several\nTimes since ... versus is a woman who was I think connecting all the all the violence and and the and the anger over the last of the last few days and the one uh what would you say to her about ... how would you respond to her saying we need leadership here we need to tone this down how would you respond to that one well\nI I agree with her I think we all need to ah keep our dialogues civil and frankly I've not been shy about showing moral leadership we are the only major party committee to cut off the candidate for their behavior or a candidate of New Jersey ... who said bigoted things we cut him off\nWe're the only major committee to show that kind of leadership or the Democratic\nCongressional campaign committee continues to support Leslie Coburn and Scott Wallace who have said bigoted and anti Semitic things and I think we need to we all bear some responsibility and we need to try to clean up our act and try to bring more stability to the\nTo our Congress and frankly to our dialogue\nBefore I let Congress or in a low on to respond to to to those charges that chip throughout their let me ask you about the president or what role should he be playing here and he played the proper wall yet\nWell I'm you know I sometimes disagree with the way the president or treats people I thought a after the pipe bomb sea initially set or the right tone of unity and coming together uh and I uh I Hope that he will continue\nThat initial a path that sounds like he didn't think he continued\nI said I Hope they'll continue on that path\nFair enough concert lawn you heard congressman ... says that you have not us continue to back people that he says uh have traffic that traffic ended in hate speech what say\nWell just first off that that simply not true but look with the concerns that that a woman hat and in Pittsburgh look another census active hate has stricken get another community and a place of worship in the United states of America and the Congress has a responsibility to act to keep people safe\nAnd it's not too much to expect leaders to bring us together to unite our country or to find a way to reach out to us to our greater good and make sure that we rise above all of the accusations and the hate and the finger pointing\nChecked so I'm certainly hopeful that we'll see that out of uh the leader of the free world and that will see that out of each and every one of us individually as well as our colleagues\nI and I would like to say I'm proud of the way then responded when ... was shot I mean we didn't blame Bernie Sanders when Steve ... was shot we all came together I think we can all come together now or it may take us uh about nine days for that to happen but I think we can all come together now\nWell I Want to read to yourself and Dan Balz start today though Steve is an added later today\nWell I Hope that I Hope the finger pointing will stop and we can come together I Believe we need to come together and then I\nHave to tell you I actually think Dan Balz is the perfect person to insert into this because he writes the following this was a time of the politics of the apocalypse\nAnd all or nothing to do the difference between winning and losing an election and holding power or not holding it politicians say that it is time for the country to come together as you just did but on who's terms I think that is the issue comes in on\nWhat this coming together mean to the Democrats and then I'm going to ask the same question to congressman Stivers I'll start with you constantly one\nWell look it's making sure that we're able to reach across the aisle and we can work in a bipartisan basis for Democrats had been clear about is if we're fortunate to win back the house which I Believe we will that we work immediately on Laurie prescription drug prices for the American people\nThat we work on a bipartisan infrastructure package to make investments across the country\nAnd that we work together to clean up Washington DC or to find ways to overturn Citizens United to address gerrymandering a to improve or an increased transparency and disclosure across the government to restore faith in our political process those are all areas where we can work together and reach across the aisle and find some common ground\nCongressman fibers what does it mean to you why do I think I Do think\nWe need to come together or not on anyone's terms but on America's terms we're Americans first\nI agree with them that infrastructure is something that we all need and we need to come together on lowering prescription drug costs I'm not sure why didn't didn't talk about lowering healthcare costs we need to come together on lowering healthcare costs a and I think we can do that we need to listen to each other\nA no matter who takes the majority are and I think we're going to hold the majority but no matter who takes the majority it will be a razor thin majority and hopefully that will mean people\nWill come together Republicans and Democrats to get things done but I Do worry about the you know making sure that we do it in a way that we're focused on getting things done not on just abolishing ice or doing the things that are on the extreme ...\nCongress insiders I Want to ask you about an ad that you're running um last week one of the people targeted by the pipe bomb or a a a sale it was a George Soros here as a part of an ad that you're running in Minnesota against the Democratic candidate there named in the end I'm paid for by the interests I enter cc take a listen\nThis is George Soros bank loans the resistance ten dancing in the un's employed by just sort of one of the liberal outfit in DC his campaign from them by other states superPACs back much shorter Smith you\nLook at who finances in Vienna employer radical George Soros most strict the biggest banks are crooked\nLobbyist Todd ... they pay the ... fund his campaign\nSupport the President Trump's message and his agenda and that's largely why I came out today\nIf you could send a message to do\nWith that message um things need to change the BS out of everything drained that's why I get it together we are one\nThat says it's time to put our politics aside step up to the plate pull up your pants and let's get to work and get the song [noise] well\nYou know here we I Will tell you this\nAh and I I look I don't know a me what\nSeventy two hours are going to impact is but I can tell you this all those voters I talked to they they were ready to vote but not optimistically they ...\nThey were gung ho and I I think this is going to have an impact as a\nVoting out of anger not out of hope yeah which is traditionally midterm strength what gets people out to notice that they're frustrated with the party that's in power what I find fascinating about this here was you know when we started talking about this lo these many months about what the battle for the house is going to look like we said\nYou know the real challenge for Democrats as they have a structural problem\nThat between gerrymandering and partisanship there just aren't enough seats in play for them and they have a problem with drop off\nAt their most a loyal voters younger voters voters of color aren't going to show up well now here we are nine days from election and its Republicans have a structural problem you pointed out it's suburban voters that used to be reliably Republican\nPresident Trump is toxic with them and now the real question is are those drop off though there's especially Latino voters and younger voters going to show up that can turn a good night for Democrats into a blowout for Democrats\nHere's what you guys think of the amped up you know the rhetoric is popping up in debates I Want to play an exchange of Missouri Senate between jobs Holly and Claire McCaskill and then in exchange between Rhonda scientists and Andrew Gillum the two candidates running for governor in Florida take a look at the heat for both take a listen\nWhen you hear leaders of the Democrat Party like Hillary Clinton saying but you can't be civil with people but you disagree with when you have Eric Holder another Democrat leader saying that uh the new Democratic Party tricks people who they disagree with I'm disappointed that the Democratic party seems to embrace this\nRonald Reagan I may disagree with them on a few things but he worked hard to unite the country\nYou never would have hurt him using kind of the rhetoric that our president uses now\nOh am I supposed to know every single saving somebody may I'm not\nCalling Mr dissenters races I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist\nWell there you go I find what interesting they're Christian Walker is the different tone so you have a Claire McCaskill invoking Ronald Reagan in a red leaning state in Missouri but Andrew Gillum feeling much more comfortable and a purple state take going harder at his Republican opponent\nAddressing the issue of race head on a it is never would've heard bronco Obama go back to have already that went away their interest ... it's very interesting it's a very different tactic and I think it is reflective of this moment right now and and I've been on the campaign trail\nThis week so I can I can tell you that people are fired up and and the president is going back to what he sees as the basics what is he talking about to fire up his voters he's talking about the caravan he's\nStoking fears over immigration again um we expect him to give a speech sometime this week in which he's going to announce a crackdown on those migrants who are heading toward the U.S\nShe sees that away as a way to get out the base anger fear", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh
