as attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions\nAre what are matters of same thing is happening\nToday with the economic news we ever GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected\nAnd so the drive by reporting\nThat economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression\nAmong the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth\nIs it didn't come into the ... to predict in three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath specifically\nGoogle also on his alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every day is stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive by to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama\nWe didn't see that much before Obama wins and very often in this economy still Trump getting right along with the drive laws are reporting the day\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this from\nA meteorite\nA headline Trump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms\nNobody talks about this yesterday this was a I fought a left wing media narrative that has created\nBut apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump to today complained about the pipe bombs being sent to prominent Democrats lamenting that scare has distracted from news about the terms and even Sloan Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and that the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly swallows news is not talking politics\nVery unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote\nThat this week\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has\nYou might guess his I sadly I Wish it were the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the news and what is it\nAnd if there isn't any news about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or and then it just stopped\nNot newsworthy enough anymore so the bomber thing has come along I mean it dwarfs the caravan that news stop being reported but more and more importantly all of

they got it\nFrom the Florida voters search site which they might have done but\nThey would have had to know his birthday to get it\nUm we don't know his birthday so we can't double check the claim here so this this stuff\nJust happened to happen right as the program is beginning I have a lot of data you know is a highly influential a major media figure I have all kinds of people trying to influence me with what I'm saying flooding lose on with things they want me to repeat\nA now say I guess the Philippine name the guy's family seems to have come from the Philippines calling him Native American and\nI and again and flooding in his own here with the with the information for you that as as I receive it [noise] um and whether or not any of this stuff is true keep in mind is what's making first impressions\nAgain I Can't emphasize that uh the enough now the drive buys have stopped their coverage and have joined the President Trump\nThere is in fact I listen to it a little bit of ourselves he's got a big powwow heading up there ...\nFor the media thank you very much I thought I'd do that and uh we feel very strongly a again congratulations to all law enforcement who had the best in the world and they just showed and thank you\nVery much for young black leaders of the White House [noise]\nNow to the subject at hand [noise]\nTo be with so many brilliant and that's what you are brittian courageous alright yeah they can proud of them are so much about it is\nBecause he's not getting on to the ... the the real meaning the reason for the meeting there which is unprecedented by the way up state leadership committee or hundreds of young black leaders are in America that are gathering at the White House has been a lot of ... about this I guess the president made\nAnd acknowledgement to law enforcement for their great work and tracking down the bomber and bringing that story to a to a conclusion\nAnd we were rolling on it and whatever he said that was relevant we will pass that I'll say I want to grab the phones get started there it's open line friday and I know you want to weigh in on this\nAh so are we going to start a just or do we have the ability you don't have the ability to give them okay Jimmy and Omaha Nebraska we're experimenting with a bunch of things here today folks bear with us Jimmy and Omaha great to have you how you doing sir\nI'm thanks for having me on rush 'em I Want to run my theory value um and I'm going to say in advance I had this thought process in my mind even two years ago I'd have to look in the mirror and say what's wrong with you but I've become so cynical towards the media and the radical left in this country\nThat I'm just thinking this way nowadays okay but this this whole thing with a package bombs to me reeks of deep state and I truly believe you've been talking about\nHow you don't think there's going to be a red wave\nOr a blue wave I'm Sorry ... and I think I think these folks know that there is no red ... I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are\nAnd I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house once the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that Feisal document and that dot CA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the ... I think these package bombs are means of disrupt in these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these nationalist right groups planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in this election for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing of the turmoil I really do\nI so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're gonna lose they're not ... they're going to win the house back Democrats than the deep state thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state Lewis as they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we can't our democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that the\nThe deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and have the left when in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean like I said rush three years ago I would've said I'm Crazy I mean I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\nI mean you're talking about some very high profile people being in a lot of trouble\nTheoretically he'll ... eventually the gears of justice grind slowly but you'd like to believe that actually some of these people are going to pay for what they've done\nWell wait a minute why why isn't that happening now the Republicans around the house of representatives now why do why do they have to win it again in order to conduct these investigations that Jim Jordan says are coming up\nI think Trump will have more to do with pushing it forward once these elections are over I think there are deep state people on the Republican side who helps slow roll this thing I really do\nI think Trump will be the one ram routing it once was elections are over if he gets the big win because this will\nHe's a mandate about him they if they really\nSorry to say let's discuss the you think Trump is essentially on the ballot\nIn in this election there's no wrong answer her do miss don't misunderstand my tone I'm trying to learn what you think you you think that Trump is essentially on the ballot that this these midterm elections in part or maybe ... close in total are a referendum on Trump\nNo doubt about it look at the effect he's having when he goes in and campaigns for people in the states that was supposed to be such trouble for the Republicans I think he's definitely I think these people on the left I think this is going to be their big moment when they finally jam it to this guy and get all their investigation started I think they think this was the beginning of the African\nI Will share something with it I was I was reading a a tech blogs yesterday and folks I really appreciate you indulge me talking about this it's my hobby not keeping up with the blockers meant keeping up with the\nTech and to keep up with the tech yeah have to read the stuff and\nIt's all written by a bunch of young millennial journalist and they have ever since election day two thousand six\nDay and they haven't been in various stages of panic and I I'm a\n... there was a reference in one of the tech blogs to a poll\nShowing the red wave of the blue wave was not going to happen\nIt was not nearly as big and this particular blogger was in a mile to panic about it writing about you know what we all have been thinking that what happened in two thousand sixty in was an odd confluence of events\nThat that gave us a one off result that it's not really representative of America that Donald Trump and these Republicans is not who we are\nAnd it's not how do we choose who to give the gift of coming into the U.S and he's a trick question I'd like to suggest that we have an answer for that and it's called the legal immigration which is the only fair way to make that choice\nHere here\nExactly right the way we have always done it\nYou know getting into this country under legal circumstances has always been a privilege it's always been an honor its always required some effort you have to learn about America you you have to want to be an American\nNow as for governor case that I don't think governor Casey\nWas advocating for anybody in poverty around the world being led into America that's not what he was doing\nHe was simply trying to advertise the size of his heart to I think governor case it is still one of these people that thinks Donald Trump has destroyed\nThe Republican Party and the things governor case that cares about\nThe governor case it once everybody's you know hey you know I saw big heart I look at these people that are down trodden a disadvantage that I still love 'em and I still care about about I don't think ill of them and we've got to be able to put ourselves in a in in their shoes and understand he he just want everybody to understand that he has a caring\nFought for compassionate person as opposed to this bunk and he thinks is in the White House\nAnd uh 'cause he clearly not advocating for every one of the lead in the country\nThat's a ... it's not possible number one um and and would never happen so that's not his uh his real objective anyone I'm so glad you called Tammy thank you

Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people in some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger that at one of their crackpot viewers is going to take action except that there is\nCrackpot CNN viewers shut up a Republican baseball practice crock pot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example\nOf attempted violence against conservatives when right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is no public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places and these are genuinely threatening people\n\nAnd they are confronting people and demanding that they leave and and there's not there's never any condemnation of the ... you never hear CNN condemning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj ... was Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insanity is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nThat I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd spout the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people will see in her find people's data that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch\nPowerless lay as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our issues they have lied about them misstated the miss characterize them they attempted to interview and the character\nIn honor of conservative people spokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun at a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our politics because the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSo we talk about where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody comes down to Trump\nHow a lot of people said Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm certainly I'm not talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and hide judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves\n\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is ... perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it\nThey're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\nAnd to be exam\nFrom having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this is Dan I mean if you if you wanted\nTo decorate in dress up a van that says notice me and if you want to everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top are major over the top\nThis is what you would do so my two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today as he convened a meeting black Leadership Conference a young black\nLeaders from all over the country this has not been done before in in this in this manner\nUm [noise] and he's talking about the rest in these bombs here\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that had been male too high profile figures throughout our country and a media organization I Am pleased to inform you\nThat law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[noise]\nCredible job by law for us we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation find the person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nNow I wanted one can remind you of Trump\nPacing if if you think Trump is not\nAs important as your baby or selling out just hang on I Want to remind you of Trump's first reaction after ... forge showed up\nThe ... at the Senate Judiciary hearing what a Trump say I've found her very credible I really hope that she continues to testify I think if what happened or happened and Kevin on maybe ... that's what he said at the

O'Rourke well outside the margin of error\nBut the cook report people say we are aware of other polling that shows a closer race back to Florida for a moment thirty eight Florida sheriffs are demanding Andrew Gillum withdraw his anti cop pledge\nThirty eight elected Florida sheriff's on Thursday called on Andrew Gillum the gubernatorial candidate here for the Democrats to immediately and then it quickly withdrawn he'll support for a radical organizations freedom pledge that refers to anti police rhetoric\nHere is in parts of the letter that they sent the Gillum we the underside members of Florida's law enforcement community ask\nThat you immediately and unequivocal you withdraw your pledge to the organization dream defenders after learning of this organization is disturbing and anti law enforcement position and statements we believe that any candidate wishing to lead our state should have no way be aligned with this radical group\nThe pledge that you assign to Mr Gillum\nNot only calls for you to defend police and prisons but the papers that accompany this pledge wrongly claim that police were never meant to protect and serve me and you and blah blah blah blah blah [noise]\nThe pledge in question is a it's a project of something called dream defenders and anti Israel anti capitalist group with which the Democratic governor of Florida Andrew Gillum has had a close personal and professional relationship what in the world\nWhy in the world what anybody\nAnti Israel anti capitalist group Gillum has had a long association with the\nFolks there is\nFor those of you in Florida I Know you know that\nI have a desire to outcomes here and you know than I Am an unabashed conservative and so forth but just for the general welfare and wellbeing of everybody in this state it literally makes no sense to elect somebody who believes\nThat the way to prosperity and and sustained overall economic prosperity and contentment\nWhich has been undergoing ongoing here for a while needs to be ripped apart from the way it's absurd anybody ... boggles my mind but I Do know that education\nAnd media have been well successful in programming people to believe and the wonders of socialism\nEquality fairness and all that except it doesn't happen it doesn't exist where ever socialism happens to be deployed uh I take it back that forty seven percent Trump approval is NBC Wall Street Journal\nWill blow me down\nShortly Kirk and his tweet didn't cite the poll say they can't be one of the big ones but it is\nForty seven percent Trump approval ABC or NBC Wall Street Journal\nThe runners are their accomplices as there's somebody that has been working on this guy for some period of time inspiring it motivating revenue him up I mean there's so much that we don't know yet and we don't know what we're going to be told we don't know how credible what we're going to be told is\nDespite\nAll of that there is enough information gleaned simply by exposing yourself to that which is reported so far today\nAnd you add that to what you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here and do you think for example that the\nThe deep state not ... the Democrat Party\nSee I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years on this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big that is so outrageous what has been\nDone in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies in the Trump campaign why the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nStaffers and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia Russia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still\nOngoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began\nGeorge Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned it in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Mahler\nJust briefly to recall\nPapadopoulos was a young eager beaver so called foreign policy advisor on the Trump campaign and you never met Trump he never gave him any advice\nBut he was hired early on because the media was hounding Trump or your advisors who is obviously fills out these positions Papadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign and stuff and help her\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joseph Smith Seward who planted in his mind the idea hey George do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lot of Hillary's emails\nNo I Know that Stephanopoulos twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they tell him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London\nAnd ambassador to step in not just you know\n[noise] told the we we know that the Russians have a lot of Hillary emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told him well they planted it in his head he didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true\nSo Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the investigation will get the ... orange what's all bogus that was not when the investigation started it started way before that\nMy point is how much the deep state wants their government back we don't even really understand\nWe think we do but we don't have any idea these people have an entitlement to our government the strings the levers of power their positions in at you and I cannot relate to we can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it hits there's\nThey are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother and but this whole two years ... who\nThey are hell bent that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out and the fastest way to making sure\nThat nobody ever finds out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get to the Senate and the White House back and then everything's cool the cover up we'll continue nobody will ever know what really happened\nThese people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared that's another reason why Hillary had to win and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to distract everybody and and be a cover up\nFor the real conspiracy and the real ... and the real collusion with on well if I Believe all of that to be true and I do and I know it is true I'm not I have no doubts about it\nI Will those people are capable of anything to get what they want I have no doubt about it\nAnd I'm Sorry it's not my fault for being suspicious\nThey have made me suspicious and all of you that attempt this ongoing attempt to destroy Donald Trump to overturn the election results to thousands sixteen and it was codified epitomize if you will in what they tried to Brett Kavanaugh it's no different\nAnd they aren't going to stop and they I I don't need to be told her reminded how fit to be tied enraged they are over their failure to get rid of ...\nI Know they're psychology I Know these people in the media and I know that these Democrats they are just ...\nBeside themselves that every thing's they've got in their arsenal of weapons hasn't worked\nSo given that this is the sum total of\nIntelligence guided by experience I don't believe I'm not gonna believe just because I'm told that something happened the way it did and that's a shame it's a shame that that the highest levels of our government has gotten to the point where\nThis trusting them is a common sense ethical thing to do but they've brought this on all of these nameless faceless anonymous sources with all of this order be asked\nEvery day for two years New York times CNN intelligence community resources and former American intelligence officials tell the New York times ...\nBlah blah blah blah blah blah [noise] every day sometimes many times a day for a\nYear two years\nStuff's made up out of whole cloth news stories literally made\nUp all to advance advance the agenda\nOf essentially canceling the election results from two thousand sixteen and finding a way to get Donald Trump out of office and it was to people\nDemocrats Republicans moderates independents never Trump hers on the conservative side the whole of the Washington establishment so\nHere we are two weeks before the midterm elections the Democrats [noise]\nThey have to win it\nThey've told everybody to the American people are tired at Trump and they want to get rid of it and they realize their mistake they've been telling everybody there's going to be a blue wave it's a fate accompli Nate Silver eighty five percent
