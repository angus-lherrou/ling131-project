interesting that the annuity product is arguably one of the most polarizing financial products that's available depending on who you talk to\nThey're either going to love them and have ever found appreciation for them or they're going to think that they're the worst financial product ever created and the truth is somewhere in between and you have to make sense of\nHow it is to use this financial tool within your portfolio and that's what we're going to discuss today but more importantly Brett when we published in audio book a while back we published this specific to the annuity topic in the title of this audio book that we published\nIs the good the bad and the ugly\nAbout annuities so think about that we we walk through everything that you're going to need to know from understanding the good and then the bat and the real ugly because there certainly is ugly\nIf you'd like to have this audio book shipped to you normally the cells on Amazon for thirty dollars but today as a gift from the show we will send it out to you just give us a call the audio book is the good the bad and the ugly\nAbout annuities you can reach us directly at Tripoli AAA Ninety five Seventy two that's eight eight eight\nEight eight eight nine five seven to all you have to do is leave us your contact information and we will ship you out of complementary copy of that audio book the good the bad and the ugly\nAbout annuities and Brent you know we talked about consumers want financial products that have guarantees to them and they're willing to give up some growth\nTo get that guarantee but the reality is is there are very few guaranteed financial products out\nThere that Markey you know some people on the surface they want to hear what they want to hear\nAnd so what they would like to hear is that you can get this amazing ready to return it's guaranteed you can always get access to your money twenty four seven anytime you want that's not how financial products vehicles and financial tools typically work like you pointed out there's gives and there's takes there's pros and cons\nAnd the key with all of this and why I liked the title of that audio book so much and as you pointed out you do have to consider the pros and cons the good the bad maybe even the ugly before you make decisions with with your uh finances\nAnd part of the purpose of that book is to get people to understand there is the right time to use an annuity in a wrong time there's ... ways to use an annuity in wrong ways to use an annuity so when people typically hear something bad about it in ... if they could dig deep enough and asking a question that get the right answers\nOftentimes what they really find is that wasn't used the right way or at the right time and therefore the ugly part of it kind of came to the surface and they weren't maximizing the way the tool is meant to be so\nThere are multiple ways to look at an annuity ... and that's that's really the key here is you have to understand\nHow to use a duty inside of your portfolio but bring we need to talk about some of the financial products that offers some guarantees we have to discuss exactly what these guarantees are who's making the guarantees because I think that's another important factor as we look at and evaluate which financial products we're going to use\nInside of our portfolio will do all of that will look at all the various\nGuaranteed options that you have for your dollars but before we do that I encourage you to give us a call in request to the audio book the good the bad in the ugly about annuities give us a call triple a triple eight Ninety five Seventy two that's eight eight eight eight\nThey expressed an interest in having financial products that have guarantees but the question is what's available out there because there's only certain options when it comes to guaranteed financial vehicles and let's talk about what's available and then who's making those guarantees\nSherman or a absolutely and you're right and the other piece to that is what exactly is guaranteed\nAnd then we'll get into that a little bit later to when we come back to talking about annuities is a potential option but\nFor many folks entering retirement one of the tried and tested strategy is to put a portion of one's nest egg or retirement savings into some kind of a guaranteed what I call a bank type account or bank investment our product like a bank CD is a good example\nYou know what the interest rates going to be when you buy it you know how long that rate is guaranteed for and you also know when you have the ability to move it or to change that strategy without getting hit with some kind of a\nPenalty or a ... and your interest earnings or a surcharge or what not so you kinda know from the get go exactly what you're going to get and what to expect\nNot also comes with some downsides\nIn today's low interest rate environment CDs it's been a long time since they've been an attractive guarantee and investment for most people because of the rates are just so low\nAnd it might take time even if it said does maneuver rates down the road we don't know our interest rates might end up in the next five ten Fifteen Years you have no idea so it becomes a little challenging to get competitive yields and rates of return sometimes and sees depending on the interest rate environment\nThe interest rate is taxable C do have to claim that is taxable gain when you're earning gain and those dollars so it comes with a few challenges as well\nAnd when we look at who's guaranteeing those dollars\nCDs come with FDIC insurance and so there's a nice little\nI guess security blanket when it comes to investing in CDs and that's part of the reason why a lot of people find them attractive and they're willing to perhaps give up some of that that upside potential for that security\nAnd comfort of knowing that there's that guaranteed back in the next option you might look at it as U.S Treasury securities and\nEssentially if you're not familiar with us treasuries are used to finance the federal government debt and so\nIn essence what is going to happen is they are guaranteed\nBy the U.S government's full faith and credit or in other words their ability to tax us right and so there's the guarantee there and really that's a pretty safe bet however when you look at rates of return there\nThere's nothing to to get overly excited about usually and so again there's that given take that comes with it and this is where people will often look at\nThe annuity as another option\nFor some guarantees and so let's talk about the different types of annuities Brent and later we're going to get into you know the downsides and what to be looking out for but first of all let's talk about the difference\nBetween two broad categories the first is\nThe immediate annuity and then in a moment we'll discuss the deferred annuity let's talk about the immediate annuities first what is it and how does this work\n... you know it's one of the simplest annuities out there in in a basic thirty thousand foot view of immediate annuities is\nWe're familiar with that is fine with better housing is your right you've got to go watch warehouse public service message from the national fair housing alliance\nFind the financial information you hear a new show on demand at usa financial radio dot com\nOnce again with Brenda Anders here's Mars Mars when\nWelcome back to the program if you're just joining us we have been discussing the exciting topic of annuities and what's interesting about our show and hopefully if you listen to us in the past one of the things that we really strive to do on the show and all of the usa financial\nRadio advisor strive to do is provide transparency and that's really what we want to discuss or the course of the next few minutes is looking at trends parents see and understanding and looking at a new disease from all different angles and the thing that's interesting\nAs we look at a ... and really dissect\nThe options that are available to you there are a lot of\nRadio shows out there that will either be very much focused on an annuity maybe you've heard of a radio show that focuses on safer money and the fact the matter is they might dedicating entire radio show to safer guaranteed money but they'll never mentioned the word annuities because they're scared to Brent\nYeah end or are you ever hear about is positive positive positive they don't also disclose the potential negatives and again we've set a lot and usa financial radio there are very few bad\nInvestment tools or investment products out there it's just either somebody shouldn't have it at all because it doesn't sit right into their portfolio or maybe they should have it but they don't have the right specific one or they simply aren't using it the right way that's the difference\nYou know later in the show we'll discuss why annuities have such a bad reputation but first Brent we want to look at\nThe different types of deferred annuities because I think that these are the most popular in terms of what is out there being recommended by financial professionals so let's look at the different types of deferred annuities\nAnd break them down and look at some of the pros and cons of first there are three broad types of deferred annuity is the first is the fixed annuity the next to this the indexed annuity and then there's the variable annuity let's first discuss the fixed annuity what is it and how does it\nWork I'm sure Michael with all these remember we talked earlier that their immediate annuities where you put money into a contract that insurance company they immediately start paying back a deferred annuity the whole point is to put money in and let it sit for a certain amount of time\nAnd then you can decide later whether you want to move those dollars into a different annuity somewhere else maybe you do on a turning income stream later it gives you a little bit more flexibility in terms of when you may or may not want to turn on income or take withdraws but\nThe first one you mentioned mark was just a traditional six deferred annuity and what that is as you put money into a contract or into a policy with an insurance company and they are going to declare some kind of an interest rate to you and when you go into it you know at that rate is in you know for how long it's going to be guaranteed\nCommonly it's guaranteed for one year at a time\nSo you put money on deposit you get X amount of interest for one year guaranteed at the end of that term\nInsurance company is going to tell you what your renewal rate is might be the same rate could be higher could be lower a lot of that's a function of what's going on in the interest rate environment with the insurance companies doing with those dollars and where they're investing on what kinda yield burning off of\nThe pool of other people's dollars that have been put into those inequities but you know for at least a year typically what you're going to get and then it just starts to renew one year at a time\nWhen you look at that renewal rate there is usually a floor a minimum rate of return a rate of interest that will be credited to your account and so some investors really appreciate that again we discussed earlier\nThat a lot of folks today are willing to give up some of that growth in order to have a little bit more safety and so the fixed annuity just a a real plain vanilla there's not too many frills to these contracts are pretty easy to understand the grand scheme of things\nWill declare that rate might be one year it might be three years it might be five years\nNow let's let's look at the indexed annuity let's talk about how it kind of has some similarities to the fixed annuity but let's talk about how it credits\nInterests for sure sure Mary ... to a couple of different things are kind of happening at once if you put dollars into an index annuity the lion's share of the money gets invested by the insurance company again pulled together was other policyholders just like yourself\nInto the very similar if not the exact same types of things that a fixed annuity investor would have their dollars but into when I say they I mean insurance company they're investing in government treasuries T. bills corporate bonds things that are\nRelatively conservative but trying to earn a decent rate of return for what they're going to give a portion of the field they get back to you as a policy holder\nThe lion's share of the dollar is actually go into that that provide certain guarantees that minimum guaranteed interest rate for that you talked about a moment ago\nBut they also take a small portion of the dollars and they actually go out and buy index options\nIf mayor without an index option is it basically gives them the right to buy into a stock market index say the U.S and the five hundred at a later date oftentimes when you're down the road\nAt some kind of declared price and the whole being that that the market is actually higher than what they have the ability to go purchase that option and then they get the pocket the spread of the different to the game and then the next option and they give you a portion that gain back into your account so\nYou're getting a little bit of gain because of the typical fix the new the investments that they make but you also getting potentially some game because of the indexes and what's happening in some of the stock market\nIt's important to understand though with with an index nudity that is not you purchasing the option to the insurance company that is doing that you've entered into a contract and they stipulate the terms and usually how it works\nIs your earnings or the credited interest into your account will be based off of usually let's just say one of the stock market indices so the popular one is the S. and P. five hundred\nAnd they might put a cap on what your upside potential could be so they'll say well you can enjoy the growth of the S. and P. five hundred but up to seven percent or up to four percent are up to eight percent or maybe they're going to say", "show_name": "America in the Morning with John Trout", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "13"}
