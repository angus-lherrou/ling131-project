it comes to discussing long term care and whether they handle the insurance peace or whether they have a partner or strategic relationship with somebody who focuses on this it is still an important part of the wealth management discussion now\nWhen we look at what exactly is long term care well\nLong term care as a range of services and supports that you may need to meet your personal care needs and I as as the term suggest it is generally\nOver the course of a longer term sort of something that is short term a few days you know there are certain insurance costs\nThat that you'll have that will cover that sort of thing but you know most long term care is not medical care it is assistance with the basic personal tasks\nEveryday life this is sometimes referred to in the insurance industry as activities of daily living or a deals now\nThe insurance industry has defined what these activities of daily living are in the medical industry is is kind of piggyback along with it and they defined it as you know the basics of of living are bathing so your ability to bathe yourself dressing your ability\nTo get dressed and function in in that way putting clothes on getting yourself ready to face the day the next thing is using the toilet what is your ability\nTo use the toilet do you need assistance in terms of that particular activity of daily living they also consider something called transferring which is really transferring from one spot to the next so from the bed to a chair or vice versa\nThe next thing is caring for incontinence and the the last real activity of daily living that they they evaluate is your ability to feed yourself so eating the other piece of this puzzle that will come in when it when looking at whether or not you'll need long term care in the services is your cognitive\nFunction argue with it mentally\nKnow a lot of your wives in the ladies that might be listening right now you you may immediately think well my husband's not going to satisfy that one and that may be true but I on behalf of guys at least you know if we can do most\nOf the ... or ... aside from that cognitive function part that I'm kind of joking about here but this is how they define long term care now\nThe idea here is well where are you going to receive the service if you if it's determine that you need help where is it that you'll receive these long term care services and now there's a number of different manners in which you can receive services the first is in your home and so you have\nSomebody come to your house and help you with those activities of

in and if you want to look at this if you want to actually start to address this in at least engage in the conversation that says hey I acknowledge this is a risk\nShould I look at this risk in in how should I address it the first step is taking advantage of a of a readiness check up a long term care readiness check up our philosophy our approach is to create that that emergency action plan in the

going to be the first step\nAs you look at addressing this risk is realizing the potential likelihood that exists and the potential costs\nThat are involved and let let's start with the cost and where you could receive care as you think about the everything that you should know when it comes to long term care in in addressing that risk\nAs I mentioned earlier the preference for most individuals in terms of where they receive cares in their home in fact the vast majority of all long term care services are in the individual is home fortunately that's the the desired spot I'm\nPut the pedal do the mental with us or NATO smart Saturday mornings at age right here on the voice of turtles to Ninety six point five in five eighty WC ages [noise]\nFinancial guidance and direction for those preparing for life after work this is the usa financial radio show\nOnce again Here's Mark Martin Smith\nWelcome back to the program\nBeen discussing long term care and evaluating this risk because the biggest threat to the long term success [noise]\nWell it's not exactly the most enjoyable conversation it is very important conversation to have and I want to start out now by looking at\nThe need for long term care arises [noise]\nThere are essentially for different ways that it can be paid for the very first one is looking at insurance is do you have any insurance that you put in place to help pay for some or all of the long term care needs so if that's not the case the next step is\nSelf funding with your own personal assets indoor getting assistance from family now that might be financial assistance from family and or that could also mean some degree of the care is provided by family now this is a very\nCommon occurrence oftentimes if if the insurance isn't in place the family will step in and at least initially they might help provide some of that assistance when it comes to the the physical care aspect of it now the last piece of the puzzle there in terms of how it could be paid for his Medicaid\nAnd we'll talk about that in a moment because a lot of people are\nHave a have a different understanding or the wrong understanding of when Medicaid might step in and what that situation looks like for them so at first of all talk real quickly about self funding with with your own assets so if you decide you're going to be self insure you're going to pay\nPay this ... this need or this cost for the long term care and eat out of your own pocket\nThere are some pros to the ... the biggest pro obviously is if if you decide on the front end that you're going to self insure and pay for it out of your own pocket if you don't end up having a need there is zero cost to you there is zero impact on your portfolio and you did not\nPay for insurance along the way so theoretically there's a when they're financially now the assets that you save\nBy not investing in insurance they're not paying for insurance you theoretically could turn around and invest\nAnd hopefully there would be some gain there on that pool of money and other downsides are obvious so when we're looking at a value waiting pros and cons of this the downsides are obvious\nAny long term care expenses are coming directly from distributions from your financial asset so not only are you staring at a potential hit to your portfolio you're also staring at\nA potential hit to your income stream as as a family unit so especially if you have a spouse or all of a sudden if if dollars have to be redirected towards your care their standard of living changes in a hurry now if you elect to go the self insurance route also\nAnd decide well I'm going to try to invest what I normally would have spent on insurance\nThere's obviously going to be some investment risks for that underlying portfolio in there's there are certainly going to be some difficulty in terms of managing the assets managing the payments and that's that's one of the I guess the big advantages to having insurance involved is that\nMany of the insurance programs out there will take a more active role in helping you to identify the care that you're going to need the care options that you have an ultimately setting up how it is that that care will be paid for\nSo let's transition assuming that you say you know something\nI Want to address this risk through insurance rather than through my own assets paying for for myself what are the options insurance wise so\nThere are essentially two different options you have from an insurance perspective the first is what's commonly known as traditional long term care insurance\nThis is very much akin to your homeowner's insurance your automobile insurance where you specified a specific risk in this case it's it's the need for a long term care you've identified what your coverage parameters might be so\nThat traditional long term care insurance policy might\nCover you for X amount of years up to X amount of dollars per month and there are certain stipulations that will be involved within that policy coverage but\nEssentially you are going to then make a monthly premium payment or an annual premium payment just like you would on the automobile or the homeowner's insurance now\nThe biggest upside for this is that you are now you transferred the the big risk as we talked about earlier that the threat of the the huge costs that eighty thousand dollars a year that Ninety thousand dollars a year of the nursing home you've transferred that risk\nOnto an insurance company the other potential advantage there is that there may be some degree of tax\nDeducted ability on those insurance premiums so again this is something that needs to be evaluated big picture with your financial professional with a tax adviser if you want to take that first step we're talking with you today and and encouraging you\nTo engage in a long term care readiness checkup and it's really starts with a conversation addressing and looking at the risk and looking at your personal situation you can take advantage of this by giving us a call at triple a triple eight Ninety five Seventy two\nTo eight eight eight eight eight eight nine five seven to or you can visit us on line at usa financial radio dot com simply punch in your ZIP Code get connected with your local usa financial radio advisor\nHit that button that says talk with an advisor and you can shoot them a note saying you know something I Want to have a conversation about long term care or maybe you want to have a conversation about something else within your your financial life\nReally to start that conversation is going to be important so as we look at the downside\nTo traditional long term care insurance these are the things these are the reasons that will commonly hear why people decide not to purchase long term care insurance and interestingly enough a lot of them are the same reasons why\nFinancial professionals decide not to even talk with you about it the first is\nIf you don't end up needing care and you go through life pass away without ever needing that long term care that those insurance premiums\nAnd the traditional insurance policy are gone you will you theoretically wasted those dollars if you want to look at it like that however it may be it gave you the confidence over the course of your retirement to no way I had you know I've I've got this this risk address so the\nThe if you don't use it you're going to lose that mindset is one reason the other thing is\nThe cost the annual cos it's maybe prohibitive maybe the cost is higher than you want\nAnd the other big piece of it and if you've talked with anybody recently who has purchase traditional long term care who has owned it for a number of years the biggest knock on traditional long term care today is that those premiums\nAre not locked in stone over the course of your life\nSo you might see big premium hikes so these spikes in your premium increases of twenty percent forty percent sixty percent one hundred percent we've seen this happen and you feel a little bit like you're stuck\nYou've been paying some premiums for these years\nA number that you felt was affordable and then all of a sudden they come and stick it to you and increase your premium costs at a time when frankly you're not in the spot to all of a sudden boost your income in any way shape or form so that's a big risk and now here's the thing\nA lot of financial professionals don't like that and so they say well I'm just not going to deal with it and what's what's really interesting and part of it if you get down to the root of what's causing this\nAs we've seen in the interest rate environment go down to next to nothing right now and as you look at how these insurance companies\nAre able to offer these policies if once you understand the economics of it you can kind of understand why there's a need for that premium increase when insurance company prices this out when the price of policy up they anticipate\nA certain percentage of people lap seeing their policy just stopping payment\nBut what they found is that that hasn't been happening nearly to the degree that they thought it would and so you couple that with a low interest rate environment so that\nThe investments that they're making with those premium dollars within their general fund are becoming more and more difficult to earn a higher respectable rate of return and so you've seen in turn these increases in fact", "show_name": "America in the Morning with John Trout", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "20"}
