{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "There are some other reasons why other professionals might not like annuities I mean we have issues or concerns from a liquidity perspective because you're not always going to have access to those\nThose dollars this exactly right and you know mark if your plan right hopefully you don't need to have twenty four seven access to those dollars when liquidity becomes a concern for an investor\nOr an advisor for that matter is when they have all their assets tied up and things that are liquid\nIf you use a variety of tools to use our tool box analogy in some of your tools provide you liquidity you don't need all your other tools to provide liquidity because if they do you're probably giving something up to have that liquidity just like with banks CDs that we're talking about earlier in today's show\nIf you commit to a longer term banks CD you typically get a better rate of return the interest rate on it because your money is not as liquid is often in return the bank will give you a higher rate so sometimes having money not be liquid can actually be a benefit to know that you you\nKnow the other thing too that goes hand in hand with that as some of these new products will carry a longer term and so when we say term maybe it let's just say ten years there's a ten year contract\nYou're entering into whereby if you wanted to pull all of your dollars out if you wanted to put a hundred thousand dollars in and the next day you wanted to get a hundred thousand dollars out they're going to be some surrender charges that would be incurred and so some advisors look at that and say oh we don't like that well as long as you understand the rules and the terms\nThat might not necessarily be the end of the world and specifically you know we're looking at a ten year product for example\nAs long as you understand and the plans for\nThe intended use of that product to be later down the road maybe that ten years down the road and it's part of the overall plan then it might make sense and you can overcome some of those concerns and some of those issues the big issue brand that we have is we look at some of the problems with the new diseases that\nSome financial professionals use them as the end all be all it's the Swiss army knife of products we can do everything under the sun if you invest everything you have with this one\nIs a couple of problems that first of all if you buy a Swiss army knife in real life in a lot of people have\nIf that's all you have access to you and you were dropped into the wilderness and it was the only tool given the we'd all take we'd be happy to have it in a pinch in a bind it's better than nothing but if we had the ability to go to the store and get the right stuff into our backpacks before we left on that trip\nWe would have gotten matches and we'd have gotten a saw we've gotten hatch it we'd have bought individual tools because they're better when they're by themselves and if you try to go out of it all into a little Swiss army knife so you know Swiss army knife approaches is done for a couple of reasons one it's kind of laziness sale\nBecause it's easier for the advisor just say hey take this thing it solves all these problems easier for me it's less paperwork it's simpler for you to understand and get it it might be easier on the surface doesn't mean it's better in fact in most instances it isn't better in in the financial world if you glob on too many features benefits riders to financial products\nThere's costs for those and sometimes the costs can get pretty steep\nWhen your glove and on all these extra bells and whistles to that particular investment\nIf you own in a new and you're thinking about in a newly we

sworn in as the new Supreme Court justice seems like a lot longer than that doesn't it here to talk about all of it is our White House correspondent Karen ...\nFirst of all let's go to President Trump talking about the hurricane 'cause it really was devastating he says he's going to go down to the hurricane zone where you see that\nProbably at some point or early next week of course the big concern Sherrie is when the president go and not impact any of the operations on the ground communications are still quite bad down there and they don't want to take away any time attention in a work power\nAway from the people that need help so the president says he wants to get a firsthand look though at the damage we expect that when he goes down who get a briefing from state and local officials\nAnd do some touring of neighborhoods that were particularly hard hit it'll look a lot like the events he's done in North and South Carolina after Hurricane Florence\nAnd Texas and Florida during last year as hurricane season\nOkay you an ambassador Nikki Haley saying that she's going to step down at the end of the year did we see that coming\nIt was a big surprise here in Washington especially here in the White House press this was something nobody was expecting and it was pretty amazing that they were able to keep this really a closely held\nThe president said he and Haley had been talking about this for some time and that the timing was right for her to say at the end of the year she was going to step down the big question of course now is what is she going to do next and she indicated this week that there is no set plan\nPresident said she could come back to the administration at any time she wants and have her pick of any job it certainly sounds like she's going to take a little bit time away and not ruled out jumping back into politics but she ... she made it very clear I'm prompted\nNobody asked her a question but she says she's not running against President Trump in twenty twenty she will be out on the campaign trail supporting his reelection\nOkay so talking about campaign rallies we saw a couple of more than we were going to see several more before the midterms these or something President Trump just thrives on he loves\nIt he loves getting out on the road the White House likes getting him out on the road in front of enthusiastic crowds he has for rallies this week and that's the case that's going to continue between now in the mid term elections\nI think he'll be on the road for five days notably these are all evening events seven o'clock eastern time he wants to try and get prime time coverage\nBut there's been some reporting this week that he's actually not getting that wall to wall cable television coverage like he used to\nHe said something really interesting this week Sherry in an interview with Fox News he said people are telling him at these rallies that they wish he were on the ballot they say I Wish I could vote for you again\nAnd I just don't know if I'm going to show up on election day now maybe this is just a stick he's using to try and get people out but it's certainly something that a incumbent White Houses presidents the parties are concerned about\nIn mid term election year how big a deal is Brett Kavanaugh these are at these rallies is his name come up he the president earlier this week with bringing him up a lot as a rallying cry for Republicans and was using it to a point out the politics of the Democrats you know saying that they handled the process badly\nAnd tried to bring down a good and qualified man\nHow much mileage the president can continue to get out of this because as you say a cabinet throwing in with only this week and it feels like it was a month ago at this point\nA smart Republican strategist also said this uh this week that it's a lot easier to rally\nYou're faithful rally you're based on anger when you don't get something so that's the Democrats you can't keep saying Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh because he's already on the Supreme Court okay finally Kanye West what what what was going on and this is one of the more bizarre events I've ever seen that the White House and the\nPeople here who've been here longer than I have many administrations will say they've never seen anything like this are we supposed to see the president and Kanye West together it wasn't on the official schedule but uh our colleague John Carlos asks\nThe president Thursday morning can we come in and seeing a little bit of your meeting and he said sure it brings a press and\nFor the oval office photo op and\nKanye West just went on a very long rambling speech profanity laced he was angry banging on the resolute historic desk at one point and the president for the most part just let them talk it was very rare to see the presidency the spotlight like that he let him talk\nI worry that good education and jobs and gang violence and guns and race relations\nI even his own mental health issues and at the end of it President Trump said that was pretty impressive and then he said to reporters what do you do after that that was a question a lot of us were asking yesterday and Jonathan girl got a hug from Kanye West at the end he said thanks for taking questions and tiny they'd come on in and just bear hug them\nCertainly done crossing a lot that was unique okay
