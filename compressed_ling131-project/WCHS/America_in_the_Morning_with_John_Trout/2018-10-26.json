time to write Mr Trump's wild ride published by all points books subtitled the thrills ... an occasional blackouts of an extraordinary presidency you lead off here with a prologue that is a very

sense lock her up really\nAbout Hillary Clinton but they have this sort of play act relationship is that all hostile\nWell Trump doesn't thanks so Trump supporters do lots of Republicans look askance
