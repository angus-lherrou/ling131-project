and just while we can expect this year with a medical officer from the Centers for Disease Control doctor leads the gross golf a lot of uh what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say oh we can never really predict for the coming season\nWhat it's going to be like how severe it is going to be right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states um flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October um but right now we just can't predict what the coming season it's going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it is going to be\nExactly and for those who say well uh I was vaccinated last year I was vaccinated in twenty Thirteen there is something they need to realize and that is that a flu viruses are very sneaky thing that keeps changing on his\nYeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change and flu viruses change constantly um and that's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season to the next the vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be\nThe thing that we're going to be seen most of in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year\nLet's look back to last year than the uh what kind of a season was that\nYeah so last season that she doesn't Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most severe seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand deaths um we had one hundred and eighty recorded so far pediatric that's from last season\nAnd one of the the things about it was that it was a season where um the activity was very sustained across the country for many weeks at a time and really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one um\nAll of that said we can't really draw any\nConclusions or make any predictions about what we're going to see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant about flu and that is that the older and the younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely to develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have debts and\nThose are the very youngest in the very oldest um those under five years of age particularly in his under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nI'm old I said we we also know that there are individuals outside of that age group for example those with some chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill\nAnd even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who could have you know if you take any individual\nWhat individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm even previously healthy people young adults can get severely ill children who have no prior medical problems can get
