so that's why a lot of people will then look at annuities as an option to look at an annuity as an option for safety but you have to understand\nYou know maybe you're going to obtain a little bit more growth from a particular type of annuity but there is that trade off you are giving something up and more often than not when you do that you're going to give up some of that full liquidity if you go the annuity\nDirection yeah so obviously an annuity doesn't have near the liquidity that say a checking account or a savings account does but it has the same kind of safety in many ways that those accounts do so its share safety\nBut it's looking at a different direction and the triangle either towards growth or towards liquidity and the real challenge now mark is\nThat with interest rates having been so low for so long many people feel that the obvious direction that interest rates are going to be taking for a\nPeriod of time into the future is more of an upward inclined rather than a downward\nDecline and so by having interest rates are rising interest rate environment now it makes that even more difficult to tie up money seeing a bond or a bank CD because a rising interest rates

week's top stories and the story you may have missed I'm Sherry Preston [noise]\nComing up how to make an impact while delivering a profit but first it's not only that\nFacebook has only been around for a little over ten years Twitter was only in debt in two thousand six and it was twenty ten before anyone it even heard of Instagram\nThe social media platforms are second home to many of us now but unfortunately social media has also become a powerful weapon cw singer and Emerson working have written a new book called like war the weaponization of social media and Peter Singer an expert in innovation defense\nAnd technology joins us now this book is is really filled\nWith so many examples of how social media has been used and manipulated by nefarious characters everything from ISIS to China to those who invented\nClick bait artificial intelligence\nI'm a social media has changed politics and the news it's changed our world are any one of these things any more troubling than the others do you think\nI think the challenge of this is that it's a network\nThat links us all and I'm probably the biggest problem that the one danger that cuts across all these issues whether you're looking a extremism click bait terrorism\nIs is when things go bad it's a combination of arrogance and ignorance arrogance of this sanction that things can't go beyond that oh I'm you know if you remember the Facebook ad the more we connect the better it gets well now we know that that's what\nThe more we connected gets better and some parts of it get worse but also ignorance we are all now on line we depend on the space for everything from our social lives are dating lives business\nNews and now war and yet we don't understand the very basic rules of the gang and when I say we I mean everything from or you could see this and the senators hearings with soccer bird\nTo ah over sixty percent of Americans don't understand how social media companies even make money so they don't understand how they're being targeted by this base so the books trying to do is basically give people the tools ah to better navigate this world of likes and why is\nOne of the things that they don't understand because it is so difficult to understand is the dissemination of fake news it really was fake when it was disseminated but now the phrase fake news has been hijacked as well so how are people supposed to know what they believe on line\nOne of the challenges is um even the term had become contested\nOr even the very nature of a truth itself if you remember the phrase you know you know alternative facts well that's not how that works um and this is where you see a layering\nBetween certain things that have played out in politics but also a Russian disinformation tactics that literally go back to the Nineteen twenties so you know there's a reason why the Russians are kicking are but in the space because they'd been added for so much longer\nAnd it's again it's part of that notion of catching up but for you and I I'm One of the most simple things to do is basically to diversify your news sources uh it goes back to\nIdea of um the ten blind men or an elephant\nYou know each one touching that elephant only gets part of the story I mean getting part of the story they come away with something that's false this is a law that says a snake as opposed to getting on multiple angles multiple perspectives and which came out this is not just us but it's also for example a teaching our kids\nHow to be better digital citizens because they're equally being targeted in space\nAnd that's one of the things that social media did it really drew like minded people together into into groups and people have talks a lot of tribalism that's going on in politics today\nBut really it was happening on line long before the contentiousness that we've seen in Washington I mean people will read what they want to read online and even though they were told not to and that they should read other sources it doesn't seem to be getting through to anybody\nAnd this is the good in the bad side of this and that you know one of the fund stories in the book because of the very first social network all the way back when the Internet was a originally created by the military to link scientist together and they're supposed to be doing scientific research\nThe very first social use of bringing like minded people together as they started talking to each other not just about science but science fiction and you know that's the great thing of social media moving forward as we can find other like minded people we can find people who share our interests we can exchange information with them but the danger of that\nIs that you know first it can create these little closed off community sometimes\nAnd second that can be exploited and that same thing has been used in everything from terrorism extremism too I'm kind of the poisonous aspects that if I played out in our own politics today a different way to think about this is a parallel I'm to the game of poker\nOr if you sit down at a poker table this isn't you know from the movie around her ... and you don't know who the market as\nYour the mark and that's what it is for many of us in social media we don't understand that where the mark when it comes to everything from marketing campaigns\nBut also political campaigns and we need to catch up our understanding catch up our knowledge of the rules of the game so there were no longer being taken advantage of\nWe have a thing in the in the newsroom is that time already has their their ... and when they see that the president of the United states has treated for the first time in the morning they'll say he's on Twitter and then that person has to stand up and and read the tweet\nIs just just President Trump understand is really really well or is he just doing it and is he making it the divisions even wider\nOpening of the book is Trump's very first tweet and she joined social media back in two thousand and nine and when not with politics in mind his funded to go back in time\nHe actually joins as a way to market an upcoming TV appearance that he's going to read the top ten list on the Letterman show and the purpose of going on the Letterman show is to try and plug\nThe declining ratings of uh The Apprentice princes has going down and ratings and they're trying to figure out anything and everything to save the ratings\nAnd they turned to Twitter [laughter] and um and this actually like back to your prior question what happens is that slowly but surely\nHe like the rest of us becomes addicted which is another reason why you can't say you know maybe it would just shouldn't use the space will\nPeople become addicted to it it's it's designed to be addicted\nAnd um he develops um a a talent for it uh and basically hits on certain tactics that now lots of people use but at the time or they're kind of game changing one for example is he gets into arguments with people on line if you go back in time\nThis was something new you know a celebrity a businessmen getting an arguments like a shouting teenager and yet it drew what he wanted which was attention\nAnd then the new rule the game is attention is power and important again going back to this notion even if we do like\nYour story illustrates another key fact here Ninety six percent of journalists are on Twitter so even if you're not on it\nThe journalistic you listen to on the radio or you read in the newspaper walks on the TV news\nThey're getting their ideas of what to cover based off of not just what they see online but by what is trending on line and one of the things again the Trump understood back then and carry forward through the election and even today\nIs that he can use that attention that power\nTo change the news cycle so whenever there is a scandal that's going badly for him and and one space he'll create a different kind of scandal a different kind of argument another and then the press\nAll fall and you know frankly that's continued all the way to what's playing out right now\nOkay well pi Wu singer up Peter Singer and you wrote the book like war
