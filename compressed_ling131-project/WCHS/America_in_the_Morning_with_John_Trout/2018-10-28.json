like it's affected every other aspect of our lives and the big message of the book Sherry's that\nAs we move into a well with these extraordinary systems those who control the most powerful systems ... government will increasingly control the rest of us and that's a political problem a generation will have to deal with\nAnd one of the things the book first of all is called future politics and it's funny because we are in such a political time right now but I really like the way that you\nTalk about politics itself and it's not not Democrat or Republican but this line politics refers to the

communicate how we get along how we live together and we're all being um you know we're using technology and such different ways now than that we don't even know where we're going now I think that's what's kind of the themes is that we're all sort of\nCaught up in this digital revolution and and and we don't know what it is or where we'll go\nYou've hit the nail on the ... I mean often when I say I've written a book about the future politics people think I'm writing about the mid times over the next presidential election and there's a little bit of stuff and that but we ... minds where we can find politics to the next election cycle that life cycle\nOr the next presidential cycle I'm looking at the life cycle of human beings and how that's going to be changed by technology\nAnd what kind of role does morality play in all of this because um another thing you mentioned that that is fascinating is a virtual reality and you know you you can look at a you know a a so this air and getting in Africa or you can you can look at Niagara Falls you could go there in person\nBut as you point out you could also be in virtual reality\nA Nazi ouch with you could be someone who kills puppies who determines what morality is when it comes to technology what hurts people and what doesn't who rely we're relying on for that\nIs such an interesting question I mean just last month an off color came out with say the system to promise\nYou know style experiences and I and you can definitely see how someone might use that for instance to imagine near the de de landings participating in them storming the beaches but what if he wants to be on the other side defending the beaches and as you say what if you wanted to experience being a nine eleven terrorists the truth is that\nAll of us ... but the basis of the criminal law here and in the case for hundreds of years has been if something doesn't actually harm someone else than it should be permissible to do it\nAnd so you know advocates for freedom will say that actually you should be able to do whatever you ... the system in the comfort of your living room because to do so it doesn't actually harm anyone else it was a very interesting moral question and your views on it might disagree with\nMy views but as you say the question is who's going to take this decision isn't going to be a market for the corporate policy of Facebook or whoever it is manufacturing technology or do we think this is a broader social issue\nWill be determined by reference to principles that we all know another stab\nBats and parliaments ... legislatures where the ... will publicly ocean you as an individual use or take it up on your conscience to decide whether you should ... systems such practices the big political questions and we don't we ... we started asking the lesson our dogs during them\nDo you do you ever get the feeling that that all of this is sounding the alarm is is sort of like what happened with climate change and global warming that uh you know it's it's happening it's happening where in the middle of it\nAnd suddenly it's here and whether or not people are listening is the question and how do you take that and go okay we need more policing well who's the person that says what the policing should be these are all such big questions to be asked\nUm the answers have to come I think what you're saying in the book sort of um collectively because we are all still living together it has to be a collective answer\nAbsolutely I think the analogy of climate change is a very very good what\nClimate change with a global problem like issue technology it's also a longtime problem in the sense that it creeps up on you and it's no wait and immediately opiates that it's a giant so it doesn't fit into a two year reelection psycho every election cycle which makes an unattractive aspect of policy to talk about so I tried to do in the book\nIs states people you know one of the basic jokes of being a citizen in the future is to understand the technology increasing began in our lives sat me think of one of the jobs\nOf being a legislature in the future to understand technology I think one of the jobs of being a technologist is to understand the politics and the moral implications\nBut the basic point you make is right this is a problem that has broad and wide as the generation that we live in and it can't just be a maximum of special interest groups on edge on the sidelines who are interested in it\nSo I ... I spend my days trying to achieve a critical mass of people out there who understand and care about this stuff on a willing to take steps to try and change things I don't mean to negative because a lot of the book is also about the one of the technology and the ... stock that it brings us\nOkay well the book is called future politics I'm living together in a world transformed by tech it's by Jamie ... and it's a big book but it's an important book thank you so much thank you Sherry coming\nUp retiring overseas [noise]\nPlaces to get the most bang for your buck perspective after this\nFive eighty WC Adrian storage every weekday morning news next to daily Jones never getting local issues and state politics on five eighty live after that the dean of West Virginia broadcasters ... addresses is using the mouse and said have you on TALK why\nRush Limbaugh anchors the afternoon then cap your day with the wind up sports and entertainment hotline would they weekly followed by the state wide forge lined with Tony nineties wanting to have a voice of Charleston is five eighty W ...\nDecision twenty Eighteen five eighty WC H A metro news ABC will be dialed the beginning it's seven o'clock on Tuesday evening November ... will be live on location downtown Charleston\nHeadquarters were Charleston city mayor just last week for the west Virginia Supreme Court and important voices from around the country on usually more willing to Charles ...
