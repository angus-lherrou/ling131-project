in with the national outlook\nFall is a time when we can see either extreme summer or winter especially when the pattern is as busy as his right now much of the east or feel closer to summer conditions today as warm and humid Gulf Arab list into the region\nTemperatures will be most extreme however in the southern Great Lakes and the northeast high temperatures will be in the upper seventies and lower eighties for a good portion of that region despite normal high in the sixties and means twenty degrees above normal in some areas\nBecause of the humidity as well as going to feel a lot warmer than the thermometer would suggest and again that humidity level especially be high across the east coast from the southeastern coast all the way up through into New England\nAs far as winter conditions go look who wants to find those temperatures in the Rockies and the northern plains will be rather chilly today the biggest departures from normal should be an eastern Colorado western Kansas eastern Wyoming in western Nebraska and the western Dakota's\nFor example we can use Denver and they'll struggled to reach forty degrees for a high today despite a normal high of sixty

Monday morning quarterbacking of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process correspondent Linda Kenyan has the story\nSenator Mitch McConnell says sure it was an ugly process\nWhere we're literally under a salt these demonstrators us hush sure some of them were women and citizens many of them were obviously trying to get in our faces to go to our homes up there to basically almost tacos and the halls of the capital\nSpeaking to an audience in his home state of Kentucky McConnell said his caucus was undeterred\nA zero tolerance for the ... that just as a governor was accused of but I think it's important to remind everybody that there was no corroborating evidence\nJudge Kavanaugh who is now officially justice Kavanaugh was accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct all of the allegations stemmed from when Kavanaugh was in high school and college Kavanaugh denied each and every allegation McConnell says he couldn't be prouder of his caucus for sticking by the nominee\nWe were standing up for the presumption of innocence in this country\nThose comments came two days after Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed in the U.S Senate by a vote of fifty to forty eight only one Republican Lisa Murkowski voted against confirmation only one Democrat Joe Manchin voted for Democrats objected to the confirmation process from the very beginning\nAnd reminded the majority leader that he blocked President Obama Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland from even getting a hearing\nAnd then he left a seat on the Supreme Court open for almost a year then he rushed to the confirmation process for Kavanaugh would undo haste Democrats say it was those actions that poisoned the entire process that McConnell defenses actions\nWhat I did was entirely consistent with American history going back to the Eighteen hundreds of what happens when a vacancy occurs in the middle of a presidential election year then you have one party\nThe White House and another party in control was when he do it again it's practical uh think about it there's no chance that an opposition party is going to be in control of the Senate is going to fill a Supreme Court vacancy incurring in the middle of a presidential election here\nIn the meantime he says despite the outrage the demonstrations the anger a heightened partisanship Parma poisonous atmosphere on Capitol Hill he believes

unwelcome guests to discuss potential issues one topic in particular headed to the high court\nSupreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh shows up for work this morning day one of the new job and the sooner or later although I don't think the docket this term includes any but sooner or later the Supreme Court will again have to tackle thorny issues surrounding the second amendment\nWe thought we'd take a look at the director the which that might go with Dave workman senior editor at the gun magazine dot com and that liberty park press he's also communications director for the citizens committee for the right to keep and bear arms are there any particular\nA Second Amendment issues that you could expect to see it coming up before the Supreme Court in the not too distant future\nWell there are a couple of cases down in California that I think are trying to wind their way up through the courts as we know the the the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in San Francisco the most liberal court in the United states\nAnd it's also that will show return a and I think there is there a couple of gun case down there are I Believe there's also going to be a new challenge to the Jersey a concealed carry a scheme that they have going back there\nUh and maybe Maryland will come up to a there are several states with very restrictive concealed carry statutes\nAnd with a a more conservative more are constitutionally oriented Supreme Court I think some of those laws are going to come under what we call strict scrutiny and we'll see how woolly fair\nOne of the more important gun control issues that come up before the courts in recent years is a D.C versus Heller that is to say look at the district of Columbia's gun control law I Want to quote what a appellate court judge Kavanaugh had to say seven years ago a quote\nIn disapproving D.C.'s ban on handguns in approving a ban on machine guns and in approving longstanding regulations such as concealed carry and felon in possession laws\nHeller established at the scope of the second Amendment rights and plus the constitutionality of gun bans and regulations is determined by reference to text history and tradition unquote than judge Brett Kavanaugh your thoughts on how this will carry forward into of cases before the Supreme Court\nWell I think that gives us a hint of where a justice Kavanaugh is going to come down on Second Amendment issues he understands that are all rights can be regulated to some degree but\nThey're not government regulated privileges and certainly the second amendment is not a government regulated privilege it is a\nFundamental constitutionally protected right and I think from from reading what he said in that historic descent I thought it was ... you get the impression that he is going to come down\nOn the side of the individual right to bear arms even outside the home or with a permit they they they were really forced by the courts to create a concealed carry system in the district of Columbia District but\nUh again it's not above being challenged again in the courts and that may be a case that comes before the high court to eventually", "show_name": "America in the
