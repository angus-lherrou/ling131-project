discussing the three corners of the investment triangle those three corners or growth\nSafety and liquidity and you might think that liquidity is always a good thing in for the most part there's a lot of benefits\nTo having liquidity inside of an investment portfolio or complete liquidity inside of investment portfolio there are probably not to better example than the ones that will share with you here now loop pi if you don't know that name he was a\nFormer Enron executive and shortly before\nCompany collapsed he liquidated somewhere in the neighborhood it's been reported of about two hundred and Seventy million dollars\nIn Enron stock now at the time part of it was to settle some financial affairs at least this is the reports of a a divorce who's going through with his wife had married an exotic dancer\nButton enormous piece of property in Colorado so that and who knows where the heck he's at now but the timing Mike of him being able to liquidate that investment was pretty fortunate the second example was that of\nApple CEO I you know the name Gil Emilio years ago apple was struggling and their stock at slumped and hit a twelve year low in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's been suggested that that slump in that stock busting down to that twelve year low was at least partially caused by\nA single sale of one and a half million shares of Apple's stock buying anonymous party\nIt was later confirmed that that sale was Steve Jobs if you know that name one of the founders of apple\nAnd shortly after that job to convince the directors to oust Emilio in a boardroom coup and he became CEO again so he was pretty fortunate timing lies to get out when he did and so it's interesting Mike though when we look at liquidity\nBecause we talk about this in in our world all the time the importance of having liquidity the importance of having access to your money\nThis can also work against you yeah in that environment\nObviously the stock in such a large chunks in those two examples\nWas liquid for those individuals it actually ends of driving the value down for everyone else's the flood the market with those shares of stock and also one could argue that depending upon what your role is maybe you shouldn't necessarily have entirely free liquidity when it comes to\nShares of stock or that you are a key key role player within those companies so that that's a whole nother discussion that's well beyond the typical boundaries of\nFinancial in retirement planning for most Americans\nBut it is important to realize that that liquidity\nCan come in very different structures so liquidity can come in the form of a individual stock as you were just suggesting there mark but liquidity can equally come in the form of a money market or a checking account and yet\nIn terms of what they represent throughout the remainder of the triangle the investment triangle that is they're very dramatically different investment vehicles one is geared towards growth that of the individual stock and one is geared\nTowards safety the checking account or the money market account and yet both of them kind of our ... together through the commonality of being highly liquid inefficient access to your mind you\nTalk to your veterinarian and visit ban failed foundation dot org slash disaster\nSay that for a rainy day\nIt's full service financial planning in one place this is the usa financial radio show [noise]\nOnce again with Mike Walters Here's Mark MERS [noise]\nWelcome back to the program if you invest in the stock market [noise] if you invest in ... if you invest\nPeriod [noise] my hunch I'm going to make a very bold said [noise]\nI Will make a statement that the majority of you that invest [noise] probably [noise] invested in a way that is not can grew in with how you feel about risk and the reason why I say that\nIs it's not your fault that our financial it's the financial industries fault and Mike when we talk with clients about this and then we share with them how we\nApproach their own risk awareness let's talk a little bit about the difference that we take versus what the industry has always taken\nAnd I want to first started out by talking about the fault that is risk tolerance questionnaires because everybody's been through it\nIf you invest in a four O. one K. if you work with a financial advisor I guess it doesn't really matter you've probably gone through this process of a risk tolerance questionnaire and you've answered a handful of questions let's talk about the problem with this because this is really important as it relates to\nThe investment triangle corner that is the growth\nCorner remark to a certain degree you've you've already kind of uncovered the big looming issue kind of the elephant in the room that no one ever wants to talk about if you will\nAnd that is the idea of risk tolerance the idea of risk tolerance the way the financial industry has approached it from our opinion it is a flawed approach the concept of risk tolerance\nTakes basic information and then shoe horns someone into a slot on a sheet of paper and a computer program to identify what level of risk\nThey should be able to tolerate but the premise at its core we believe has many flaws for example if\nIf you had to individuals that both went to work in the same company let's say Thirty years ago and at the age of twenty five\nThey entered into the four o one K plan and now Thirty years later at the age of fifty five they're rolling over an IRA opening up a new investment whatever the case might be\nOver those Thirty years those two individuals have both been in that four one K. plant at their company for the exact same amount of time it just so happens that one of the individuals is the CFO of the company who's very\nNumerically oriented and the other individual was a a a manager let's say in the age our department\nThe manager and the HR department maybe once every year or two would take a look at where they were investing money in their four one K. and just make sure that we're putting in the amount of money they hoped and they just kind of hung on and hope things went the way they\nThey wanted them to go inside of that four one K. on the other hand the CFO had a much more active involvement with choosing where they wanted to be invested which funds they wanted to use in the four one K. over those years and so on and now here they are at the age of fifty five and they're opening up a new investment account and they have a risk tolerance questionnaire\nFlopped in front of them and asked them how many years of investment experience do you have at this stage of the game they're both now answering Thirty years but do they have the same Thirty years\nOf investment experiences the real issue and so there is a distinct difference between risk tolerance approaches which are very cold and systematic for lack of a better way of explaining it\nVersus what I Will call risk awareness and risk awareness gets more into your psyche and your character about how you feel and how you are motivated about money what kind of fears you have about loss\nHow you approach\nMoney and all that gets wrapped around money in terms of the potentials for gains and losses and how you can stomach battered you can't stomach\nAnd really it comes down to these risk tolerance questionnaires are are stacked against you I mean the truth of the matter is is like you pointed out with that example in that particular question\nIt's going to score those two individuals exactly the same way it's going to assign you know a certain waiting to that the answer to that question even though they're going to give theoretically the same answer we know that that question is a is a bunch of garbage and it doesn't really factory in to how much\nRisk can they truly stomach what is their real understanding and tolerance for risk and so let's talk a little bit about the approach that we use here at usa financial and all of the usa financial radio advisors use when they're working with\nClients to identify what is the right amount of risk because let's face it when when we're looking at the corner of the investment triangle that his growth\nYou have to recognize that growth and risk\nAre going to be tied together now there might be some ways to reduce some of the risk while still enjoying that growth but at the same time you have to understand that those two pieces of the puzzle are going to walk\nHand in hand together so when we look at risk when we look at identifying what is the right amount of risk\nFor our clients here at usa financial we use this this notion of risk awareness but specifically we identify your personal risk number now for a moment I'm going to I'm going to step out of the world of investments to sharing example because I think this is going to help you understand\nWhen I got married to my wife\nIt was time for us to purchase a new mattress and we went to the mattress store and if you've ever gone through this exercise it's almost comical to go through where\nThere's all these mattresses laid out on the on the showroom floor and you started hopping on them and whether or not you can really identify what's the right field for you but it became very apparent that I like more of a from Matt\nAnd my wife was more interested in a squishy mattresses what I Will say right I Believe the term is saw as unless you're being derogatory ... so we go through this exercise in and after we done that\nThe salesman says well you know there is an option that you could consider and there's this other manufacturer and they have come up with something known as a sweet number bed\nAnd the concept is that we each have our number of firmness that that mattress will have in the sleep number bed fortunately\nCan allow one side debt to have one level a firmness and the other to not have that level of firmness now\nWe didn't end up purchasing that because I ended up convincing my wife that a firmer mattress was better for her and so we I Want out but in the end the concept of the sleep number is very akin to our concept of\nThe risk number let's let's talk about our personal risk number and how we go about determining what that is Well Mark why I really\nLiked the example you just went through although I think you took full advantage of your way way shape or form it sounds like but I'm gonna I'm gonna let that pass for now the reason I really like the example you just gave is because a fifty year old might have the same sleep number as a twenty five year old\nBut then might have an entirely different sleep number from another fifty year old\nAnd that's why it's so important because when you're looking at risk awareness interests number of the same thing happens I'm fifty today but I have\nA risk number that is very similar to individuals who I Know that are Thirty years old\nAnd these thirty year olds are shared interests number with a fifty year old but then other thirty year olds are sharing interests number that's\nMore likely to be with someone who is maybe a little younger that has a little more of an appetite for risk the reality is some people have an appetite for risk regardless of their age\nOther people have no appetite for risk regardless of their age and then there's this huge spectrum in between and everybody falls somewhere\nOn this dynamic and that's how we come up with the risks number is by going through and approach to figure out where do you actually fall on the spectrum so that's the only one half of the puzzle here though Mike when you think about once you've identified your personal risk number we now have to take that one step further\nAnd we have to look at your portfolio and identify what is your portfolios risk number is it in sync with the ... are they in sync is their balance between the two because if they aren't what ultimately going to happen at some point in the future whether it's going to be tomorrow or five years from now\nThat portfolio is going to react in a way that you will not be comfortable with according to your wrist number in the portfolios risk number and as a result you will react in a manner that might be unfavorable to the long term\nSuccess in the long term result that you want to have with your portfolio so what we are offering to you today and what we do for our clients as we identify for them\nTheir personal risk number we walk them through this really deep detailed analysis to arrive at that risk number and then from there", "show_name": "America
