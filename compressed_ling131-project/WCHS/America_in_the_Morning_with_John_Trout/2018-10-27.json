[noise]\nLooking back to the program I have to share an interesting story that took place last summer and for those of you that don't know I enjoy the outdoors and I enjoy camping and hiking and all that good stuff [noise] and I uh was out\nHiking and came back a couple of days later and I had a little rash and I was convinced\nThat it was poison ivy and so a long story short I started doing a little bit more homework on it and\nThe Google of course is I like to refer to it like your friend yes a right because if there's anything I don't know the answer to the Google has the answer obviously and so I started searching for and I put in my symptoms and the truth of the matter is is that\nI had a belief that\nI had poison ivy and so all I was doing as I was doing my homework was I was looking\nTo just confirmed my diagnosis and as it turns out it was something different and fortunately my wife has a lot smarter than me and I didn't just go the normal route in terms of what you would do for poison ivy but I was convinced that it was poison ivy and as I was doing my homework that's what I was seeking\nThe answer too but what this illustrates is we all have what's known as a confirmation bias and the ... the matter is is that people tend to search for information\nThat confirms their view of the world of the stock market of something medical and my wife's in in medicine and one of the things that she picks on me about his I always turn to the Google for all of my medical answers\nAnd I'm I'm sure that doctors can relate to this\nUh they probably see patients coming in each and every day that they've already gotten their diagnosis from the Google the truth is Brett this proves a couple of things it proves number one that\nWe do have this confirmation bias and I want to talk about that also proves the importance of actually working with somebody who knows what the heck they're talking about and not necessarily believing yourself indoor believing in answer you get on the Internet marketing\nAnd one of the reasons this happens and and by the way studies have shown this is a oftentimes a subconscious issue that people don't even realize they're actually even doing it and along the shorter than what happens to people is most of them don't like to be wrong\nWhether it's a hit to the ego or just creates more uncertainty or more stress or whatnot\nPeople have a tendency when they think they've chosen wisely or made a decision\nThey would like to think it was the right one and therefore they have this subconscious oftentimes driver that then tries to provide data or information to support that decision because again they don't want to take a hit to the ego or they don't want more uncertainty in their life if they can simply just confirm this decision they've already made it makes them feel better\nOne good example for many people not only in their investments is simple a simple thing like buying a home\nPeople like to think that their home values are going to go up and what they don't want to admit is that the neighborhood or the suburb or whatever they're living in might not be going up as quickly as they want and that's a difficult thing to swallow not only because you feel like maybe I didn't choose the right location for the home\nBut if you're trying to use it as an investment which some people kind of get blurry as to whether their homes for a place to live in a roof over their head or whether it's an investment it's even harder to acknowledge that and then you try to\nFind support him data in the area whether it's information about school districts or retail development in the area you keep telling yourself all the property values have got to go up here that I just know I made the right choice eventually they're going to go up\nDog in this World Series on Charles VSBN one of six point summoned for the mining and points to Charles and farm\nMoney and investing meets clarity in confidence misses the usa financial radio show\nOnce again with Bernie Sanders here's Marc Mauer is going\nWelcome back to the program if you can think\nBack to the fall of two thousand and eight you'll likely remember some of the pandemonium of the financial crisis and you no doubt remember some of the media headlines it didn't matter it didn't matter\nWhere you turned you saw Bear Stearns struggle and what's interesting is obviously going out of business\nAnd then you saw what happened to Fannie and Freddie and you know you look at some of these things that transpired and especially these big entities and you say well there's no way they could feel there's no way\nAnd one of the keys to surviving\nMarket volatility and by no means or we suggesting that what's going on right now is going to be a repeat of what took place in a waiter or nine\nBut you have to suspend some of the disbelief some of the things that could happen and and you have to go into it from a mindset perspective with a neutral ground and understand that things can certainly happen and\nA lot of folks when you see times get tough like this\nThey might make snap judgments thinking they can now slide in and buy certain stocks on the cheap as their sliding down and this is the whole concept of you can't catch a falling knife and\nWhen we experience this market volatility it's not a time to overreact it's not a time to panic and one of the things that we suggest\nYou do in this might be very silly but do write yourself a little known right yourself short story about the last time that the stock market did this\nIn what happened what was you know share the ending with yourself because maybe you need to remind yourself in your own writing that this is going to happen we're going to see some of these market corrections if you will some market volatility these are things we should expect to experience Brent as we talked about\nYour a mark in what happens to people as if they sometimes don't write a story as you point out or put up their own personal guard rails maybe we should call them as to hey if the market stays between here and here\nHere's what I'm going to do but if it goes outside the guard rails maybe that's when it's time for me to consider making a change but most people don't have any truly defined\nMeasuring sticks or guard rails to know do I just ignore all this noise and in any market turmoil volatility or do I really need to\nSit down and rethink what I'm doing if they would simply even just do that establish some ways to kind of measure their risk tolerance isn't measure the volatility and no okay now I'm fine I'm Still more than the guard rails and if they go to a certain spot to say okay maybe an hour and you do something different if they would even just do that\nIt would help correct a lot of the bad behavior in some of the things we talked earlier about the typical investor behavior and why the average investor dramatically under performs the markets because they don't have\nCertain policies and rules for themselves put in place to help manage that and when the markets volatile and people get scared if they don't have guard rails it tends to do when they make their worst decision\nHere's the real truth of it if if you have experienced anxiety as a result of some of the things that have been going on recently in the stock market my contention is that you may be invested incorrectly and I'm going to share a dirty little secret with you about the financial industry\nThe financial industry has historically had these risk tolerance tests and basically what they do the entire intent of them was to determine your asset allocation and they will say well you should have sixty percent and stocks you should have forty percent and bond\nThere are different rules of thumb that may suggest that but the truth of the matter is\nSome of the manner in which they landed on how you should allocate was completely incorrect and the truth of the matter is is we have to actually establish\nAn officer index that I'll call it if you will you have to establish a risk score for yourself and we work with and all of the usa financial radio advisors work with\nSome analysis software here Brent that basically identifies a risk score and essentially what to your point it identifies these guard rails that says you know something I can tolerate this kind of risk and I'm willing to enjoy\nThis upside return and I understand kind of the downside risk\nAnd it's not just percentages Brent ... we have to put this in real dollars\nSomething always gets lost when people look at things typically in percentages only\nIt sometimes doesn't really hit home until you take the percentages and calculate them into real dollars and then if you apply that to an individual holding a particular investment or an individual overall portfolio\nAnd you ask them have stairs in Ninety five percent probability and the next six months\nThat you had the ability to burn X amount of dollars in your portfolio versus suffer X amount of dollars of loss\nAre you comfortable with that or not versus you know hey you consider yourself to be a moderate investor and aggressive investor and oh by the way what age are you and then we try to figure out what you should be invested in that is very generic it doesn't go deep enough but even going just to percentage gains and losses isn't enough for most people you have to help them\nCalculate it terms of dollars and all of a sudden it hits home and it really means something and that's when most people can typically start saying yes I like that or no I don't and then you go to the next question okay if you gain this many dollars in lost this many dollars\nHow do you feel about that and is this yes no feeling out process to help somebody really figure out what is really\nTheir risk tolerance and everybody should know hopefully all listeners do there is a direct correlation between the risk and the return and wants portfolio and there'll always be so it's just measuring the connection between the two of them and finding your comfortable spot and your sweet spot\nAnd that's probably one of the most important things that we do here at usa financial is to identify you have to work with your portfolio number in understand your portfolio and so if you have a portfolio let's just say throwing out numbers of five hundred thousand dollars\nAnd we're talking about uh ten percent lost to you\nThat's that represents fifty thousand dollars so that's the number fifty thousand has to be the number in your head that as you're evaluating certain risk\nAnd evaluating how you should be allocated you have to identify fifty thousand a number that is going to make me uncomfortable is if I reached that number or be if I go beyond that number in terms of the lost perspective you have to identify that because\nIf you have a portfolio of a hundred thousand obviously ten percent of that ten thousand so those numbers are a little bit different\nTen percent is different for everybody and unfortunately our industry does things\nCompletely backwards in terms of how\nIt identifies asset allocation how you should be allocated and Brent this is really the value of having\nA good cabinet advisor who understands us and we'll work with you as an individual level again before you do this before you go out on your own or if you want to evaluate the opportunity of working with the new advisor or if you just want to put your current advisor to the test\nYou need to know the questions to ask and that's what we cover in the audio book that were making available today this audio book it normally sells for on Amazon for thirty dollars but today it's a gift from the show simply call triple a triple eight Ninety five Seventy two\nThe name of this audio book has been Nineteen questions to ask a financial advisor it's really a guide\nFor making sure you have the right advisor for you give us a call triple a triple eight Ninety five Seventy two that's eight eight eight eight eight\nNine five seven to ... once once you've now identified and you understand what your risk score is because folks if you don't have your risk or if you don't know what that is and if you're advisor hasn't walked through that\nSit down with your local usa financial radio advisor it's extremely important that you understand that part of it and go through that analysis will walk you through that analysis but once that's done Brent what do we do what's the next step in terms of surviving a little bit of market volatility\nAnd I've got a question mark before I touching that I Want to quickly back up on something you just said and that is you know once you establish your own personal risk or what you need to you then need to have an analysis done of your existing investments and portfolio to see if they match and sadly more often than not they don't there's typically a big discrepancy\nMost people on the surface think that a little bit more aggressive than they probably are and if they went to the right series of questions they'd probably find that out\nAnd then most also find that there's more risk in their portfolio than they really rely so it's kind of a two pronged effort one is to establish a risk or to having announced the center of your existing portfolio and see if there's discrepancies\nThen the third step is you need to take some action to get them lined up appropriately\nBut my one of the biggest thing somebody can do and it comes time to\nNeeding to make some changes and some allocations are ... in your portfolio is understanding that different investments and different investment types carry different risk or as in and of themselves so although where you're going to look at it overall for yourself as an investor what is your score", "show_name": "America in the Morning with John Trout", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "27"}
