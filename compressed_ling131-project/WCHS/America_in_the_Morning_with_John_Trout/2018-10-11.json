storm as it moves across the south east we're going to be looking at the center of the storm cutting across the Carolinas for today and emptied tonight\nAnd then coming up across Virginia by tomorrow morning the center of this storm is likely to end up being all the way out over the Atlantic and at that\nPoint it is likely to have diminished considerably\nWe're going to be looking at a lot of rain across the southeast is well this is going to be renewing flooding problems throughout the Carolinas including some areas that are still dealing with flooding issues leftover from Florence\nWe're also going to see gusty winds that's going to be a big problem as well and we can have additional power outages has trees and power lines began to come down as well with this storm moving through\nFurther to the north we have a cold front which is what steering Michael also bringing rainy weather there can be some gusty winds even up through Virginia and into Delmarva\nHowever we're not looking at any of that as we hadn't been to New England to just the rain as the front comes through behind it it's going to be cooler and much less humid and more typically fall like through the middle of the

our Democrats bring the issue of health care back to the forefront in advance of the midterm elections correspondent Linda ... has the story\nThe mid term elections are closing in fast and Democrats want to punctuate the issue of healthcare\nHoping it will help bring voters to the polls on election day they want to portray the Democratic party as the champion of health care and the Republican Party as the one that wants to take it away\nThat helps to explain why Senate Democrats forced to vote on a bill that would eliminate the expanded sale of so called junk health insurance plans the fact that they didn't get the votes to support the bill and that only one Republican Susan Collins broke ranks and voted with Democrats is not necessarily a bad thing for the Democratic party because it sends this message\nWill keep working to improve health care to bring down the cost of prescription drugs but to make sure that people with pre existing conditions can get that chair and we will do our very best to hold the Republican majority accountable for their attempts to undo it\nDemocrat Maggie Hassan says these policies which are part of the jail peace effort to undo Obamacare don't cover much and they certainly don't have a pre existing conditions\nWhat we really are seeing from the Trump Administration and Republicans is an absolutely relentless attempt to got protections especially for pre existing conditions Republican\nJohn Cornyn says that's not the case\nProtecting patients against pre existing conditions something we all support but basically the the misleading argument we're hearing from the other side is the only way you can do that through the Affordable CARE Act the Affordable\nCARE Act or Obamacare does cover pre existing conditions and Democrat Chris Murphy says the low cost insurance plans that Republican support and not worth the paper they're written on\nI think it's really sad that we couldn't draw more than one Republican vote for a measure that simply says when you sell insurance it should actually be insurance\nBut Senator Cornyn says the insurance he's talking about is all about choice\nWe need more choices for consumers who they can fight healthcare price they can afford and the suits are nice\nMurphy says the so called junk plants don't serve anyone's need by the way we just passed\nAn opioid still a couple of weeks ago let's be clear about one of the key insurance benefits missing from these junk plant addiction benefits\nMilan debate over these non Obamacare policies continues Democrats further accused the Trump Administration of attention to dismantle the Affordable CARE Act in other ways the administration has announced that it will take down the Obamacare website for maintenance for up to twelve hours every Sunday during the open enrollment period\nThis will make it more difficult for people to sign up for Obamacare plants Democrats call that curious that transparent timing the administration calls

... will diminish someone and intensity and it's going to be able to continue to bring quite a bit of rain and wind across the Carolinas and southeastern Virginia\nThat rain is going to be renewing flooding problems across parts of North Carolina and South Carolina\nEspecially the eastern half of those states that there's going to be a lot of rain along the path as well where else in looking at when strong enough to still bring down some trees and caused power outages along the storm's path as well\nThere is also a possibility that as the storm is moving northward we could see a chance for some tornadoes as well and that's going to be a possibility throughout the especially the eastern Caroline is not as much in the western half of the north and South Carolina\nWe're also going to be looking at rainy weather in general through the north east as a cold front is pushing eastward and that is going to be able to bring occasionally heavy rain across New England intending to the rest of

'til jumbo Hannah and welcomes in his gas\nThe weekend Michael but still very strong is rampaging through Georgia heading for the Carolinas\nAnd we're talking with Dr Brian tag assistant professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the university at Albany State University of New York do offer some thoughts\nI Know the relative speed with which Michael surged a short compared let's say with the forests the last notable storm which was a virtually guilty of loitering why the difference\nWell hurricanes or or like ... and the stream where um the stream as a kind of a background atmosphere flow steering the storm in case of Florence is kind of slow me entering strain so state over a long a period a an area over a long period of time\nOr as a Michael it in a fast moving stream and is there for moving quickly to the north\nI gather that the dreams of wind velocity there's no connection between the speed with which a storm moves across the landscape or if you will it fits horizontal speed if you as a as compared with the the speed at which wins in the circular motion the two are not related right\nRight the two are related yeah\nA storm surge again or is there a loitering stormed more likely to cause more in the way of water damage done one that moves rapidly\nIt certainly can cause a build up a surge ahead of the store and it can\nSo long to search as a storm as making landfall this storm is moving at a slower speed\nIt's an impressive the titles certainly you have as a assistant professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences there at the university at Albany state you of New York I can recall a time up\nIn my youth when we we made jokes about the weatherman and how accurate they were in by today's standards that was certainly true pre satellite and free computer in the host of other things\nToday I think we may go the other extreme we see all these great satellite photos and that you're about things like Doppler radar which most of us don't really understand but it sounds oh so technically precise and I think we tend to think of you is miracle workers and we we get on your case of your off even the even a little bit\n... light messages to just to what is the current state of a a environmental and that was very understanding\nIn terms of weather prediction we've come a long way in the last ten to Twenty years and our ability to more accurately predict the weather\nUh in terms of hurricanes a week on predicts a the the tractor hurricanes with relatives turn the sometimes even five seven eight dollars we solve Florence um you know Twenty years ago that would've not an awful\nYou would do research that focuses on tropical cyclone formation intensification and the interactions and for those who don't know by the way a psych loans uh hurricanes and type foods are all pretty much the same thing but in different locations is that right\nThat's correct and and you focus on on those areas first start with formation what is it about a given spot in the ocean that indicates that a tropical depression is going to form their which may then turned into one of these mass these storms\nSo and and the Atlantic a tropical depression is far from clusters of thunderstorms that originate a off of Africa than move over water um we typically see about ... percent of these tropical a ... they're called tropical waves or develop into a tropical depression is\nUm typically in a sort of the August through October timeframe\n[noise] uh why August to October\nIt's because the ocean temperatures are typically the warmest in the tropical Atlantic or the jet stream as the further north around that time of year and the atmosphere is the most humid around this time there was all three ingredients tend to make for a kind of prime conditions for hurricane so far\nI guess there's no body of a larger ocean anywhere that doesn't have this type of storm when you appeared on my nighttime talk show last night you would have created that in general with obvious uh obviously many exceptions but in general\nThe intensity of the uh the typhoons in the western Pacific tend to be higher than that of the Atlantic hurricanes is that correct and if so do we know why\nYes that's correct and that's just because the ocean temperatures just tend to be much warmer and uh the area of warm water has me a much greater in the western Pacific\n... is it a ... ever do you think like they were going to be able to impact these storms that is to say a alter their their direction or their intensity", "year":
