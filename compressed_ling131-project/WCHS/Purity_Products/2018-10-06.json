{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "I in Iowa State wow a coach had her it's going to be loud\nIt will be put those Iowa where people are too nice though to really get jak [laughter]\nWe'll we'll see what happens but yeah I mean he again Jeff\nWe we've been around long enough we've seen it um the more you wind up the more the next game counts right and now probably um you know not I don't know what was it could be West Virginia is ...\nI'm not positive with that but uh up until today I witnessed said it was but uh certainly right now at this point maybe it will be but again we talked about the fact that you got to get to\nNovember undefeated because you have to really start and and that's the next one that potentially contribute\n... during the way today's game went the real important we could\nPractice come up yeah and this team has to start fast next week so the three dominating performances by West Virginia and start the season to wins in these last two but sloppy performances and clearly today needed to be a bigger when you were a few plays away from that so yeah they're going to have to get back on track\nStart fast on the road and I think Greg I think he can stay looking at this and I I Would not have said the two weeks ago but I always states doing a lot of good things they gave West Virginia all kinds of trouble last year from the defensive side of things\nAnd they look to have found and often it's a little bit so that is not as much of a gimme as I thought it might be a couple of weeks ago western is going to have to play get that way and try and moved ...\nMiles away and then you said it offensively they'd been future ... so far this season but all of a sudden now in Oklahoma State that Oklahoma State they found some offensive firepower\nNow they found block party on the side of the eye you gotta you gotta there's your does your homework you've got to find out why brought ... up in in the game\nThat really looks really good remember this was without David Montgomery their star running back who I don't know the nature of his injury But West Virginia lower he'll be back next week to play I Know he was injured heading into this week select states should be a fun one next week but to do this\nOn the road and again they bring it up to date six twenty remaining in the third quarter lotta football left Iowa State is leading thirty seven to twenty eight over number twenty five Oklahoma State I don't know about the big twelve guys I mean that's just\nThe way when you think he ever figure that you don't have that or do I I think it's kind of exactly like we thought this summer guy this league is there for the taking there's a lot of teams that are in rebuild mode trying to get back to where they've been this league is there for West Virginia taking\nIf it can keep doing what it's been doing got to get a lot better but this is a very very winnable leak the season in my opinion for West Virginia\nAnd obviously Greg ... you got to get a lot healthier particularly right\nGo yeah I I I I Am worried about the health of this team I mean right guard as is certainly glaring but um you know if don't talk or he's out for any length of time that that takes a linebacker situation and will be the fourth one back or you've lost hopefully he's his is just very short term situation but\nYeah I mean talk you got to be lucky and stay relatively healthy in West Virginia is knocking on the doors bad luck\nI I thought a data holders and had a great saying when they ask if he's going to let will Greer play any defense and he said well if you keep throwing interceptions you haven't got a lot of practice but\nYou know you don't ever want to see will Greer making a tackle either you don't ... referenced it it it was in western he's lucky that none of those went for ... let alone all of them yeah it was a time when those were first pick you thought oh those are three picks sixes right there so\nYou don't need will ... that things can happen when hookers getting involved in the tackle whether he's tackling are getting tackled so don't\nDo that we found that last year that that is for certain and and but again we did get the backup quarterback\nIn for one flight and in fact Allison you didn't do anything that handed off and lose all your [laughter] oh and his fault that though there was not his fault at all but again\nMountaineers do get the wind today guys uh against seven o'clock kick in Ames, Iowa next Saturday Night our coverage will began at for the um next Saturday afternoon so uh and will be on with you throughout the entire night in part of the morning\nA myself in a Brett how and Jeff Jenkins and Ryan got three will all be here\nBut will be fun so now it's starting to get good guy yeah I have five games in your in your six game it's starting to come alive here a little bit you can start to smell that you're in the title and hunter a long way to go beyond that you're in the hunt\n... these next two and they get in November and you've got to somewhat of an open week that that that link the week after Baylor then all of a sudden that thing's going to get rid of rats are fast\nCars at Texas game if Texas come in and wins out through there in West Virginia is undefeated in that game that's a massive game coming in that first weekend in November that'd be fun\nWell we would like to tell you ah what Iowa State record is going to be there one in three right now oh into in conference play but you would never know it\nAnd watch out this game is going again they they're leading\nMy uh eleven over Oklahoma State that's got to do it for us mountaineers are five and so on the season three you know in big twelve conference play they had to Ames, Iowa next Saturday Night for seven o'clock kick and will be on the air at four o'clock next Saturday talk to you than good night\nYou've been listening to the metro news void after presented by mind when we're delivering

physical space warps a worm holes are hired him engines or anything like that\nToday we're going to talk about well the physics of everyday things lasers computers touch screens and we're going to talk about well outer space or the origin of the moon what is dark matter what is the standard model of physics\nWith us today is Mr Russ swan author of the book the physics behind and we are going to talk about the physics of well ordinary things but we talked about Moore's law which simply says that computer power doubles every Eighteen months\nAnd we get Moore's law because we can edge type near and tiny or transistors using laser light or alter about radiation but then the question is well writing is laser light so Russ tell us why laser light is so different from ordinary light\n... laser light is made with exactly the same stuff as ordinary light is made of\nOvertones which are really tiny packets advantage either quantum took advantage but the difference between ordinary life which has\nA whole load of wavelengths them to a whole lot of different\nColors because of those wavelengths is a laser sauce all older photo albums all go to a hundred ... all the same energy you they have the same color and the same wavelength\nAnd so they appear as just a single color you cannot have for instance white lady the other sort of a physical him possibility we can have a red laser will green light as well as uh as long as it's not one single wavelength\nOn the other thing about a laser light how's besides being a single wavelength\nIs what we call a coherent\nAnd it means the old way linked to the\nPoint of energy the photons all white briefing at the same time the sort of thing around together\nAnd they grow up together and they go down together and the vibrate in exactly the same a pack them so that means that you can take a laser light it can be really interesting things with the things that you cannot do with the regular light bulb from a a an ... life from the song\nIt means you can focus some really tightly\nYou can control and a very sharp cutoff fairy shrimp starts up and lasers are still producing some of the most interesting\nTechnological breakthroughs but we're getting in society today in fact the twenty eighth team a Nobel Prize was announced quite recently um do we know of that private with three of them altogether we're all working with laser light\nAnd according to the press release or one of the applications of this one was to create an optical tweezers you do you live I'm really not tiny tiniest things just since the mid to late tools can you explain\nWhat up to ... it was a bit like if you if you watch Star Trek the science fiction program it's the track to be improved Star Trek it means you can use a laser sauce and you can control in certain ways so you get what they called a wasted be I'm not can\nCatch I'm move around\nTiny object tiny things like bacteria can be captured by a laser beam just like attractive being on a very very small scale of course and they can then be used and studied to see what ... what what they're doing and ... ... become in biology one of the most powerful tools with the last couple of decades\nOne author of a new book\nIs called the physics behind dot dot dot ... otherwise we're not going to talk about the big bang we're not going to talk about the origin of the universe we're not going to talk about string theory or higher dimensions we're going to talk about well things that you see around do every single day then you know\nThat almost second by second almost everything that you would touch you experience that you work with everything ultimately comes back to physics but we don't think about it that way and that's where the book the physics behind comes into play\nBecause we're going to talk about ordinary things well before the break we were talking about lasers rainbows\nAnd now let's talk about stealth bombers at another form of electromagnetic radiation and are they really invisible so Russ tell us about stealth bombers\nStill probably the calls all designed\nIn a few different clever engineering ways to minimize the redo radar reflection so they're not invisible to natural light you could feed them but not really quite difficult to write a book almost invisible to radar and there were two main methods that are used to reduce\nOur thinking the job when he was the shape of thing\nSo if a radio signal is transmitted from a radio station it is something if something made of metal it will bounce back\nAnd if you make the thing that it depends on who\nMade a little flat surfaces instead of coming back to work through radar system\nThey might reflect off into different directions so that cannot be detected I'm going to lead the rejects movie great off thinking that you're a print simply outgrow it also applies to the wall ship a retro reflectivity is one of the interesting things here if you're wearing a high visibility common\nAnd you notice it when you're trying to life on it you're trying to pack very brightly because if they are designed specifically to be back to reflect too much was reflective but to reflect the signal back where you came\nAnd I feel sorry for the exact opposite book to be completely normally retro reflected\nWhich means that when they designed the aircraft have no rights because their rights on go allows an energy being to bounce one about twice been calling back way again if you look at a store bought them you know the right I'm going to be seen almost anywhere\nThe only thing that they do go is the treatment they paint them in\nA rate of absorbing material basically is black and white you might say\nI'm painting absorbs the signal and the arrangement the geometry of books that being affected and that means it altogether you could have something that big a bummer that has a rate of ... about the same as a boat or bumble bee really very tiny\n[noise] okay well of course the average person has seen movies like Harry Potter where there is an invisibility cloak where you really really really are invisible to light\nNow there are certain things called ... materials which gives you a semblance of invisibility for a microwave radiation but well what are your thoughts about one day or whether or not we're going to create true invisibility whiz meta materials for optical frequencies
