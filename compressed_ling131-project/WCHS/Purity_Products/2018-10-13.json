I say I challenge at Iowa State will not have more than West Virginia\nI challenge you do I think West Virginia will have more and also I think West Virginia is going to win I think they're going to win the wind up with more TSLs\nCall on the field\nI always said is wearing all black one by one or junior should do this thing for a game that oh here\nWe go black uniformed discussing that\nGet it started Ben Kurt shovel\nSo are we saying that West Virginia should half black uniform yes that's the question challenge last in no challenge ... I Know black is everyone's third color even if it's not actually in their colors I challenge it and I'll just counter with is\nJust for one game bring back the blue blue gold with the blue piping down the legs ... just just for one game just do that one don't worry about the black do that\nSteve\nI challenge it too because you know even though I have [laughter] I have an Orange Bowl all black on black hair all black over he's got challenging\nWell this is Dana black so that's what they were so I wouldn't be like Dana anyway so what did you say ... would you say like you said I like traditional colors and where's the gold pants and the blue shirt so that's what I like\nAll right a ... year typically I Would say a ... I'm a traditionalist becomes a uniform but can you imagine\nHow high the crowd would be an all black for Oklahoma at the end of this year\nIf there's ever an opportunity to do it at home\nOr go hide hide the question you can't do it this year you can't get them out of time I saw it on a path uniform\nYeah let's do it yeah where do you help recruiting what do we have to do to recruit ... we can do

not one that criticize Dana so what do you wear black\nAbsolutely get black uniforms at some point so you favor the black hole I Do I like it or a I Am what's that what's that which we don't have the answer should they wear black uniforms at some point next season or that he should they usually they\nLast year they have uniforms that are colored black and wear them yeah like special occasion though doesn't have to be every week should they mix that into the uniform combination the answers actually no because blacks not a color\nOr it's not on the spectrum is actually an absence of color white white Snow White collar either All right well they have white uniforms well it's not a color understand ... your typical I told your margin they could I add one question should they have black or not\nYou know because of West Virginia fans got so freaked out when Dana always wears black I mean they were going to storm the facility building\nSomewhere black you got great colors you can do a lot of things with those colors in West Virginia ... into what blew out and you don't need you need to go all black and white Jenny as big as basketball wins over the last couple of decades they beat Kentucky while wearing black to go to the final four\nSo they had uniform they didn't have any color\nIs that right Brad and Brad's defense it's also about apparel it's not just about the uniforms right it's about all the apparel that you get during the week true yeah and all that hype is a real somebody hit you in the mouth\nThe um the ... is there any uh\nUh a color what other colors is I

last week I told you it was a win no matter what happens so I just ... three things to watch for not going that far to not have actually got three keys to victory for each night here we go to number\nStart fast now that probably goes without saying but I'm gonna say it anyway you're on the road at night in front of a packed house that hasn't seen his team at home in two weeks and ... are coming up a huge road when ... advantage to Iowa State similar to what WB face going into Texas Tech how the mountaineers overcome it and love it\nThey started fast took the crowd out of the game early by scoring\nTwenty first quarter point West Virginia started fast last year against Iowa State but the cycle and help them to know points in the second half so you better start fast tonight that'll that crowd down and ... stadium enroll from their\nNumber two we've talked about this all night you've gotta give Greer time tonight and every ... every team in America could use this as a key to victory I get that but it's especially true with Greer I'm not sure there's a more accurate pastor in the country when given the clean pocket that will Greer West Virginia was very good at protecting him in the first three and a half game\nThen some injuries along that all thanks to blind force backups into the game as well as some shuffling around a position to ... have to move from center to guard the result has been six porters are pressure from WB use opponent\nCan West Virginia's authentic blind reverse that trend tonight give him time and I I don't think there's any way I always said holds with them watch the ... tonight for West Virginia\nI'm very angry confused and attack we spent a lot of time on Broadway production\nThat is he's in his first started you got an Eighteen Nineteen year old in his first collegiate start we hear from every opponent every week\nHow difficult this defenses to prepare for from a blocking schemes who do you pick up where they coming from how many geyser coming where are they coming from if that does that show up tonight against a true freshmen in his\nFirst START I would be done that's got to be a key tonight for Tony Gibson's group confused him attack him just like you did live freshmen at Texas Tech Allen Bowman that first half was going all West Virginia's way until Bowman was knocked out of the game\nYou know and brought pretty is going to if he's going to run the ball fourteen Fifteen sixteen times again he's gonna get hit read to ten twelve Thirteen fourteen times that many changes attitude a little bit about running a football right\nOh yeah and that line backer room all week long their coaches telling you if he runs the ball as much as we expect him to run a boy and finishes the game do not come back here next week [laughter]\nAnd also Steve you know rock pretty when he went in that game remember he went in the second series against Oklahoma State joke on the state did not prepare for a guy that's been running now what's what's good they've been doing for the last seven days well that\nThat's always a problem for coordinator cause you you you go out there and you think you're going to get one quarterback and it's hard to adjust your players when you get a running quarterback so they're going in knowing what they're going to get in and I would be shocked if Tony don't shut the quarterback running\nDown well doesn't that help too that this is exactly what West Virginians August Texas Tech you saw quarterback with the ability to scramble in Iran sees scene that you get a blueprint there don't you less\nPlus you know did this defenses built for the spread offenses ... there are spread system so you know and we're planning a pretty high level our defenses to me is way above what everybody expected him to be\nYou know I'm really additives to see a West Virginians defense so performs against property because he did if you watch the game last week he was pretty impressive um he's got an arm okay even with these when he flushed out he can throw the ball down field\nUh he's got you know we got we all that gets passed the wind read you know we can pick up Fifteen twenty yards he's a real ... what about a third down strikers give me a lot of to bring pressure on third down do you do you still bring as much pressure if a guy can can pack it in and take off well\nFirst of all they they don't want to get in certain longs thirty seven plus his way out of the deal that's putting it all and party to make the pass it just started down and wanting to Z is definitely advantage to our state there's no question about that so I think the key to the game and stop the running game for some in third in laws and make them become a pastor which I don't think he's ready for it\nTo a good point you want me to give you ... that I don't listen to this one West Virginia has hit the opposing quarterback twenty eight percent of the time on drawbacks on third down this week three of the season the big twelve average just Eighteen percent so West Virginia well above that on getting to the quarterback on third down\n... what'd you going to see you must you must see a bunch of quick games you must see screens you're going to see a moving pocket and that gets in there I think 'cause he those ball very well moving\nBut read you have had some amazing stats here today I think you've been really busy all the way round this die together for this game it's a big game comes around ready to go you know then go back to where we are my goodness give the guy just a little bit more time okay keep people off of them a little bit more time and let him be maybe not quite as anxious\nTo a gym that ball in there and have confidence to make every fro\nYeah because that's the key there is going to be pockets to throw into but as Steve was mentioning earlier against us Iowa State defense you might have to plot down the field a little bit they're going to give me those meaty medium routes on the sidelines the big play may not be there's much you got to have some patients\nTo guys find when I asked a world go round the horn on this is West Virginia the ranks six in the country and they their ranks six by benefit of just continuing to win other teams lose your the team's ahead of you were all undefeated although Georgia might be falling through the is West Virginia the six best team in the country Brett\n... that's a tough question I'm going to reframe that I don't know if they're the sticks the best but I think they deserve to be ranked sick at this point they haven't trail the only team in college football that hasn't trail this year they have one games and they've done what they need to do", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products",
