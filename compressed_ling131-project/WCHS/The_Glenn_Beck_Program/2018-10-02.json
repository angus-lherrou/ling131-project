you were in the uh in the um what is considered the production room and you're listening to governor just yeah and his uh his press guns eight\nThirty press conference yeah and you know they release late yesterday information revenue numbers in revenues continue to do really well not\nAfter the first quarter of the fiscal year so the first three months of the fiscal year they've exceeded revenue estimates by about a hundred and twenty million dollars which is huge I mean that's a that's a really big number\nI'm so the economy's doing better than they thought it would uh and so personal income taxes up\nA corporate net income tax is up and consumers sales tax those three other drivers so I think they there are about Ninety five percent of the surplus so it shows that you know that that there's a booming economy and better is getting better it's getting better or so with that information\nHe announced today to significant things and it's a pretty I mean he talked to a lot about Republicans in the in the uh it was pretty parties and announce it but he did announce that as the ... task force continues to do its work this doesn't end any work they're doing but he's pledging\nOne hundred million dollars toward a permanent fix for PE I now says right now we don't need that because as you know from our reporting pie I had a very good year last year so their surplus\nCan take care of at least the next year of increased cost\nBecause they had a really really good year last year and they have these surplus fund but he's pledging another one hundred million dollars on top of the new surplus they have to continue into the future a while while the ... task force continues to look for a permanent\nFail and the ... the ... the problem is an actuary problem a problem is stuff that's going to come to you know I mean my son is in the hospital last week for a day yeah I mean and and he's on Sara's um\nYou know ... and um\nYeah so I mean so he didn't announce effects or anything 'cause he's been kind of talking about privatization and different things but the task force will make recommendations and we'll see where it goes from there all he did today basically we say we're the economy's doing well\nHere's one hundred million dollars in little place one hundred million dollars toward the permanent fix then the next thing he did is he said I Will propose and these lawmakers these the Republican lawmakers will be behind me for a five on an additional five percent pay raise for teachers\nAnd for all state workers there will be approved and the next legislative session so that would mean that teachers if it's if it's approved that'll be a ten percent raise in two years have not heard from the teachers groups yet I don't know what they'll say about\nThe ah speaking to teachers where I have a little boy yeah old school yeah they don't expect yeah I mean this is going to be a plus yeah I\nThink it's um I have a nice it's a teacher GW and her mother my sister and I were comparing her stuff around the country and there's a definite discrepancy with West Virginia teachers store and it it's really stifled our ability to\nUm\nRecruit ... teachers from um\nUh in math and science shorter so\nHopefully um I mean I you know I'm all in let's go to the party if I Hope it's real I Hope it last\nUm and I was shocked yeah so ... yeah well yeah that's a\nThat's pretty significant you I mean governor is usually are very very very close to the vest with any pay raises because pay raises mirror an ongoing cost as you know it's not one time money it's an ongoing cost his base building right what they call base building a pay raises a base building bills to the base of your budget\nYeah it's it's it's it's it's ... you just do it this year yeah you do it every year goes on he goes on if they if a certain percent pay raise in the city Charleston cost us four percent four hundred million dollars I say or I don't know forty may I don't know whatever it is\nMan that's a new forty or four hundred million every year year and I write down on me forty four hundred but I mean whether to stay within right if it's four million dollars yeah he's going to be in the budget the next year and we've been we've given some significant raises and now we've reached a\nPoint where we're having trouble doing that and uh I'm Glad the state can do it I think it's a great yeah\nThat's so that was that's what came out of there this morning to sing the pretty significant announcements and again he did point out that that the CIA taskforce continues to do its work this doesn't stop them from doing their work but there'll be this one hundred million dollars that will be\nThat will be there for them that they can use or figure into any permanent fix\nIs what is what he's proposing he thinks they're getting kind of me will continue to grow in these grown for the last the revenue collections have grown significantly now as far as a Walker try talking about that during closing arguments now so they had just one witness this morning my account the former state budget director and kind of he talked about what the budget was like you know\nHe clerked for the Judiciary Committee when I was a\nYeah yeah yes it might have been around he works for the auditors office now good guy and uh and so he uh he he just testified with the state's financial condition was like a couple of years ago when all these renovations were taking place\nYou know just kind of violent light to that but shot is giving his closing they might kissing will give his closing and then we then the Senate will deliberate\nWonder deliberate yeah does that mean they they stand up and do it a room I probably I think they go up and make the speeches I don't know but I Do think gentleman we should vote to convict and removed from office or it\nMight be some of that but they might also going to close like any jury would go behind closed doors and deliberate and come out now there's going to be the most trials their instructions so I'm not sure what if if if the judge Paul Ferrell\nThe chief justice in this case have have jury instructions I mean can they what are their options\nRemoved from office censor reprimand me out of you know what what are the options that they have\nFor her fine I mean I don't know what they can do or they can
