more and it's just kind of been spoken about kind of promise\nSay hey wait a minute on our start over with that because I left the the ... you say is kind of a manager and go ahead and say that again\nI Believe the hundred million dollars is is a ... it's just been spoken about talked about it hasn't been earmarked hasn't been put into a special scale it hasn't been a dedicated to that fund yet in a truth in my mind I Believe the legislature would have to go through a process to do so or through budget process\nAnd I believe as we've seen so many cuts over the last probably two years they're going to be a lot of it he's looking to get their budget\nPut back into the shape but were they were two thousand eight I'm In if we put a hundred billion dollars towards PA which that may cover is for about Ninety percent of two years and then we'll be all that right back to the same situation a on top of ten ... ten percent compounding interest\nSo I think we got to get an actual fix the pie I rather than putting some money aside and hoping that everything's great again two years\nOkay All right um the third thing and this is what I wanted to share with you and I have an interview on this tomorrow I don't really do you when you get to listen to know casually you might but um you know the opioids had been taken over by men\nThat I've heard that Yes sir I promise you\nAnd I have Cooper on here tomorrow to tell you about it\nAnd I think it's significant because opioid has become like a you know the bell rings on the chocolate chip cookie with the dog okay and and um the bells still ran but it's no longer a opioids is now a mess and it's significantly more\nAnd I I have an interview but I think you should know that\nWell I think the issue we we face is more of an addiction issue than it is a opioid or math issue I think we saw a crack cocaine and the early nineties late eighties\nWe saw heroin in the seventies or state we saw heroin just what I you know this last decade and maybe we'll switch to mess with a a ... process that no matter what were the two there's got to be a drug out there that are going to have to suffer through\nI understand the only reason I'm saying this is because I think legislators it matters as to where it's coming from because it may be coming from a different place and um\nAnd it it is being in his actually worse than heroin\nI think that a message worse than here so and not everybody to try and heroin gets addicted to it that math is just a little bit different and it takes you are a lot quicker I I I just want to share that with you and actually what the audience\nYeah I think the the hot button word this year as a opioid and while\nThat may be the issue we face today are really the work drug is more appropriate for the addiction thing that that our community suffer through it if if we can face that issue and try to correct that is maybe the supply access for granted struck me as\nFair enough I appreciate you very much Dr ... thank you for having me off I\nHave a great day Andrew Robinson who is a delegate from can all county from the east in ... county can all city and represent the east and certain little special parts\nOf the gerrymandering or little Smith road reads is they've really got to stop that it\nSome of these so\nI'm convinced that when they created one of those single districts in the old thirty second when I was in\nThat it was a that they created it for what it looks like on a map and I'm not going to go into what it looks like on a map because it's\nNot fit for radio but I'm just convinced this gerrymandering stuff has got to stop but none of them at the one you were in\nYeah when they broke it up to three into three separate districts the\n... there was some imagery going on there that I think was intentional imagery but my point is is I think the U.S Supreme Court is going to start looking at both congressional and a state not if nobody challenges it I think they will at some point\nI mean this is the you know like just look at just look at a map sometime and look at how\nThe Democrats just really wanted to try to hold onto their seats by creating Democrat that's right but and the Republicans do it too I'm not saying they're innocent I'm just saying it it's like having\nYou know [noise] ah down in Putnam county it's crazy I mean you've got you've got up putting them county which is a progressive\nConservative progressive county ... ... that's not necessarily inconsistent reaching down into Logan county putting them in Logan county have nothing in common and neither does Lincoln ... well the because of the senatorial ... they're all voting Republican\nWell but my point is is you you've got to bring some continuity to the stuff\nI mean it should

Fox with Claire McCaskill she's running for Senate she's very impressive I don't think she's going to lose\nBut she said that um she was she said why can't we just fix the AC because\nThe Democrats are for the Medicaid there for the Medicare\nThere are but they realize that the the exchanges I mean the cost of these changes has gone up crazy if you're it's like the exchanges were made to hurt the people that participate in the middle class and I think that's the number one issue these years healthcare\nThey tend to lean more towards the environmental side and they are uh they would be very liberal\nOn I'm On I'm\nMaking ... instead of passing laws when it comes to the federal agencies look I don't speak for and folks\nAre saying to everybody that I understand that what you hear their political rhetoric on your their political advertisements they don't say that I'm just I'm always like anti Trump and that they never basically back up and say here's what I stand for because it's the
