in America\nWhile a civil conflict is a conflict I think you would be talking about masses of people going after other masses of people is that what you're talking about\nYes people taking sides yes okay\nYou know if it's an interesting that you brought up how old is Nazi Germany get started\nAnd you know did they just follow Hitler's book Hitler saw an opportunity and German society where there was a a a poor economy all he had to do was find an enemy to blame and people were following anywhere\nBut he never got any like he's trying to make an analogy here I think he's headed\nToward analogy well wait a minute or you know you\nCan you pick up on things real fast\nSo wait a minute Chris remember he ran a couple of times and didn't get anywhere\nThey didn't get anywhere is ironic compare of that ad enough current and if she didn't hold on the right enemy\n\nWell but he was all in there was a he hated the Jews in his book and that was back when he was in prison\nRight okay so are you are you talking about me are you talking about Trump or who you're talking about\nBut daddy I you're getting ready to be done with this whole political thing you're not going to be leading anybody anywhere [laughter] right or the president\nAt the getting of the campaign oh it's the immigrants the immigrants are going to take everything away from you so let's get mad at the immigrants and it has morphed into all the Democrats over the liberal\nAnd things are going to be the two groups that ended up fighting it's got to be conservative against liberals and that's something none of us want to say\nBut it's common\nI I think it was a ... you know I spent time out west and I think this this thing to go after people from Latin America has been a mistake from the very beginning\nAnd um\nIt's a native this concept and you know what native is is that not everybody does and\nIt it's easy to get people to organize around that is a place immigration all from the same place so we ought to be on the same team and we ought to oppose people who aren't from the same place immigration\nWas the first time but\nI that Donald Trump got my attention as a candidate and I'll tell you why because because he said he wanted to get rid of these gang members who were in the United states illegally and I I don't have to deal with that but\nI but I just put myself in the position of someone in Chicago or one of these large cities that have to deal day in and day out with illegal\nCriminals in there and they're they want him front yard and it was a major sanctuary is that that was the first time he got my he got my attention I'm like wow it doesn't affect me but I'm going to vote for him to help out the people in the big cities we have to deal with these criminals every day\nThey don't think like Trump they now wait a minute we'll yeah you're right let me get this right now let's get this right guys just the big cities are when it comes to immigration there about as liberal as you can get no\nNo no and the thing is the leadership is I'm Talking about the guy that goes to work every day who has to lock up his house with with bars on his windows and has to worry about his children getting shot in his yard because of these\nIn the big cities in the big city there do seem to play and voted for Trump I Know but they are in point\nNo they're not well their leadership isn't but the but the little people a lot of the elect why do they elect a rama Emanuel ... in a de Blasio when you're right but why did they vote for Trump why did the big city and why is voters vote for tribes they're not even a Republican Party left\nIn California or in a New York or in New England Susan ... will be the last Republican\nAgree I agree uh what are you know in Compton like or wherever over there in in east LA ... they're getting shot up\nWhy why why are they voting that took ... this is to you Chris I understand I I really do I get your I get your a meeting here today but that was the first time the Trump resonated with me and he said I'm getting rid of the criminals\nThat are illegal immigrants and I thought wow what would be great to get them out of these big\nSea ricin doesn't even affect me dressed in two thousand six president\nBush and Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy had a ... bill which was considered pro immigrant is a very reasonable bill\nA you had to pay a fine you had to pay back taxes you had to learn English and all the people there in the country could sign in and get green cards but to get citizenship they got behind the people that were already in line they're outside of the country you with me\nRight I thought that was a perfectly rational and reasonable and I argued and he wouldn't remembers twelve years ago I read was happy about this we had a debate on his show and you get this out of out of the folks um\nEven on the reasonable writer in the middle you get this is the law's the law and we should say the law\nProhibition was below ... we didn't have that law\nWe should mainstream these folks now well Chris ... a very good\nPoint that I was wanting to make here [laughter] [noise] it seems\nThe politicians that name and enemy use our fear against us in order to gain power you've got politicians out here that sell a concept of folk and other politicians who sell a concept of fear\nYou as a voter are going to make a critical decision\nIn this election day\nAre you going to vote for our best or are you gonna vote for our worst\nFears record us where we're going it's a good quote\nThat's it that's been made before but I I I think it is and I think that a person should should try to exude ... optimism an upwardly mobile thinking but also\nChris we need to um we need to be realistic and truthful and if this is somehow

I'm not I'm either guilty or not guilty of a lot of things but I Am guilty of really ... I Am for Charleston and\nWhoever wins the mayor's race I'm going to be for them so I've got my preference but she's well\nI I Am Seventy two and uh it's pretty bad when you have to go out to feel you have to have an arm or a stun gun or something because it is so dangerous I have to walk for everything that I made because I had no car\nAnd the Democratic party has gone so far Iraq\nThat I don't feel like they are for cursing lightning any wrong or that quickly and ... and they're afraid that the uh the under privileged where who I worked the night and I'm like when it comes to that and I I cannot that in that direction\nSo you you feel like you're as a person just an average person I'm sure you're not rich\nI'm her but I you feel like you're in the margins at the right\nAnd I'm the only kind of person that relate I Want my friends on the left to hear this and I think this is a very important phone call because this is Donald Trump relates to exactly\nExactly this is the ... the first time I voted Republican\nYeah he's um he's the person it's getting to the people that feel like nobody hears exactly right yeah and um and I get that I didn't I didn't vote for him but I understand it and um and I\nI watched I watched this could be a presidential conventions\nAnd when I saw what was coming at it I got a credit convention I mean logging papal ... children are criminal and and and not bringing up a tape of that I can relate to I mean what is it solid that right\nThat's right he's right All right hey I appreciate you thanks for you never go before have you\nKnow I never had this is exciting\nThing I listen but I listen every day and I read to you and I'm Sorry you're reading and I heard it hackers get get because when you say\nAll right thank you very much it's going to be a tough job on anybody to get to ... mainly because the elements\nThat we were dealing with Kim good morning\nMorning how are you today good\nHey it's a little bit of politics on different direction a couple of things last week you were asking about term limits your favorite term limits\nI think I Am yeah I think I I've gone back and forth on it but I think family a legislative term limits and if you want to impose among the mayor I'm Sorry I said next return I mean fairness\nI'm Glad you're standing next to term but I I was the same way I kind of was against it like if you can find somebody good deeper not\nBe free to re elect them all you want but what changed my mind as some of the things that we've been talking about lately with um the Supreme Court each moment with tapping on all of that and comments will come up like they got to worry about what their constituents still think if they vote this\nWay or that way and I got to thinking\nWould happen if you didn't have to worry about real getting reelected and just doing what you thought was based on the facts and I think people spend too much time\nI'm campaigning and doing what they think will get them re elected instead of making the tough decisions so that while I'm In favor of term limits let them sit there and fix financial problems and fix\nThings right argued and fix it and get out and I've always tried to where the truth I've always tried to tell it where it be it\nAnd it's got me in trouble right that ... thing you talked about\nThis campaign ads you ask people do they make a difference or not or they just turned you off and going to the polls\nThey didn't make a difference for me and I'll tell you how I Am less there is a town hall meeting or debate it's hard to tell what what candidates really for what their platform and a lot less more radio and TV\nSo I kind of listen to the ads and when I hear a lot of ads from a candidate that candidates voice fan I'm Joe delegate and I approve this message\nOr whether in dollars and a lot I don't know but I'm Glad I hear from that candidate and his commercial and when I hear mostly from the other side not them but some hack commercial and they probably didn't approve it who knows what and all it talks about is what the other candidate is doing wrong not what\nTheir preferred candidate is doing right now as far as\nMe off well they have the right way I'm\nMostly Republican what the topic just match and more secure that really wasn't sure which one I vote for and mostly what I\nHear I don't really hear from ... from the acts that just say well Joe got chauffeur around when he was governor Johannes portrait painted on well every governor does that I don't hear more see coming on fan I Would never spend that kind of money like water into someone on fan\nI don't agree with that ad I didn't want it it's not what I represent here's what I'm about that kind of turned me off ... mainly because I don't hear from\nThem interesting very interesting ... uh Tam thank you very much very good poll thank you for the call uh I'll tell you who I had dinner with a one term was Alan Simpson\nAnd he had the hard right in Wyoming that was against him very Republican state at the time and he said the the way he got around it was a\nHe was he fought the Arab pie because all we entitlements you know kept and without any cause and effect as to what it might cost ... ... it's not he said I wasn't against everything there were four but it was always about them you know they didn't they refused to look at the whole picture and he fought the pro life crowd\nAnd he uh said buddy if a woman I don't want to his views on abortion about like mine because when we get your feet Mr them out but now wait a minute I don't want to I get I get to ... per life or no no no I'm not saying anything I'm I'm listening I'm list okay so he said that the way he did it and the way McCain did it\nAnd I'm sure a lot of Democrats I'm sure tester out there in Montana does it this way they held town meetings they go to places and let people come up and get to know him and talk to them and let them hear their voices and say well he's a nice guy and I'm ... with him on everything but ah like the way things and\nThat's the way you're able to measure up but if you don't do that if you don't expose yourself to people\nIf you don't make yourself available and let them see and hang out with you and if you're if you're a politician like that you were good with names\nOh my goodness oh God I never had good governor ... he was a march arch Moore
