I'd be the best one in history or the worst one in history so [laughter]\nYeah don't listen to me but I it it just it just seems like that a justice Walker demand that some of the same arguments I'm certainly stated the power to the constitution and to the body with which you\nFused and it you know if they seem to the states seem to survive that\nAnd that's why I think that she survived and I think that she that's why I felt like there was a good decision I\nMean I felt like a bath uh she gave them the relevance um she knows that there is some screw ups up there and she knows according to normal people and I'm not talking about a\nUm I learned a lot from these callers I learned so much for these people that call this show and just normal people out there on the streets in this\nBut regular people in the street are outraged by that outcome I mean there are very few people who like that outcome and you said she knew this is\nA woman sitting right back there I mean Eric I mean come on I mean there are people in this\nBuilding I mean just normal book normally votes right and and um so I\nI don't know go ahead Kenny I'd just okay so let's let's go to something you can't talk about the ... the juries are deliberating started again at nine thirty now to this one guy they do\nOkay that they do I look for decision today I Can't if you let me ask you this question if they didn't get to the gym today would they work on Saturday or come back on Monday\nMy guess is the scope a neighbor would give them the weekend off\nUm it's it's not it's not surprising every ... every ... days and days of detailed testimony from Twenty one with the ... and then I Believe there were there was one fresh rebuttal witness was just had a very\nVery very and very short thank goodness in very short but but pretty\nPointed and on point I can talk about it\nHe was called a liar he was caught on matter even intelligence yet he was you know what were you know our car said here's one here's one car said\nWait a minute\nAlright seeping bring it up would just have a little fun with it or are you doing in\nThe rye and now let's get on a lot of hold on getting\nWe meant that they do it again do it again listen ... go ahead I\nNow I have to cry [laughter]\n\nCar car and closing called it's called the liar Disney\nYeah he did and well but they caught a lot of people liars actually it and that was a part of the closing for Philip right\nBrent Benjamin already what other\nYeah a lot of people would have had to not be telling the truth for justice law free hundreds assistant to be telling the truth and we'll let the jury decide that but uh but it's so it's not a huge surprise they've been out because of all the documents they have to look through it all the best way back and clear up\nI can clear up personally whether you believe me or not maybe I'm a liar but I can clear personally one issue for sure\nA big contention was when the justice offering though that was it ... desk and who allowed to take it home and under testimony it was that Steve Canterbury directed that that can be taken to his home of course much Cadbury not knowing he had the desk\nAnd and the point was made well state Cadbury knew everything else and he told Kenny bass and that was set in court and so why wouldn't they tell him that the desk I can tell you on my mother's grave\nThat I didn't hear about that desk from Steve Canterbury and the initial volley of all the information that we received from him\nOn the court okay and they did not happen because if I had heard about it you know would have heard about it\nWe would have been in the story steep Canterbury if my memory serves me correctly steep Canterbury told me you told him about the death\nI found out about it later from a different source\nAnd and although other media outlets say that they've caused the the issue to be raised and certainly feel traveling with the guys that did mention the couch more than anybody before anybody else even though I Know about the cap since August that was something that we were holding back because we have so much other material\nThat I didn't know about the desk until shortly before I sent an email\nTo justice walk free\nAsking about it and the FBI tells me it's the first mention of the cast Gilbert desk in this case and that's where I asked the man he still has that casts Gilbert desk at your house and do you plan on returning to the state anytime soon that information to the best of my knowledge did not come from Steve Canterbury\nAttorney car or didn't have the look that he didn't he called my friend all our general life but he didn't have the fact you didn't have the law\nSo he just threw everything me to think what else are we supposed to do I mean well I think\nI think he did a good job I think he did a nice job on the case I think he's a good attorney I think he was he was aggressive during the trial he lodged more than three or four dozen objections for relevance for er here say I hate for you know he he did he did what a lawyer supposed to do he aggressively defended his client the\nProblem is his client did self acknowledge\nAlmost everything he was accused of in the night but he did talk to a gym Alice in that meeting it's recorded he didn't take those strips and use the state's credit card hey did um have a cast Gilbert desk at his house\nI mean it it's tough to get around those things he did received checks in the mail and cash to put him in his account and not reimbursed estate somehow get massage that and to not being illegal that the shore that car\nFaced during the trial and I don't know if he pulled it off and I don't know if he failed that's what the jury is wrestling with now\nI have no trepidation about her and that guy if I came into town and need a lawyer on a criminal case I Would have no trepidation he's a good lawyer agree he ... hey Kenny uh we'll talk I'll hit you over the weekend okay\nYes sir I have a great day thinking man\nAnd you know we ought to do the now now you can come back on the show Steve I'm about to\nCome back in the room during All right I'm here [laughter] we got to get out a way to get John ... go on

the show even you occasionally and ah and I think that's important and I I've gotten some lecture\nVery mild polite lectures and people that say Danny you're too close to this year one of them I mean they don't say it like that but I think that's what they mean you're friends with these people and you don't see what it feels like from out here to stay with me Chris mhm because I think uh this is very important\nIs that looked at this\nWouldn't have mattered according to this decision it wouldn't have mattered if it was a million dollars shower or three hundred and twenty thousand or couch\nI mean we can do what we want where the policymaking untouchable and that's it and this is and it can all be persona is bad but hey you weren't in my opinion but I I've done some personal intimate there but\nWe'll look here's what they've done they said\nWe're not trying to tell the legislature what to do what we're trying to do is tell a legislature what to do they talk about separation of powers and the only branch they respect separation of powers force the judicial branch they're telling the legislature what ... wedding exactly what kind of bill they've got a pass to impeach somebody gets

well\nAnd uh so yesterday we had activities going on in Boone county a rate down there we had a massive take down a and a Parkersburg or we had project Huntington earlier this year and those takedown Fayette County takedown happened about two or three weeks ago I think we're making real and roads and what we're saying\nIs that after these raids after these activities is federal state local partnerships that we've built we're actually seeing declines in violent crime we're seeing declines and overdoses and\nI couldn't be more thrill but what I'm calling about is I Want to thank all those law enforcement professionals out there\nAh it's easy for the U.S attorney to get up at a press conference and and get a lot of glory and and all of our chiefs and our mayors but I think ... if you'd like to join me and saying thank you to all those folks on these raids hundreds and hundreds of law enforcement officers\nAre many inside West Virginia or outside West Virginia they're really risk
