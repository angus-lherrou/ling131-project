I've asked this question many many times I've never gotten a ... a real concrete answer from anyone who is a pro life\nBut it always comes back in the case in San ... rate that it's All right correct\nOr you'd look I I don't speak for anybody that's what the legislation says I don't exactly you got it they don't know what she's saying is that's one of the exceptions\nThat's one of the exceptions and my question is what has rape or even fans have to do with that little baby that they're calling\nYeah and that's what murdered and that's what caused the Missouri senator or the Missouri guy that was running against Claire McCaskill that would have won that Senate seat\nHe he said that it was acceptable rape or some stupid comments like that I don't know do you know this isn't my issue a ... a woman ... ...\nYou can leave me out on saying I don't have anything to do with that and I think that the woman in the in the in the obstetrician can deal with that stuff I'm I'm gonna I'm I'm Out of it um but this amendment one but I've got Canterbury waiting okay so let me get Monday thanks Deborah let's get a Steve\nHey I was happy to listen to Deborah\n[laughter] well I'm I'm caught up in the middle of this mess\nWell I I Am very sorry I didn't get the here and you\nKnow here's the deal now here's the deal Steve we've got to admit somebody called Morgantown West Virginians are like oh yeah they say does make some perception what does amendment one do\nAmendment one says this is nothing in this constitution six years of protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion is a compound sentence the first part of the compound sentence clearly prohibits abortion\nNo exception for incest no exception for rape no exceptions for life and the mother and the constitution Trump's code\nAnd that's why when when the when nearly and then made that decision in Ninety three because I was not just doing ... radio then I had a TV show\nAnd I was interviewing him now I I had Richard on my show and we were talking about this and he tried to explain it to me and I'm just a high school graduate so but I Know one thing you want to speak going the stars money I'm Out I don't I don't know what I'm\nInclined to feel the same way I mean it's more I mean it's it's an issue for all of us but certainly it's it's not a man arrested there that\nThey're saying now that west reunions for life said that they can steal a if the woman's laying on the table and it did it in the case of her life the still get the Medicaid money\nNot according to this constitutional amendment I mean roughly you're a lawyer and welcome back buddy it's nice to have a\nReally it is and uh I enjoyed every time I've heard June and a couple of times we've talked outside of\nThat now see that that's real nice human rights do you come up the job I'm not a great Steve wait a minute if I\nAlways have to get together in the movie so yeah it's\nReal nice ... maybe ... or that's very very very nice do you look is is um [laughter] is\nSo that's all the amendment is what you just said\nThat's the whole thing is one compound sense of the subject of the\nFirst read it to me and read it to me again\nNothing in this constitution secures corporate tax a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion\nNow I Know that and uh that's that's the abortion crowd and if I were their political advisor I Would tell them the same thing I'd be saying go push a couple of hundred thousand dollars that are spent on very poor woman\nAnnually or to stop having any state money going into the funding of abortion there trying to make that to be as if that's the only thing that it says but it doesn't it's a compound center\nThat's the second part of the compounds that isn't the first part of is nothing in this competition six years or protect our right to abortion and I believe that\nWe go in the no on on both sides but on the anti abortion side they know that and they want that and\nThat's what they wanted for a long time and uh I think it's up to responsible people to listen to this and what I said in my op ed is how I feel I'm not going to get into the argument with people about what a fetuses my goodness everybody's heard that argument you believe that life begins at conception or you don't and every other thing falls\nOn are saying about this I was about to believe that others lives are precious I wanted to live should be protected and that's it\nMore than my dad get on me about this when he was a really conservative Godzilla came to this is you\nYou said who do you think you are you know I'll never forget that lecture I got from him and he didn't tell me that he said who do you think you are rich women get abortions and I thought they just don't tell anybody about it and I never forgot that but in you know you can disagree with that and it's OK enrich\nHave always had access to yeah they have they have and I remember I had a\nI had a friend who had a service on the phone and he would send a D.C every Saturday\nTwenty women on Piedmont Airlines you know so my my mother drive\nOf poor people for girls to DC\nAnd uh you know but but you know she was almost a a I mean she was a true zealots for trying to protect the poor especially for women and and these were typically ... women ... they were I don't think that we're Tim that we're a

America great we have a good time when we talk we will I Will always respect them I think this service the legislature was except for even though I disagree probably the fifty percent or more votes\nLike an ... point where America hey let me ask you a question on hey man I did one last question now I Do have to go because they're going to color\nDid you see where Trump did the deal with Canada\nNot only do the everything off and he did this I'll tell you that one last thing that I I'm getting tired of women have now sixty five of us what they're saying all week I have done nothing to
