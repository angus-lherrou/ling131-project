{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "Do that again you guys can make contacts for for financing for someone who's well lately\nWe've got a probably twelve financial institutions that we use from the big huge guys at a U.S banks that are nationwide to\nDealing with a or a good friend ... people's federal credit\nUnions in wonderful lady yeah so I mean if you want to keep everything local we don't have a problem with that and you could do we we don't deal with West Virginia federal\nPeople's we've we deal with a lot of a local credit union so on a year you know yeah it's easy you know those guys drought right out of your check yeah right yeah so it's easy easy financing norm\nBut we can take care of all that for you don't have\nTo go to your credit union and take care of that the sales guy or finance guy can shoot that over to him\nYou know with a with a deal and her name is ... and they know exactly what you're getting in a you know we take care of that we take her in the insurance and your insurance guy that's the one thing that uh\nThat sometimes people forget they're like oh gosh how you how much is a singer so right you know\nWhat if it's more than what is it two hundred fifty three hundred dollars a year you're paying William lady the other day on the twenty five foot prima forty dollars a year wow I don't know who she is with that I Lived with my\nYeah man that's that's a pretty good rate a pretty good rate for that is no doubt I found it fascinating there's just so many different routes you can go about doing like this we did touch on the financing do so I Do want to make sure that folks understand maybe they are looking to get into the market for the first time a terms on financing generally as far as linked goes I interest rate is determined by the person but as far as the length of\nOf uh of terms of financing what typically are you seeing as like seven ten what what how many years are usually put on one of these\nYeah most people right now we're we're probably see in between a seven to ten years when you say Jim and you know it was gonna guess I mean they can go to ah we do have the gas to want to go thirty\nSix months and that is a that's the minimum you can't go don't have anybody that will uh do less than thirty six\nUh but you can go all the way out to a hundred and forty four months\nOn most units are probably twenty\nEight and under that you get up into these thirty forty fifty ah we've got this wheels or Seventy grand jury and drag goes out Fifteen Years\nI was wondering I mean that's basically I bought a house at that point so yeah that's the as far as the investment go but it's great to the terms are over that long time 'cause just like people will buy a vacation home and they have a mortgage on a vacation home that they're paying off and in Fifteen Years or whatever it is\nThis is like your vacation homes have your vacation and wherever you go you don't have to worry about just being in Myrtle Beach or just being in the Hilton Head or wherever it might be\nRight well the the terms I'm definitely help out with a Jimmy will tell you that ... a lot of people will come in with a payment in ... you know they don't have a ... mile ride on a payment and mine\nSo if they hit Jimmy and say you know what man I Want to be around to fifty gives him an idea for a lot of what unit you can afford but it also with with qualifying credit I mean you can extend it out a little more like you know what\nI think I'll go ahead and go ten years um\nThe fifties where I Want to be I can afford\nA little more than that so and you can pay down we don't have any of the banks that are that are ah jamming you own interest anymore all of them are very it's all samples\nYeah right right but I don't know that I'm back in the day it wasn't as prevalent\nBut I think Jimmy you're seeing a lot more of that where people probably the millennial thing they've got maybe they're more apt to say this is what I can afford right I Want to go\nHere here in here right so you seven guys say hey I Want two hundred a month I Want to fifty among fifty a month\nAnd the big thing is don't be so hard and concern about the rate I mean the by downright between I think zero and same since four hundred dollars right you know it was a term loan but\nFind what you will see how much it calls and then give us an opportunity to get to your pain right\nAnd that's it and you really have to be going to open minded about those kinds of things because if you come in with only one direction in mind and that really unlimited your options you have to keep your options on the table and see exactly what you have you got to walk them through you know the process so they can make a decision that based on fat\nAnd ah and ah it it's an important investment there's no doubt about it but you have to use the professional use the resources at your disposal and you guys are the resources part of the resources that are available there\nI think the one thing that that that we have the hardest part with is a is a carpet sure isn't the people anybody anybody can get a car\nAll zero percent right right so they try to make it at all you know just one that's we're not car business people right right right I mean yeah you're buying a toy the amendments yeah not\nBy a essential things on your ... and sometimes the rights are a little higher\nThe investments a lot different that that's a lot of great information that we've had this morning once again so I haven't been here for that camping center and Jimmy Dean from sales
