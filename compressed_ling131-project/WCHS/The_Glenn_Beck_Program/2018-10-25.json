{"month": "10", "state": "WV", "station": "WCHS", "content": "I went to the western Supreme Court and we got what was called the pan of Pentagon decision\nIn which our court said well over and above the federal constitution there is a state constitutional right to free choice by women and if it is a state constitutional right it can't be\nOr taken away based upon one's economic status that's a doll due process and equal protection and therefore\nYou know if the state constitution ensures the right to an abortion than the state cannot limit that right based only on economic status\nAny more than you can say you can put somebody in jail just because they can't push the button right and that's been the law gosh I guess since back in the Knight Nineteen Ninety three yeah and it's you know of course it's obviously costs folks to chafe a ship public funding a taxpayer dollars and these are federal dollars because the Hyde amendment\nFederal law prohibits the use of federal dollars to fund abortion services anywhere so these are state tax dollars that are used I don't have really separate that there's probably a financial fiction but they are separated and last year I think there were about Thirteen hundred termination\nProcedures performed in West Virginia and they were funded public funding so this amendment is offered and let me just read what it says um\nThe the language of the amendment says nothing in this constitution secure wars or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion now they're ... they're in lies the rub proponents of this amendment\nPersist and saying this only protects West Virginia citizens from having their tax dollars\nSpent on abortion services for indigent women\nBut that's not all of it says it says it doesn't secure protect the right\nOr right or in the\nThis junk so there's two separate things now what does that mean a\nOpponents say well that means that West Virginia will go back to the days of criminalizing abortion and it will\nIt will ah subject ah\nFolks to the law's been now been declared unconstitutional and get a prison\n\nThere really isn't I don't think\nThere is no bright line on this I mean you either\nOpposed to abortion pregnancy termination under any circumstances where you're not and if you are opposed for whatever reason and folks have perfectly valid reasons in their heart and their minds to be a boats\nThen you're going to vote\nFor the amendment right I think the confusion is for the amendment is against abortion services\nAgainst the amendment is for\nA yes abortion says so that's the ... that says if you are on the island logical a side of the debate which says no roe versus Wade was wrong under no circumstances should\nA pregnancy be terminated either rape or incest life with the mother whatever the legislature says in the future goes there for this\nIf you say well I'm not sure there's nothing black and white and hear their shades of gray a then you're probably against it you know if the if it had been written strictly on and tell you from my perspective had been written strictly on the grounds of\nNo funding out of it no problem but he for this\nAnd it's expensive major on a day of it I mean I don't know I don't look like most Democrats do because I personally am would consider myself more than mildly pro choice for any number of reasons are pro pro life I'm Sorry for a number of reasons but I think the fact that\nYou know there's an overstatement on the side of the opponents because this is not going to immediately criminalize abortion services roe versus Wade is still the law the way and then\nAnd there are arguments based on if that is\nIf roe v Wade is overturned it if the west Virginia legislature is compose at some future date of of lawmakers who want to further restrict abortion services and if that law passes and if it's signed by the governor David overcomes\nOr if not vetoed by the governor and if a lot of things and they have what's written still passes constitutional muster then we'll get back to the old days while he is in there that are treated about positives by opponents\nCould be looked at Harvey almost like\nA trial when the defense that can you know tries to create reasonable doubt write I say almost confused the issue in a way in well right ... and an art\nIn support of what the opponents of this amendment say it is true that is the point was to reverse the pan of pinto holding as far as requiring taxpayers that they have their taxpayer dollars used for a procedure that they have\nWell founded deeply held and legitimate objections if that was it then why isn't that just is why does it mirror or an\nAmendment it's also being offered in Alabama within a language is obviously a part of an effort to interject ambiguity into its meaning\nSays the legislation will be more free to act\nAssuming the main thing is the thing I remember\nWhen you run the legislatures fine to pass these laws are not always going to be the majority for\nHarvey the paint law for ... yeah the law firm dot com that's the way to get a hold of or stop by for not having one eight one for

the homeless issue last week and wanting to see a couple of things but that real quick\nIt's sort of a misnomer um\nIt's used as a catchall really for four separate issues that have homelessness just as a common characteristics in the first one is those folks that just you know lost their jobs lost their house or whatever they're just they're ready to be productive they just need to get back on her feet and that's really a small percentage of the homeless\nVery small ... you're right very small you know\nThe second group is that there are also financially depleted but that's due to addiction gambling alcohol drugs or whatever they can actually be productive at the root cause is debated\nAnd again that's a minority group that is the third group is those just what prefer to Napa under the stars in prefer a transient lifestyle I talked to sociologist Charleston she said she found out I think some of these folks in a couple of days later she couldn't find them they're back in the streets I just said they couldn't live within walls and that's\nYou know again a small percentage of the issue in the fourth group is really\nThe mental health issues and you know that you've talked about it you've seen that film they're released did you see it\nWasn't as good at talking to hire originally um yeah it's really good\nYou know I called up hearing checked on lend more I called up there and check you know the blackout oh I ...\nOn him I'm going to call back and check on him he's the one guy that he concerns me so much and um but you can't continue to do\nWhat we're doing here and you can either do that or you could you you but you can't draw can't grow with people laying all over the place that it won't it won't it won't happen to him\nRight that the the uh the old days or the harmless homeless you know those guys I mean there's no problem but now it's it's to criminal um Baker instead yeah ... so that fourth group is really the biggest group mental health issues and they can exhibit behavior so those other three groups and again if you get to the root cause\nControls her medication and counseling whatever\nThe homeless issue can be solved it across those four groups but you got four different root causes it to\nI think even if you I think as articulated it very well\nYes setting up a poor to John or giving them you know blanket while they're sleeping on a bench really only temporarily shoes symptom illness it's worse than writes charitable actions don't address the root cause and don't cure the problem it can even give a false sense of betterment\nThank you
