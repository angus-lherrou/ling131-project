going to produce much higher gas prices\nBecause of a fight we're going to get him of Saudi Arabia and the question is I I don't I have no idea but the futures were way down the market and stuff like that I really have another bad day now they've gone up it's going to open up with a positive and it's going to open up positively\nWell often bad news internationally is good news for the market I mean you know and the one hand you don't want to have some sort of OPEC situation like we had back in the seventies but on the other about production primarily but on the other hand if oil prices go up that typically hurts the consumer and helps them are in the market doesn't always work out for consumers you know\nYeah ... came up to my house and watched a video with me on Saturday well yeah and I wanted to get people to I'm going to plug it and try to even get people listen to it if you have Amazon Prime Showtime right you have to have Showtime ... on Amazon Prime I got it for the um\nI don't know the Mayweather fight\nOh yeah I never had shut down and ... may was run by and uh so I I'm\nA then I kept it and I guess that's a Showtime trap ship that right uh we were able to watch and I want you people listen to me now it's called disgraced yes and it's a on Amazon Showtime and I guess the thing will wind up on Netflix someday is\nLike yeah usually they end up on not Netflix streaming but that leads to end up on the good old little red envelopes you know this\nI'm telling you now this is about Baylor basketball team two thousand three coach bliss right who is a sociopath well he's certainly a deceptive person yeah and uh that you're being cut from very kind yeah now the assistant coach\nUm is I don't know his name is first name is like a Mars and just like ... or something he had to be a ... he happened to be a black guy he was the chemicals in the whole thing he has he he was the good guy and the thing and ah this this coach took a basketball player pay for a scholarship Adams checking account\nLot about it and\nAnd he wanted to and he still engaged in a cover up to try to frame this guy having trays of doping that a darn\nGuy and suddenly the dead guy yelled and and you know we're not giving away anything here but uh\nUh you know it's it's really a good documentary is set up a little like a mystery a it's it's it's not dry in the least that that it's a galloping speed the way they uh unfold the story a lot of people here documentary and they got to change the channels but not this one you know really quite interesting ... drama and it's very important to hear this stuff\nAnd I like for you folks that have Amazon Prime showdown or know somebody do pleased Washington is ... because I think you'll I think you really like it\nAlso took a moment to try to get a ... a a little bit and demanding a man and the high castle\nMen in the ... about what would happen what would have happened if the Nazis in Japanese won the world war two right and took over our country\nRight I'm not going to say exactly how they want to because that'll come up later for anybody watching it but it starts it's pretty scary the way it starts just as you're watching what seems to be a pretty\nPuff piece about quality of life in the United states and then within the first minute this comes so I'm not giving anything away but then they show the flag and you see the stripes and the flag and then as the blue she is with the flag unfolds instead of the stars there is a swastika and it hits you right between the eyes you know and then from there it gets interesting\nVery interesting I have seen it promoted on Amazon Prime for so much in a series of what I've watched a bunch of series on Amazon and liked him like a lot of them in on Netflix and I just didn't know if I wanted to get in another one but it was very good and the acting was good\nAnd they're really good and Bosh of courses on Amazon as on a prime the end or at least company worth watching\nNetflix is spending on new material yes eight billion or yeah\nThey spend more than just about all the networks combined or something crazy it's amazing what they're spending you know I started watching Bosh on Amazon Prime I was reading Rick still hammers column I read it every week it's a good column it's usually funny and uh but this one was a little harder because he had a heart attack and he was he was a death's door\nAnd as he's thinking about what all he's going to not be able to complete in life one of the things he said was and I'll never see what happened in Bosch of wanting to have turned out and I thought if a guy on his death thinking he's on his deathbed he turned out to be fine and rex doing well\nBut if he's on his deathbed and one of the things he thinks is I don't know what happened in the series that's a series we're starting in watching I decided he was right it's fantastic\n[noise] um I watched the first season I didn't watch any of that law furry yes well there's a nominee and they want to comment and then we'll break go ahead\nWell I think that the jury did an extraordinarily good job they clearly spent the time took the time and and and looked individually charge at a time and that's why out of twenty two counts they found him guilty on eleven they could not come to a decision on one and found him not guilty on ten\nOr a justice lotteries attorney I'm a Mr Carr made a really strong case about reasonable doubt and and I think that on some of those trips that the\nThe U.S government decided we're improper and which I personally believe or improper but there's a reasonable doubt on some of those and they found him not guilty on those ones that were clear the days that were Thanksgiving and a couple of Philips and\nThings like that uh that just didn't have any reasonable doubt that they clearly were not anything more than personal they found that but on the bigger counts the ones that were the\nThe bigger sexier aghast counts the witness tampering with Kim Alice uh once again want to say is the true hero of this whole store I I'm an honest to God whistle blower and um and on the council of lying to federal uh officers\nThe FBI and the U.S attorney they found him guilty and um\nHe initiated and yes when he went down there and try to marry you write\nThat seems to be when it happened he went down and said

teachers public employees have a decrease in salary and insurance innocent senator Manchin was in the capital with Joe Manchin is improving the lives we are we teaching we're learning new jobs scale he's thinking of the future of this great state of West Virginia\nPatrick Morrisey had a different response to the teachers strike here's elementary school teacher me my bill later\nMorsi has written to lock us all up he was focusing more on putting us in jail and less on the tree problems across the state\nMorsi doesn't respect public education he doesn't respect West Virginia in my opinion I don't think he really cares for US Senator Manchin just showed us sent he want what's best for West Virginia\nI'm your manager for the United States Senate and I approved this message paid for by Joe Manchin for West Virginia\nJudge Dan Vere grew up in ... he shares our values judge gr brings honesty integrity and hard work to the judge we're dedicated his life to the people in all county as an

I mean even though his depressed told me that car did a very effective job I think that bothers me more than bothers you\nLook I expected it from him I expected no less from al offer you a lot for his always blamed everyone else or anything he ever did wrong um he's never taken responsibility for his on\nHis own problems um and it doesn't surprise me that he would have said as attorney that doesn't surprise me the ... the attorney had nothing to work with let's face it he had to do with anything you can grab\nOne of my favorite points American cars are very smart man ... went to the air force academy he went to Harvard He was a jaguar your immune to know I'm not really something no I'm not going to put him down but I Do have to laugh about one thing he said because I heard about this\nAnd his are closing remarks of course they tried to portray the casket over death is just old pieces of crap furniture\nAnd uh you know you know it's funny antiques sometimes are just you and that's how I antique dealers makes so much money or somebody tosses it into a flea market or tosses it at a goodwill or something and the and the bigger picks it up everybody watches pickers knows about this\nAnd they get it for a song when they thought it was an old ugly piece of furniture when in fact it has great value but with car said that was so funny was he said if these these are casts Gilbert deaths are worth so much why are they just put in storage\n[laughter] I mean the greatest art on earth is in storage a lot of the time the field museum in Chicago at a very good friend who is director of exhibitions up there\nNine tenths of their collection is in warehouses they don't have enough room in the museum to show that's why they're always do on these shows everywhere else with their stuff yes great art is in storage\nIt's not something that's unusual if you don't have anybody wants to use one of those deaths than you would store it but I think that you know it was the arrogance and his denial I guess it's to the core of his\nBeing I think is that coach list of ... yeah he I mean really what we're\nClearly psychotic but a psychotic than iron but uh\n[noise] I don't know he seems to than offer usually in this process there some deal making going on I have to believe though I don't know the details that there must have been some sort of offer\nOf a plea deal somewhere along this line and he must have said no and I can't imagine why because he put the state through a lot of pain the feds through a lot of money a lot of money to try one of these cases and that he knew the whole time that he was not telling the truth\nUh I Know a lot of those trees I don't know all of them I don't know much about his car taking except that it was you know what I was thinking of all the time\nHe's the guy that wrote the book yes he he's not he's not able to be guilty for us it's denial it is it is and it's luck I always have to qualify when I say\nI'm not a lawyer write me that I'm no lawyers and I've I've studied criminal cases and and read about 'em and I know lawyers that you know that that explains stuff to me is the worst kind of defend a tab is one that's just in denial\nAnsar al offer denials a river in Egypt and I'll tell you I'll tell you who could have gotten less time if he hadn't been in denial\nWith Jeffrey Skilling or from Enron as he didn't he got twenty some years to beginning then he got a lower ... he got lowered to uh fourteen or ... or something and he was a heat to this day he thinks he's in his right I mean and\nAnd he had a he had Daniel Patrick Kelley\nHis lawyer you know the the OJ Simpson lawyer yes right and So Daniel Patrick Shelley he hired him and he says look I've never done in a criminal case he said well good I'm not a criminal right additives are so that if you have\nTo you have to be able to grasp the reality of what's going on around you and maybe to you and the fact that you're culpable\nIn something and you have an I guarantee a car with then very effective in negotiating a deal for the guy and and uh I have lawyers that I Know lawyers that make a living doing that\nKind of sure well I I when I took my several walks through our prisons because Iran the jails and prisons but I Would go to the prisons because the regional jealous already the bond holders of the reasons on their own most of the prisons in West Virginia\nAnd so I Would go through the presence of doing inspections and walk through and I talked to the inmates and and it was interesting uh when you'd ask what are you here for\nThey would never say I committed blank they would say I was found guilty of committing like and they would use it said but you know that was all wrong I didn't do it I didn't do it I didn't do it the prisons filled with people who said I didn't do it and I guess that'll be a they'll have another person and injustice lottery he'll be saying I didn't do it\nWell you remember in I guess we'll be able to see all shank yeah when I'm right\nTim Robbins told Morgan Freeman you said but I I didn't kill him he said more than ... said you're going to fit right in [laughter] nobody did anything about it

Marines gas served in the legislature where they might\nWell you know I hear your point is er and I think that what you're saying is interesting if they don't go back and impeach anybody that they say okay the courts thought our hands we can't do anything\nThan the irony of all this is that it could be that's the only person that has any black mark out of this is the letter a center that went in to justice Walker which is kind of ironic given that\nMost women a lot I think it's kind of unfair and don't get me wrong she wasn't candy you and now and that bothers me and it always is\nOften aren't fair he and I am so yeah we're on saying it was\n\n[laughter] I guess she's got to go find a golf pro someplace 'cause it doesn't happen one thing that's clear as she can have an appeal from the legislative decision even the court's first syllabus point is there is no appeal after", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "15"}
