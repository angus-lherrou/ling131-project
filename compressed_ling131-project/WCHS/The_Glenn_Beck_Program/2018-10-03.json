sure how much you wanted to be there yeah I um [noise] he's not a prosecutor is right or he didn't he he he had a case and he was an advocate for the rest of us that's right and and had to question the lunches and I heard a lot about that I didn't get to watch all of it on I'll watch a lot of it\nAnd\nAnd I thought that um\nI don't think just the bad guy that's what I'm trying to say he was just trying to he was just doing his job here and um I don't I just never felt like you took any great pleasure and being\nBut that's my I think that's right now when when did when did the deal falls apart it well how did ... did you know before that when it happened that they were going to rule that\nAre no we we went in on the eleventh a with a with a censure resolution uh for for justice Walker and justice workman and uh it was presented to the Senate and they broke for recess in private ah and and discussed it amongst themselves privately and\nThey came back in and uh and voted it down a road it out of order is the technical way they handled it\nUm and it was over at that point it which is very clear to us that there were going to be trials and and to be to be quite honest I think that what the senators felt I Can't speak for them you'd have to ask them but I think what they felt as they wanted to know a little bit about the facts I mean the impression that I got is the senators to their credit\nTried not to closely monitor the house proceedings so you know the way this works in the constitution is the house led by House Judiciary just like in the federal system develops articles of impeachment they had hearings there were hours and hours of testimony there's transcripts their exhibits posted on line\nI think the senator sort of took a step back from that and they didn't try to follow what was going on over in the house so that the the issue is that when you got over to the Senate then\nThey didn't know the facts they didn't know what had really happened why shouldn't they make a deal about a case in Illinois and they don't they didn't get presented to that's right and and I heard senator Craig Blair on the radio yesterday saying look I've never heard of a plea deal that's cut with a jury and he's right now it is sort of a hybrid system they're kind of accordion the jury\nBut uh I think what they needed and what they wanted was didn't learn a little bit something more about what happened here and that was our mission going in we're going to tell you\nWe can explain to you clearly and quickly what happened here with respect to best Walker and what you'll see and I and I think what they heard from Beth herself as some contrition but also a defense of her conduct in office and that conduct in office wasn't anything close to what would warrant her removal from office\nYes penalty that's right yeah that's what I'm that's what I've always it is that what it is that the death penalty for a for a person that's in public life and and as a lawyer and gets elected to the Supreme Court\nAnd um I was for the deal mhm and then once the case was in and I was glad they presented it I mean I was glad you you were able to see it\nI have it is important I think it's important for people to hear from Beth Walker um as as you mentioned at the outset as and when we first came on the air this morning\nPeople just need to I think see what she had to say for herself see who she is judge for themselves I think I think people saw that I think it was important um she's good person she's a good judge she's tried to reform things um she will be a good judge for the rest of her time in office\nI have a bias I'm\nWith Steve ... okay so people to listen to me know that we discussed it yesterday I tried to be open about my biases are right and and one of my lizard may become nose to the ... about it yesterday and I was called on it so I ask you two questions okay\nYou asked why didn't the first thing what his name as to be bought up\nWhy did why did you ask her why she ... what what what they have to do with anything will because a lot of what\nWas that issue in the article of impeachment against Beth Mr Mayor was administrative policies and procedures that was really the entirety of the article of impeachment\nThe problem is the court is a big institution or that's made a very important analogy I think that that's really apt in her testimony where she said look the justices the five justices on our Supreme Court or like the board of directors\nOf a of a corporation really like a private small family corporation\nThe chief justice is like the c._e._o. the chief executive officer in the administrative director is like the C O the chief operating officer the ministry of director makes a lot of the nuts and bolts of the way the statewide judicial system works that that that person's job\nAnd I I think it was unfortunate but given how much of the articles and how much the house managers case focused on those administrative procedures that we didn't really hear from any administration personnel we're from one accounting firm the court and that was really it\nUh we didn't hear from the people who actually handle the office renovations handled policies and procedures handle payments handled tax issues we just didn't hear from okay All right\nBut she said the number you gave her answers I don't remember him one the first one she had to choose\nTo justice has wanted him gone right to didn't I I've been in that situation she was the third vote she chose workman and a lot of free I get I get that so she got rid of Steve that in he's willing pleasure and he knew it and um\nBut then she said because of the spending since they only cross for two days\nI mean wasn't the spending that she found about out about\nAfter the fact\nCertainly and I asked her to just to clarify that I asked you know what happened when you voted to remove him and justice Walker indicated while I I you know I I was new so I was relying on my colleagues she was relying on what just as workman justice Lafayette were telling her\nBut then I asked her to clarify okay based on everything that's come out and you have to understand Mr Mayor there's been back and forth with a legislative auditor there's been documents produced in the impeachment that there's been a lot of development of these facts since that time I asked her Justin and her opinion what she felt ... based on what she knows today as we sit here today\nAnd I I didn't hear the question that way but I accept your your yeah they're All right then you bought and I didn't hear this you bought his name up in the final argument that's right\nAnd and just to be fair I brought up the names of both the ministry of directors\nActually ever I've read the names of all three of ministry of directors because the current minister of directors or around before that it was judge Gary Johnson before that Steve Canterbury and and it was it was simply just to say you didn't hear from those folks\nNewer and I also mentioned this Mr Mayor nor did the house managers present the testimony of a single chief justice if you go back to my analogy the chief justice is like the c._e._o. that we've never chief justice they blocked her\nHer colleagues blocked her they're all from being in chief justice but they're all in the duck I mean they're all they're all going to be they're all going to be on trial there yeah All right All right so All right but just and once again I have about a scenario open about it um he he was not under something\nYou know you didn't beat him in and made it a shot right but it was their case to prove it wasn't our understand I understand and he may testify I mean I'll tell you Mr Marilyn my understanding is that he's not going to be testifying in the law for case and the federal trial\nThat understanding to have stayed has knows he has no subpoena against him he has no subpoena out there I think he would come forward um and um\nAnd just I'll just say much mayor me as as Mike his I'm not not necessarily the best waters lord but just as a lawyer who who like you followed these proceedings in these cases around I just think it's it's sort of unusual I I don't think at the outset of this\nUh Mr Canterbury testified for hours and hours in house issue I don't think at the outset of this folks would have thought at the end of the day when it came to the main event that he wouldn't be a witness I think people expected him to testify and it sounds like he's not going to [noise]\nWell that's not his choice I understand I wanted to do in my listeners and I'm not saying he's I mean he's retired he lives in the country I'm not saying you've done deceptive out his contact with civilization you're looking at it so All right I have one more question I'm going to ask and congratulations to my cousin who's with me\nAnd he did such a splendid job yesterday I'm In the last few days with best Walker and she's going to return to the bench is Twenty one past the hour we'll break we'll be back on five ...\n... ... bank is celebrating one hundred and ten years in\nAnd ten years [noise] a lot of things in the

Bram making friends\nOne deal at a time\nTwenty seven or the hour on five eighty live\nCheap Cooper are good morning how are you sir I'm doing fine how are you I'm doing okay\nWhat's um you have a person out there that is preying on the elderly\nYep uh Willis Cargill are you ... we have a warrant for him he wanted and capital county Bluefield West Virginia Bluefield, Virginia\nAnd a total of about six agencies he's been a one man crime spree against the elderly from Caswell Virginia Huntington West Virginia\nSo we are uh we've been through it on a man out for Mr Carville and uh he ... are charred stemmed from an incident that happened about a week and a half ago he's manipulating his way into the homes of elderly women especially\nA passing himself off as a utility worker or when that doesn't work it's gotten to the point where he has for school entering the whole uh\nShoving the or Ninety year old victim into a closet a bending or arm and this happened in Virginia just a couple of days ago\nSo we're we really want to get this guy before he really hurts someone and uh his picture I should have been set to West Virginia metro news so maybe someone could put that up\nA burglary a credit card fraud a home invasion and you know we've got a thirty non page wraps\nAnd uh we dealt with him about ten years ago when a similar case and sent him to prison happening can also you can uh so he's back out he's also registered sex offender\nAnd this guy's just a bad guy there's just no two ways about it when you look at this all these felony conviction starting on page wrap sheet and he's targeting the elderly so we are looking high and low for him\n[noise] um\nDo you can you tell that story about him in the city the eighty eight year one\nYes ah without getting her name or address he he moved the neighbors are I've I've gone and spoken to the neighbors\nIn that block and the surrounding areas to show them his picture warn them or he'll come to the door and he what he did his he knocked on the door the victim answered and he said that he was with\nUm ah the water company and he needed to check her toilet because there was a serious problem with the sewer lines area so\nShe left him and he goes up the mess was around ... in our restroom comes back down she realizes he's taken her purse and wallet and use our credit card from here to Huntington\nOr we're just fortunate that she was an injured or there was she was in her late eighties or the victim from a Tesla Virginia is Ninety One years old [noise] one lady in capital county was approached by him after after decorating the grave of her late husband and he scanned her out of her purse\nAnd this was a very large intimidating man I hate them violent toward police he was violent toward us or in two thousand nine two thousand ten when we had the case back then\nAnd so we do urge people to to take a look at him and use caution if you see him called ... and ... we're looking hot we're searching high and low for Willis call Dale he's forty nine years old and he has been a one man crime spree against the elderly or from has well Virginia the Huntington West Virginia\nAnd we have his picture I mean I Know you've tested it to me but do we have it down here ...\nThey do a a there is the detector bureau emailed a picture of him and the vehicle that he's driving so as soon as we can get that on the website better I just want people to be safe and Rick he's recognizable if you say because he's such a hulking figuring he's got a very pretty distinct\nAh look about his face or just get a look at this guy and uh hopefully we'll have him in custody so we're looking now been searching for several days either banded where he was staying in another county uh with the work with the state police very closely Bluefield pd\nUm capital county sheriff's department of law enforcement all across the region are working together on this but we need to get him in custody because I don't think he's going to stop\nAll right All right well um I think will be able to get that picture of it that much trouble see thank you very much value I alright twenty\nTwo before the hour lines are open to Rio for three four five fifty eight fifty eight um\nI didn't uh markers from being on the show [laughter] he just uh\nI think he's working today and he texted me and you know helped me now in contact with me when I'm On the air so he told me he wasn't going to um be able to call in today of course he's upset about what happened in um in court yesterday and um\nAnd so anyway governor justice had a press conference yesterday\nAnd he talked about putting a hundred million dollars towards ... and plus getting another five percent raised to all state employees know schoolteachers good morning Jeff doing good morning mayor how are you sir why are the union so\nI don't get it I I don't I thought they caught a politic\nA little stunts political stump because it comes five weeks before the election and\nDavid Hany told me that uh he's the executive director of the W. B. E. A. dailies on available this week but he said you know we for promises before and we kind of just a basic they don't believe the governor and that's what it comes down to they think he's just he just made this announcement or\nJust to to try to help Republicans\nAnd if the if you in and I did you know we staff the news conference and I listen to the whole thing yesterday and the governor does it was a pretty partisan news conference I mean announcement wasn't much of a news conference but a pretty partisan\nNot where he talked about Republicans and and and also\nI think the teachers groups got upset because [noise] and I'm not trying to speak for the governor at all but the governor said\nYou know we\nDon't need these rah rah rah people\nUp there you know rallying with the teachers you know when we were getting things done and I think he was based in later he referred to data so I think basically I don't think now I'm again I'm not\nTrying to read into it he didn't mention that teachers specifically some of the unions people think that he was criticizing the teachers for rallying\nI don't think that's what he meant but\nAgain I'm not speaking for him I think he was meaning more of a Jetta caused later he did criticize Jetta by name saying that he was out there running with the teachers but what is really what his you'll get it done the governor said so it was a very partisan type of announcement but within that was this pretty significant pledge\nOr that might even call them caught some lawmakers off guard to mayor quite honestly at ... that were selling them up there with him he pledges one hundred million dollars to PE I a says we don't need it right now they had a good year last year we're going to come up with a permanent fix this is just an additional ... one hundred million dollars that they can use\nGoing forward this is not the total answer but it's something they can use and a five percent pay increase for teachers and all state workers\nWhich again is a is a pretty significant a\nPretty significant promise from the governor\nDid um you\nI mean it's a pay raise of that amount of money yeah for all these workers and a hundred million dollars for I mean that's\nHundreds of millions of dollars and this hundreds of millions of dollars into base and there is no revenue\nI mean I mean I mean I mean I'm sure there's new revenue but it's not coming from anything passed any tax or anything like that he and\nHe mentioned that there'll be no taxes\nWere doing this without raising any taxes\nSo in two years that's all these employees will get ten percent\nRather getting five percent and the current budget right to start in July and then another five and they'll get another five percent starting next July if it if it gets through that's where the outcomes I guess from and I asked David hanging yeah we had a good conversation I said\nYou know would you like five percent you know you weren't turned out five percent and he's absolutely not but he said they were just we've been promised things before he said and people have\nJust done publicly ... yeah and it was done at a news conference and it was called for that reason that\nA ... and you know for me as somebody else to\nPut about just together for government I just don't know where the money's going to come from and then in if if this was all true\nI'm what I don't understand um um\nThis has got to be paid now every year in other words\n... ten percent of what a person was making last year if they were making forty thousand\nThey're going to get a forty four hundred dollar raise over two year period that's a whole lot of money not for one person but when you when the multiplier effect kicks in for all these different employees or a no", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Charleston", "day": "03"}
