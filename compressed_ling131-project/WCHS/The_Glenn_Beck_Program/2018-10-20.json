know but something was missing in my life I didn't really care about ... searching for a goal they didn't care about money I needed something bigger and better to do\nSo I kind of the mid west decided I'm going to be a ski patrol where\nInes on this narrowly ski mountain not knowing anything really about avalanches and when I was in ski patrol school I learned an avalanche that happened across the street and the ski resort they buried for toddlers I'm Sorry three toddlers there for four and six years old\nAnd the local avalanche dog deployed to the scene but failed to find the children\nWhen when I kept asking them well wait a minute\nIsn't that the dogs only job is to find humans how come the dog failed answer I got wasn't good enough and that night when I was walking in a snowstorm I decided I Wonder if I could train a dog save a life and I about to never leave anyone behind\nSo what was the reason that they gave you a wide search and rescue dogs wouldn't work so well in snow\nWell and they had a trained avalanche that I don't know I mean to this day okay to the scene was complicated there was a lot of people and seen but I Know the answer I got wasn't good enough and I don't know if they could answer it maybe they didn't train enough maybe they weren't really as good as they thought they were and I don't\nKnow even to this day because I had to let that go but I said I Will never let that happen on my watch and I set out to train the best possible search dog and\nIn our career than even though I didn't know even how to take care of a house plant let alone a puppy and I was commuting back and forth we you know turned out to be one of the top teams in Colorado to call in the\nExtreme and buy or mental condition because we were really good at what we

reality of it all ... teams don't make live finds that often we did I write about it but we end up really finding victims who've perished and so my work went from\nLie find to cadavers and you know we were able to find on\nKnow in the snow under the water lost in the woods victims of crime and that's kind of our career path we took over ten years\nOkay so it wasn't just avalanches it was all over the place wasn't it\nYeah I worked year round you know water missions I had several of those kids left in the woods avalanches and victims of crime\nCan you tell us what the um rescues that were meant
