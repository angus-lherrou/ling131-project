do you don't get on the stand in line and\n... if you're a criminal defending the case now you're a smart young men Chris so\nI don't know if you've ever had anything to do with criminal law but if you get in front of a judge in in your line and they know you're lying you've just enhanced your problems the best thing to do is let your lawyer tried a wing it and he had a good lawyer or the the the media that was in there\nThat the I was outside the courthouse bird dog and the media and they were all telling me that what's his name car was that his name ... he did they said he did a great

I'm going to come out somewhere around twenty cents and uh he's going to have to do exactly zero days in jail because he's a very important\nFor you Chris you're ... you're too smart to be thinking like that\nActually ... I think my intelligence was what's leading me to uh to this particular conclusion a ... court justices are allowed to blow any amount of money they want on roads while the people West Virginia suffer and there are no ...\nWell I bet now I could uh\nBut that this goes beyond ... spending too much money on drugs or this is um\nHe was a tampering witness tampering you know what a federal judge look like that they looked at a ... a guy that would would do and it's on tape of police Chris you're looking at three two and two on this that's where I get my number three two and two and I I just\nI just want to know are they going to set up a courtroom and cell block six\nNo they're not and that all freaking here all his case he\nHe's willing to non pay to dance for that that little bit further hey now offer there in ... a judge moment rally up so that one for go ahead go ahead Chris\nRushdie I got a question for you we're killing one finds the budget for the west Virginia judiciary\nWill uh or ...\nAh I could I think it's a line item ... now a lot like everyone else is\nIt's one line item in the uh West Virginia budget and it's just one big lump so right now that\nThe executive releases a budget for what he stands here's one line item\nAll that's what this amendment one is about ... to maybe you you you voted right oh yeah I Am an avid yesterday after when we get closer to the election we can we do some handicapping\nSure yeah it'd be happy to do that with you\nDid a I told you how did it I think that I listen to that started the bottom what's ... what's the helicopter\nGather one wants to run the helicopters off the roof of down he's a three percent or and then you pick the second person whoever it is and let's not let's not get a names or anything like that if yours is a my candidate in what was his percentage be and then you the you're left with the top number\nI mean I can do this one for you today if you want me to\nAll right let's but listen All right so where are you going to start at the bottom give me your number\nA helicopter guy gets one point\nOne point and voice the second part of that you are\nEven people that why can't you know this election is too important to throw your vote away on a third party candidate\nOkay All right so he gets one point so then I I Would assume you'd think the Democrats going to win so what do you think the Republican candidate or get\nA forty four points\nSo then it's forty four and one and then so your candidate gets fifty five\nFifty five and that's my same call on the a Senate race\nA United States Senate yeah I think that\nYou might get one percent and an independent candidate a about a forty four for the a Republican and a a jerk guy\nTexan homeless fifty five well let me tell you I or should always outperform spoiling always look what happened in the ... they said oh goodness it's close\nWhen mentioned I it wasn't close so did the wait a minute though Chris loaded uh\nSo did a Patrick in the last race against uh what's the guy's name that into the paper and Reynolds he was a ... the race was closed and Patrick one about ten points but ... ... let me put\nLet me let me put this together and um I did I didn't live there and listening or who listen to this show when they listen but I I was asked to get a promise from him he's not going to change parties\nAnd the conversation went on and I'm not going to share that until after the election but I was asked to get that and I got it and he is not going to do that yeah that's that's not right and I\nDidn't figure Joe would switch parties\nYou know he's a Democrat who's going to stay a Democrat and I think what he likes Chris I think he likes is independent\nWell I mean he certainly independent he doesn't listen to his party he doesn't listen to the people of West Virginia age is does what he wants\nTo ...
