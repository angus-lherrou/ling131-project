Ohio or his three counties but he he basically he lives and and where it and so he he serves primarily Hancock\nAnd any further judicial he's in a chair he's the chair of J I say ... and they were the ones that said nobody did anything wrong they're the ones who said that a specific charges a couple of specific charges were\nNot wrong and that's gotten people kind of upset um they said that the meals are not a a a violation of a of the judicial ethics and uh so I think that's why there's controversy with him right now I'm\nBe that as a may that's the court and um they're going to be hearing matters related to this and of course the big question is what if they decide that it is indeed\nA constitutionally prohibited for this to a a\nA happening in the Senate since his removal hearing is is not is not proper for some reasons that have been a and the and the following that was made by justice work and what if they say that and then the Senate says we don't care we don't care if you put a stay on this we're going forward anyway I mean I have no idea I Know that my role is this I got a subpoena\nBy golly you get a subpoena your show up I'll be there at ... am I on Monday and the Senate and if it turns out there's chaos I guess I'll just watch\nSo so you do it so it it Mark Williams was on each day Williams brother right now he's a very good lawyer and\nHe was on um\nHow the show yesterday and he he did the brief\nNow the people doing the trial or Ben Bailey and right there she has two different law groups hired right well he he does to fend for right he represents I mean he does corporate defense work so I mean if any of his farm\nBut I happen to through circumstances I happen to know the um the senior partner that from their out of South Carolina his name is ed ... man he's that's one smart cookie as well so is Mark Mark but um\nIt is interesting to note if they're going if the court say if the court said that the that the Senate doesn't have jurisdiction to impeach a chief justice\nYou have to remember right that the legislature cannot and beach and I can't remove if they say that well I think we've got to a genuine constitutional crisis on our hands and I don't know how it gets resolved you know\nI used to say this a dozen times a day when I was working at the court I'm no lawyer but you know I can read and I will uh I I tell you this this will be very fascinating if they come out with something that tries to prohibit it I'm\nSmart guys smart people or they're wrong in this group\nAnd the five that we want it now so\nI think I'm Out and try to remember this it's ... um this Wilson he lives in ... Moran seem rescue probably served with you\nWreck was ... or the last year no majority leader was majority leader in yeah yeah I Know that ... a good guy sure Rickey is a great guy and I went to elementary school and junior high with her humor I Can't imagine Rick Moran ski\nSaying that the heat he went through the mansion impeachment yeah I don't think he voted for it but a matter of fact I Know he did but I'm a ... a kind of stood out to us because the leadership\nVoted for mostly not Rick he was and he was to make doubt county majority leader ... and but it was his chamber citizen leadership issue which I found interesting but\n... ... Marines he is a good person and I can't imagine him voting to say that the legislature does not have the ability to impeach uh maybe I'm\nBut one one thing she brought up and I think they could focus on this maybe is that the house didn't send over a resolution a bill from too attached to all of these articles it's almost like this\nYou're ... mixed up\nWell it it's never been close to announce come through there\nNow acting through [laughter] ... well the problem is I don't have any control over this no this is I did this date deal I mean but I bought it up and my people heard\nThat I'm at a ... and the thing and um\nAnd they say you've got your ... names mixed up but it doesn't sound I don't know I mean in ...

I guess\nPapers ended up three uh-huh are paying for all this trash\nSo this is in Charleston all African rode out\nLet me tell you what I did about that one and then also I did about blonde you come to me I I have no idea that this will help you or not but what I did was I found\nA somebody that was you know responsible or the public was easy I mean you find out who's turn out the phone book you call them and you go hey by the way the people you hard to turn out the phone books they throw them on to create\nA but the other one was harder to track when I finally found somebody who was in charge of the distribution of those things and I don't this was several years ago and um they at least hired somebody better for our community because it hasn't happened in a while so you probably need and you know I\nI Know I'm no expert on any of this stuff but what you can do is try to get one of those documents in three or something and see if you can find a number of the responsible party just are just call one of those people have been advertising so you know\nIf you want to have good advertisement you don't want to be ended up as litter and you need to let people know we're doing this they're just throwing them into the drawing in the woods in the streets\nWhat he's saying mark work\nThanks how are the mayor can fix it you know mark All right let's go to a let's go to Jerry Jerry\nHey good morning fellas as long as this is trivia day let me throw in trivia um how many state road inspectors do you think we have in the state\nI Am not going to we're going to say how many state road inspectors would take to screw in a light bulb or something you know go ahead I'm any\nWell I don't know what I Do know is we probably have what maybe seven hundred and fifty thousand drivers over a million\nYeah okay so why in the world doesn't the state have a website where people who are the dangerous conditions on the highway whether it be a couch that's falling off of you know somebody's truck on the interstate or or or\nA landslide or a pothole or anything else where they could simply upload a photograph through their smart phone to a website that that apartment of highways would operate so\nThat they could get instant communication from seven hundred and fifty thousand or more inspectors are that that the these things along for the state ever catches them or before there was an accident I mean the state has spent millions and millions of dollars\nWeb sites that half of them don't work because if you click on the links are dead ends\nAnd but this is a very simple thing to do allow the public the taxpayer to report\nConditions instantly to the state and throw a picture up there and send it to them without having to\nFind their phone number and find what you know division you got a call and by the time you get three you know three people down the line they've done a lost her information I mean there would be so simple and I hope somebody's listening that might be able to put this in place\nGerry thank you it's good to hear from you than good idea All right let's go to Ken and\n[noise] Ah yes sir I'm about five thirty this morning I ran a gentleman off the interest of my neighbor's driveway looking up in there and that was\nOne right but what the deal is is I could've called yo but you know the city of Charleston police but ... now

rules of engagement but\nRules of engagement that's [laughter] that's good yeah it's interesting that yeah you do know what\nWhat what I'm getting at is the ... the communication and a partnership between the counting in the city\nI I I see all ... all kinds of things in the news about the city doing this to see the one that that I was seeing nothing with the county and my personal experience with accounting going to the courthouse and waiting on\nCourt things should be done and stuff like that wasn't that great I shouldn't do this little Amish I'm you sit there for three hours before she found out that her trial already been had done and everybody's gall go home and not a bailiff even came out and told us or what ever happened\nYeah and you've hit on several dumb at the legal yeah
