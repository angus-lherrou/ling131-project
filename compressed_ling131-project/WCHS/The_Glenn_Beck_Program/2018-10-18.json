B. got 'em about when he talked about the chemical and I mean every ... every every other way\nIt was that cattle calling everybody knows it was a cattle call now that's a figure of speech he was not calling these people cattle and that was a figure of speech and anybody with any common facts crafts\nKnows that it's a figure of speech and in fact it was a cattle call and boy Amy's Amy peanut gallery really up to it and I thought has his country gone downhill to the point\nThat we can even use an old fashioned euphemism for people lining up to get something and add without you know everybody wants to be offended and boy that that crowd was offended at that but here's an ...

I'm In Charleston it doesn't I mean we're we're not partisan I mean it may be in this term it's been a little partisan and that that doesn't work well for me but I I mean I've done this on and I think uh\nI mean I've had some great city councils and some of the greatest members were Democrat so I'm not I'm not into that kind of stuff I don't know if it's possible to have a\nHave a legislature without being partisan must toss it up that look does that is they're going to be a hundred million dollars go over to the yeah I\nI I think if there there is going to be maybe the governorship put that are in a special ... immediately and do it now almost\nLooked up there and do it right away um as you know with the with a large budget like that brings to grab hold it and when you make big promise to a lot of people I mean that's one seventh of what's your population is all ...\nAnd you make a big problem is that those people maybe you should uh pass that often and make sure we walked up on the up a as other people that Governor justice has money to uh", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "18"}
