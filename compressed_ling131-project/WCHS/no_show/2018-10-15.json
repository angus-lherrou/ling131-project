Virginia that the ... was so in that\nThat it couldn't move the football at all and I say all of that while still giving credit to Iowa State I mean I Wish they did a fantastic job had a great game plan and obviously scout it extremely well knew exactly what West Virginia was going to do and flat took it away from them\nWhy wasn't there anything there's things you can do when people dropped three safety is back when the first game West Virginia's gone against when someone has said you know at West Virginia you're not going deep honest run a drop some safety backed figure something else out they have what happens Saturday Night 'cause it was a complete debacle and the office of science\nAnd during today's big twelve conference call Dana ... was asked where does the blame go\nYeah it's really frustrating and and that's part of being the quarterback I remember going to blame the quarterback part or the head coach and\nAll that needs to come there's no question about the court the finger one hundred percent of them their recreation of themselves and that we have for him and the entire country as a\nMatter of fact that I was really good job or do we do a better job of walking up we need to do a better job of running of all the pressure off of ... and we got to do a\nMuch better job of running route and getting open and then we just got a ... what we're doing them and let it so we got we got ...\nSo just hit it all is said gotta get better place in the quarterback we've got to block better the running backs got to run the ball better and receivers have to run or else better so you know\nSo there's your answer in other words that's what they're saying internally they're just saying that as a catastrophic collapse of the office basically are saying everybody there's not one group there's there's not one group involved it is absolutely the whole thing\nBlew up yeah and and not just players that goes on coaches too I mean he was stronger into skiing I thought his post game quote was exactly right on he said\nThis is Dana we didn't do anything right we didn't make good decisions we didn't call good place we didn't play with effort we didn't block\nThey didn't come up with any magical place I've got to do a better job coaching office\nI think that's that's what's so surprising about this is this isn't an offense that just will Greer and a bunch of other guys just running around out there this is a fantastic quarterback with multiple running backs tied ends\nThe best group of receivers in the big twelve and there were no answers to Iowa State coming at them none nothing looked any different in the second half\nNo it didn't appear any adjustments were major and he plays were run that changed the routes that receivers running that weren't working it was just it was surprising to see nothing happened throughout the whole game nothing no new momentum whatsoever was established in ...\nNo no absolutely true you don't what would you don't get past the fifty yard line and you don't have a drive the last longer than five points\nIf you're not going to get any momentum not but you sometimes have to generate your momentum and you know the uh there are guys on that team that are offensive line or that bought the offensive line is is very much I'm an enigma\nIt's faceless it doesn't have um it doesn't have guys on there that you could say that the leader of the offensive line you don't have that guy and you go back to the Tyler or law ski often salons that was his line\nRight when he was out there that was his line and you go back to West Virginia off into what Danny Moses and I know one name and an outlet trophy guy but I'm just saying you got to have those guys there they can't be faceless nameless you've got to have that leadership up front and you don't have that consistently\nWith that group and I think that's a part of it again this is not a one party problem this is a fundamental problem and\nThat is one of the issues that they have to get they have to deal with and to be quite honest with you um it's probably not going to do a one eighty before the season's over when you've played happier season chances are it just doesn't go\nOne eighty and you go from here to hear\nBut keep in mind or whether it's being as bad as it was on Saturday the numbers were still solid statistically\nGoing into the game but as we pointed out last week up until last week West Virginia played the Ninety second most difficult schedule in the country Ninety to Iowa State it played number five\nAnd so the bad news is it's not going to get any easier for West Virginia these challenges now will be much more extreme than they were in the first half of the season\nSo that's the concern so you've got to get a lot better a lot quick or or or you're going to really have some problems\nAnd I think Iowa state's gonna they're playing some games this year I think you're going to look up and find that they've they've got a pretty good team there they're building something there are so again I give them all the credit in the world and I would I Would lean more in that direction if it weren't for again what I just said about Oklahoma State\nIt was it was almost an identical type game yet there were big plays that Oklahoma State found they were able to hit some some place that got them in the end zone\nThis wasn't even close to getting an ... ... so that that's what I keep going back to her tiny wasn't a loss wasn't a close loss was the last we saw some things it was just a total\nCollapse on all fronts that's what I Would not have predicted out of this often during any game you could've sold me on a couple of losses this year you could have sold me on some struggles at times a total collapse from the office of

during the pregame\nBut when you talk to about ... dreading when we'd be taxed I think it was two thousand and three\nAnd thing is those teams were physical or running game was physical physical up front I Will agree with the one thing about the caller said going back to the pinch tribal physicality so important in after we'd be Virginia Tech backs into Frank Beamer said you know we came up there and they just punched in the mouth\nI think that kind of happened and I and ... did lay out the perfect storm like you said ... another thing it's ironic because they know worked so hard to develop a physical reading game I mean look at small with these with the eagles now look how they ran the ball back then\nAnd then I think again not given a hard time to recline or ... or those ...

think\nThere's any question that you've got to be physical and you've got to be able to run the ball even if you're a spread team you've got to be able to run the ball when you want to run the ball

how well you can throw it you've got to be able to run the ball agree or disagree\nYes I Do and I think that showed up the other night you couldn't run the football but I also think in today's day and

team on the road if he can't run the football maybe at times I think there's degrees in there that you're talking about but I think there's no question West Virginia that was one of the problems that
