we're joined by ... the wealth management and good morning hey good morning Chris how are you I'm doing well this morning what are we looking at is we started another day on Wall street almost in a pretty volatile week\nIt really has the markets came back strongly yesterday that I was up four hundred blind to recoup and a lot of six on a plane\nDown there we had the day before it's now positive again here today so up one percent the essence he was also strong but that that is very weak though it was down almost rape or sent and going into this morning the future for sharply lower when I first got up I we were down over three hundred points on the dial right now we just got third quarter\nGDP at eight thirty and it came in at three point five percent which was higher than the estimate\nOf three point two percent and last quarter classical score point two percent so when you put the two quarters together a plus for Clinton to and the second quarter up three point five and third quarter that's the strongest two quarters of GDP that we've had\nSince two thousand and twelve\nSo that's a positive such an earnings is the problem right now you're starting to see the cracks a we had two big tech companies namely Google their stocks down over five percent this morning an Amazon what's your stock is down over ten percent both of those ... both of those companies reported\nRevenue that came and blow the forecast and or Amazon also disappointed with the fourth quarter guidance\nSo I'm both those stocks are taken up on the chin this morning but the teachers were indicating about a three hundred point down day than those numbers came out on the GDP Chris and now believe it or not it's kind of one of those good news is good news and it looks like the plot opens about down two hundred and fifty so we had a pretty\nPretty quick quick move off the GDP numbers ...\nAnd ... and you mentioned the findings dogs are those are the ones that are the darling of the market or have been originally\nYeah they're not now are so far this month the recipes down about eight percent an accidental or seven what yesterday's move a small caps are down Thirteen percent said the darling set now turned into a little little daredevils he said yeah\nBut uh interest rates have been that's where all the finger pointing has been this markets that awful since the fed raises rates and supposedly he made a rookie mistake on as guidance that he would\nThat we were nowhere near neutral and I'm interest rates by right now this morning Chris are three point eight percent three point oh wait three point oh wait and then the fed raise they were really at three and a quarter\nSo we've seen interest rates go from three and a quarter to a three point overweight and um but we think longer term the market is constructive the two things that\nDr stocks higher or economic activity and earnings both those right now are very solid pillars of this economy but what gives all this volatility this is the day to day news\nAnd we think there was a lot of it out there but that when you look at this pullback it's similar to the previous pull back that we've seen namely two thousand eleven two thousand Fifteen sixteen this one kind of looks like\nThat in the market you know even the one we have this February wearing a temper set pullback market went on to hit all time high so just rotted out hang in there\nI mean the question where do you go so you got a few days ago on a fix on a point down day yeah where do you go to dawn the cash and then you'd have missed that one and a half percent\nWell if you if you bought a bunch of bunch on that last year's bought into a bunch of starting to build a new day later you made a good bit\nYeah you'd have made more than one day there you'd make and two and a half year old and she said to them as well\nYeah if you're a traitor ... that you've got to think I say we don't own stocks William businesses to her and you know like
