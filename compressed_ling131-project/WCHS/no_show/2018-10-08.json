this is setting out but I talked about this before it's setting up for a big year for a lot of reasons not just the on the field stuff and what this team could potentially\nAttain on the field but I think it's a big year for data horse in as well if if it turns out that way and it's a big twelve championship appearance or a big twelve championship\nYou know that contracts getting to the point again where you start to talk about renewal and you're going to talk about runoff I'm his agent and this is a ten eleven when season or a big twelve championship season\nIf it hasn't already Shane lions phone will be bringing from the ages I Would say the same pretended Gibson if this defense continues on the art that it's going right now and I recognize it's going to face a lot more difficult all fences and its face to this point\nThe defenses really performing well right now until he gets it gets calls every single year as well you should for the job he's done if this is a season in which big twelve championship\nComes along with everything else it could be a big year for Tony gifts in as well be at a head coach somewhere beat a defensive coordinator at another place to be at Oklahoma making a call so a lot of things at play this year not just the obvious stuff going on in the field yeah I mean we've\nSeen as a thousand times right and I mean you know well you know who's doing this for thirty plus years from from coach dealing staff in in in him as well through you know rich rod just due to ... and now to dance staff I mean if you have success others are going to come calling for you I mean nobody wants people on your staff\nThat means you're probably not new in a very good job right so\nWhen they come calling when you because you have success in that may ultimately be the head coach a coach the inland turned down some opportunities or we can talk to him about that\nWhen we have him on later tonight I'm you know obviously data rich not only turn down opportunities but also ultimately all also excepted one um you know do wouldn't around long enough to\nProbably get to that point but uh if they in has a year a that they're going to be people that will call him and you know he's thirty second uh according to USA Today chart in coaching salary or he makes pretty good pending I think any of us would take it but certainly if they have a banner year\nUm Shane lines is going to have to figure out what he wants to do and you know if if he wants to how much more you want to go home and he's making three and a half\nAn hour over three and a half but\nWe're seeing the market gets close to six for a lot of the guys I'm certainly SEC guys part of that is for me to believe in in maybe nothing can alternately keep your head coach if if the\nRight opportunity comes along and and certainly the same goes for assistance defensive coordinators as well I mean it's not always just money sometimes opportunities but let's face it the money is getting huge by a lot of people so we'll see but you know that's again\nThat's a good thing and in some ways it's tough to to fathom a but it means you're having success people want coaches on\nYour style I I I call every

I could buy that you know what you have a traditional every game I Know that's why you're not a good person to have this conversation but I\nSee I get that point I understand that that's not a bad point Kansas game what I didn't like lack of focus lack of energy turnovers poor pass blocking much of the time and receivers not coming back to get open what I liked\nThe wind and the weather here is like\nLegit field will just like everything else especially the especially the road yellow uniforms\nState road yellow uniforms mhm Mm\nWhat's your opinion of the will Greer slide no call\nSays hey guys I'm Still upset about the ... no call the ... what is worse quite trick it was worse but that was that when I was a that was missed call I mean Greg clearly got hit in the Helmand got a helmet to home so I agree with you\nI agree with you\nI'm here's a question update on an Oscar ... visit the talented hold on for a good ...

first\nAnd then I'll always asked about that ... on last night's show too and I didn't have too much new information at that point because ah from understand Oscar was still in town at that juncture didn't get into Morgantown until late I was told he had like a\nAc tier SAT test on Saturday afternoon so didn't attend the football game in the afternoon we got here in town and everything bread if everything from air sounds like went well\nI'm hearing the same everything went well and if you talk to certain people not necessarily this is from a western coaching perspective but if you talk to people that the uh the lean is still heavy West Virginia at this point\nBut will say oh no announcement as a ... one of the recruiting guys out there did tweet that Oscar saying he will have a decision within the next week or two so you're not going to have to wait real long course signing date for basketball the early signing period begins in early November So it's only a few weeks away anyway\nI'm I'm hearing it went well as what I hear All right likes running the ball and special teams that dislike the turnovers that is true you know it's really interesting West Virginia has won four consecutive games now going into fall on the air\nTwelve penalties in one game four turnovers and the next twelve penalties in the next and four turnovers and the following you really can go for
