which will be out later tonight will get in some of your text in a little bit but now to talk about the Texas Longhorns for that we had down to Austin, Texas where we are joined by Kurt bowls Austin American statesman Kirk welcome back to the show thanks for being with us that\nThe bread how's it going where well sorry we're well we're looking forward to this game on Saturday coming up and I'm fascinated by this because I think both teams much like well heck most uh college football except for Alabama\nAnd we've seen both teams look really good we've seen both teams struggle quite a bit so let me lead off with this for you ... when Texas is playing really well it's doing what very well\nIt's a writing the balance of Sam mailing or their sophomore quarterback who doesn't know what it is to throw interception anymore\n[laughter] so he through to the first game and then thrown in a sense though and that and a lot of weight at Braddock come down to the vet\nSo he threw it forty I think if I had this right forty two times against Oklahoma State I've got to believe that's a higher number than what Tom Herman wants to see him I correct in that but they rather keep the ball more on the ground and and let him run it a little bit more\nOh absolutely right the running game was kind of been a\nProblem area all year long um they've got a better line but they've been better protecting Sam than they have been in creating big holes for some of their running backs and how they offer the best running back as a freshman yeah the anger from Carthage, Texas and he's got the most first than the ...\nBut he's had an injury and so they don't completely trust them and trying to preserve him the whole season so you know sometimes he won't even play the first quarter because they want to get the last three quarters of how I've been you know he's people would like to see him get the ball thirty times but they're\nThey're watching his carries in work a little bit more than that so I think they're running game and in God awful thoughts from beef and started games because the phone for six or eight drive for starting games this year so those are probably the biggest issues that they bred\nBowls Austin American statesman break to take when we come back we'll continue our discussion about western any Texas take a little different approach will talk to former WVU defensive

our game day broadcast I'd encourage you to give it a try this weekend just turned on the TV for a little bit to this day in and former WB defensive coordinator Steve done lap will be there given you a world class education or not only defense because I think that's what's interesting about Steve he's the former defensive coordinator\nBut that means he knows a lot about office because he spent his whole career studying officers so he's he's really good on both sides of the ball I think it's a really unique fun way to kind of watch and learn about the game let's see if you can do we're not watching the game right now obviously but we'll see what kind of inside he can give us in the Texas\nAnd WVU joining us now WVU former WB defensive coordinator Steve done that because stomach good evening walk on the program\n[noise] good any thoughts how're you doing\nWe're well we're well you better bring your a game this Saturday I just gave me such a great introduction there so no let down we have all these people tune in so I had\nTo speed up the ... the valuation process because you know I thought I thought I was going to be there Saturday\n[laughter] well that's I don't want to all your stuff tonight I just want a little preview of what we're going to talk about Saturday So let's let's start with that you're always great you come in with page after page of notion hunter you know what's interesting about done that\nHe comes in with these pages full of notes they're all handwritten and he's got impeccable handwriting it's unbelievable might be the only guy left in the world with nice handwriting so I'll just give you open up the floor here\nWhat jumps out at you first well Texas offensively do their first\nFirst of all when you get old short term memory is gone so you've got to write it down okay that's the first thing and they got it but\nAnyway uh probably the quarter back I mean ... he's the guy makes them go he's probably the\nQuarterback version of a runaway bird truck when he runs and he's a very effective when he does run I just went back and watched the first half on TV over the Oklahoma State game and and try to figure out how the how how they could possibly lose though not very good Oklahoma State team and would\nYou know he didn't Oklahoma State and and they are he only written about twice the first staff I watched the first step you know the rent it twice with both ... touchdowns ... so you may see him not run the ball quite so much after that introduced right shoulder so\nYou know he's not they're not quite as affected me running game when they can't run him cause that that there is not some\nTougher for defensive coordinator did try to handle than a running quarterback because he just came to be accounted for all the time\nYou make a good point I I just mentioned it I guess we just had on the ... he threw the ball forty two times against Oklahoma State I Would think if you're Tony gift than and Ellen gr throws at forty two times rather than runs it right out you'll take that won't you\nI'll absolutely but you know he's from west like high school and in Austin, Texas and that's also were Drew Brees is from a ... and he broke all the school passing record so he he's a very viable passer and he's still a lot of good boss\nI watched the first African AS Oklahoma State and I mean they they run wrong routes they drop boss and and then you know they just found different ways of mess it up from time to time I mean it toward the right before the half they had the um the ...\nOklahoma State dead on about the forty yard line in Texas jumps all sides gives them first down I mean they just can't do anything right and I always I always think Texas is one of the most under achieving teams I've ever seen as far as you know\nThe talent they have in ... what they get out of it I mean I caught the country club the fact that the guys get recruited and that they think they're entitled and then run this when and and that's going to take some time for a\nTom Herman to get that straightened out I'm sure of that but I mean\nThey just did all kinds of crazy things that half and a lot of it goes back to and is there to starting corners\nDidn't didn't start in that game for the first quarter clothes I keep missing meetings and they were this one for it so the result of that because it cost\nTexas Seventeen points because to touchdown pass in the field goal in two hundred and sixty ours because her play with two freshman corners so they've got a lot of problems are not off the field also\nYou've I'm always interested in ... especially you know start with West Virginia you used to be West Virginia's three three ... was very unique only a couple of teams intelligible Rand anything like it now seemingly every week is up there going\nWell they're taken a lot of what he's doing I was ... now Texas ... maybe it's not the same thing but are a lot of people starting to do this\nWell right now as ... as I've counter that there there was probably six teams at that base out of a three man in front of the big twelve right now so\nIt's ... it's kind of a trend maybe because of the three and four white out sets and spreading you out because it does create a lot of confusion you put lighter faster guys on the field to try to defend these things\nAnd I think that's a trend I think the the people who haven't figured out the best by far as our state and and everybody said well I Would stay wasn't that good and they shut us down but they give up thirty one points last week where they really didn't give up thirty one point Seventeen points they weren't they wanted to feel that they had to block punt for for\nA touchdown and a safety quarterback sucked in the end zone for a touchdown\nAnd so you know they're they're the ones that kind of set the standards I think that they've got it started to figure it out in ... does a lot of things they do already was built into the streets restock so as this goes on you know this hurry up spread out often says that I think the difference is starting to catch up a little bit with them", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston",
