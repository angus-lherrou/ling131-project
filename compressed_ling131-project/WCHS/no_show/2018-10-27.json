upgrade for you to be in West Virginia hunting on a Saturday morning but I Want to extend that I I think I'll be have a sportsman\nIn the state though we want to extend thanks to ah to the national Shooting Sports foundation for the work that you guys did to help the help convinced the legislature to move forward but the Sunday hunting legislation I think that's something that hunters and the state really appreciated\nIt when we appreciate all support in the state I mean we started this project probably about six or seven years ago the first day we pass Sunday hunting in was\nVirginia I mean we were getting rid of glue laws are over two hundred years old and you kind of moved on from there and did North Carolina and obviously came into West Virginia and you know I think it's great for the west Virginia sports men that they now have the ability to hunt on Sundays both on private and public land\nAnd uh you know we need more people out in the field and then we need to increase you know recruiting every era attention and I think that from the hunting is one way to do that\nTell me a little bit about the national Shooting Sports your the organization that represents a firearms manufacturers and and and and those those organizations right you're the trait that training was hovering ...\nYear one hundred percent correct we are the trade association so we represent all the manufacturers\nI'm obviously large manufacturers Smith in West and Remington Winchester the ... of the world as well as retailers and ranges of ... around the country so there are many retailers here in West Virginia that are\nAre members of ours we we've visited one yesterday at mc flies um you know great retailer and uh you know they we we do everything we can to try to support our members and help them through or sometimes difficult times and good times for the industry\nAnd not and I know that you all have also been one of those it's supportive and every time I get an opportunity to talk about the the Pitman Robertson act was one that was created more than Seventy five years ago and that is where the firearms industry I mean there's an excise tax that we all pay\nOn the products that are produced by the firearms industry and that becomes money that helps to manage the game in the in the United states and you for the first time ever benefited from that this morning\nCorrect I mean people don't realize that hundreds of basically the number one conservationist in America they are the ones that support many of the land that people use the hiking and mountain biking of bird watching and you know the feet the taxes that we pay that go back to the federal government and get distributed to the states are key to that uh every\nEvery fire him every box of animal that somebody buys is a money going to conservation\nWhen that you are where are you guys headquartered\n[noise] so we are headquartered we actually do have a Washington DC office and then we are headquartered in Newtown, Connecticut ... ... people always ask why are we in Connecticut and you know that it used to always be gone valley a lot of manufacturers are in the northeast there's still a lot of manufacturers in the northeast Jeff Smith in West and\nI'm river's still headquartered in Connecticut ... cold so we still have all of a fair share manufactured in the northeast as well\nYou know when you consider the way the political winds have changed in the last fifty years or ... ... it's often hard to remember history where you know the country pretty much started in that part of the world in a in that you're right that's where the firearms were made for I don't know a couple of hundred years it seemed like\nYeah we are seeing a lot of states now giving economic incentives and tax breaks to move a lot of farms many factions of the north East I'm Marilyn Marilyn was one that lost Beretta or at a move down to Tennessee for their manufacturing facility so\nYou know we do see a lot of states trying to entice the fires fires to move out of the north east because of the political environment\nAbsolutely and if you got any more out there that are looking to leave West Virginia you mean you'd be experienced we love our firearms here\nAh I experienced West Virginia the past couple of days I even went to them\nThe football game on Thursday night so I'm
