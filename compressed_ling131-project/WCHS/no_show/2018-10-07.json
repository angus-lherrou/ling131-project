are the pillars of running a business you have to meet your bottom line but can you hit the bottom line and make having a social impact one of your top priorities\nSusan ... fierce and founder of ... strategy sat down with ABC's Rebecca Jarvis on her podcast no limits to discuss how you can be business savvy and have a social impact at the same time why it's so important to do it\nFor those who are thinking about starting businesses are have started businesses and then also those inside of companies where they wished their companies would take on more of an active role in trying to make the world a better place so let's start there okay if you're inside of a company right now and you feel like\nNot doing enough look around yeah what can you do well first of all you have a voice and you have colleagues that I'm generally you either work with or you know when you have friends so number of thank you personally can get involved and\nAnd volunteer um there are ... there is actually one point four million nonprofits give or take in this country today do deep dive into yourself to find out what you care about\nI'm oftentimes people are led into causes because of personal situations for instance if you've lost somebody cancer or heart disease you might find yourself gravitating towards those types of organizations or\nYou know you might have had experience seeing hunger firsthand therefore you might go that way so I think it's really important to find out what you care about I grew up with a a mother who worked for public television and always told me that it wasn't about making money and it was about doing good and ...\nWhat is college for thirty nine years which which taught me you know that a woman's voice needed to be heard you know they had they were second generation I'm and\nVery much about getting back to the community so that was instilled in me from a very young age I always wear my hard on my sleeve and in hindsight probably like really pushed me over the edge as I moved to New York city in two thousand three and I didn't know anyone\nI had a paycheck since I was Fifteen um and\nDid that make you nervous the idea of not having a paycheck and\nOh my God and in fact I um I left that and with the assurance of two organizations that said if you leave we will hire you so I left on a friday and I started on a Monday I named it next year since strategies\nBecause I thought it was just a place holder I'm Nick here's the strategies as my ex husband's name and he's a wonderful fellow but it just you know it didn't make sense but again I thought it was just oh until I figure out the next thing\nAnd then we're coming up on five years on next month\nCongratulations thank you what do you wish you knew\nThen that you now have come to realize now that we'd be here in five years and have more confidence and well yes and I I I wouldn't be so terrified and and\nBut the best advice I did receive which I think is the reason for the success was a well two things one and this is this the price of the consulting world when you have good month you have a tendency to want to record\nAnd and and just kind of save it for a rainy day and what you should be doing is using that to invest in bringing the best people around you\nWho do all the things that you are not good at so hiring more hiring more aligning yourself with you know maybe finding partners um but I had been very conscientious about surrounding myself with the people that do the amazing things that I Am unable to do and I also say you know I was the grand old age of forty eight when I started the business\nAnd I don't think it would have been as successful if I had started at age thirty and that is because of the pure network effect\nI was saying as you get older it's just it's it's like the law of gravity you just know more people yeah um and I've always all my life he can every single meeting\nAnd you know it wasn't until Adam Grant came out with his book give or take that said actually the more meetings you hold the more productive you get that that's how I live my life I Am so fascinated by people in their stories and what makes them happy and\nThe reassuring king is early on in your career you you don't have to know everybody is over time that you get to know all of these people yeah and you also get to know yourself and what you\nCare about exactly and we are so lucky to live in a world that you can connect with almost anyone to I mean I think back years ago when I you know when I was applying for my first jobs and you have to go through numerous gate gate keepers\nYou had to use the yellow pages and the Encyclopedia Britannica there was no Internet there was no now so I mean kids growing up today\nYou know I always say if

I think it's trending just a little bit on the our side in Pennsylvania because the economic issues the flourishing of shale play in the western part of Pennsylvania the jobs are recreating cracker there's a lot of excitement there again is all about economics and typically economics drive a Republican election\nWell I mean there has been a pretty sizable economic shift in this state in the last ten years and ah one of you commented that economic growth due in part to the growth of this industry the oil and gas industry um do you see that continuing obviously we want to see\nGrowth content and we want to see this industry continuing to grow\nYou know I don't think there's ... there's an industry is limitless and I say that ah\nWith all due respect there the growth of phenomenal that really has not hit hit yet I think once the liquid starts staying in this in in this part of the world is part of the United states\nThe downstream opportunities come come in I think that that is just it's just a matter of time in ... and it's a you know we got to get the storage hub and we've got to get to\nThe cracker built in America\nI mean once that stuff happens\nA candy bar the door so to speak in in North central West Virginia seeing that already you can't find hotel rooms or on the pipelines side are clearing out grocery stores every day on the delivery day um and that's driving the economics of the state of West Virginia every month for the past three months mhm and I think\nHe is absolutely right you know this I think West Virginia's potential is limitless right now we're going to hopefully continue to see a strong economic growth and you know as the industry continues to progress we're going to see other sectors just you know just as historically when the coal industry was up several other sectors that well I think in West Virginia\nAs a natural gas industry continues to grow we're going to see that bleed over several other sectors\nAnd one thing I did pick up that senator mansion said or to the gathering here yesterday or looking out to the crowd gathered for this war bongo fall meeting the future of West Virginia's right in this room\nExactly and I you know I think that's a that's not easy for senator manage because he'd been so so cool oriented his whole career moves in the governor's office and in the U.S Senate and I think that transition is taking place so I it was nice to hear him say that and and it was well recognized in the room when he did that\n... our guys very good great information and you have a presentation or is it more of a panel discussion you're involved\nIn well we have some pretty interesting people on our panel today and uh\nIt it's going to be very uh in uh Brian's is going to be one of the mark Blankenship a Kurdish workers and and I'm a\nBill Bishop and we're just going to have a conversation about politics and they're going to be challenging each other or I'm going to ask a question everyone would can respond to that question is I think it will be one and informative panel and secondly an entertaining panels well so All right that's coming up later this morning\nLast and this is my twentieth anniversary as being on the border will bongo so I'm I'm real happy to be here and it's been a great role and as I have seen in my career on the board over time\nIt could have been a ...

sleeping on a cushion that disciples woke him and said to him teacher don't you care if we drown\nHe got up rebuke to win and said to the waves quiet\nBe still\nDidn't win died down and it was completely\nAnd he said to his disciples why are you so afraid do you still have no say\nThey were terrified and ask each other who is this even the wind and the waves obey him\nYou know I don't know about you but there's so many times in life where it just seems like storms are coming all around in literally I find myself from time to time crying out God don't you even care what's going on right now don't you even know what's going on and sometimes I Need a reminder that\nHe's in the boat with me who is this guy the guy who can control it all the God of the universe\nOr M A story today comes from a time where we were trying to teach him how to swim now something that\nNot many people know about me is that I literally growing up I grew up and went to Salvation Army camps all ah all my whole a teenage life and actually got to work at a Salvation Army camping became a lifeguard and so I was trained and certified lifeguard\nAnd so to me it was going to be a lot of fun now as an adult to be able to teach my child how to swim I couldn't remember though how much my one an only child Emma did not trust her dad to do this\nBecause she thought I was going to let her drown she thought I was going to let her go and all of a sudden she just said daddy I Need you to get a real life guard to help and I could just remembered try to tell him I Am a come on\nYour dad is trained your dad loves you more than anything trust me on this\nAnd I can remember her saying no daddy\nLet's get swim lessons\nAnd so I can remember\nShelley nice shelling out the money for us to go and take her to take swim lessons and I thought oh my goodness I feel so bad\nFor this little sixteen year old lifeguard because my ... was just not going to learn how to swim and I'll never forget as they had all the little kids sit on the side of the pool\nAnd and the lifeguard from inside the pool said when I blew my whistle you jump into the pool into the shallow end and then we're going to learn some different techniques and I thought oh good luck\nYou don't have a clue what you're getting yourself into with\nEmma and that life guard Louis whistle and Emma jumped right into the pool as a dad I could not be more upset because I couldn't believe that here my daughter trusted this little sixteen year old is she wouldn't trust me she wouldn't trust me\nBut then I thought you know how many times do I do that with God how many times am I liked the disciples who when I look around and say God don't you even care don't you know me don't you love me and and and then all of a sudden I started to put my faith and to other things I tried to put my trust the other thing okay I guess I'll have to take care of the storm myself\nFolks as we go through our storms you don't have to trust and other things we don't have to find other lifeguards to save us from the storm remember that Jesus is in the boat with each and every one of us\nAs we said do you do you care Jesus\nHe's saying you better believe I care\nMy hope and pray or as as we examine our faith today as Jesus Says why are you so afraid do you still have no faith that today as Jesus asks us that that we say yes Jesus I Do\nLet's pray father we thank you so much that through storms in our lives you're a God who goes through them with us\nAs a father we just pray that you help us to remember that that wherever we go you go you're in the boat you're in the storm with us maybe we'd be uh people who always\nTrust you in the storms\nThanking Jesus for being there to singer named ...
