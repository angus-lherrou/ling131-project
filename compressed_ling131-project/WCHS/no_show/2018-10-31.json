from an opposing often it's another words what what does West Virginia have to do to to to pick on their weakness\nUm I I Would say that they've they've been playing pretty good run defense but then justice ill you know slice and dice them ... this past week\nUm my my advice would be get the ball out of your hands are quickly right because I I don't think that their front seven is pressuring the quarterback as much as they should um that Charles ...\nWho has had several good weeks here in fact he's got like six sex in the last\nUh four or five weeks um he he's really coming on the record hangar or hasn't done as much as they had hoped that Chris Nelson is is is a done a really good job replacing coon afford but see his role is to just kind of stuff up the middle and let the line backers make the place right um\n[noise] you know ... stern had a terrific start season as a freshman I mean they were sent him a freshman all American after September and now he's\nKind of fallen back and looked like a freshman at times and so um I I Would if if I'm West Virginia and I'm designing the game plan get the ball out of wills hands quick and and really press and when you feel like Texas on their heels go go after it press harder\nYou know this is what I Would say\nYou know offensively for the long wars is Ellen gr being able to run around and make places\nThat their biggest

if you look at that film um there's a thirty nine yards throw to Andrew back down the same in a touchdown throw to ... those are I Would argue are two of his best throws has a long horn huh and he did that with the with the supposedly a messed up shoulder\nLast thing for me is ... guy that people like having on his team about other teams don't [noise]\nSeems like that yeah ... yes up until the moment he uh he tries to bank through when they're good ideal downplayed sparking this per\nQuarter mail a you know the head coaches are on on the field like a crazy person yeah\nYeah I mean it was it
