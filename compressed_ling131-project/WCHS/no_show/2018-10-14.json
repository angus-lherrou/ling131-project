include West Virginia and he thanks for coming on and and attempting to explain this to us first of all welcome to the show we appreciate your time\nGood wine Kyle and a whole let everybody in West Virginia\nAh we're we're a little bit warm for open for fall here very soon but we're we're in good shape what more can you tell us about section one twenty six of the clean Air Act in which the state of New York is attempting to a impose these uh these guidelines\n[noise] yes I said what twenty six has a very uh it's a summer rarely used a cricket and other clean Iraq um which does enable a a\nA a state to a target either a major source or group of sources where we use are impacting it owes its air quality and it's ozone levels with the United states\nOr New York though however here has stretched a you know a major source or group is sources it's two three hundred and forty six sources across the line up when states from New York um all of it's actually a part of a ... at first she was struck down and keep the energy in the ground\nOkay so what are we talking about here a power plant pipeline construction sites ... what are they trying to impact\nUm is a number of power plants there are a number of industrial facility is across the west Virginia\nA dupont Washington works a washer and Virginia West Virginia allies Morgantown energy associated with the courage implant um their crops items along with actually a number of a compressor stations are run by many in Columbia gas than a couple of other companies\nAll are targeted in West Virginia by this complaint\nWow so that's from your study from your research that's roughly twenty nine facilities I Believe in West Virginia and we're talking hundreds a when you take in account Pennsylvania West Virginia Ohio Indiana Kentucky Illinois in Michigan right\nThree three hundred and forty six separate sources targeted but near ...\nOkay I just can't work candidate [laughter]\nOr maybe we're very hopeful that they will vote in either Christian\nUm we uh what the the chamber along with the ... coalition of which was a group of other creditors Houston's or some little packs of companies I did file a very lengthy record all this New York protection a few weeks ago and it hurt the both of the modeling efforts\nThat's a New York conducted with respect to this condition where all the\nAnd a lot of the information that it was quite frankly was was was out of date a lot of it pretty day it's a lot of the environmental roll right now that I have I've actually got a major impact on cleaning up the air in the last\nSo if I did ... years okay so it's an overreach or I guess to say the least ... what was in your rib bottle what were some of the things that are that you brought to light that perhaps could have an effect in in ...\n[noise] ah well for one I mean they failed to demonstrate a consistent with BPA rags that there was any actionable a team of issues with the New York state suddenly even\nOr even in their modeling uh there were very ... that we're going to be out of are we going to school and as they call it a mayor ... we're right around New York city actually and curiously or you know a number of those\nCounties around New York city are impacted by a five New Jersey I'm\nIn New York decided to Met's or New Jersey and its sources of from a sort of the crosshairs of this complaint\nOr also you know they're they're modeling was out there that um it also failed to do was to identify any cost effective now emissions controls that could be implemented at the hundreds of sources um listed I mean the of the arguments being that both of these sources already\nHave the most cost effective at mission control or do you do to the cross the air pollution rules do the other uh uh EPA rules already on the books\n[noise] okay what at the bottom of this what's the root cause why are they attempting to do that they have the state of New York has work to to block construction of of of pipelines and that sort of thing in in in the state there and we all know that\nConsumers their pay a significant amount more for their electricity and their energy what the point of trying to work backwards here in in and put other states out of business so to speak\n[noise] well you know for for for for a large part of ... you'd have to ask New York why why are they have a ... this is this a sort of a version to uh you know the powerful natural gas that are found in Pennsylvania Ohio West Virginia and another states further west\nOr I mean this has been a consistent effort by them on and we have now we did a study here at the chamber called water pipelines are built into the northeast which actually is you know you know seeing what happens\nWhen we weren't flocks piper infrastructure I mean right now uh you know people in the northeast or ... percent more for their natural gas serving us average or forty four percent more for the city a lot of that is because New York as\nI'm using other EPA rules including a foreign one of the clean Water Act um to deny a pipeline permits that otherwise have been you know federally approved and have been approved by the other impacts of states\n... okay All right well what's next ah when ah when we get a ruling on this or when will we learn more about uh what's to come with the\nWell right now it's sort of the the ... decision will face for the er physician filed by the New York state\nOr the the BPA is on the hook to a a gym or something with the petition and with the revolt we filed a sometime in November I Believe is the the the date for that and after the time to be an acceptable then actually be a\nA sixty day comment period on UPA accent there after ... and so we're going to make sure to inform a lot of the folks in these these nine states you know when that cholera trade Oakland's 'cause I I think a lot of uh a lot of the you know enemies that are targeted by this compliance or even though some of the energies may now\nAre a lot of people to work at those places that they pick how to use them towns and his colleagues here at the uh property taxes for many different industries are the court or may not know that New York or even has a you know an avenue under the clean Air Act you or try to attack book or academy is in this way\nThis just seems like a massive overreach doesn't\nUh we we were we would

Twenty years ago were going to talk about some of her experiences there and working on extensive research on projects dealing with women's health welcome Elizabeth nice to have you with us\nThank you father how are you\nGood good let's go back a little bit to air force bases in Greece and turkey where you served and what to talk about that experience and maybe even some of the challenges you encountered\nSure sure so that was during my um early years in the United States Air force and I was a nurse\nFor the Christopher I'm thank you for having me it's good to talk to\nI think the first question out of the box has to be can you tell us what you mean by secularization in the context of eastern orthodoxy that half the puzzle to people\n[laughter] yes indeed well um to me when I think of secularization um well this particular edition paradigm I always seem to die mentioned to me there is a social cultural damage done\nThere's obviously if you're logical or a spiritual dimension to it and I'm part of my own research I'm I'm trying to see how where's the line between these two things how can one um think\nAbout the pros so that is at the same time sort of a logical pro says he has to do something to to say about who we are as Christians and what we do and how we live our life and the fate but also something that is outside of our control in the way because it's\nIt's positive how society functions oh dynamics as it were larger than the ones that we can control from within the ... role um everybody so I don't want to sort of stopped electoral this\nWill do it's very it's very tempting for me to do that and I can very easily slip into this but\nI'm just maybe for the clarity of those will listen to this um I think in in in the sense of a soldier's the social cultural mention of secularization of this paradigm I'm a first of all the first thing to say that it is sort of a theoretical model in the way they was postulated\nI'm buying a sociologist sociologist to religion thinking about the relationship between maternity\nAnd how it affects religious life religious bullets religious behave yeah\nI'm so basically if one or two is assigned a question to secularization it would be sort of what happens to religion and the conditions of maternity and accelerated changeover accelerating change\nUm this is something that should they be mounting a British in sociology of religion ... was and I think it's a ... a useful way of looking at this\nFor them where you're headed now you hit it right on the head in that last sentence\nThat you have to go to the essence of what you're doing but let me go to a different question father the remaining Orthodox Church has produced I feel some of the most loved scholars in recent times for me to for the Roman ... who have truly withstood the forces of a secular world\nUh how has their memory how has their Christian witness help keep alive the rich tradition of eastern orthodoxy in Romania\nAnd thank you for this question will I think first of all come before really addressing it directly I Would want to say that that um there there are much loved elders um throughout the sort of different also looks traditions or churches or um [noise] people if if you're going to use the word\nUm and I think they're they're all extraordinary can textural into in the mission and the witness stand I think that this is\nClean and we we have two of 'em there's this in the work of the Holy Spirit\nYou know times in in in in in the twentieth century and um I certainly believe that we will have elders we will talk about in the twenty first century and\nUh that for many of us we were trying to be sociological and so you know we we it courses and it's just a medically allergy one oh one two oh one thrill one fiber ones you know and and we're talking at the five oh one level and everyone will really just wants to be it's a one on one level and I actually learned\nWhat needs to be an architect Christian um let's let's ask you this question the United kingdom I'd never visited United Kingdom and I hope someday that come there and it comes to Cambridge into follow what you're doing\nBut can you tell us a little bit about the early beginnings of the usa north eastern orthodox church in the United kingdom because I think that would be of interest to our listeners\nYes well I'm I really want to just to throw in a quote from I'm from ... in one of these early church stories and flooded and apologetic writers he writes around the year two hundred in his address is ... says the name of Christ now rains\nIn all parts of Spain um in France in ... among the goals and the origins of the Britain's ... it'd be only Roman sway\nBut subjected to Christ so\nAre already in the around the two hundred so second third century um people have an awareness that there is Christianity in Britain um largely thanks to the Romans um conquering this um the the most of its its territory and I think\nIt's exciting to think that the history of the Orthodox Church in a way to put it like that\nIn the u._k. connected to these very early routes you have people I'm like I'm saying I'm old been uh who died as a monetary three hundred and four during the prescription of introductory ... in in\nThis is now the second letter I've written to you in both letters I Want to stir up your sincere understanding by way of reminder so that you recall the words previously spoken by the holy profits and the command of our lord and savior given through your apostles\nAbove all be aware of this school offers will come and the last days golfing and following their own evil desire saying where is his coming that he promised ever since our ancestors fell asleep all things continue as they have been since the beginning of creation\nThey deliberately overlooked is\nBy the word of God the heavens came into being long ago and the earth was brought about from water through water through\nThe world at that time perished when it was flooded by the same more the president heaven and earth are stored up for fire being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly your friends\nDon't overlook this one fact [noise] with the lord one day is like a thousand years in a thousand years like one day\nThe lord is not the lay his ...\nI must have some understand delay\nBut his patient with you not wanting any to perish but all the ... but the day the lord will come like a thief on that day the heavens will pass away with a loud noise the elements will burn and be dissolved and the earth and the works on it will be disclosed\nSince all these things are to be dissolved and this way it is clear what sort of\nPeople you should be in the holy conduct and godly ... as you wait for the day of God in Haitian it's coming because of that day the heavens will be dissolved with fire in the elements\nWill melt with heat but based on his promise we wait for new happens in a new earth were righteousness dwells a couple of things when you observe\nNumber one is that what is happening in our world even if it seems to be getting worse does not determine what's going to happen to our world what determines what is going to happen to our world is the word of God\nAnd it makes complete sense is Peter says it the word of God brought this into existence\nThe word of God will take it out\nBy the way where's the world Golding the pretty clear testimony of the word of God is it going away it's going to be dissolved there's gonna be burn up it's going to be completely destroyed\nAnd the un godly the people who tend to make this place and not so nice place to live there'll be judged there'll be destroyed\nWhat kind of gun does that will adjust God does that noticed that he says after he destroys this place a new place of existence a new reality will come into being and that place will be characterized by righteousness\nAnd justice\nGoddess ultimately working for justice God is ultimately desired for our relationship to be right with him and our relationships to be right with each other\nThat's God's grey day that's what he's been doing since the foundation of the world the God is not the problem\nAre seeing is the problem and there are cosmic consequences of are saying that is made this place a difficult place to live but what it is a difficult place to live you observe and you know this to be the case\nThat there are bright spots to it they're still beauty in this world there's still beauty and what we see in this world in the things that have been made there still are beautiful sunset marvelous and amazing features of\nThe sky which we would call space that justice down ... they're beautiful canyons and rivers there's just beauty there's beauty and relationships although none of us perfect ally act the way we should in any relationship\nThere are good times and they're beautiful things even about the human race it could be so discouraging at times because to be quite honest human beings aren't very kind of each other most of the time\nAnd then there are moments when the best of humanity comes forward we treat people with kindness\nWere there to help each other in cases of need we give we don't focus on all of our differences we come together for purposes of building each other up\nThere still some good in this world and Peters trying to tell these folks look God's gonna take care of all the bad things\nIn God's gonna take care of the people who just absolutely refuse to do good refused to serve him who have given themselves over to the deceit for an of allow themselves to be used by hand to lead people to stray\nGod's gonna take care of that but the second part of that message is the whole point of it is okay because all of this is going to happen and what kind of people should we be we should be people he says who expect the day of the lord to come and do expected to come like a thief\nWhich means you don't plan on it no one predicts that you\nCan't say well this is the day's coming but you live with the anticipation that God will be faithful to his promises that God will bring it about gods said he'd do it he'll do it\nWe live expect it only according to the promises got also says if view that we live holy lives\nWe are determined to be God's people on this planet we're called to be people who are the problem who don't give in\nTo hatred and fear who do the file ourselves and use people for her own sorted gain we live holy and pure lives\nSo it's not for us to worry about what this world coming to\nWe no one is coming to we are people who trust in the word of God we trust that God will do what he said he would do and because we trust in God will do what God tells\nUs to do it doesn't tell us to worry about it he tells us to live as if we understand where the world is headed\nOne of the most beautiful parts of this passage though\nIs what we learn about the character of God I mean one thing we learned we've talked about is that got us faithful God says something that's gonna happen it's gonna happen he'll do it he'll do it in his time which leads us to another beautiful point about God who his God\nHe is patient\nNot willing that any should parish\nBut that all she'd come to repay niche that everyone should turn from his wicked way that everyone should stop rebelling against him and do life the way he intended it when he created us in the first place\nThis guy this patient", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city":
