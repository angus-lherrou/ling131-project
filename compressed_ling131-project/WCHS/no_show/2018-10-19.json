of full\nGame to be a motor do you think you'll be able to see it earlier in the Baylor game is I'm leaning early I think that first half of the Baylor game to me is about is critical half\nKeep those coming three zero for eight to five five three zero for all squeeze a quick call in here before we go to break let's go to the phones Jim in South Charleston is calling Jim thanks for holding Europe though had\nThis go remarks just summer or the guys I said that we would ... where it's cold there because we're not it may be better if you look at it this\nWay no\nOne is a coach or what not to give up that we've seen\nThe show we drove out to be ugly and they were just they just they were the old ... ... that's ridiculous when they\nAre I gotta thank you Jim we appreciate the phone call\nNot getting better throughout the season that's certainly been the case here these last three games you saw that and that's that's what you go back to that Texas Tech game and you start to look at that and you think okay well just just a bad have to just catch them off guard then you saw some things that Kansas that concerns you was it just will gr made three bad decisions yes there were other problems there\nAnd then sure enough it was leading into the worst performance the arrogance Iowa State so that's why the Baylor so critical here you've got to get that trend river Oh absolutely\nI mean in in in that is why that is a huge many people made a little bit more out of the uh especially the Kansas game I mean West Virginia's often still mood football it's on I mean had some turnover issues obviously they kept that ah from making that thing a a complete\nRoute but ten of West Virginia is twelve drives off into positions that game went past forty five yard on for Kansas\nSo yeah and I think eight of those ended up in the reds yeah West Virginia had\n... they're often performed well made mistakes and turn to football over but I don't see that one in nearly the same realm\nAs sex ... second half of Texas Tech or the entire game and it I Will say now admittedly I mean you know he put 'em altogether in their questions and I do think that as you look at Thursday night ...\nWe talked about it I mean and to keep reiterating but it's it's the most important game for West Virginians season because that is going to be true what the what the caller said\nYou know he was not getting better or that will be a mantra that it's hammered home if they lose on Thursday night and his six wind total may be high west Virginia loses Thursday night but if if you're right the ship you feel better you get your ... going\nYou know I I I still think there's a whole lot of painful for this team but I I think so much but it depends on what happens there is\nIt does and it and it's hard to see the positive moving forward given the last taste in your mouth is just what you saw names but\nBut you're certainly right if you get that when at Baylor and get that thing click and again and then at least you're going into the Texas game and you've got some ... some serious matchup problems that are against taxes but at least you're going in with the Iowa State thing wiped out of get that out of the way\nYou your back on track and at least you have a little confidence going into that game and then that's a that's a season maker if you can win that game because they think of the change in the discussion we're having right now\nIf you find a way to beat Baylor and then you go on the road and be the top ten Texas team the whole conversation shift again back the other way\nYeah absolutely now you're playing for a spot in the big twelve titled game if you know you beat Baylor now you're going to Texas with a realistic expectation that if you win that game you can get to the big twelve title game yeah but you need all that scenario falls apart ... if you lose next Thursday\nAnd it and admittedly it's hard to see that scenario right now given what you've seen All right let's get a break and when we come back\nWe'll continue this discussion more of your text at three zero for eight to five five three or four also basketball poll out today the twelve released its
