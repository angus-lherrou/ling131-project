Wednesday morning and a boy how things shift and change and move of of course we're still in October but the last time that limit awesome and I got together it was just after the broad run into up and uh and it was a\nTon of warm outside and still you know where like where is automatic ... now suddenly we're about two steps away from winter\nOh yes yes it was a very warm a doo wop I mean he got quite warm there uh in that we had a little bit of rain but that was a pretty darn warm Saturday yeah and you know it was a ... in that sense beating down and spectators in the in the ah\nPeople showing their cars you could just see it it's the perfect to do office one sixty five and a little breeze and some clouds and all that kind of football feeling season but yes you're right it changed well got long pants\nSo moisture is less likely to attach itself to you know whatever area because you'd get drastic changes\nThe motor home sits under a shed so to speak in other words that has a roof over top of the it's a looming um or some type of metal and you know in sweat so that gives you a pretty good idea of what metal does\nWhen you have contractions or excuse me have variations in the weather you know when you have that Seventy degree day which we're going to have to excuse me sixty degree day today and then we're going to fall off into the mid thirties\nThere's going to be a lot of ... a lot of moisture collect and if you have these ... they'll start dripping all that well you know inside\nIt's there's no difference a male do will form\nSo as long as you keep that air moving and that's probably why they say cracked window at least if you're in a garage and your windows are down to crack\nYou do have some type of ventilation because most people the garages are not heated or heat it at All right like you know their their houses only heat they have is the heat that you know retaining off the walls or the inter walls\nBut when you go out the one thing that they help people always forget that seems like they always forget until it's in their face is for those people keeps her parked car parked outside [noise] is that when shield washer jog\nYeah make sure it's feeling awful water you know fully wiper\nAnd we've all done it yeah maybe a\nRabbit and also what I Do and I think that normally the vehicle I'm driving is it is I keep it stays outside I have a two car garage the vehicles and but the one I drive back and forth to the the car lot\nSits outside is if it's going to get very cold or snow or ice\nUp all of the windshield way the windshield wipers away from the windshield another were in their their their flexible you just pull 'em right out\nAnd that way when I start car up the windshield is clear before or you just walk by and I got ... Russia because if you hit that windshield wiper and it's frozen on there unless you get really good blades I mean they have any weak spots at all\nIt's ... right there you are right you go oh mom down to meddle now well you don't want to do that because you scratch your windshield\nAnd these are these are things that takes about five seconds to do\nYeah that that's a really easy tips they are pulling your windshield wipers way because there's a lot of it or even if it doesn't pull it off right away you might be a a worrying away at the entirety of those things and there's nothing worse than that little strip it comes to lose and then\nYou're driving down the road and you see that strip leaving behind as your windshield wipers working you know it's about ready to fail at any time and then it starts leaving like a little\nYou know a little area that's getting cleared off right away and you can't I mean it just builds up so yeah I'm pulling the\nThe windshield wipers away from the windshield um that especially helps us I don't have a garage or a carport so for folks like me\nThat helps if you do get a little bit of snow or frost or something overnight you don't have to worry about those things being frozen to your windshield you can clean off as normal plus it gives you you know ... and living off and you don't have to worry about maneuvering around your windshield wipers or anything and then when your windshields clean and warn and ready to go you put them down and you're you're going to go\nDown in your front cows normally who are those who are most of your ice and snow collects in your front ... so if you pulled away a lot easier remove snow right debris\nYeah that's very true let's go to Jay who's called in this morning and he is coming in from Charleston good morning how you doing\nIn mourning mourning in a\nJust a quick question out jumped in the other room so I can hear it on the radio okay um got up uh my wife's cars about ready to be treated as a ten thousandth ten super forty thousand miles at great training but I'm kinda curious about the way Larry does is purchasing of vehicles\nI Know that if I sold vehicle on the open market out probably get considerably more perhaps than I Would if I traded and when I buy a new vehicle so what is the difference between let's say mob or selling it on the open market compared to what Larry might offer me in his business\nCompared to what I Would get a straight and I got to know what that number would be but I'm curious about the other two but I'll hang up and I hear your response on the radio thanks a lot of shade enjoy the show ... well\nThat's a good question and we talked about this all of a few shows go I called to risk versus the reward and now you know when you when you go to sell your vehicle or sell anything you have\nYou have to you're almost putting an open invitation to people out there in your world ... and you know today we're we're all worried about cyber attacks and all that well there's ... there's predator so I'm just going to cut to the chase their predators after waiting to send you a you know see what you have come to your house or meet him somewhere\nAnd I'm not using scare tactics but it's a world out there that's I'm not like we have known in the past\nAnd as an automobile dealer and his shows not long enough to tell you some of the stories I have been told in here in the last two years I received telephone calls\nFrom police departments outlast out west people impersonating Larry dolphins on his sales with with certified funds so to speak and the ... these are people out and I know nothing about they Googled me they they have um [noise]\nI guess they have created a clone of may somebody looked me up and I can tell you I mean I I have the police police officers name or my desk because this this was a re occurrence of a phone call I was getting worse not only me I'm sure that there's other people they were\nUsing the right word cloned but they were in person dating\nGoing at him in purchasing\nAnd all the perils and pitfalls can you sell curbside so your vehicle Oh yes it's it's ... I'm going to say it's easy to do with it you know it's fairly easy to\nDo there's resources available sure sure to do the\nBut people are shocked when the economy and how fast and easy and friendly we make it\nAnd as I tell people that you can't exactly what you want yeah maybe maybe not but I've been doing is a long time and I bought a lot of cars from individuals a lot of cars from individual I have a repeat of people I bought cars from so I Know we're doing something right\nThere and we make it very very fast in other words that we don't have to go get a bank loan we we we don't need a tidal if you have a payoff we're going to take care of that you're going to get your equity check in some cases in some cases there's negative equity probably in this case or not because he has no ten model it's probably paid for\nBut there's no reparation of us had well we've got to go get floor plan we got to go get borrowed money we you know we have to do this we have to\nI mean there's there's it's a Fifteen minute turnaround of all the stars millions lined up right\nAnd as I tell people there there's a lot of resources as you can go to the good old common sense and I have said this many times as let's trade places you become the buyer you look at your car now realistically what would you pay for the car\nAnd in somewhere in there you know we do have to create a profit because sometimes we take trade unions\nYou know we have after cell warranties may we have to dress in then we had the re conditioning factor we factor in\nBut most generally I tell people that with a reasonable person I normally by their car and we ... we bought a car the other day for two hundred dollars now that's not really what I Do right but this person come in they want to read a car ... you know it probably was a two or three hundred dollar car it wasn't much there but\nI have a resource for ... you know I Know where I can take the score and do something with it\nAnd we had you know they said just hear bad right\nBut thirty and forty thousand dollar car I mean I've gotten a variation or the variety pack of automobiles so the other day we put on Facebook and we try to put something on Arab day and I think we put in our we buy cars we back ours everyday were previously would cars or something\nAnd somebody said would you buy two hundred and sixty thousand mal ... to come\nAnd I said sure bringing in I have known two of them I've got one with a hundred and fifty thousand miles and we let a light one's going to the auction tomorrow that I think it's got two hundred and forty or fifty thousand miles\nSo fast I think I see daylight\nAt the end I mean I'll buy that car right or not all is does that daylight ah as bright as I Want it to the ... I miss things believe or not I go out and see that and therefore the profit margin if any diminishes but that's okay I mean I'm In the in the business\nExactly and I think that uh um what Jay was alluding to as far as the differences goes in what Larry was illustrating there and you put it to me best before it went on previous shows that we've done at the bottom line is that when somebody comes in buys a car off the street from you if you're just advertising at curbside or whatever it might be\nIs there is the expectation and whatever that they're looking at on that car as they know that that's what they're going to get so if the inspection stickers doing a month you know they're just going to ... their they realize that they're going to purchase it right there if I'm\nNot sure about the brakes maybe they need it replaced at some point in the future again they're going to take on that cost him and they have an expectation of of taking on that cost\nWas only about the car for new it's different because when they bought a car from a dealership when they're coming to you they expect for some reasonable path to be made as far as making sure that car is going to pass inspection and the next time around there's there's cost you put into that vehicle when you purchase it because the person coming to you about off of a dealership lot\nIt has a different expectations that if you're just going to buy something\nFrom a a private individual off the street you it although both of them is that is when you're buying off the street you almost expect for them to be more warts and and there's more that you put up with because\nWell once again the score of their rumors\nLeaves the Dodgers [noise] one nothing for the third [noise] a L.

he was injured um did walk first batter what jobs would make the manager happy but also he ... that it was a lefty and left a combination that was the only left handed batter in the entire lineup so they thought maybe we're just going to do this\nRegardless with all the right hander that would then be coming up but obviously walking the first guy sort of added to the drama the situation will have

Lawrence journal world Matt Good evening welcome back to the program it's good to talk to you again yeah how's it going tonight or an imam\nThank you I Know you're really busy you got a uh a lot going on Kansas has been in the news here so let's just dive right in and they have limited time with it I thought let's start this this way I thought your paper today ... really important in good question and and we went through this a bunch on last night's program about\nIs Kansas guilty are they not guilty as bill self guilty as Curtis towns and guilty there's a lot of some antics at play here but your paper did a great job day and asked a paramount question I thought and they just simply said this can just believe it has a clean basketball program\nKind of walk us through the genesis of that and where you think Kay you is with all of this stuff that's come out here in the last few days\nThat that was a column by our sports editor a ... and ... you know we talked about it last night as has we have throughout fest three weeks and or weeks and ongoing ongoing um and you know really it's our coverage is kind of\nMirror that of the trial I guess is how you could put it I mean early on it was kind of like why is that going on I'm gay that might be a part of this because we we know about what happened last September when all the FBI investigation was made public in Kansas came up then so\nIf that's the case boy the NCAA hit them off to punish them all and then in doing so weaken their products and and and hurt their bottom line of of March Madness and the big moneymaker this ad is I mean I just can't envision a scenario where where we have a March Madness whether it's you know two or three years from now\nA without that maybe twenty of the top thirty basketball programs in the country that that just seems crazy to me so I'm there are other ways to punish them obviously you can do more than just the postseason ... and you can head of a scholarship bands you can you can suspend people and coaches and\nAnd and probation and all those things so so maybe it doesn't just come down to the bottom line of March Madness but um it it it's going to take a a herculean effort for them to go after and really equally\nHit all of these programs that are again among some of the best in their in their sports so I don't know if that'll happen I I that might be a little bit too big of an undertaking if it gets to that point it's not to that point right now and that's what puts Kansas in a pretty scary spot if you ask me because\nUm if they're looking at it doesn't go much farther than this\nThe NCAA could absolutely be looking to take just one or or one or two programs to really hammer him and really make an example of them as sort of a fear tactic to sort of show everybody look we're willing and we're able and we we did do this so\nYou might fall in line so you're not an accent and I don't know if that would work either that's that's again a little bit naive to think that might be enough to scare people um because as we've seen through this trial this is the way things go this is what college basketball\nAnd specifically recruiting who's the world of that that recruiting world that's what this is about and that has been for a long time and a lot of people know so um it it's there is a tough spot everybody's in a tough spot\nThough I mean the the people that haven't been mentioned are holding their breath I I Believe you know the the schools that have are\nAre trying to make sense of which way's up and how are we going to get through this thing and and then of course you've got the NCAA sitting there going\nOh my gosh when it's our turn what are we going to do and and I don't know that anybody has any real answers right now so that's why you get the situation where a lot of people are just waiting and waiting and waiting to see what else comes out and\nAnd and then maybe the sort of make a judgment or or act um when when it's all closer to the end because right now it's still very much a fluid situation and and uh it can go any number of direction is is pretty wild\nWell said and given the NCAA's past history that's that's a very valid point to wonder if anything will get done at all are I buddy I said we wouldn't keep you along and you got to run for some other interviews will keep following this almost certainly talk again is as more information comes to light so thanks for coming out some time always great to talk with you\nYeah it sounds great thanks for having me and and appreciate you get a quick but ah yeah we'll have a another story is probably up right now actually but but we talked to some former NCA employees that that had some\nSome I guess role would be a good way to put it it's just some you know in fractions and in committees and things like that and\nUh there's one guy at the very end of the the thought of that stuff now from bill in life and art one of our news reporters that the guy's a former NCAA guy or something like that I think he works for a committee that was of all things looking for a pushing for integrity is in in in CA Sports in\nUh this this guy who's quoted in the story flat out says hey uh yeah you'd like to see this lead to some change but I just can't see it happening in any kind of goes into detail about that that\nVery thing that I just talked about what the if it's Fifteen or twenty of these top program is just skeptical that they'll go there so that was the read as well and villains and doing a great job of covering for us as well so uh again thanks for the time and yet call anytime\nOur brother we'll talk soon thank you Matt no problem that there are there is Matt\nTait Lawrence journal world had over check that story I gets more insight into what's going on from Kansas perspective and again Kansas has a school grade that's kind of emerged in this that there's been a bunch mentioned magic named them the Kansas has really been kind of front and center on this certainly over the last week and I I think they've got significant problems there yeah ... problems because\nOf the assistant coach multiple players they do seem to be more in the spotlight than anybody else at this point\nYeah we'll keep an eye on our right to take when we come back we'll dive into a couple of your calls eight hundred seven six five eight to five I get to some taxes well at
