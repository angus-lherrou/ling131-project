A. R. breaks in the first time explained to them what you guys are all about if you will\nSo what there is all about is just next year coming up on twenty five years of producing what we believed to be the best after market breaks the United states\nAnd why after market breaks I mean the kind of breaks where you can buy replacement rotors patch I'll bet you can also buy complete systems whether you've got a sixty nine now or twenty eight teams now you know under sixty nine Mustang or twenty Nineteen Mustang\nUm we've got breaks for those\nThe big news purveyor is that uh if you have a recent jeep J. case so you're wrangler is your ... most people don't know that they sold almost four hundred thousand of those things last earth\nAnd the same everywhere and the new one is called the jails series they're very organized via Chrysler subject jail\nAnd so we've got stuff coming up for the ones that will be formally introduced at sema coming up at the end of this month the specialty equipment Manufacturers Association in Las Vegas\nAnd then they'll be generally available going in to the Christmas season just time for a bagel heavy boxes under the tree\nYou know we you know I've talked about this before I don't know if we were headed when you've been on the show but the biggest problem everybody does they lift their vehicles out they put twice the size of ram entire and make it look all pretty and it doesn't stop and least nowadays everyone's smart enough and they want to listen not smart enough you need to get a good set of breaks\nAnd would that being said I Want to overcome the objection where everyone I Know she's ... break could bear breaks expensive I'm like no they're they're very competitive with every other marketing ... market brand out there that's an after market break you guys ran alongside him when it comes to pricing correct\nYeah if you take a look at the objects catalog for example um you'll you'll see us right in there a virtually the same now in some cases I mean you know want to\nBe fair um you'll see that we're a hundred dollars or but there's a reason for that wall their break system\nYou get everything aid to actually stole the breaks so ah is it a car that requires a brand new stainless pressure resistant hoses what comes with those hosts it comes with all the ... test fit that system on that car or that truck\nSo we know everything it needs to be installed so you save yourself or five trips down to the local hardware store the local hot rod shop\nUh so you could put it all on in a weekend with ordinary tools\nIt it's amazing to me how easy it is to put on but you know what I'm going to say that even that being said but that being said\nThe the qualities there it's just like tennis shoes you can buy tennis shoes for twenty bucks and your feet or ... or or you can buy tennis shoes for a hundred dollars in your shoes or lightened are great so I called break shoes and [laughter]\nNo pun but the thing is the qualities are so I never really thought about the fact that you get every part in peace and clipped and extra little\nI mean it makes it so much easier than taking a test in in the first time I've ever installed something where I could breeze over the instructions with my mechanical background and put them on and no time in the front breaks on telling you\nTwenty minutes to put one side on complete system so other than run for re climate was simple twenty minutes done voted together I was laughing\nThat's the goal every every time just to make that easy and yeah I mean when when you're doing some work and you've got a\nNineteen Seventy challenger for forty six pack or something and you go to put that front system on it's possible [laughter]\nBetween now and forty eight years ago that something might happen you know somebody change something out of that car they got some new great idea that uh they did you know five years after they bought the car or whatnot so we've got a full set a tech people ready to pick up the phone anytime\nA walk through those questions and with the great technology we have now almost everybody has a smartphone it's like hey\nShoot is a picture show with what you got and then we can say oh look at that they actually decided to update it to those in breaks off it\nIt's warm period which was a hot swap back in Nineteen Seventy four ah but that's what you've got my friend and and we can help you get past that so we don't leave you just oh I've got a box I've got instructions it's great to have all the parts but\nThey don't fit the way I thought they were like that and it turns out it's a change so we're ready for that it\nYou know we're talking with Bill Keller beer breaks and when I say eight logs I'm not talking about the honest march radio road team right when I say it logs what does it mean to you\n[laughter]\nOkay ah the ah it was really refers to a standard out there for heavy duty three quarter ton one ton trucks that originated or with the Danish sixty and even bigger axles a floating actual styles but hold the big wheels on those trucks\nAnd for many years people upset we love your stuff or you know I asked one fifty year my Fifteen hundred GMC but you know I've just trade again for now I've got a diesel the poll you know uh my trailer\nAnd I don't want better breaks on that because yeah it's lifted leveled and I got big tires wheels on that nothing will go through an intersection like nobody's business right\nWhen he going to come out with breaks for that well that's the other big announcement coming up we'll be eight love product or we're really excited about this we're also going to have speaking of jeeps again and all that uh\nCurry manufacturing which right partner of ours uh produces a what they call rock jocks a complete axle assemblies to go under jeeps and other rock\nOr off road vehicles these are super heavy duty assemblies that make use of about eight bucks\nAnd the very first application will be stuff so if you've got that monster king of the hammer's jeep or truck or what have you you're not going to be able to have brakes on this so if you're doing traditional keeping going down the hill want control that truck because you've taken it out to Moab", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "06"}
