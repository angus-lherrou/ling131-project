state coming in or it doesn't matter what not you play it you're gonna have to contend with yet another high profile quarterback\nNo doubt about it and while Marshall fans far and wide might not have circle this game on the schedule when it came out that change last friday night when middle Tennessee beat\nDefending conference usa champion Florida Atlantic and all of a sudden even though it's only a week to a conference usa play\nAll of a sudden this games for first place and the USA's eats division and yes Rick Stockstill head coach of middle Tennessee been there a while he's the six longest tenure at head coach at all or college football how about that now seems to be a guy who\nWas built to be a coach he was up Bobby about quarterback back in the early years of what goes out and put together at Florida State I think they've had maybe one ten when season\nBefore Rick stock spoke out there but uh when he was there they started feeding Nebraska and Notre Dame and Ohio State and so Florida State became what then uh what was certainly a dynasty or many decades\nBut a year after he graduated he was already the office of coordinator at the phone cook when university down in Florida\nSo built to be a coach and I guess after years of recruiting quarterbacks and trying to get the right when he decided to build his own\nAnd he was on Fox 'til now as a senior and a a guy who's the uh sixty seven yards away from ten thousand career passing yards gets eighty five career touchdown passes by comparison for Marshall fans his numbers are right there in the middle of guys like ...\nYou know I can remember growing up Steve and you can probably end up with is when a when a quarterback passed for a thousand yards and the season that was a rare in ... in in law did go this guy's going to do it before mid season\nHe is really good and other than when he was wind up against you he is a blast [laughter]\nHe's pale and said obviously he's\nReally smart a kid who grew up you know working at video with his dad yeah but he is one of those hard of a lion guys he's got pretty good feet to he could run around not only to\nMake plays a stay alive longer and then throw a path but he'll take off and run and as soon as he crosses the line of scrimmage he goes into running back well there are no quarterbacks lived with this guy's gotta fight for every last and so like I say a blast to watch and Leslie is on the opposite side by like it will be put marshals\nWell definitely going to be a challenge to her defense tonight and then we'll see how it goes one time he goes on the

made us a friday congratulations weekend as here it's a great weekend we have to run and do what is happening down over this already dam or in a few minutes ago who's a presenting the music of your lifetime down there on the boulevard and also over on ESPN one in four or one of six or seven fourteen Ninety\nAbout your power does here we're going to talk a little bit about uh it is it a sinuses at allergies because this is actually an important question at or is it both right right exactly because it could be both ... and I and I think uh what\nWhat people come to see me about is trying to figure it out you know they're you know ... many of my patients has come directly from a primary care physician who say okay this is so and so has having a problem we think they need surgery and got the CAT scan but really that's that's hopefully that's not what your therefore you're you're there to figure it out sometimes\nIt's sinus infection sometimes it's just nasal congestion sometimes it's nice breathing issues which are an an atomic problem sometimes and sometimes it's allergy especially in our environment where we have this overlap but both seasonal and what we call perennial allergies that the mold and the dust mind Anders\nIt's important to figure it out and get get the treat and done correctly\nOver the counter the other thing is obviously these companies have they they're owned by us if you know they are publicly traded companies they want to get back their investment so\nI think holding back on going over the counter really ... you know they they were able to make a little bit more money for a longer period of time experience today that are empty and everything and all of them now all of them now like for example that size though that that went almost directly to over the counter had a very short period of time or his prescription but\n... that that the topic is always fascinated me I I did want to circle back around for just a moment because I'm doing shows or whether you leading up to the recent times we had talked about how ah it's been there's been a little bit more moisture than usual mode is a little bit more of a problem and we've seen it in our schools here in ... county ... more of a problem\nYou know that's not enough I mean people hold the county schools responsible evident ultimately they are but we're seeing the types of of Mother Nature yeah I mean we're seeing things that we haven't really seen recently as far as the ... the amount of a ... witnessed that there is the temperature distribution I mean all these things are a little different than what we're used to experiencing\nAnd I discovered I had a problem in my house not just a a moisture problem that was causing some issues with mould actually have an air flow problem I didn't even know that I had and so I had to call out especially since they may not have some issues with\nHot air and moisture kind of hanging around in my kitchen I have mold is uh in my cabinet for some reason although there is no direct moisture being introduced to it so we had to have somebody come out and take a look at it and it ends\nThat I have an older home that we remodeled but it ends up that uh the way that it's structured on the outside as prohibiting the Airflow which is making this happened I Would have never have known that if I wasn't being cognizant of there being moisture problems or mold problem and then doing research for mayor so it was important to kind of be aware of your environment we've done shows on it before and there are structural engineers\nThat'll come out to your house I say that you know and it the evaluation does not need to be expensive and remediation doesn't usually need to be expensive either but you need to have the right stuff done so again you know the lady I asked the lady about well you have a basement and have you looked for most only to have a basement\nI said well what is your house built on is it built on a slab or across space and she said well it's on across space so I said somebody needs to go under there and take a look at if it's just you know exposed soil needs to be treated\nNeeds to be covered that needs to be some sort of ventilation and could just be livers or fans or things like that and that that can make all the difference in the world\nYeah for for me it was amazing one of the first signs I started to see is along the borders of the outside on my wall where we're at the butts up against the yard\nI have a I have mosque growing now like I mean I have a lot of ... I mean I was in ... long enough to know there's the moisture are happening on that side of the house as Russia\nAnd the sun never sets on there as well as on there as well it was called ... reserve for three or four or five fifty fifty eight three there for three or four or five fifty eight fifty eight doctor bipolar disease from the ear nose throat positions and surgeons of Charleston more information on line in the polar dot com\nEat in the polar dot com we're talking this morning about a diagnosis between sinus issues allergy issues things along those lines\nAnd uh the care that are that it could require a as Dr Ballard said earlier maybe something happens where it leads to a surgery or balloon signed a classy something along those lines but maybe it's just something with some sort of a a patient care that you can take care of yourself\nBut the key to that is as you have to go in and see the appropriate doctor first that's right the\nPrime that sinus investigator\nAnd that's a great way to put it exactly you have to see the Sherlock Holmes assigned of me aside where you ... I like that I like that\nSo so if someone is having some of these issues and and we alluded to in the in the er er last discussion that we're having before Jim called in um if somebody is having issues where they it seems to be somewhat cyclical like they think seasonal based ... they've always put it up the allergies so\nI think what could happen if somebody tries to self diagnose and so they're just taking in a histamine because they think that it's an allergy problem maybe they're not getting the managed relief that they're expecting to get and they think you know I just have bad allergies that may not be the case though it could be something completely different\nAnd and for some of my patients ... my name's Apollo patience is a fair amount of overlap so they'll have symptoms all year long\nBut they hit the predisposition there the root cause may actually be um mold allergies you know there's something called allergic fungal thing inside us and you know the the treatment for that is to remove the polished but after the treatment for removing the policy really have to address the mold exposures in your house or maybe some form of therapy or shots\nYeah and that's the important thing to keep in mind whether we have got to look in the news is that once again if you have any questions you can give us a call we're going to take our break if you have any questions as to the right time to get in line waiting to get on with Dr bothered when you get back from the commercial break our number is reserved for three or four or five fifty fifty eight\nYou can find out

three there for three or four or five fifty eight fifty eight\nThat are probably an hour talking over there in the commercial break and one of the things that he brought up that I forgot to mention as we were talking about\nThe mode issues and things along those lines sometimes and you know it's it's\nMy wife sometimes they'll say things that are so obvious to me that I didn't think about I feel kinda dumb afterwards but after I was kind of a um a freaking out over this mode issue that we were having this moisture issue that we're having I'm like oh my goodness what are we will be able to do is going to take thousands of dollars to change all these different things around\nShe was just like can't we get a humidifier and run mad until we get everything fix wouldn't that also solve the problem and I was like\nI don't know about solve it but it would certainly address a large portion issue you're right honey let's go get ourselves with the humidity\nIsn't that just that you can't take things there are sprays that you can spray on mold to kill them other than just that you know very dilute solution bleach but obviously\nLeech a chlorine is caustic seem to be very careful when you use it for things that are the you know ... uh most of the fires and so films that actually get rid of mold there are things that like you said earlier you've got the uh the mosque kind outside your house\nThere are things that kill moss in Boulder you can spray outside of that take care of some of that\nSay ... putting my thoughts together regarding that the show I said well let you know we can put symptoms for sinus and symptoms for allergy you write the difference and\nIt's such an enormous amount of overlap but\n[noise] you know well we're just I like to separate them out for patients because I I think that people look at that\nAnd they say well what do I want to make better you know Mrs Smith what do you want me to make better about\nYour sinus symptoms are you having coffee at nighttime drainage at nighttime isn't nasal breathing is it you know return infection with you know purely Mukasey nasal drain in are you having wheezing are you having a cough is breathing worse on one side compared to the other\nAnd for the most part there is a lot of overlap so that the most common reason people get a sinus infection actually is they get a series of bad colds\nThe colds produce swelling up inside the nose the mucus gets trapped back there or whatever bacteria there stays there for a long period of time it kinda works its way down into the sinus bones right\nAnd so you know those are the patients that sometimes I Need a small amount of surgery it's kind of release that\nThat the second most common is probably patients that have nasal allergies they had for the same reason you know they have nasal a demon congestion but for whatever reason\nThey well they do get infections um they don't necessarily need to have surgery the same amount as that other individual had a an acute infection that you know that things got trapped we seem to be a little bit better at reducing reducing the swelling if we don't\nGo back um are meant as a college football
