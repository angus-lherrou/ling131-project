good so far so good will will will get into that here in the second uh obviously so you're at the red river rivalry and you watch Texas\nTake down the sooner within twenty four hours after that uh the defensive coordinator is is removed and you've got rough and McNeil stepping up there what is the in Europe perception what's the reaction among the ... the Oklahoma fan base as to that decision\nOh I'm celebration in the streets it was probably the best way to ... all over you know the people that aren't happy are mad because it took him so long to file a bike I mean might is the cause of every state of Oklahoma\nIlliterate oil [laughter]\nBut um you know\nJust it just wasn't working a lot of people thought he should have done after the Rolling Stone\nLooked pretty good against a clinic lots of good against UCLA not very good at all in style state couldn't stop on them all up and down the field and then Texas scores are six touchdowns touchdowns in to go on twelfth possessions\nTo which they were weren't really trying to score they were just trying to milk cook\nMhm so it was a disaster portions I didn't think he would do it at its season but by the\nBy the third quarter Saturday and the cat and below I knew that my stoop Sarah was was mad at San Diego will probably at the end of this ... yeah\nUm what's the reaction now that rough and McNeil isn't looks from this perspective that that's a really good pick\nWhile he's wildly popular among the players you know fired from Lubbock to Greenville North Carolina the norm love the guy he's\nAn old school all he's a ... but now I Would say strict but not yell at my um cars will react very well\nI don't know what that is going to look like on defense um I don't know how that's going to make them cover better we'll tackle better or [noise] or stand up to opposing linemen and running quarterbacks better I don't know any of that\nBut I Do think it will go well for Lincoln I'm Sorry while for Lincoln an for often\nJust because they did need a new voice mhm they detonate a new a new face and what they were doing ... wasn't working five states\nIs old school you get ...\nThis is the twenty first century that kinda stuff you can always work anymore and um there was a time when the defense Nader was their laws and that time is not now so I don't know how much it's going to help you know\nVery do you think that this ultimately could be a permanent position for Russian McNeil or is this a do you think in the end of the seasons there'll be out looking for a new defense coordinator\nI Can't imagine it being permanent um for one thing we're up in not in great physical shape and he's he's got some health issues he came into the interview room last night Norman\nTo get down into the interview you actually come in from a side door if you're from the locker room you got three or four steps to walk down\nAnd you know that you know the players just take it one step\nYou know less normal adults you know we just walk down the steps rough and looked like he was going down inside of a mountain\nWhen I was very tedious foreign so he's not in great shape he moved up\nTo the press box this year just because his movement on the sidelines was not very good so I think this is a temporary thing I don't know yeah there was some talk that he wasn't going to coach that much longer could move into some kind of administrative role helping Lincoln\nUm so I I think there'll be in the market for defensive coordinator\nVery tremble the Oklahoma and joined us how surprised were you to what's going on at the ... state\n[noise] well I'm a little bit surprised\nI'm surprised that this bad on defense you know I've always had the right off the ball in the in the in the summer\nAnd even in September everything was about to quarterback um who's gonna play quarterback and then it was going to be is Taylor Cornelius good enough to to win this job good enough to keep this job high end and people\nWere so now the other guys who were on the other guy\nAnd lo and behold he thinks is off\nThe fence is about as bad as\nAs I'll use I mean I was ... goes down the Fort Worth scores fourteen point week ago Saturday Stillwater entertain scored forty eight yeah so and that's what the truth about making that they do now is pretty good looks a block party\nBut man they had no answer on that experience it only has been but it's
