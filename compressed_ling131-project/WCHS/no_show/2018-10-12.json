loans\nAttorney Rudy will have to call that game and he joins us now in the morning news ... morning good morning to Chris well I listen to you guys on sports on all week long and you have thoroughly terrified me about was waiting for West Virginia on Saturday Night\nYou're making it sound like that stadium in in the middle of a cornfield like mountain air field on a Saturday Night and that's a scary feeling\nWell I didn't mean to terrify you by any stretch but I Do think that you cannot go into this thing thinking that you're going to walk in there and all of a sudden three and a half hours later walk out and that's going to be an easy and I work I don't think that's got to be the case at all I think that\nAs you take a look at the two sides and you see the momentum that Iowa State has generated after its upset when at Oklahoma State last week on the road coupled with this quarterback that came out of really no one aware although I Would say that certainly knew about it is part\nOf it makes for this week's really really interesting and obviously the stakes are high for for west\nVirginia well and it would probably help everybody's confidence that the mountaineers themselves had shown a little more promise in the past few outings at least the the second half of Texas Tech and then last week what everybody expected to be a cakewalk was not an image got everybody going into no\nRight I agree with you a hundred percent and and to be quite honest with you that may be something positive to be honest I maybe that's the glass half full to me I think that maintains focus for this West Virginia team and they can use that have used that coaches ever use that over the last two weeks eight guys yeah\nOr undefeated however we this is what we're doing wrong this is why we're not playing well so to me those are bumps more so than than than issues that aren't going to be correct for West Virginia I think West Virginia he goes on there tomorrow by all accounts\nIn the right frame of mind the right focus and and they'll give it you know the the whole deal is so to me I'm not worried that there's a smell major malfunction within this team I think it was more of a matter of getting some stuff cleaned up\nThen finally this ... as you mentioned this is I was they get a quarterback\nYou know a year ago he was buying milk shakes where his girlfriend after friday night contest now he's playing division one college football for 'em and and one of the power of five conferences\nYou know that's true Chris however is numbers in high school he was a player the state of
