business right there I think nowadays things have changed dramatically and not for the better and uh so when I see a sports writer like\nYeah I Do I Do don't you agree yeah me too man and certainly there I\nThink a lot of ways it's the last I think it's a lost it's a it's a it's a losing art it's a lost art\nFor for what it used to be and how stories used to be written in al coverage used to be done and you know this man the day is James right I mean now I Would have I don't know what they're doing it Iowa State but everywhere around the country you're getting limited access to players nowadays limited access to coaches and you can't have those relationships which gives you that\nGood ... good nugget stuff agree\nYeah no that that's right and in Iowa State we don't get and if it's the same thing everywhere I'm not everywhere but most every place I'm and I'm assuming it to send me a West Virginia we can't talk to two freshman\nWe cannot talk to a true freshman what kind what kind of handcuffs us right now because I was states start football or just happens to be right now a true freshman so\nAfternoon and they all the lights the black uniforms but they say they don't know

to do that thing right they're gonna have hanging in the lockers and the guys come back and they're going to be there and get the big celebration or ... or or you know what you\nMean yeah I think they come out on the field and work out in their normal stuff yeah I don't listen\nTo this and this is Bruce was coaching at Iowa State a million years ago and and I was state was playing at Iowa\nAnd and um they they went out on the field at Iowa State went out on a kick in and worked out before the game you know like they always do they went back in the locker room and they found uniform jerseys at least Jersey says said beat Iowa\n... years means that the pilot and the plan that can extend Bruce\nAnd they're playing that can it I think that you and they were so excited oh my gosh that's got the new uniforms catches jerseys and he beat out this is cool yeah we're in a quest there and give them hell on I think it was like forty eight to\nNothing [laughter] I think that in that when I see now
