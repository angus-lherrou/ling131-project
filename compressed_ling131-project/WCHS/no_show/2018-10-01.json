three percent\nSo it looks like the fourth quarter could be positive\nAnd there's an indication that we could see and when do we earlier today the the GDP for the year could be a three to four percent\nYeah they have the second reading last week and I it was over four percent now we get non farm payrolls this Friday so all eyes are going to be on that to see especially because interest rates\nThe fed raises rates last week it's widely historically viewed that rising interest rates hurt equities which is not necessarily the case I was reading some statistics last night\nSaid that's not always the case it early on interest rates are rising because you have a strong economy a strong economy is positive for equities it's when you get in the latter part of the interest rate hikes that they become negative and historically that's had a five percent\nLevel and right now the ten years a little over three so you still have a ways to go before bombs start stealing assets away from stocks\nYeah what else are we doing anything else looking at this one is going to ... minutes here\nUm that that's really most of the the news that up saying of course all of ... mostly headlines like you know a lot like I said it's it's it's it's been a pretty good year for the first nine months um\nThere was I mean regardless of how you feel about Trump and lord knows there's plenty of opinions about him but\nHe did this agreement is something he's then we begin and we got to know whether or not you know I'm sure the devil's in the details as when reads anything different than what NAFTA was but I have to believe that the we talked about it it will be and is is that sort of optimism that few optimism that kind of similar agreement with China\nAre these are these ... you've been talking about for a long time simply leverage\nWell I mean China can't compete I saw were very important that China I think I read Nineteen percent I'm Chinese exports are purchased by American consumers that makes the United states the number one trading partner with China so there's er leverage no and\nAnd they can't compete with that so but the fundamentals when you look at the fundamentals of the market you have low interest rates still you have a solid GDP Growth as you mentioned you have double digit earnings per share grows\nStable dollar all of those are positive for stocks now everyone we're in the month of October and typically bad things happen even though it's been a positive\nQuarters of the month since Nineteen eighty but jet black friday and Nineteen eighty seven as a twenty three percent decline oh wait you had the Lehman Brothers collapsed which took Eighteen percent off the market in the month of October that historically\nThough the wind writing a fourth quarter Chris is an eighty two percent\nSo that means stock market returns are positive for out of five years and the fourth quarter\nAnd typically first quarter sixty seven percent when right sixty four percent second quarter sixty two percent of third quarter and eighty two percent when right in the fourth quarter that's a pretty good odds\nAre on that on and do it a year out for a day you'll be back

we'll dive into some of ours right now goose I'll give you the honors let's start with likes gimme gimme a life that you had coming out of Saturday um I I don't think this\nIs hard teeth Washington\nI thought he was fantastic\nThe number one weakness of this team going into the off season the number one question mark was a secondary specifically who was going to play cornerback he stepped in seven tackles five solo tackles quite a few past breakups\nSo I agree with that and you know that's a that's a good one number to dislike\nInefficiency the office and the second half penalties and the old line allowing sex\nAnd keep going and uh like David long disliked consistent running game to close a game out some more or like big twelve road when dislike future it yellow helmets probably cause the second half let down [laughter]\nThey were wearing them in the first [laughter] I don't mind the yellow as much when they that look on Saturday that doesn't bother me I Know I Know a lot of you don't like that that gold helmet but I I really done it the old white goals is a pretty good looking bummed me out as much\nAlright three things that this another tax like the office of lying driven given Greer plenty of time in the pocket best I've seen the old line well I'll tell you what that first half I went back and I was watching the game today I'm not sure he took a hit until one Nineteen to go in the first half\nAnd yet he got it took a hard one one night I don't know that he got hit you guys were on the air but at the ... who was uh I forget\nWho the amount of Brooks was doing a color commentator in on the game for ESPN two and he mentioned that multiple times throughout the first half where he goes I don't think we'll Greer has seen the turf yet yeah and there was one play where a guy got free and he kind of play action and he actually\nGot knocked down a block and then when I have seen an episode of that way that you're talking about and they mentioned it on the broadcast as well that's the first time that he got\nTouched all pro football focus pulled out of that onset late Saturday Night or maybe it was yesterday might have been Sunday about Greer sufficiency from a clean pocket\nAnd what jumped out to me he had thirty one attempts from a clean pocket\nLike I read that says like oh huh that that's like a game for a lot of guys thirty one attempts from a clean pocket and again I really do I think that was the first hit at one Nineteen to go and have\nAnother like from that same texture before bones injury that defense was very disruptive if Texas text passing game agree with that as well we we weren't sure how this defense would react facing a Texas Tech team that was so proficient at passing we just had not seen West Virginia do it this year I I thought Bowman was\nWas looked like a freshman quite frankly he ... he ... he looked like he did not want to be out there after a couple of those hits you've looked confused and took a bunch of ... he looked like West Virginia fans wanted him to look when you talked about\nFact that they he was facing a defense a scheme that he had never seen before and the speed that just West Virginia defense has yet he looked like he wanted no part of it there is a good statute to back it up to do another like that we talked about last week and you guys talked about West Virginia seven uh fourteen on third down pretty good fifty percent\nRed zone three opportunities three\nTouchdowns and that's how you went on the way that is good and the third down that number was even better if you just take the first half I mean they were clipping along at first half of that stuff that came back to life and the second half\nOr came back down to reality or another tax I was on the edge for the second half I think where we dropped so many passes it caused us to lay down and die defense want it for us go defense yeah I think there's no question and\nI said the Saturday if if you've played sports at any level quite frankly including use when the game's going like that and it's thirty five to ten and you're just whip and the bottom of the guy across from me I don't care what sport you're talking about you know pretty quickly whether you're better than the guy across from ya\nYeah and there's a there's a lot of times when you get a big it's just human nature to say\nThat we're getting we got this and then Texas Tech goes to its third string quarterback you pointed out in the break then he throws a pick on top of that\nI can see where that ... do you want it to happen no does it make coaches lose their mind yes probably the number one thing that drives coaches that's sure but I don't know if there's many teams across the country that in twelve games are Thirteen games are when you play\nEvery game you step on the ... for the whole time so I think you do have to allow a little that would you rather not happen certainly what can you get away with it later in the year it gets better teams no probably not but at least you you got away with it this week yes that's exactly how\nComebacks happen and you know on a general level that's how upset happen\nGenerally if the team with the best talent shows up and plays the way that they're supposed to play they win the game but that's not how it always happens for that reason that you just mentioned sometimes you get over confident whether it be before the game or during the game it's natural human behavior\nOr I'd like to do a couple of more real quick slight twist on the like I liked that we left the game with a lot to work on Kansas could become a trap game with the announcement\nOf the night game that's I was dating means really feel will come out just dump KU disliked the entire second half like an experienced the DX variance day running quarterback might help against do you have experience seeing one\nDisliked seem lackadaisical went up by points you know as we just said another tax like corn or play of Washington in Norwood disliked inept running\nGame and more and more than\n\n... ... ... ... I think that's I think that's it for now David long had Fifteen tackles in that game\nHe did save your mid ... says yeah clearly including what I consider to be the big other than West Virginia the biggest place for Texas Tech that allow this come back to happen\nI don't think there's any debate was that jet Duffy fourth down scramble or to West Virginia defenders ran into each other in the backfield and it was like oh man we can uh you know there could have been a ... in the game was over and then he scrambles out and then once you started to run I think every West Virginia fan was like yes\nThey had um cornered in somehow\nBetween ... and David Law and neither one of ...\nI've never I've never seen this David long did not attempt to tack let me just put his shoulder down I don't know if he thought he was closer to the sidelines and above where I Would push 'em out of bounds but he didn't had had and they tend to tell you I've never I've never seen that are in in Stanford Tony Saturday during our podcast we're talking about that particular said knowing David long like you do\nHe probably comes out and has twenty seven tax cuts Saturday ... oh you are here you had ... by the end is after it after ...\nAll right one more ah one more like here oh here's questions says if you flip the haves do you feel better about the when that's a really good question\nYes that's a really good question I think the answer's yes ...
