U. S. greenhouse gas emissions\nDecreased by two points seven percent\nFrom a period between two thousand sixteen and two thousand and Seventeen and the American Petroleum Institute has reacted to that news and with the is the American Petroleum Institute vice president for regulatory and economic policy tile\nOf helped me with your last name again I'm Sorry it's either cower Isaac our ... our tried to write it down fanatical unit threw me off tile either as one of those on the inside jail thanks for coming on we appreciate it put this in perspective here put this into perspective for us this news\nWell it is good news and obviously ah when you have ... uh emissions reductions a that's a good thing I'm a and it jibes pretty well with data with other data sources from the government for example the I Am the energy information administration under the the department of energy [noise]\nUm ... uh has its own a inventory that it puts out a on a G. H. G. and see oh Charlie missions and then what they've identified as actually [noise] uh right now in twenty uh Eighteen or using twenty Seventeen data are we are at\nTwenty five year lows for C. O. two missions here in the United states and what's interesting about that\nIs that is what is driving that\nUh and and what the IRA data shows is that the primary reason why C. O. two emissions are at those twenty five year lows\nIs because of natural gas use in the power sector so what we've seen is significant reductions in the power sector since two thousand six and that was the the year in which a C. O. two emissions peaked and then started dropping a and since two thousand six\nSixty percent of the emissions reductions from I'm from the power sector have actually come from some fuel switching to natural gas so natural gas is really driving not just the power sector but but all of a the admissions ... much of the emissions reductions that we're seeing in the United states right now\nWell we just did a segment to before the news with Jackie steward of energy in depth talking about how high or low in Pennsylvania or a head of the curve in terms of natural gas power production so it is a ... a lot of that is coming from the Appalachian region right\nAbsolutely uh so you're saying ... obviously the Marcellus Shale at Utica shelves of these are very very prolific a natural gas place uh to the point where I'm a you know the the break even costs have been reduced significantly\nOr in these more mature plays like like the Marcellus or to the point where uh you know we've got break even cost ... below two dollars per million BTU a and that you know in in many areas\nAre and that makes natural gas just such a a an economic fuel or for the power sector and brother ah applications um that you know the great thing about this is when you're looking at emissions reductions and I think we all can agree that emissions reductions all things considered equal or a good thing um\nBut when you look at at uh what is driving that it's not necessarily a regulatory driver that's pushing this it's not you know administrative the odd it's not the president saying we have to do this\nOr that or it's the economics of it so the economics the shale developments are are are such that uh we're producing the most ...\nMost cost effective fuel source for power generation and other industrial applications and that's really what has been driving a the emissions reductions that we've seen over the last ten Fifteen Years and it's a it's obviously a real a real positive for a for the economy and for the environment\nWe are with Kyle Isaac our he's vice president of the regulatory and economic policy with the American Petroleum Institute\nLoosening some of the regulations that we've seen the last couple of years and this proposed affordable clean energy rule how much is that had to do with burning the growth of least the last couple of years\nWell I think it's important to keep this in perspective when we talk about regulatory a modifications ... regulatory changes we're not talking about fewer regulations are lesser regulations loosening what we really are looking for smarter regulations so we want we want to be able to get\nThe same environmental benefits without\nAll the uh the cost of compliance and that's really what on the um [noise] uh the the current administration has been focused on so we applaud their efforts [noise] um [noise] but again the uh the regulatory a efforts are to uh to make you know regulation smarter more cost effective\nThere are certainly helpful but when it really has been driving this or just the economics of shale\nUh it it really is just the overriding a factor in terms of growth in um in natural gas development and and the growth is really pretty significant if you look year over year from\nLast July to this we've actually increased from about Seventy four billion cubic feet per day of production to about eighty three billion cubic feet per day of a production so you're talking about more than ten percent increase in just one year's time that\nIs just phenomenal and unprecedented growth in um in in natural gas development and that's why ah\nNot only are we are we seeing an increase in um in natural gas used domestically but we also have an access that we can we can export through a ... year pipelines to ah Canada and Mexico\nAnd also on ships through liquefied natural gas and this is really a tremendous boom or to the U.S industry in the U.S economy creating more jobs and you know increasing tax revenue for the government it's it's a win win all around\nYou know not to mention that the clean air as you pointed out the cleanest Darren decade due in part to the increased use the natural gas to generate power\nSure and and not only is it ... it it it does natural gas have a few or\nA CEO to emissions relative to uh to to the pills are replacing\nThat are also is a is a a burns much cleaner uh in terms of things like mercury and a a much nitrogen oxides solver a oxides so uh it's it's improving air quality in in numerous ways\nAre very good tell us a little bit about your organization the American Petroleum Institute\nOr thanks are we are a a word trade association based\nHere in Washington DC uh we uh have been around for almost a hundred years or will be celebrating our hundredth

just had a kind of say Emma what's wrong\nAnd she says I'm going to show you around the school\nTo which we said yes some of your show in your classroom you're showing us raw to which Emma and her little first grade way she says how can I lead\nYou if you're in front of me\nYou see that day because Shelley and I are you been to the school we had an idea of where we were going\nIn our normal parent way we just kind of gotten a front and there we were in emerald saying but wait a minute I\nLead I\nLead you\nI don't know how about you but there's times where I tend to get in front of God\nI tend to literally get in front of his instruction I get in front of the line and God saying listen\nI'm gonna let you do that because of free will\nActually desire to instruct you a desire to teach you I desire to show you the way but in order to do that you've got to let me lead\nOh maybe a people\nOf faith who follow the leader we follow none other than Jesus Christ if he's the leader we've

the Romans\nIn the first chapter and verse is Eighteen to twenty\nWe read for God's wrath is revealed from having against all God listening is an honor righteousness of people who buy their on righteousness depressed the truth since what can be known about God is ended in among then\nBecause God has shown it to them\nFor his in visible attributes that is his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen since the creation of the world being understood through what he is may\nAs a result people are without excuse just to note all scripture used on so you can find it's taken from the Christian Standard Bible with the permission of home Bible publishers\nSo Paul contends that God has shown the truth about himself is eternal power and divine nature since the creation of the world main understood through what he has made\nNature provides testimony or the existence of God that's what Paul is saying is\nNot the first biblical rider to do so either\nTsongas declared insulin

power of God also consider these words from solemn eight\nWhen I observe your happens the work of your fingers the moon and the stars which you set in place what does human being that you remember him a son of man that you look after him\nVersus three and four there aren't many films I feel like I just have to see nowadays but I just have to see first man controversy not withstanding verse man tells the story of Neil Armstrong\nAnd NASA's mission to land a man on the move the whole idea of landing a man on the moon though it happened eight years before I was born hasn't treat me as long as

impacted his face he said to look at it this kind of creation and not believe in God is to me impossible it just strengthens my faith\nTo be fair and not every astronaut responded to their experiences by contemplating the greatness of God some perhaps didn't believe in God still given what the biblical riders stage it about nature including space\nBeing evidence offered by God himself to demonstrate is eternal power and divine nature\nHow these men responded to their experiences\nIs quite injury\nThe point here is that evidence exists and each of us must determine what we'll do with the evidence\nWe will have to decide where it's leading us will continue to consider the evidence of nature in the coming weeks\nBut if you believe in God and do not have a relationship with him or
