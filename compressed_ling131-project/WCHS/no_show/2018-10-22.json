Thursday morning at eight twenty devoid of junk bond rating WC Asia [noise]\nSeven thirty six on the morning News Good morning I'm Chris Lawrence on metro news the boys West Virginia the boys metro news decided the courage of all\nChris thirty five years ago the west Virginia Supreme Court issued a decision on abortion that pro life and pro choice advocates have been arguing about ever since\nThe court ruled three two in women's health center of West Virginia versus bad up into the state had an obligation to pay for abortion for a woman if she's too poor to pay for it herself\nSupporters day that ruling demonstrates the state's compassion for pregnant women and difficult circumstances and helps protect the right to stab wishing roe versus Wade opponents say the taxpayer so under no obligation to pay for what are typically elective abortions and that brings us to this defining moment on the issue\nOn election day West Virginia voters will decide whether to pass or reject amendment one\nThat proposed amendment to the state constitution states quote nothing in this constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion\nThe pro life movement which backs the amendment does it simply means the state should not use Medicaid dollars taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion\nThey argue is similar to the federal hide them in which has been in place since Nineteen Seventy seven that prevents the use of federal dollars for abortions except in cases where the mother's life is in danger or in cases of rape or incest pro choice advocates who oppose the amendment maintained that it is purposefully confusing\nAnd they are especially concerned about the first half of the amendment which they believe opens the door to even more restrictions on a woman's right to choose\nFrankly the language is unnecessarily boring lawmakers drafting the amendment should have combined the second part of the amendment along with language that mirror the Hyde amendment to ensure protections for victims of rape incest and the mother's life\nBe that as it may the fundamental question remains the same for voters should taxpayers pay for abortions former Justice John McHugh in his dissent in the Nineteen Ninety three case wrote as long as the government does not interfere with a woman's right to choose an abortion\nThe decisions regarding the funding of abortion should be left to the legislature\nIn other words it's a public policy decision not a court decision West Virginia is one of his Seventeen states to provide Medicaid dollars were abortions\nLast January the state department of health and human resources report it to the legislature that in twenty Seventeen West Virginia paid three hundred twenty six thousand dollars for one thousand five hundred sixty abortions what voters must decide on election day is whether that is an appropriate use of public dollars Chris\nUh your hobby and hobby will be
