percent agree that it's an important financial miles down\nThe first step is that down payment and that is a major road block for a lot of people that can be in and it can be really\nDaunting because you know for somebody who is you know relatively young and there's just getting started with their financial life there would be the largest single sum of money that they probably put into anything on

a way to get into a house with twenty thousand dollars you know I put eight thousand dollars on my first call so there are opportunities in their mortgage programs they could potentially take

have a little bit more\nA level of comfort in order to be able to take on that type of obligation because as we know there is paying for the house and then there's maintained about so there's always

producers are innovative and they find ways to develop resource cost effective way so we're still seeing as a growth in production I anticipate that to continue over the years um and you know I think I think there is great opportunities as a result of that\nOne thing that Ohio seems to be a little bit ahead of the curve on is the use of gas for power plant facilities and I believe the numbers ten right in the ... just in the past four or five years and\nNatural gas power plants have been approved a somewhat in various stages of development but that's a pretty big number\nAbsolutely um you know

all in the state of Ohio a it's a great opportunity for I'm\nOne of the gas producers to find another markets for gas but also for consumers senior I'm no benefit from low natural gas prices we've

New Mexico\nAfter his baptism his career plans changed from being a physician to becoming a priest a spiritual physician his wife said if the ... is also a convert to do at the next phase and his his as he says much better half and spiritual support together they joined fully raised seven children all born here in or they're in Salt Lake City\nPurity have ... more like how they came into is that almost now I'm\n... years will do thank God ... let's let's talk for a minute about you you mentioned it\nA walking in the streets people will see you they will talk with you so they must be some misconceptions that people have about the eastern orthodox faith and how do you help that converts appreciate the EPA's decision because ... being a convert into the church\nOr you can also be a dangerous thing\nAnd people don't like it when I say that but I see it with all love because you know a good she takes time to see and to be good to the taste or coming in people can get excited they can see one thing they like and they ...\nInto it and then once they're in the soup of uh the alphabet soup of orthodox did they say well what did I Do here so I'm sure there are misconceptions I'm Wondering what what you heard\nWell I think you're absolutely right I as a convert myself I can definitely say that they're absolutely you know the struggles for people that come out to the faith and I think that\nThere's more and more some kind of learning how to help them do that and the ... I think there is so funny or something like that it takes twenty five years to start becoming a Christian you know [laughter] um and so again I'm blessed our community is really mixed\nSo all of our wonderful folks you know or not you know we have some we have a great community some over here but most of them go there we have Romanians Russians Bulgarians and and they you know their faith too well but they just live it kind of seeps out of them and we're all very close and so\nThey they they they they appreciate and they're shocked by the deal at the conference and they take seriously what they've always had but the other hand you know Congress another trying so hard to do something I said look they're not trying to do something that's trying to be\nYou know it's something you could start strain and so hard and just kind of be and be patient and it said journey here and start community doesn't gender that people take each other under their wing you know and that's a big blessing but misconceptions I think our\nYou know this is the original church of absolutely it's original church oh but I see a problem you know maybe I don't like you for the just not like this or that may be you know the the the scales are falling from our eyes no it's\nThe church of the bride of Christ but it has human central people in it so there's going to be it's a hospital that's got people in it so I think that's a misconception everything's perfect because of the original church which of course is not true um I think that initially they come and when they see me on the streets they think are you Catholic\nYou know you got the there's a kind of a Catholic or are you or maybe my where my Catholic they'll say even with the big cross and they'll say are you a are you a golf are you a new age or are you a ... I asked the other day\nI got I suppose the rabbi the other day actually with a huge cross on and it wouldn't happen to New York but here in Utah people are not aware of different religion so um\nI Would say two things really I'd say one misconceptions are orthodoxy totally unknown and I think that's a a a joy and it's too bad one it's\nThe joy that it hasn't been bastard dies and it hasn't been\nYou know modernized and kind of like that like many other religions in the world but it's sad because it's if it's the ... of great prices and nobody knows about it so um but I Would say that's for newcomers in the streets for a new people that come in I think the biggest misconception is like you said that it's all just changed my mind oh you know I was Catholic\nBut you know and you know I'm gonna change my mind but enough conception the pope and boom now you're orthodoxy and so our bishop metropolitan Joseph one thing I Love about him as he's insistent upon a deep long ... so our parish policy is that if you're unless you're marrying one of our folks you know current folks but in general\nYou become a cat a human about the church new year itch time and you have to go through the whole church here um you have to pass through fasting and actually experiencing all that and then everyone's received on on holy Saturday and that way\nThe flashes and the parents don't have time to work it out and the struggle a bit and it's not just a oh I read a book about that I see I'm ready to be with us\nIn those two let's not let's not kid ourselves there are those two who are ... worth of those\nWho knew very little about their faith and at some point in their life they come to an awakening so that that sort of steady as you just said with metropolitan Joseph and we love and respect very much um gives you that sort of a runway\nThat on that runway you can go through all the different seasons of the church you get to go to the fasting you get to see what is the full picture\nAnd why are these things being done because many times you know we were called I'm sure you've heard is that the Orthodox Church is called the marine corps now face a because you fast and you do this and do that well but there's there's it means\nTo the end that's why they're not they're in and of themselves and that's where sometimes newly enlightened orthodox Christians or those have converted will become more than I can get stuck in that sort of a spot in their faith look it's just been my observation anyway\nAgree for\nWhat would you like to tell us about saints Peter and Paul ... church and that will enhance and enrich our faith today\nI don't think we're anything that special I mean I think the churches the Turks and that's the beauty of it doesn't matter if you're in the middle of a small town in Maine or you're in\nYou know you're in Boston or you're in Texas or wherever you are that's the beauty the churches that it's universal and um what's happening in our community it's really exciting I mean it's\nIt's ...

[noise]\nMost of us are outraged by the proliferation of child pornography\nRail against child pornography but gladly and on reserve and labor dissipate and be objective vacation of women by viewing or possessing pornography that is not outlawed\nSome of the same people who speak against sexual slavery or forced child labor or gun crimes against children would also support the right of a woman to dispose of human life in her womb if\nWe're honest even those of us who subscribe to biblical worldview have lived somewhere in the middle of all this what has led us to the value human life\nWith a shorter some most fundamental answer is sin it's also the most comprehensive explanation of it as Paul writes in Romans three ... twenty three and listened carefully this for all of sand and fall short of the glory of God\nMore importantly we have devalued human life because we have distorted or disregarded the sacredness of life for example we've had many discussions in our society about the nature of rights independent of a discussion of and many times\nLeaf in the idea that humans are created in the image of God\nWhat concrete human rights exist that aren't afforded us by virtue of having been created in the image of God this is a fundamental question because unfortunately personal liberties conflict\nWhich we've seen very clearly in our nation's history does the slave owners right to own slaves\nWhich affected the slave owner economically\nTranscend the rights of the slave to be free from forest servitude\n'cause that was a huge discussion leading up to and during the civil war and the question was\nWhose personal liberty was more important in a speech delivered in Great Britain in Eighteen forty six former slave Frederick Douglass explained the fallacy of a slave owner having rights over a slave\nHe said but you may I ask is the slave owner really a man's dealer my answer is he takes that which does not belong to him and that I Believe\nConstitutes a thief\nRobbers one who by force takes possession himself of that which rightfully belongs to another do not slave holders do this do I belong to myself or doing that if I Do has not the blackest negro in America an equal right to claim himself\nI Know I have a right to myself how do I know this because God has given me power in faculties if he did not intend that I should think he would not have given me the ability to think he gave me these hands this had the shoulders wish they had so much ornament these are my own\nMy birthright as a human being but the slave holder takes them from me\nHe strikes down all ride in striking down one right\nThe right of one man to himself is the right of every man to himself how do you establish rights not by the color of your skin not by the texture of your hands not by the cast of your features your rights to your sales are self evident\nAnd the strike down those rights is to strike down the fundamental right the right to which all other rights are attached\nA slave holder is as much worse than an ordinary Steve as a murderous pirate is worse than a common pick pocket he destroys body and soul he claims the intellect he ... he strikes down to manage and reduce the same to the level of the brute\nAbraham Lincoln made the following observation about slavery in a letter he wrote to him real peers in Eighteen\nFifty nine this is a world of compensations and tea who would be no slave\nMust consent to have those life\nThose who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under a just God\nCan not long retain it it's still a discussion in the abortion debate does a woman's right to choose to dispose of the human being in her womb Trump the right of that human being to continue to live\nOf course one of the primary tactics of those who support abortion rights is to declare the baby to beef subhuman which is interesting because slave owners made the same arguments concerning their slaves and we might also observe\nSo said the Nazis about the Jews and anybody else they wanted to get rid of as this clearly seen in both of these cases\nThe question is how can we legitimately decide who's personal liberties should be preserved\nAnd who should it\nHave a difficult time seeing any concrete Lee legitimate resolution that doesn't include a discussion framed by belief and mankind having been created in the image of God that's why slave should be free and baby should not be aborted\nThey are created in the image of God otherwise as we've seen sometimes the liberties of the victim supersedes those are the victim either as in the nation's eventual answer to this labor issue and sometimes the\nRights of the victimize or Trump's those of the victim as this scene in the nation's answer to the abortion debate it's an inconsistent mess\nThe idea that we were created in the image of God clears up some of these issues it certainly shows the idea of sub human fetuses and slaves to be rubbish\nSo why have these discussions not been framed by the image of God doctrine with regard\nTo slavery unfortunately most of those who argued in favor of slavery used distortions of biblical teaching to support their case and frankly they just prejudicial he decided to alter the image of God doctrine to suit their desire\nFor money\nWith regard to abortion the simple answer is many of the folks framing these discussions don't believe in the\nBiblical teaching surrounding creation let alone man being created in the image of God and they don't believe this because I don't believe in God it's rather easy to see even those who do believe in God and do believe that we were created in his image twist the scriptures to leave the ... says\nHuman beans out of the discussion is if God spoke of the unborn as being something other than human\nThis discussion of how we approach the issue of human rights in our national discourse reveals much about what is actually led us to the point where we witness a serious lack of regard for human life\nIf we keep on teaching our children that they were not created in the image of God we will perpetuate this lack of regard for human life\nBelieving in this sacredness of human life causes us to have a high regard for it failing to believe in it causes us to disregard it\nSimple as that this is why this\nSecular non religious approach to education and government are failing America\nThere is a better way and this way is not simply an American idea and it's not simply available to America this is the teaching of the Bible concerning\nThe sacredness of human life is the foundation of Christian ethics if more people would surrender their lives to the Lord Jesus Christ this issue would go away and our nation and in our world to a large degree\nYeah
