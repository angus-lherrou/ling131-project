straight sixteen sweet sixteens we know they're ranked preseason number twenty four but how has this produced team expected to be this season\nWell there there are some knowns such as a shooting guard Carson Edwards used returning um Jerry West\nAward winners at the top shooting guard in the country either preseason all American he's pretty soon player the Kennedy the receipt and clarity or the big and so they know they've got a big time scoring option there at the two\nEverywhere else or maybe not everywhere else but they they know that they have a talent elsewhere they just don't yet know how it's going to come together they have for seniors starters last year that went along with\nEdwards um people probably remember I used to cost you know seven to three hundred pound guy in the middle\nAnd this was a team that for you and before him ... won again so for a few years now a team that really played through the post predominantly and this year I think you're going to see a different kind of basketball from Purdue a little bit um they're going to have to be a little bit more guard oriented\nSenate leadership funding for just responsible for the cognitive is advertising

kneeling standing by we'll get to him here just second for some football talk but first let's continue that basketball conversation Greg\nBecause I think that's interesting when you look at at Purdue team and what their expectations are that great all American guard\nCarson Edwards that they have West Virginia going into this game very much trying to find out what it has in terms of all these new player so here's a little run down of that box score that Nathan referred to that was a floating around on Twitter this weekend but a couple of things caught my eye\nFirst and foremost leading West Virginia and scoring ... points on seven uh fourteen shooting each cell not\nSuch a really good sign early I think we've been talking for what three years about ... has elite level talent is it going to be harnessed inconsistent if it is the season West Virginia's got a chance to be very very good such a good side I Know it's only one game and it's just a scrimmage but that was a really good side another number that jumped out at me\nFive up seven from the floor three of four from three point line Thirteen total points\nI Know you've seen the box score so I Would normally tell you I guess that was that was freshman Jordan McCabe\nSo that's a really good side and going from a guy that early on the reports where you could see the talent you can see the skill level but it was going to take some time getting used to the speed as it does most most freshman to step right in against Purdue and be able to hit three threes have Thirteen points and look really good from what I've been told that's a good sign as well for West Virginia\nYeah obviously agree in it and that's what you're hoping for him right I mean I\nI might have been as if he gave me anywhere close to that on a consistent basis oil yeah you'd be thrilled that an a plus performance from a freshman wasn't it absolutely okay here's a couple of other insurance\nChase hardware we've talked a lot about him for of nine from the floor to of six from three point range he finishes with Thirteen points as well and then also staying in the back court germane Hayley the six seven transfer\nThree of four from the field eight of ten from the free throw line he puts up fourteen so he was the second leading scorer so there's your four guys in double figures Easter Haley parlor McCabe\nLike you like that yeah no no argument with any of that and you know especially when you consider to starters or not\nEven in the lineup yeah was ... to an obviously beat a bold\nSo I and I don't eat again uh you know hug chosen addressed specifics too much he's talked about the injury aspect but it I I don't think the ... is a long term situation but I think there is a little bit of concern with beetle\nI'm just you know sort of the feel I have got because he said a few nagging things all throughout the summer so hopefully he you know hopefully you both them back but the Beatles some more concerning of the two\nYeah he's in both those guys you have to have an obvious reasons but that's a good sign right there with with two of the newcomers in Hayley in McCabe\nAt least for this one particular game scoring and playing pretty well according to the box here's another thing that jumped out Purdue out rebounding West Virginia thirty nine twenty seven so probably not a huge surprise given the size that Nathan just told us the Purdue has on the roster that's obviously a hallmark of of Bob Huggins teams and certainly oppressed Virginia\nSo getting out rebounded by twelve concern or just a function maybe of the of the lineup Purdue throughout their\nA little concerned though again because I'm you know ... was going to be counted on to do a great deal of that\nBut that wasn't that great rebounding mountain your team last year I mean there are a lot of guys that are good but they don't have a Kevin Jones or a Devon Williams who just goes out there and eats up almost everything seemingly that comes his way you know ... was okay at it but obviously he's\nBetter at blocking shots and use it rebounding Easter can be okay at it but sometimes he'll\nIt's up here um in in Reno lot west isn't necessarily a rebound and I think that's something they they are going to have to pay attention to that I can say it's an Achilles' heel but I don't think this that will be the strength like ... some above bugging says teams I had at that as a strength\nI Would agree with you cannot say being in the lineup may have changed that a little bit you're going to count on him to get a bunch of ... of the leading rebound and the game was Easter with five second leading rebound or ... west had four and really those are the ones of no germane Haley had three Logan route also came in and had three rebounds as well so kind of interesting to look at some of those\nThose numbers some other shooting numbers Brandon nap or to have to from the for one of one from three point land less Harris three of seven\nAndrew Gordon three of three and Matthew is one of one\nWho didn't want to one from three point line West Virginia nine of twenty two overall from three and they were Eighteen to twenty five in the freezer light so another good free throw shooting performance we saw that team last year be able to shoot free throws\nIn again I'm as we said no you cannot say no bold and the other at ... from this uh actually to one of them a scholarship in trade doom so we don't know of any um injury situations with the freshman but if he wants to be red shirt or if western view wants to red shirt him um\nThat this may be an indication of that and also Trayvon Horton walk on from from Fairmont did not play in maybe that's what they're thinking with with him as well so we'll try and get some clarification from hubs on that over the course of the week or so but um something that's ... another little tidbit that struck me\nSo eleven guys got in for West Virginia eleven guys play it and then as we just said no beetle no sags which would have given yet Thirteen which is right in line with where you think this team might be at least early I think you're going to see a bunch of guys early and see if it leads itself out\nBut even that I Would think the hope is to play in that eleven twelve ranch traffic guys and and run in lines like you did in the early days of press for\nToday I I think everybody that played ... is going to see him like I say everybody's would see significant action but I think\nThis is sort of rotation he was ... I think he would like to use all Thirteen you those that I don't think you know they had Fifteen or on the roster and that's why maybe doomed and Horton are ultimately Richard I don't think they would have gone that deep but I can see all Thirteen of these guys seeing some regular action almost every game\nAll right there you go there's some basketball update from the scrimmage West Virginia beach Purdue over the weekend will uh will get ready for some hoops coming up that starts what this week right and I guess well Saturday Saturdays agitation at Penn State at noon over at the ... in it in\nThe following friday a buffalo ... said we can West Virginia plays TCU and any time still to be determined which is\nJust dropping stay window for ... rental with hoops All right let's do this let's get a break and now when we come back that'll give us a few extra minutes with coach needle will get into the WVU Texas game as well as what he saw from the other big twelve teams this weekend coach Leon right around the corner on the city that they watch Portland\nWheeling island hotel casino in racetrack invites you to this book pack killer a night of fun at the wheeling island costume party friday October twenty six admission free for those in costumes and five dollars for those not there will be live music performed by tongue in cheek and cash in free play prizes\nFor best costumes so make it a night book pack killer friday night October twenty six\nFrom wheeling island hotel casino and race track get that we're leans feeling prescription opioids can be addictive and dangerous\nOpioids pain medication to everything that I had nothing mattered more than getting my hours on the verge of being homeless my house is being foreclosed on knowing that it could have been prevented makes it worse it just takes time\nPrescription opioids it only takes a little pill is alive\nBecause it helps for W the dot com 'cause I Can't Amos developed by the Centers for Disease Control and prevention\nI miss either one of hundreds or in a mile and I've been here for twenty eight year old ... improve the headline one of them pay my way\nHe takes the drug I helped develop right here in more detail on up to six hundred products in America are lame I work with her you know that's not a name and that's why I'm proud\nOf him island is committed to creating their help prevent or world that are American better West Virginia\nCity that said why sports line continues in two minutes on metro news voice of West Virginia [noise]\n\nThis is Joe Manchin of West Virginia is home to honest hardworking people who play by the rules\nIs why I Will always protect Social Security Medicare", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "29"}
