played in last friday's game and today they announced that rat who was like [noise] that\nTall [laughter] lawyer for almost literally I mean that's almost lit or one of the size of your ear you're Eighteen when you're a freshman right basically and so how old I mean yeah like twenty now yeah so what what was the one when he got here how with the kid have been there for three or four he's like that big\nHe's going to start a quarterback in Arizona's game this coming weekend ... ... ...\n... this past friday as we were waiting in West Des Moines a\nFor West Virginia blaming them all and he said you don't say the U.S has no he does that that's why you're just jak and you have ... listeners out there we know you gotta have the audience and he actually played fairly well he had no support whatsoever almost three bills right\nYeah they will take their starter was hurt and uh he's just getting crushed that poor kid so I'm not sure reading about a hundred and forty pounds I'm not sure how long they'll last\nLast marriage and read and we're not at that game where they've been at most of the games they were not at that game wanted when he would gain by one of\nTwo games in most also he's also a news like yesterday I was a talked about\nAbout the Iowa State fans storming the field\nAfter the west Virginia game today the big twelve conference came out and find Iowa State twenty five thousand dollars and do whatever they do reprimand censure or whatever you call it public ... public private reprimand just people don't know about right right\nActually we be reprimanded and but it was ... ... ... and immediately Iowa State says now we're appealing that\nGet outta here senator yeah you said in those athletic department meaning so what are your guy\nWell so that they they had to find them they had to find them because what Dana said and I know Dana was\nWas ripped a from front another fan base for his comments following it but but he actually has a point there that says ... and we've talked about this ad nauseam on the show I Know what I'm about to say is not a popular take among fans\nBut that's the correct stance anytime fans are allowed on the court it's a dangerous situation and nine times out of ten you're not going to see anything come from it but administrators in schools are responsible for that one tiny percentage or something bad could happen so you've got to be in a position to not\nAllow that to happen and if it's going to happen you're not you better not only have a plan to get the players out of there you'd better be able to execute that right just like game planning versus execution you'd better be able to get players off without any interference in contact with fans that didn't happen on Saturday So it's an obvious situation in my mind where you find Iowa State\nIt's also an obvious response from Jamie power the athletic director who has come out and said he's appealing that because they had a great plan and they enacted the plan\nWell they're still going to get fired I Can't imagine bubbles and he says now yeah you're right we'll take that back because that's that's impressive and you're going to see that constantly but if you're Jamie Pollard he's walking a tightrope there with his fans and his support staff\nSo by him publicly appealing that that's a show of support for his department the police that work there and his fans to say hey I get it\nYou were celebrating the big moment you be the top six team to advocate so he's got to pay the fine they're going to get fined but the public appeal in my opinion is Jamie Pollard from Iowa State just defending his group in a public way yeah a\n... as you well know 'em long on record especially in basketball games yeah that when a fan goes onto the court or to a field there and great risk of danger that's all I see just be aware don't say oh my gosh I rent a player rented to me and I got hurt when you go on there\nIt's all bets and it was in his more dangerous now at Iowa State than it used to be because West Virginia used to be on the press box ... they moved the visiting team this year so the other side B high in front of the students\nSo we're West Virginia now runs off into that tunnel that's where the students poured onto the field has been the other way than WVU could have easily ... got off the field because it would have been near sideline near tunnel they're done\nI saw that thing comment and I'm looking for my top but I'm going like\nThis the numbers aren't good and I was worried that someone would run into a mountain air player and I'm Out near player would dispatch then get outta my face and all of a sudden you got a big time problem in a mess thank God\nNo there's no reports of anyone getting trucked no reports of anything bad habits that was very very dangerous not for the mountaineers [laughter] they got here on it could have been really really bad\nFor the kids that are run a ... and I get them they want to celebrate that's a huge moment I totally get it but it's a it's easier to do in basketball when they put the rope up and the team can just stay on its side line and get the heck out of there and football it's almost impossible\nWell and if that's the case that the students are right where the visiting team needs to exit that's a flaw in the plan right there in Iowa state's gonna move sidelines than you darn well better have an answer for what happens in that scenario and again not just in theory you better be able to an active and clearly they weren't able to\nDo things a ... and I don't know if they showed it on TV or what but will grow was escorted out by the west Virginia state police officers and they actually sent him out\nA little bit early or delay void the mess okay so that in which you talked about the last year it's just a was Harris at Texas Tech court storming situated he ends up missing the game or two right do you miss\nA day I was a day or say there is something I was in there yeah and they're like oh I don't think he did I think that's not something that was but here's the deal when it's not safe for fans either is not really about safety the players the fans that that's a dangerous situation for them\nI don't know how you don't do it I don't know how you stop it in football so the easy thing to say is let the opposing team leave the field then you can storm the field but the the ... the reason they stormed the field is because the clock got down to zero into them the races on\nAnd yeah I mean no one's going to sit there and go okay one minute countdown I'm watching the clock and now I Do the reason it it goes on the field and the reason you don't get the players off\nIs because the court storming or field storming overruns security that's in place to stop at that point where if they were being logical and saying that we're going to hold off from and give it a thirty second clock here at the clock up on thirty working out well it just doesn't happen that's not real world that doesn't happen that way\nYeah so there there's there's that latest story when we come back data holders and from the podium what he said the day during his press to
