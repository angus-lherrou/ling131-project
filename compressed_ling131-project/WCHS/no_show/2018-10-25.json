a rare game day on a Thursday but\nThis is a game that I've heard you all on sports all end all weekend long and I have heard the word master abused more than once about how massively important this game is especially for the mountains to win and keep all their hopes and dreams alive\nI think it is Chris I I don't think we thought that was going to be the case when the season started but after what happened at a Iowa State I think this game becomes important very much so because of the fact that if you don't win this game\nAnd you know what you have looking at the rest of the schedule the next four games after this one is over then you go like whoa converse\nWhen yeah when this game you get your moment of back and at that table up for this round that you're going to go into that close to see\nHow his will Greer I mean he just did did not look right in that Iowa State game I don't know if he was trying to do too much or or if he if you had something wrong with them and ... what is the story with will ... going to be back to the one that we saw against Tennessee\nWe certainly hope so what he has said and the way that he has you know kind of conduct themselves as far as access to the media and things like that he is good to go\nUm I think that he has kind of looked at it and you know I think he took a responsibility I think the rest of the team as everyone knows I'm also shares their responsibility they just play simply did quite well and I think over a period of time in that game because it was limited possession\nGame for the office they only had four possession for the second half I think they got tighter and tighter and tighter as the game went on and so each subsequent possession tightened them up and they weren't able to do anything with it so um they all seem to be\nA ready are very much anxiously forward looking to go back out onto the field and a show that they can crank it up again so all indications are he's got to go\nWell and that happens you know you have a bad game now and then but that made to in a row Tony and suddenly this one here I mean this ... this was the one everybody's going in a let's let's make sure this is not a trend and come out and just blow these guys out of the water tonight I don't know that you do that against Baylor because\nUh like you said this is a team that does have some some weapons in and get hurt you\nYeah they got a quarterback and Charlie ... who can hurt you with his feet and he can also throw the ball well and as a Tennessee guy Chris you remembered Jay Lynn heard\nHe left Tennessee as a running back a year ago and was a very good running back he becomes a receiver\nAt Baylor to show the NFL folks that he can play that because that's where eventually he will be a pro and he played

hearing went over they already had four hundred plus folks vote by three forty five yesterday the first day of early voting\nThere was a bit of a line when we got there but the nice ladies most of whom I Know you know because I've been around a long time [laughter] oh people are name oh Mr painting [laughter] you're still walk and ah\nAnd yeah they mentioned that the biggest questions they had as Balad officials in the ballot visuals cannot answer substantive questions about\nIssues on the ballot who should I vote for what does this amendment mean what does it mean for or against I mean they're they're limited to you know here's the ballot\nHere's how it operates if you need assistance with the electronic voting we can provide it but by law they're prohibited by from substantive inter interaction with a voter\nThe ladies universally said the biggest questions I had had were about the two constitutional amendments that are at the end of the ballad\nNot about the Supreme Court race which I find confusing because er ten candidates in each division or about the divisions or what that meant but about the constitutional amendments then it dawned on me that like you and I and folks with whom we interact\nDon't have those questions with something we deal with it\nThe day so let me say this to the folks who are listening there to\nSignificant constitutional amendments there at the end of the ballot\nThe votes are for or against ... yesterday as for against ah\nWe'll talk about ... amendment number one a little later amendment number two the last one you vote on it has a little paragraph of explanation but essentially what amendment to does it allows the west Virginia legislature some control over the budget of the judiciary\nThat is a it requires that the chief justice of the Supreme Court of appeals of West Virginia all the request of the legislature appear and presented budget\nThat allows the legislature to reduce if they find the need to do so some items in the Supreme Court's proposed budget so long as they don't reduce the budget below eighty five percent of what it was the preceding year\nAlthough there is an exception to that with a two thirds vote it could be reduced further this amendment brings West Virginia and the line with the forty nine other states in the United states and\nThe system or courts in the federal government when it's when\nThe ministry of office of the United states courts decides how much chief justice of the United states John Roberts can pay for a lamp to be put in his office and they do\nThat is that a budget package that is committed the Congress defended by the administrator of office and by the chief justice or whoever he designates to get out and make the budget presentation to the United States Congress\nIt's done that way and varying degrees in every other state except here in West Virginia and the conclusion seems to be that that insular budgetary a position may have contributed to\nAt least somewhat a detached\nPerhaps cavalier attitude that some of the court had relative to spending so it's universally supported this the current Supreme Court\nSupports it or the rest of the chamber of commerce supports it the defense drought council of West Virginia where insurance and corporate lawyer supported\nThe association for justice for I'm On the board which is the plane of trial lawyers we support it gets just universe been endorsed by both newspapers so the the\nAnd this is really lobbying it would be hard to conceive why we would not want under the under amendment to the vote for\nIf you vote for amendment to that means you're in favor of some legislative oversight of the Supreme Court budget for the future now that doesn't mean the Supreme Court can just well we're going to have a two thirds vote will cut the budget down to see her that can't happen\nThey're still going to be constitutional controls I mean one of the issues about\nThe current impeachment\nIssue is whether the court violated the law by paying senior status judges they per diem rate as contractors after their total compensation for any year had exceeded their\nPre retirement salary and said well the constitution says compensation Shelby fixed by the less well it does but it's this thing does that mean you can cut the salary of a judge to ten dollars\nDoes that mean you can cut the salary of a court reporter and the Supreme Court to five dollars a day which would mean that you a sense and couldn't operate you're kind of course not they're always levels of constitutional necessity you have to be met or all of that apparently did not dawned on some of the\nUh\nDetached members of the house of delegates who are on their lord of the flies which on the stone somebody so I mean do they ... amendment to it's a little bit complex it's a longer paragraph it's a four of a ... or ... yes is\nThat's a good thing in Harvey a constitutional amendment obviously our state has a constitution there is a process set up by which you can amend the constitution and has to go through the legislature they have to meet certain criteria to even get it on the ballot right which they've done so and so he's just a majority vote yes on election day now that he's\nRequired the laying of an amendment before the voters requires a super majority in the legislature to pass a joint resolution\nBy three fifth vote to get the issue on the ballot then it's a majority vote by the by the\nState wide voters and the amendment will take effect immediately upon the certification\nOf the election results so I mean there'll be a period of time probably usually tend to fourteen days after election day wearing all the county commissioners me they count the votes they certify the results in their counties they submit those to the secretary of state than the state wide results are certified so there will be\nSome legislative control to to be some budgeting a combinations made for the upcoming year mhm\nPretty amazing that what she was the only state yeah it was and how that happened\nYou know the judicial reform amendment was unified control of the courts under the Supreme Court was adopted in the early seventies well think about what was going on in the seventies and the early seventies when this was written Watergate we had a ... a we had a\nCase is bouncing back between the White House the Nixon White House and the Supreme Court of the United states the D.C court of appeals\nThe west Virginia Supreme Court was actually in some water with the stage of transition I went from being you know old conservative guys too\nOld moderate guy [laughter] that and then it morphed into\nA younger and perhaps more liberal men and women so the court when the ... the legislature\nFormula that amendment they have that in mind well wait a minute we're in a constitutional issue here in the United states where they were firing attorney general's anyway let's protect the court's budget and that's what the voters did it just turned out that fifty years later\nWhat situational he seemed to be good practically was him\nIn the long run

certainly\nCan they really be as bad as they were last week you know fifty percent or better I'm In\nAlready Brett interim mountains convert fifty percent or more of their third down chances tonight\nYeah who knew West Virginia was going to play the eighty five bears last week had no idea that was coming and their third down struggles or because they average nine plus a yard [noise] to\nGo every third doubt so that's a recipe for disaster I Do think west Britain he gets back on track offensively in order to do that you're gonna have to keep those ticks moving so by the balls all stay\nIn more than fifty percent All right I'm also in on\nThe spot in West Virginia\nConverted around sixty percent of their third down tries West Virginia's favored by nearly two\nTouchdowns and the total on this game is sixty six that means points in plenty of them and with the knowledge of Mark Twain rumors of the death of West Virginia is often or greatly exaggerated I'm In our final topic clean Jersey obviously a huge key tonight for West Virginia is getting will grew back to doing\nWe'll Greer things growing for three hundred plus multiple touchdown passes reconnecting with David silk but to do that some things need to start trending back in West Virginia's favorites and I like the mound you're often so blind providing a clean pockets\nGreer regaining the ability to throw the ball away when he's under pressure and the big gain or down the field just isn't there Jeff dinner out west Virginia allows breed or fewer sex to Baylor tonight [noise] three or fewer\nStocks I Will be in

to get right at the number and I'm going to go out I'm gonna go boy you know above above ...\nSorry Brad what's your take West Virginia allowed three or fewer sex to the barrel alert Baylor Bears events that I\nI'm not sold on this offensive line yet they've had some struggles even before the Iowa State but I think this I think West Virginia went back to the drawing board and they're going to do some more quick passing take advantage of that middle of the people get back to his plans\nI also think of letting grounds back on the line at you gain your best to block or out of the ... you try and move west go back to help out again as you saw at times over the last couple of games [noise] so I actually even though I don't have great faith and there's all kinds of line I'm going to be in on three or four years\nBecause I think the shore up the blocking quicker passed in game in Greer throws that are way more than you've seen in on this one\nAll right and I'm also going to be in\nQuarterback out of the game early in Austin and did people longhorns off the scoreboard and then the second half last time out put the bears did not record a second that game and they only have Fifteen total tax in seven games this year but more importantly tonight scans and opportunity for West Virginia is often supplied to get back to swagger and play well in a big\nSpot under the lights

I ... I Would guess that there are about twenty five percent three down so they have the ability to do that didn't like they got a completely rebuild their defense\nSo you think they just implement that
