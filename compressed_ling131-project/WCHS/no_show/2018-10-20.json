Virginia doors all across the state of West Virginia few minutes lived here with calling ... near the ... leader but the west Virginia DNR we'd rather just wrapped up these three we three early bears seasons I don't think there are ... are they a full week long calling the three early seasons\nWell they actually very that the um the one in the mountain county um is is a full week we've got also a full week in Raleigh and say no but actually the first early season that we have the first year\nIn a in our for our tree only dear counties which you'd be mango mapped out Logan Wyoming was actually um sixteen days law so that they had two full two to four weeks and actually three weekends so\nHow do they do lists let's start with that one down in the in the counties words archery only for dear how did those owners do\nWell it's been the fourth year I Believe since we actually splits counties out separately um the most we ever killed down there and in that early season is a hundred and twenty five and that was in the first year at least we killed was Ninety six last year so we came in right around a hundred and ten next year so\nWe had very little fluctuation in the in the harvest um since we've had that season but\nEven though you've given more days down there\nYeah yeah this year we we had a ... you know only a few more animals skills and last year um so yeah it seems like participation has been pretty stable the whole time um so you know\nHowever it's um it's encouraging because before we split those four counties out uh we were killing you know less than twenty animals per county in those counties so\nAnd that would that would have been by just relying on the boat hunters who were killing them\nNo no no I mean before we actually gave them their own early see them you know having and they used to be in with relatives and say OK okay you know we had eight\nCounties open harvest in all of the counties offered so\nGotcha so ... ... ... ... and I guess the the the to Susan in the mountain county so they do\nThey did about three hundred and Seventy animals\nUm which was down a little bit from last year um but it's within the range of what they've had 'em yet throughout throughout the years have an early season we've had a variety season format in the mountains over the years burying from three days in some places to seven days\nWe've been we've been set on seven days the last several years um but it's you know it's the harvest fluctuates usually between three fifty it's going three fifty to six hundred typically in that early season up there\nAnd then uh and then we'd go and I guess you were during the mid south [laughter]\nRaleigh boon fate and come on [laughter]\nYep yep and they they killed just under eighty animals there which is within ten animals or what they killed last year no I'm the harvest didn't stay in pretty stable in these early seasons\nDo you find that hunters in most of the guys that the trades these things with dogs they live up in you know the higher elevations there from up in the you know grant\nMineral Pocahontas up in that in ... in that country because that's that's that's kinda traditionally where most of my own name was done are you finding that a lot of them enjoy coming down here for these three seasons and gives them three opportunities to to do some hunting\nYeah there's there's no doubt it's um it's kind of become we've been doing it so long especially in Raleigh North county said\nI've never I've never talked to hunter who hasn't participated at least one of our early seasons so you know you talk to guys are going to be in the county for for Fifteen Years now and early ... um and and you know you talk to a different guy and say oh I think we're going to try that that real early season this year and\nA cause that was around Labor Day weekend was meant\nYeah starts right on on Labor Day weekend yeah and you know a lot of guys are saying well you know it it's funny because we we've actually been we've had bear hunters say you've got too many seasons now\n[laughter] so I probably have a good thing [laughter]\n... well the the other thing that I Wonder about is the you know I remember Labor Day weekend I was at the w._b. you Tennessee game down in Charlotte it was stupid hot that weekend I cannot imagine\nYou know traipsing through the hills particularly in this deep country down there I mean you had to I Would have given up and the first Fifteen minutes of doing that uh and and there's got to be rough on the dogs did that it have any impact as well or or or or not merely didn't\nIt doesn't seem to you know and that was kind of what we weren't sure about what first I'm open to season that early down there but what you know we gotta figure as they've you know most most folks have been training dogs all summer and that kind of eat anyway you know the differences now you've got an animal that you got to get out of the woods quickly to get cool down so\nWell and the guys that don't these dogs I mean they the their house members ... before they're ... and they will take care of those dogs and they ... most of them have enough that they can run one of 'em for a brief period of time and then put it in the in the trunk and give it some water in turn the other one lose\nYeah that that some of the guys I talk to the hunted down there this this year said they they had to a kind of separate dogs he could you could rest to a group one day and ... you know see have something to run the next because it's so demanding so steep so hot you know so rough\nYeah so and that's a ... and you're at a time to when will I mean we don't even know the leaves come off yet but you can imagine how it is in there trying to run up through the mess yup well what ought to do it man you got anything else before I cut you lose\n... just just a reminder that we've got another out their season coming up next weekend it coincides with our atlas a deer season and Thirteen counties\nYeah OK we'll keep that among you can check those counties in the regulations and all you need to ...\nAh yes yes it is yeah of course land or do not need one but ah but

your funeral homes that running ambulance or oh and\nBack then it was really expensive to have a hers and an ambulance so the coach builders which most of all the coach builders in the United states believe it or not\nIt's that Ohio right they got real smart and they made what they call the\nCombination vehicles so that could be used as a hearse and or an ambulance so like the jump seats for the ambulance would fall down flat and to the floor and then you'd have panels that would flip over so you'd have the rollers where the casket so those are the fold flat so the multi purpose vehicle for the same price\nOr your ghost expert and we'll give you those credits but I Want to know it was so do you do have it\nI Know I don't I mean so it's a guy in Maine but see this is getting up to the point of how spirits could be in there is no doubt\nWith most of your um funeral homes running ambulance service we really didn't have all the lifesaving apparatus ambulances do today so back then in the forties and fifties it was basic first date so they came up on the scene and you are still alive most times you would die in a way to the hospital and\nSo there's a lot of deaths that are related in to ambulance especially of that era the forties fifties and sixties\nUh you know the ambulances today obviously they can actually save your life on the way to the hospital so there is there's a lot of deaths that are wrapped up in those vehicles and you know for some reason I think spirits can be laws they can lose or way maybe you know the proverbial white light that they say that we all even were dying maybe\nMaybe this girl Roxy she got spooked by it didn't know what it was in her time to go through it closed um but yeah when we're asking for names and all that she she told us her name and she had passed away in the NBA learn\n'em and she was like the only spirit that was in the ambulance butters but her voice when you talk to her was really just a real quiet almost like she was losing energy which is kind of sad to think that she was stuck in the vehicle for so many years\nYou know so forty years later I pop into vaccine started saying Hi to her that I was the first person since she died actually communicate with her\nWas Roxy really in a car wreck or something how did you ever ...\nYeah I I Try to research um what title research is through the state of Ohio the on and go back ten year okay\nAh the individual because all with computers and keeping the paperwork so that was the unfortunate part with that because I Love to do all of that thorough research into this uh when I did the research I did find out that it was used in the ... area last or your family area\nHuh that anybody that would have ran it was passed away at the funeral home area and it was no longer in business a lot of every ... no pun intended\nBut I was at a dead end yeah that I was\nTrying to research this vehicle and maybe maybe it just wasn't meant to be found yeah\nWhat year was the kind of like a Nineteen fifty six\nOh my God so looking car when you say communicate did she responded things that you said are asked\nShe did a I actually have the recordings to this day uh when we asked you know what her name as you said Roxy or ask are you religious person she said yes I was actually I'm using it for a short time period for storage goes underneath my carport at the house and I was living at that time\nAnd I had my dog and the front porch and you know they they talked about animals being very sensitive to normal and they can sense and see them because they hear on a higher frequency than we do and they see it in a different spectrum than we do and as I was actually digging through and pulling stuff out of the back of the car\nWhich I coined Roxy outfitting\n... so uh I was actually play an audio and my dog started whimpering and I and his name was ... Tucker be quiet and at the same time you hear Roxy on the recording you can you hear me sliding stuff in the back of the ambulance and you hear her say stop it so she's yelling at my dog from the other\nSide do you still have this audio you've never share this with us or not\nI Can't share to yeah I can get it to you\nKnow that'd be great or whatever that now I understand it some people believe ... so many problems because their spoof drawn to this is true that is true [laughter] ah\nWell that's ... Ford's the same way [laughter] I'm a savvy person out\nThere as well you're working on the other projects you've expanded beyond vehicles is going to have you know\nWe have a we actually filmed a actual couple of pilots for Honda vehicles were trying to get that as a regular show on TV or we just talked to producers last week or we did a phone conference and they're interested and\nPossibly taking that on as a project what should be really cool to get something like that on TV but um we also do homes so we've been doing that for many years we just last two years we've been working with us nation America for a couple of different shows that they're doing\nParanormal survivor and a hard case files but most of the most haunted location that we've done believe it or not our vehicles we do\nUm a series of haunted trains in Cleveland, Ohio that they send out on actual excursions and the Ohio Valley um and then add a man's Rio de we've been dealing with a haunted fire trucks\nThat's kind of sad because the firemen that they see walking along the fire trucks in that situation or actually they had passed away um when a fire fighter dies on a call but he does they call it the last bell I Believe All right\nSo they're actually doing like the last bell and you'll see like the Nineteen twenties images of firefighters you know running to the fire trucks and everything\nWhile I'm well there are long gone now but there was one point a mom to be so back in my twenties\nI used to go to a lot of old salvage or that have since been EPA a destroyed but there was a lot of fatal cars and when I said I can tell by the the the amount of destruction to the car that someone died in especially the way the hacks always cut the bodies out so\nMy question you've you've a guide typically gets killed in a car Garber on whoever chances are taunted or why why the marks\nThe ... ... or ... I Love using this example in a weird bizarre way ah when people talk to us about haunted vehicles and hard and transportation because America has a love affair with a transportation right um maybe an old car guy myself I have a couple of sixty seven Galax I have a fifty five Packard\nUm my dad growing up he's always had fifty five and fifty seven chevies or he restored a fifty seven Chevy tutor hard copy restarted fifty five Chevy convertible so let's use the fifties by\nA convertible as an example that's that's an eighty thousand dollar car okay so say he and he put his blood sweat and tears into this thing\nSo why not a car parked it to Jane dean Roach there there is well documented reports that all the parts that were sold off of that car that those cars had mysterious accident and people were killed\nAfter what my here's my question do you have to have special power to talk to the dead because I mean other than when I smell certain things I think in my deceased father when I was at my mom's house like I went to this one room one time I guess where he walked through me is that mental or do you really think my dad walked through me I don't understand see I'm I'm a I'm a sky believe\nHe probably walk the the thing is you know once we get past a certain age were told not to believe and that in a certain magical creature that we grow up with\nThe Easter Bunny the Santa Claus and the tooth fairy closer mind's eyes to the possibility up and we do it to ourselves with our children are just\nThe way society is that the only later on in life that we realize that there is something else out there and we try to re open their minds I\nLook at it this way you know there's some people that are more sensitive to what that our environment than others so and I will do the math and the stadium filled with people and there's twenty locked doors and there's only one open door and there's a huge catastrophe you know there's a fire\nEarthquake what have you with everybody going to run to the closed doors locked doors absolutely not they're going to go to that one open door\nAnd when the paranormal is in our existence they know if we're open to it or not and\nSo then they'll call you with us better so I Want to sit and Whoopi Goldberg body when I'm dead to come back and see everybody like on goes\n[laughter] like Patrick well you might want to pick a better body then I'm going to come back and they were Andy\nAnd he got to victory lane almost three times and every ... absolutely it's not about the what ... is not about the gender imbalance in the end her and she stock I've been than since day one I really don't care what anyone things I Know she's pretty I Know she did a lot for the sport\nAnd I'm all for girl drivers but bring me a lady to put the boys in their place because I always say the girls are better drag racer is I Know down deep will be better round the racers\nThis segment is going to haunt me forever but this has been our spectacular edition Abou it stunk will take a break on the other side or the program this is the auto smarts radio network mysteriously powered\nAll\nI was expecting maybe funerals for friends with them but then\nWe will give me the auto smarts radio network it as Bob betting or as our guest the national Vienna funeral history and Bob you must never get uplifting music to lead a segment when you come on her\nWhen I come on show I get the uh [noise] um yeah and also I'm a a organs and everything else\nA well Bob is with the national museum of funeral history he joins us now on the hotline and Bob Bennett over you tell the people again uh we've had you on the show I think three years ago what the National Museum of natural history is all about as it pertains to automobile\nAnd cars and transportation\nBut we have a thirty thousand five hundred square foot museum and White House probably the nation's largest historical collection of professional vehicles\nAnd um all all of our cars are completely restored that they all run and we do take 'em out uh every so often but we have horse drawn hearses as well as a motorized cars to uh our oldest vehicle\nIt's an eight to thirty two horse drawn hers and we believe it's the only one in the country and ah and then the one that probably\nMore people talk about than anything else\nA and there's only from what we know there's only two and existing and we have one of them the Nineteen sixty\nPackard bus hers over in Europe when they go out to the cemetery they use one big bucks or as a family in the back in the polar bears and then the\nCoughing and then the driver that's is it only goes sixty miles an hour\nAnd um so the one that we have was built a course in Nineteen sixty but there was a flock to it which nobody realized the car was shipped out to San Francisco and was used at the funeral well with all of the hills in San Francisco the\nRear axle was up too far toward the cab ... when they had the family loaded the fall bears loaded and then the cats get loaded as it started to go up the hill it flipped over\nAnd everybody came tumbling out so that was the last time that the car was used and then uh uh she hurt her habit and he turned it into a house and then one of our board members founded because it's such a rare car\nAnd he completely restored it and now that we haven't in art museum mhm and uh it's completely restored it's a beautiful little car but we had to unload it when we got it at a low enough loading dock in downtown Houston and then it took us all day to drive up to the museum because only go sixty miles an hour\nNow Bob when you see everybody came out does that include the corps\nTo yeah I don't know that okay oh say that Rodolfo that part of the family came tumbling out let's just say they're all on the ground there the put him back [laughter] sounds better yeah you know with\nYour question for you know I'm a big I love her so I I think they are the\nI think here the coolest car and and the artwork behind those cars I mean when when people who does car they think of death I look at those cars and thinking of the work when shipped behind them I mean just if you look at like a sixty two Pontiac or a holding to hear you I mean they just breathtaking when I look at the amount of design them would behind those cars\nBack in the early Nineteen twenties is when the craftsmanship really took place as well as the horse drawn hearses 'em when they went to the motorized vehicles\nThey took the box of a horse drawn hers was very ornate and then they removed the bed of the pickup truck and then they had mounted on there that's where the very first one\nAnd we have one of the very first one it's a Model T pay and it's a beautiful little car cool and uh but we have a Nineteen Twenty one rock falls and most of the hearses are painted that color\nA black is mainly for an adult uh mainly for a man white hearses\nAnd gray horses are for a child or a late okay well this Nineteen Twenty one that we have it's made up a bird's eye maple and sixteen other words the fire wall is probably maybe three ... three feet thick and it's all different kinds of woods so they're sixteen different what's in this car\nBut it's a natural color it's not ...\nAt all and it has lamps on the side and stained glass windows and uh it's just an incredible car\nSo what you're telling me that back in the day when did they stopped doing that because probably cause financial reasons for the funeral moons but back in the old days it too was whiter gray was your children and they had a black her for the men\nYes I never knew that but we'll leave it on the motorized cars 'cause I can remember Moby in black grown I remember a dark green when one of the funerals my small town I grew up in\nYeah um that was mainly back in the Victorian era okay and then as you start to get into the motorized versus a lot of them are black or or bottled ti ti ti is the style of it is great and then we have a horse drawn hers or for a child that is white and it was pulled by two adult men\nWho had a is absolutely incredible car\nTalking with Bob better of the national museum of funeral history buff who's going to ask you is there a governor to keep the speed down on a hearse or is there a top speed I mean can you open up person go about eighty eighty five not that you're in any hurry when I was just wondering if we're limited as to how fast they can go\nNow it's just good judgment [laughter] ah [laughter] you know you don't\nLeave the entire procession behind you as you're speeding along\nWith the local speedway that I work at sometimes there's a a hearse it comes to the Bernanke competition it's like a sixty catty and he wins rather you\nKnow they'll get they'll get her done though they'll kill the bag dire especially the older they have a big block in them and stuff they'll be able\nTo go for Seventy two and what they called dead on arrival or something they got it all get all lower but I you know I I've seen a lot of tricked out and I I really I'm going to own one the next few years and I definitely want to like put air right on it and making a show called I think it'd be really cool right\nBut it's ... they're going up in value which is a good thing and fire trucks are starting to rise to yeah\nUm this past June we hosted the professional car society\nAnd uh all of their members either on ambulances versus or fire trucks and we had rain so he didn't have as many people thought we still had about thirty cars wow and and trust\nAnd uh they're unbelievable that they all run and when they came down to the Houston on their convention or they drove all nothing was traded him mhm and uh you know cars from the sixties fifties or and then they had some fire trucks you know from from the forties or just gorgeous\nNow I've got a question for you I understand you have a pope mobile there too\nYes we have an exhibit of five thousand square foot exhibit called celebrating life and death of a cold and we have a Nineteen eighty two range rover political ...\nIt was use or the Holy Father ... jump off a second when he went went to England and that they had made especially for him and uh that don't have any types of bulletproof glass but it's a beautiful a car and he could stand up and then he could walk out the top\nAnd um we had as our guest folks Taylor and we flew him over from Italy and when he first saw the ... you said Nineteen eighty to England\nWow but yeah I mean so he knew the advance and then we are we doing that exhibit and uh the gentleman that is redoing it found a picture of the crowd back in Nineteen eighty two\nSo now he had that blown up and it it takes up the wall but we have the pope will deal that was actually used in the crowd that was actually ...\nIs our that's cool now do you have any up her from a president's with their last right as well to\nYes we have a two thousand and three Cadillac masterpiece that was used for the state\nState funeral the ... Ronald Reagan and president poured out in California okay and and that 'cause there was actually three urges used for them but this was the one that was use out of California\nWhile I was er three use\nWealthy that there was one out in California for President Reagan and President Ford there and there's one used in Washington DC which was a matching car okay and uh so that was for also both of them and then Ronald Reagan came back to California a Gerald Ford went up to\nMichigan yeah a ... up to a Grand Rapids ...\nI just drew a blank for a second I'm Sorry uh up to a Grand Rapids so so we used three different cars\nWill Bob of people want more information again where is the national museum of natural history located give us the website and all the information to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Charleston", "day": "20"}
