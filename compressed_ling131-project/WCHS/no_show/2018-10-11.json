linebacker they're playing for the for the ... right\nYeah that's exactly right and a ... and the receiver right\nYeah well there Kevin White yeah Kevin White collar\nSo yeah so we were we uh we like our West Virginia connection\nCrusade that absolutely appreciate your support so bud\nLet's jump in here uh we we collectively the three of us here find this game extremely intriguing coming up here on Saturday and even though now we're at the midpoint of the season I think we're both still trying to figure out who we are both West Virginia and Iowa State do you think that's a fair assessment\nI Do um I you know obviously\nWe know a lot more about West Virginia I think has to date were for your team [noise] um but I Do think they're really good I mean it's just\nThat that has certain obvious that come in the back half of the scheduled for you guys for us it was on the front have a schedule I mean we have a we played\nJames one two three and four first for opponents of the big twelve 'cause it seems one two three and four year ago so um I I think it's I think it is an intriguing I thank God you know I think it will be a great environment um I I think it's too pretty salty defenses\nAnd pretty you know pretty nice officers if we face I always stayed on last week uh obviously West Virginia's explosive off and on but it should be a really fascinating game I I think it'll be a lot of fun to watch\nJon certainly brought pretty team out of the Oklahoma State victory with a whole lot of a claim and deservedly so but you know some kids are one hit wonder some of them it's just the sort of a a great career where where's ... you think in that realm\nWell that's what we're going to find out I mean I I tend to lean\nAnd maybe it's just wishful thinking forward the ladder um I don't think he'll be a one hit wonder the coaching staff was really high on them I'm In the weeks leading up to that game and had been kinda chomping at the bit to get them out there\nAnd they knew going into last week scam that they were going to play on the second series and then they see what happened beyond that\nBut he went out there and played with the voice of a of a veteran guy always true freshman I didn't even come into spring so he just arrived on campus three months ago and\nFor him to do what he did was really impressive you know the first session he had he once ran out I had a nice gone on a third ate got seven yards almost got the first album they had on it away\nAnd they put 'em out for the next session and then\nYou know the five of those six possessions from that point forward resulted in Iowa State touchdowns ... very very well\nUm [noise] he just looked so called back there and I think we're seeing more and more of that in college football all these days for young quarterbacks come in more sophisticated more ready to play and I think a lot of it is not you know it's not like Twenty years ago where these kids were playing\nThe wish thrown in high school and then they get to the college level and they have to figure out how to become a college level quarterback a lot of these kids are playing the same system in their high school programs plus they go to those\nUh you know pretty sophisticated passing camps quarterback camps seven on seven feet or activities and things of that nature and so I think more of them come in\nJohn really
