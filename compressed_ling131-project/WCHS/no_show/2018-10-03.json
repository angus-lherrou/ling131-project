tell you this Mike I'm the fact that you have these situations and someone was talking about this you can pay these guys\nRight tons of money but ... but at the end of it all they're still human beings right and we as fans get real emotional and kind of sometimes lose what our perspective is that happens is well the coaches that's why the greatest of the great\nOr just the the airplane pilot that never gets rattled no bad how bad the turbulence are right those are the great ones those are the great ones and you know frankly came back out and said you know Ohio State came out so we knew exactly what they're going to run either going to run zone read we had it done\nLike so why can't James Franklin go like what did they think we're going to run had those votes right what do they think we're ... what do they think we're going to run All right let's do something absolutely opposite of that\nIt'd be a genius but you don't know because you also want your best play yeah but as your if
