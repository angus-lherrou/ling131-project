yeah it was good we left this morning low earlier than normal life Waco bad eleven I'm not sure why [laughter] hey but uh we are here and looking forward to it\nYou know leaves or leaves are turning pretty there now where you're ... you're saying we need a I'll text you or did you guys need to dig a little run the morals or twenty minutes from where you are at a ... head up to Cooper's rock you guys are like that along\nParty on really get very on opening and thought well I'll ...\nI'll do it will do it absolutely so bring us up to speed on on your bears I'm obviously coming off to go after the loss on that Texas which played longhorns well it's anybody's game\nOr in the fourth quarter of play and to this point it sounds and it seems from our perspective is though the rebuild of this program with Matt rule is on schedule and you guys are getting better each and every outing fair assessment\n[noise] I think so the the Texas game was probably our best game all year complete effort especially given the competition and on the road so uh that's what you want you want to get better every game out and or\nIf it's on schedule that's probably right also although it's never as fast as as everybody wants to ... you know fans want her the process which ... talks about they want to be overnight but uh that was not going to happen so definite improvement in the second year under coach rule compared to last season\nWe saw Charlie brewer and the second half of last season's game against West Virginia how has he changed from coming in there as a freshman year ago to now is a sophomore\nI think last year when you saw him remember he was a true fresh now he he was just out of a lake Travis high school in Austin area really high level high school program but you know it's pretty big step from any high school too that if they want big twelve level\nSo he was still still sort of feeling his way now I think he's got a much better grasp of ah ah what the coaches want from him\nOr he sees bigger and stronger this year having been away a year and the white program um and and I just think he has more command more presence with the ... you know he's a truce sophomore but still he's really the unquestioned later on that often subside\nA which is pretty impressive says a lot about him and his personality so\nI'm Glad we got him and Charlie salmon a good sophomore season\n... sixty five times on your rented Thirteen times against Texas so he's got that ability obviously in there and they're using them to run that thing\nYeah and he's not afraid to do it I mean if that's the best option you will definitely do that so uh that that that sort of what he brings you know he's got a good accurate arm maybe it's not the it's not a ... a arm but he can throw the ball on the on target and then he'll run when he needs to and not afraid to ride\nIn John it looks like he's got a couple of really good receivers we've seen other good ones at Baylor since West Virginia joined us lead but we're we're to jail in her ... sit in that category\nYeah a ... is a is pre season all big twelve and having a good year good solid year are not spectacular but he is the guy that you can certainly count on a jailing hurts an interesting story transferred to Baylor a as a it was a running back at Tennessee and do his best\nPro potential was probably as a receiver and so he switched he came here with the intention to be moved to receiver and he is he's really good he's a he's very athletic league gifted\nAnd we're using the backfield on certain occasions looks very smooth and very natural and does run the ball but ah as a receiver he's he's really good he's the guy that can take a short\nPaths and you know he can take it along the way after he makes the catch John ... those\nGuys are are top too but you know Chris Platt is in that mix as well who's strictly and we've got several receiver so he's got plenty of targets\n... is our guest the voice of the Baylor Bears John looks like at the running backs by you're doing it by committee or do you Michael Hastings got fifty five carries Jon Lovett Scott forty nine ah trust an Abner has got thirty three so pretty much three headed running back\nYeah pretty much and all those guys at certain spots have been hurt an out ah but ah all three are available for tomorrow and I and they're all good you know they all do things really well and faith on\nOne thing to watch all those guys catch the ball really well out of the ... we got a lot of uh receptions by are running backs I think more than any\nA mini any school in the big twelve so they're not afraid to do that and that's that's pretty good weapon you know those guys can catch it coming out of backfield as well as run it\nJohn often flew there are a lot of really nice statistics are all across the board defensively though those aren't as pretty ...\nI think are the big issue that we've had in a in some games in ... that not was given up ... given up explosive plays", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Charleston", "day": "24"}
