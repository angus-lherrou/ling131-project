John\nThe American conversation this is in some ways the perfect wedge issue in that it was happening that's extremely polarizing you have people who are vehemently in favor of the players want there don't you also have people who find it to be deeply unpatriotic out strongly against it\nSo it's a very divisive issue and not only is it sports but it's something that reaches the highest level of politics it's something that President Donald Trump regularly treated about spoke about last year so when you look at that at first glance might seem strange but then when you think about it or it starts to make more and more steps\nAnd you're saying that uh there were a couple of dozen accounts roughly at the same time tweeting the exact same the same exact thing right\nYeah so there clearly is operated by a small groups of people who made a\nFake identities the whole point is that they want to be the ... look like they were\nReal Americans tweeting about these things and you can that was true also uh when they were treating political issues and so these people would be you'd see a\nTwenty four how sweet the exact same thing at the exact same time or within minutes of each other and they'd be very politically charged statements saying things like how can\nThe NFL disrespect ... we saw that the majority of the tweets that had a part of feeling or from what\nThe researchers called white trolls which means that they were a conservative and they were and those people were typically very much against the player protests are on the other hand you saw some people who are said things that could be seen as inflammatory from the other side and very much strongly in favor of the players\nWere speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Andrew beaten his piece is called how Russian trolls inflamed the NFL's anthem controversy or this is still going on I presume has been no attempt to shut this down to be a violation of free speech perhaps but I don't know is there anything like that happening behind the scenes\nOh I'll be the cats that a reference happening shut down um but the\nThe the whole thing is though that when these accounts or shut down the new ones are made and new ones are made so what so there's definitely still what the researchers told us that those definitely count still being monitored that are that way then more recently on various topics whether that was\nThe Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick that were also drew a lot of charged reactions or the U.S open final between sweeter Williams\nAnd and I only have soccer that also really drew a lot of attention so it's\nClear that they the sport as a way into the conversation about American culture in a way to sort of discord\nSo they're obviously sowing discord of some kind of does that mean that the tweets are influential\nIt definitely varies I mean some of these is the cat didn't have many followers and probably didn't reach that many people on the other hand there were instances of a cat these accounts that good to have\nA tens of thousands of followers and could have tens of thousands of retreats so it\nSo it definitely varies across a broad range of structure I mean of course it also needs to be\nPut in the context that that there's probably this is just a portion of the giants the of tweets that are sent on the subject that they obviously huge conversations for anybody but it's fascinating to see that these became a ... something that they saw as a wedge issue\nWith Andrew Wall Street journal reporter Andrew beaten it's twelve minutes now after the hour on this
