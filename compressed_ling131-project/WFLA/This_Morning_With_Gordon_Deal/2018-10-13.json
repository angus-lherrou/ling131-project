{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "To start the first couple of days so it's no surprise to me that they're changing that aspect of this rally orange Joseph wind intact because it's it's been there ... and that is good and bad and a lot of ways [noise]\nUm but yeah I just you know the the the short wave for us to stop asking him and for fans and stopped much needed to go out and produce like we noticed team can produce [noise]\nAnd it it wouldn't be uncommon they put a ... you know I mean a Legal Center rapid temperature it's gotten a lead author them we'll see you break for the\nAnswer you know that's that's what happens when you know\nWe started asking the players these questions well because they get tired of answering them then they go on the answer among the ice you all have the best way to get an answer to see that wouldn't surprise me at all if they find their breakthrough tonight this is a moving of some of the winds around kind of shake things up in life and even\nThough because I I think you're not worried that they're going to eventually score a lot of old I'm not concerned I don't think a ton of the mandates necessarily as I think you bring up a good point is the first two games but I think\nThe nine to find glasses on a little bit more I think that jumped to perhaps tinkered with the line [noise] yeah you know and I think that maybe a contradiction to what we have felt like you know they're going to snap out of this [noise]\nWhat do you make of that [noise]\nUm I did for the reasons I just mentioned it to stay on the upper hand in yes it's a started the season but the ICC has I don't know the numbers are and I'm not you know me I'm not a huge numbers I liked the I pass more I Do look at it from the time or in terms of shock camps and stuff like that for and against but the task tells me\nThat they're they're stale yeah and so from that aspect\nThat that's the only thing I read into it that you can solve if they were generating chances and they just weren't join and if they have the park in the zone for extended periods of time\n[noise] that's one thing they have and they didn't want it done when they've been in there um they haven't look dangerous really for the most part so to me that that's what this comes out of it is is just see how how they look on the access and and what it looked\nLike are they passing up shot or is it is it more than that for sure [noise] um because they shot they were Seventeen to buy them now see your point surgery shot attempt it really didn't think the first line did a heck of a lot of our country which is surprising\nYeah um yeah you know I Know I think back to a a\nPlay the Nikita Khrushchev had where he had the hockey is entering his own from the right circle he cuts was last season that that prime time slot area now you'll find scorn zone and he passes offices I\nKnow when it connects in a building or not we think are beautiful pass\nBut when you go back and you look at it go well he passed up a really good chance especially how many calls we sleep ... like that where he's tell you one way and he finds a way to shoot back across the rain to write a goalie sliding to his rights and the puck comes back to what\nWe've seen has won many goals like math throughout his career [noise] so yeah I I think and this this is what you get and you know we mentioned this when we had a round round table while ago about elite players have to play with the players sometimes will sometimes will declare the plane with the players and find out and that means over passing and I think sometimes\nThat creeps into the mindset too much and they're not selfish and which is crazy to think a league players usually things are selfish unselfish no news\nBut some of the players are like that though the ultimate team guy absolutely and they they do end up they want\nThey want to help out you know they're they're ... at the end like vine burns had the best line right they're going from a chance to have a chance and most of us are going to use that ... that are not\nUse that to give ... definitely\nThat that's what you do and that's that's what we love about girls and on our show here do we seen the ...\nOn the power play at all and I assume and kept they get [noise] get some chap [noise]\nWe'll have to see you know it was a surprise to me the other night with a five hour play chances they had that sort of separately and I'm like forty second [noise] I'm a power play because he had been throughout practice\nThe leading up to the season opener and on for a couple of days leading into the Vancouver games he had been the first guy that had been running a second powerful use andme McDonald had been the other guy fighting and getting some work with them as well why do you think there's much I don't\nI don't know I'm as as we mentioned a little bit during the intermission the other night I think this is just one of those subtle messages that coaches like Santa and I've seen John Cooper staff\nDo are quite a bit that don't be complacent because of what you did last year [noise] you know okay yeah my surgery you had a fantastic work here on the fence when you really leaps and bounds\nFrom the beginning a new year to the end of the year yes you're potentially a wizard with a ... some of the things that she can do what you saw you know but I don't want you to think too much of this I Want you to make sure that you understand your first priority is making sure you're planning to do face first and then then we'll throw you a little candy and you get to\nGo in the sense of what's that again because I [noise]\nYou like any other like a C a Swedish Fish and just for show he does not even chocolate [noise]\nLook what look everybody was talking to

started training camps through the preseason went on to these first\nTwo games uh I think it's it's great family you send in a great message that he's here and he wants to contribute and he wants
