{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "To the doctor Sean and you know we've heard this story today we started off this hour with Mara she lost thirty pounds in just forty days and what I\nThought and I'm curious to get your thoughts on this ... you hear this a lot when I thought it was interesting about her story was how the habits that she learned during the course of her forty days on your program\nTrickle down to the rest of her family you know they didn't go through the program but they picked up healthier habits because of it yeah it's a big part of what we do obviously a large concern of mine is what's happening to the the American family the break\nSome of the American family and most importantly or specifically is our level of health chronic inflammation but the food consumption\nIs off the charts individuals do not know how to make the proper choices in life it's a big part of our program run you know this it's not a weight loss program it's a beautiful tremendous educational experience but as we take you through this process I Want to show you how to reintroduce\nThe proper beautiful nurturing nutritious foods for a lifetime I don't want to share to lose weight for forty days but I Want to she had to do this thing for the next\nForty years and when you think about it regardless of your level of health your age group you're demographic you and I were making choices today\nIn either we're building health for the next ten twenty thirty or forty years were guess what we're aggressively going in the wrong direction our body is breaking down it's the premature aging process but we're slowly building disease and\nThink about it this way that house around the waistline that toxic dangerous\nBelly fat Lara made mention of that but she talked about the visceral fat right this is the dangerous the hidden fat that surrounds the heart the lungs deliver\nThe kidney the pancreas this is the dangerous aggressive fat that surrounds the waistline but in essence it it compromises those vital organs of the body but it creates high levels of toxicity of crates high levels of chronic information and you know this chronic inflammation\nIt's the number one cause of chronic degenerative disease and I'm Talking about heart disease and cancer in diabetes and stroke and ... and dementia ... but in essence it's the premature\nAging process and so as we take a patient to the program I Love the weight loss you have to understand and you've been to the program\nThe weight loss is awesome it's tremendous but the weight loss it's just a byproduct of the program I Want these individuals' reaching their God given health potential I Want to energy homeostasis which is the highest level of health but it's the way you\nRest it's the way you sleep it's the way you breathe that's the way you move but it's your level of energy but it's getting your system your body\nInto the optimal state of healing again not so much a weight loss program\nBut this is a gets you healthy program and that's what I Want our our our participants to understand that's the experience that I Want them to go through and it's so unique and\nI Love the feedback and responses from patients it's so much fun working with him and I do I love my team my staff you know each and every one of them but not so much my employees but they are truly my my family members and it's a unique opportunity for us taking these individuals' through the program being a part of the Tampa Bay\nCommunity and watching these individuals get tremendously healthy and I do\nI Want you to feel good I Want health restoration and so if you're listening to us today I Want to reach out to you I'd love to meet with you I Want to work with you and I know everybody says some day we'll make that some day day one and get into our office you experience a tremendous\nForty day life transforming process and I do I want you to feel good the weight loss is great but it's a package\nDeal it's kind of a side effect of the program\nAnd you know going back to the visceral fat you you talked about something that you know it's just it's a really bad thing to have in your body or you don't have to be massively overweight to have\nToo much visceral fat correct because you know when I went into your office and started the program I wasn't massively overweight but my visceral fat levels were in the rat I mean there were no weren't good yeah everybody wants to understand how that works and there's a term that's I guess quite popular today\nBut it's called skinny fat and you have to understand visceral fat if you're tuning in right now I Want you to Google visceral fat look it up but when you come into our facility was beautiful about it we're going to take all of those measurements it's a computer generated body composition analysis\nBut my goodness on a hard copy on the computer screen in essence run you know this you're looking at a blueprint of your health but your body mass\nIndex your specific body fat percentage\nThis is your body's percentile of fat storage I Want your body out of fat storage I wanted in a healing state of fat metabolism and Laura said gosh Dr ... I just feel clean I feel\nLied on my feet I've clarity of my mind my my level of energy is through the roof and really that's what means the most to me that's what I Want our patients to experience but it's\nPrepping your system for the next five ten Fifteen Twenty years but tapping into that fountain of youth again it's a forty day program at say life transforming processed no drugs no shots no pre packaged foods I Want health restoration I Want you to feel tremendously tremendously well\nAnd that body composition analysis the doctor was just talking about that as part of your initial consultation and that initial consultation has a three hundred dollar value but because you're listening to this show right now if you use code Ryan R y A N\nYou get that initial consultation for only twenty seven dollars and really when you see it on paper\nYou say you know it's very simple if you're in the green you're good if you're in the ... not so much and for the most part I think most people when they walk in are probably going to be more in the red than they like to be I Know I was when I got it back but it is an eye opener and you know I got to tell you when I saw for myself it concerns you know then of course you're there\nAt the doctors on helping weight loss center and the solution to the problem that you're looking at is right in front of you you had it\nBreaks down those numbers and Ryan may mention of it it's so simplistic how it works but we want to look at your body mass index your body fat percentage I Want to see your level of cellular hydration and I get it no one wants to talk about water Ron water's kinda\nAge to do is kind of boring but you must grasp and understand water\nIs the number one healing catalyst in the human body not water\nConsumption but water absorption and the number for your level of visceral fat but tune in to us we want to meet with you we want to work with you and that number is\nWe've got the number right here for four yes

represented whites and non whites are much more heavily leaning toward the Democratic party\nAnd we see the pillow race along with religion we're increasingly trying to get an education team and that you know more educated voters are now starting to lean toward the Democratic party more\nSo you know that there is to test that you know even if you say that your political identity is not that important to you all of these other kinds of identity that are important team increasingly kind of tell us about your politics\nWell respected Emily badger writer for upshot at the New York times and she's written a piece titled Americans either politics don't defined them but it's complicated you said to people even change their policy preferences depend\nOn which identities they're thinking about what does that mean\nWell too so you have lots of different identity is at any given them and you know you have a radio show you are and then\nUh you know you know from a particular part of the country is silly\nIt with your home town and whichever one of those as important to you may sort of changed by the moment depending on what you're doing and what you're thinking about so political scientists have found that you know people policy preferences can change if you get them to think about certain identities or other identities so for example a\nYou know Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support things like sentencing reform\nA or you know to to say that they want to spend money on social services and that's one point and then worrying about the the federal deficit\nBut political scientists have done experiments where they've shown that if you get Democrats to sort of think about the fact that their parents first and foremost you actually see their\nViews shifted to become a little bit more conservative on those kinds of questions so that suggests that you know identity is kind of fluid thing that shift depending on you know the context that you're in you're thinking about but ah\nThat that your policy preferences might shift as well I think it's a little bit surprising to us because most of us tend to think that our policy preferences are these very sort of well thought out logical conclusion that we reach\nEmily badger she writes were up shot at the New York times twelve minutes now after the hour on this weekend [noise]\n\nAllergy sufferers my

listening to America's first news this weekend with the\nAdvice for spending some of this how\nCool would this have been back in the day of four day school week Wall Street journal says more schools are adopting a four day schedule to save money and attract teachers here's this weekend's Jennifer ...\nIt saves money and it retains teachers for days school schedules are starting to spread across the country to an al hubs or the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend how widespread is this for a day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we are actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\nYou know at the end though that's a really good question and what a from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have you know more district spread out more rural district because this is something that started in rural district and it's still very dominant role districts\nAnd um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nSo now why did the rural districts decide to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers aren't really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as you were absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it and now they're unexpected benefits that seventies districts initially going into it to save money or is that while you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know they're noticing fewer teacher absence as\nWe're speaking with turnout hubs or the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours\nAnd you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum uh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day\nIt just depends on where they were at when they started when they when they were all five days if they were already exceeding the hours there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nNow does each state decide its own hours and or days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm\n... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever and there are some states that still\nDo base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at ours has you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that empty day\nYeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day\nAnd what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's non profits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the and the school district might provide the meals\nWe interrupt

I mean Johnson was that ... was that and so it does feel like they have the ... system\nThat just keeps producing guys that that joined the NFL level ready to play and I think often bring a lot of speed to the table\nSo that was ... from the hockey news as we said in the open the loudest played the lightning extremely tough over the years Tampa Bay will be looking to reverse that trend tonight John Cooper knows his team for battle against the while\n\nYeah the wild when here on a regular basis and uh there was a great environment here the beautiful rink and the fans are into it and so it's this is going to be a tough one\nBut as I said we've\nWe took care of business at home but understanding that if you want to be playing in\nThe April May and June after one of the road and uh so speaking to us for us", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "Tampa", "day": "20"}
