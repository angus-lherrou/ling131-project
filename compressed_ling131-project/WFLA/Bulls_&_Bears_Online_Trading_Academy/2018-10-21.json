digit potential returns but does not participate when the market goes down\nAnd folks this has been part of our family's financial foundation now for well over Twenty years because I'm somebody likely like many of you listening that knows what it feels like to lose money and in light of what's happened just this last week where many people took a three percent tumble just in one day this last mid week day\nThe fourth largest single point drop in art stock market history just transpired this last week\nAnd as the headlines read which I again this isn't a fear tactic this is just educate people CNBC reporter this last week there's more pain to come for stocks according to analysts are watching the charts\nCNBC also said they're warning signs of a big market sell off was coming and investors believe there's more to go Amazon and it's a Facebook plummeted stocks a tech stocks recorded their worst day in seven years this past Wednesday and the folks the list goes on and on and on\nAnd it it's not good news because again what what's the reality here let's review the facts were nine and a half years into the longest Bull Run and stock market history\nRight no bull markets ever made it to its tenth birthday\nIn the last time right that the second longest bull market being fueled by the dot com boom and then unfortunately the rally went bust in the nineties caused investors to lose nearly eighty percent folks I'm One of them\nI'm somebody that I'm going to teach you indexing versus investing that anchor down our family ... financial foundation and praise the lord I we had that but at the same time I got greedy as Warren Buffett talks about I did the opposite I he says be greedy what others are fearful but be fearful when others are greedy\nAnd I took too much risk and it it prompted\nAll those years ago are experiencing the loss of some of our families money into studying what the flu and the ultra wealthy have done for years and this is an interesting statistic that many people that I've had the opportunity to educate I'm not just a best selling author or national radio educator I'm somebody that\nHas written several books a two time best selling author and it all came from the things that I've learned from other people\nAnd then by applying these techniques and showing people how these techniques can work in conjunction with one another enables folks to discovered uncovered their various areas of hitting the wealth\nThat typically reside in the two biggest threats to boomers which ended up being the two biggest success techniques and that is a limit ... stock market crashes\nAnd eliminating unnecessary taxes to getting rid of the crashes and taxes folks is not that difficult in other words having a stock market protection plan any unnecessary not to pay tax savings\nPlans and it's all done through using the tax code right judge hands several years ago said there's two types of of of of taxes are in this country tax payers I should say that he says they are in this country the informed and the uninformed right however both are legal\nFolks this is not deceptive tax evasion this is strategic tax avoidance it's teaching people how to grow money without tax access their money without tax and transfer it without tax that's a savings in itself\nBut protecting yourself from this market volatility that I Believe his back right to lose eight hundred and thirty two points in one day this past week being the fourth largest single point drop in our stock markets history\nIs giving people the riding on the wall with many people predicting this happening well before now I myself have been teaching people how to get ... they're serious retirement savings anger down and secured\nTo not not just a lot lose with folks it's called lock in and reset so let me spending just a minute on this for you because this may be one of the biggest breakthroughs the boomers have shared\nThat I'll be teaching this coming Tuesday or more specifically that I Want you to be able to learn more about right people don't have is one clients that ... we don't have the time\nTo go through another major market meltdown we we do not have the time to recover\nAnd of course folks that's the big concern right but many people are caught off guard by these unnecessary taxes\nLet me teach you just a couple of quick techniques then I'll be teaching more about an in depth and detail this coming Tuesday lock in reset it's a unique provision in the engineering of how to to to structure your savings that you're going\nI mean to build a structured cash flow of of secure retirement income from so that you don't run out of money before you run out of life\nIn the strategy is very simple as the market goes up your money isn't in the daily ups and downs and all around the stock market right especially with all this volatility but ironically the volatility itself actually makes this strategy better\nNow I Know that sounds kind of odd or counterintuitive so how can volatility helped me Chuck let's let's think about this\nWhen when the market has again our clients lock in that game never risk of giving that gained back\nWhich is not what anybody else has I can assure you I I I personally sit with clients on a weekly basis and and I can't believe nor can they the exposure that they start to realize they have by some of our software analysis one just the other day with would lose fifty five percent of another await market crash hits\nAnd they can't afford that has no one could it but it's the same time when there's again it's locked in huge peace of mind sleeping better no worry right and when the market does lose there's the floor of protection\nSo it's a lock in but here's the key though reset so if the S. and P. today let's say fell a thousand points\nAre clients don't lose they lock in any prior gains not at risk of giving them back\nAnd then they get the advantage of the index that they're tracking only games not losses to Theresa sat at the lowest point\nTo start their next game right so in other words if the S. and P. loses a thousand points the folks have to wait for that thousand points to be made back before they start any new game our clients start their new game from the lowest level forward\nFolks that is huge that's a way to out Fox Wall Street and how we've been getting that done and helping clients secure they're serious retirement savings\nFor over two decades now\nHere's the things I I Want to teach you this coming Tuesday so for those that have saved at least two hundred thousand or more are typically between the ages of forty five and Seventy five I don't care if you're getting to retirement or you're getting through retirement you can improve you can increase this

avoid having eighty five percent of their Social Security tax\nA number to avoiding having their retirement income tax a number three avoiding leaving a unnecessary inheritance tax to your kids or your grandkids\nAnd ultimately giving people the ability to live more and ironically leave more all without\nTax but also without the sleepless nights concerns of when the market did its thing right if you remember back when it did its thing an eight hundred point drop or an eight hundred point gain was that the ... not the exception folks I think it's back\nAnd whether it's back or not can you honestly say you have a stock market protection plan and an unnecessary tax protection plan because you can\nUm here's some of the things I Want to teach you tax free liquidity having access when and how you needed\nMarket volatility protection right the uh the red removing the uncertainty of when the next crash or drop or correction takes place and ultimately with now running a seven hundred and eighty two billion dollar deficit through twenty Eighteen right folks the writings on the wall where taxes have to go\nSo here's the opportunity for those that registering the tin or the first fifty I
