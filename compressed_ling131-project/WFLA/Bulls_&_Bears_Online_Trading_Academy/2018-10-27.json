for one loan to compensate for this\nPsycho scores ignore and mortgage I was doing and increase made in the early days prior to your scoring right this is All right I might go dot com so it's actually under two sections ones that are does the formula treat all credit increase the same it's also under what to know about rape shopping\nOr they've also got some great tips on here about how to improve improve your psycho scores and all that is on my psycho dot com under credit checks and increased so\nYou know again you don't have to take my word for word it's right there in in any company who tells you not to shop around not to know don't talk to any of my competitors are going to talk to your credit score shirt his buddy ... just know what that's all about\nYou know and I will I Will promise you know one here will ever tell you that if they do offer firemen to spy if I ever hear that one of my loan officers told somebody not to have their credit pulled by a competitor because it would drop their score because it's a big load of malarkey\nSo another urban myth disproven when you're shopping for a mortgage to buy something costing a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more every the interest rate fluctuation and all that will cost you majored Tyler's\nAgain used saving thousands rule number one always shop around especially when it comes to a mortgage but it'll work for you was almost every purchase your copy of the Fifteen saving thousands rules to success can be found is saving thousands dot com on the Web\nWe have time for one more question from the audience Robert getting into our final segment of the show court wants to know the financial formula he would\nUse to see you're getting a reply is a good idea today so Robert\nYeah round the most important thing people have to understand is is when is it beneficial to refinance right and there's all these urban legends and myth that old wives' tales and my personal favorite is this is one that was perpetrated by the big banks and they tell people you shouldn't refinance your mortgage unless you can save two percent yeah okay\nI Know first off I Want to put this in perspective and when they when this came about interest rates were like Seventeen or Eighteen percent so yeah if the race that high you've got to save two percent to make a difference because rates are so so high\nYou know that's cutting your interest by about ten percent of what it is yeah well now the rates are so low if you're eight six six cutting it by ten percent will be going down to five point for right so the same proportion of drop is just not there the other thing is the banks they don't want you to refinance\nPaying them six percent today huh why would they want you to pay four percent right does that how they make their money doesn't make any sense so so many people get hung up\nOn this idea of well I have to save ... percent or it's not worth it to refinance aren't so that's not the case at all so I don't want to walk people through today is how to do the calculation I could it's different for everybody that actually different for everybody how to do the calculation of how much you're going to say\nTo the first thing you need to figure out is what are the upfront costs of the mortgage love right okay\nSo that's the first thing we have to know it there's there's three things that go on to this equation the upfront costs on the mortgage loan the monthly savings from the refinance\nAnd the amount of time you're going to be in that home ... the number one is to get those upfront costs now someone who's out there they charge crazy amount a lender fees you could end up paying for five six seven thousand dollars on the cost to refinance\nWhatever that that cost is will be given to you by your lender on what's called a good faith estimate\nOr some companies use a form called an initial the worksheet either way you need to know how much those closing costs are in the state of Florida we have intangible tax we have ducks stamps we have a title insurance all of these costs play in and then you add in any lender feed the lenders charging and easily upfront costs\nNow what is not a cost but we also we lift it on the sheet is the amount of money needed to establish your escrow account\nSo what happens is Rob when you have an escrow account the lender is going to pay your taxes and insurance for you annually so they have to have enough money in the accounts to pay that so if you refinance your mortgage your mortgage in March\nAnd your first payment is due in may and your taxes are due in November you're going to make a may payment uh June payment uh July payment and August payment a September ... and October payment and then boom the taxes are due in November\nRight you're only gonna made six payments but they've got to pay twelve months worth of taxes so what happens is they have to get the difference from you up right yes All right so that's a stat wishing your escrow account\nNow this is not a cost because what happens is your old Linder\nHas to send you a check for any money left in your old escrow account so this is a Washington so when you're determining the cost of the mortgage loan you take the good faith as many of these worksheet and you did duck the amount of money being collected for homeowners insurance escrow and packed\nEscrow and this is going to leave you with the cost of the loan than you are right that number down to be two thousand three thousand four thousand five thousand maybe zero whatever that number is you need to write that down the next thing you look at is what is your monthly savings okay now this can be a little tough to\nIt's not just up payment savings and if you have\nTwenty eight years left on your mortgage and you refinance to a thirty year fixed you're going back two years so the payments can actually be a little lower because you've added two years onto the tail end of the mortgage which you have to actually look at is how much interest argue saving every payment Mm okay\nNot the total payment savings because it's all payment savings if you go from a twenty year to attend a Fifteen year the payments can actually go up but you're still saving money in interest so you know what that interest savings is\nThe way you do this as you take your loan amounts right\nAnd you multiply it by rote interest rate so a hundred thousand are alone if I was at six percent I was going to pay six thousand dollars in interest that year if I take a hundred thousand our loan times four percent I'm going to pay four thousand dollars in interest right that's the difference ... till you calculate the difference between that too is that differences two thousand dollars divided up by twelve\nAnd that's your monthly savings or just look at it as a yearly number I'm going to save two thousand dollars the first year it costs me four thousand dollars in upfront costs therefore it will take me two years to break even on this refinance loans if I'm going to sell the house and twelve months bad deal if I'm going to sell the house in twenty four months\nI break even but who wants to get a mortgage just to break even bad deal if I'm going to be in that house for four five six seven eight years\nNow I can really save some money so you have to look at those two numbers compared to each other you take the upfront costs compared to the yearly savings see how many years it's going to take you to make up the difference to start saving money and then think about how many years you're gonna be in that house\nBecause there are some people out there if if they're getting a loan with no costs and they're dropping the rate just say point two five percent that's still point two five percent in pure savings\nIf you go from a four and a quarter to a four percent rate would know costs\nAre two hundred thousand are alone that's roughly five hundred dollars a year in savings if you're going to be in your house for ten years you can save a lot of money that way so don't don't think of any rule of thumb there is no\nOld wives' tale of oh it's got to be ... percent of a drop it's gotta be something that makes sense for your financial situation and if you're going to leave that house in the next twelve months there is no number that makes financial sense if you're only a couple of years away from paying the mortgage off\nThere is no number that makes financial sense right but if you're going to be in that house for the next Thirty years and there is not very much in upfront costs it doesn't take hardly anything at all to make it makes sense it's a purely financial decision to make it upfront costs\nDivided by yearly savings equals years to recoup the cost and then years to start saving that's all you've got to look at\nVery you Robert warmer that brings us to the end of the show but there's more empowering information at the website I mentioned saving thousands dot com\nAnd you can always you're bull versions of this show is saving thousands radio show why assisting Robert to loosen nation mommy I heart radio out with all of this information working for you and all of us caring for you with all the ... Robert bomb\nIn\nThe proceeding program was paid for by our piece funding [noise]\nNews radio seventies got what your Web LA [noise] kind of do when you went to the two Clearwater\nWhat if something's already at a high price and it falls well shorting was short selling as a way for us to profit from that and I'm going to give it a real world example here\nAnd look at a stock ... clack gets K LA ten core ticker symbol K. L. A. C.\nAnd they've been around a long time in ... near and dear to the heart of our light treat academy used to be a stock that a lot of people each do learn on and trade back a few years ago but ... as early as September ... September or early September was right around a hundred and twenty dollars a share\nAll right so if you got to buy a hundred shares that will cost about twelve grand and so what's important to understand is that as the market started to fall and we started losing the technology sector because this stock sits in the technology sector there's been up to to make money when it fell\nAnd so shorting was short selling would've been a really good opportunity for if you understood what to do and so clack Kaylee sea in early September trading at a hundred and twenty bucks you know here's the thing that a lot of people get confused on\nHow can I make money selling something if I don't already own it in other words how can I sell ... if I don't if you buy at the store with well that's the beautiful thing about the financial markets that are broken will allow us to sell shares of their inventory into the market before price falls\nWith the goal of us than buying it back and giving it back to the broker at the price falls so let me give an example on ... let's just say in September eighth tenth or right around that time you decided to use the clock was going to fall in price and you went into the markets and you said I Want to sell a hundred she has a clock\nNow it's a hundred and twenty bucks or share so your broker would basically say okay we have inventory that you can sell and we'll let you utilize our fears of clock to sell into the market at a hundred and twenty bucks a share so what we're doing is we're going into it\nTrading platform we're executing a short sale and what that does that sells a hundred shares of ... into the market at a hundred and twenty bucks a share on our behalf\nNot understand we don't own the stock broker owns stock they're allowing us to utilize their shares to sell into the market at the market price which was a hundred and twenty so we do that now with considered short the stock now here's what happens\nWe believe prices gonna fall well here seven weeks later clocks at Ninety and it's it's actually happened so we're using a real world example it clock at Ninety you decided at night and you're going to buy it back so when you go into the market and buy it back because you Ninety bucks this year to buy it back when you sold that you took it a hundred and twenty\nWhen you bought it back because you're Ninety\nNow the moment you bought it back the sheer that came out of your brokers they'd been toy originally now when you buy back immediately go back in your brokers inventory in other words they're made whole with their shares of clock they got their stock back\nNow what did you do well you sold at a hundred and twenty and seven weeks later you bought it at Ninety think about that you bought low in Seoul high you just did it in reverse order that's the beautiful thing about the markets we can do that\nIt's a real strategy skull shorting short selling and that's why we're talking about we banned the drum every week you need to understand how to make money regardless of direction and because of that you just made thirty bucks a share on stock that fell that you've never owned think about that\nSo in a hundred years you made three grand on a thousand years you made thirty grand\nThink about that folks that opportunity is real and exist and it happens all the time in the market and we get movement

you how institutions approach the ... and more importantly how you can profit regardless of what's happening\nYou'll run out of ... years before you get your financial goals in other words you're a lot of time to grow your account because those big losses are draining your account and now you're trying to get back to break even do you realize that a lot of people took them almost eight nine years to get back to break even with the collapse of two thousand eight and here they are now break even or there were they were\nThe problem is or nine years older and here's the other problem\nThe markets geared up for classes again think about that is the definition of insanity that's the masses we need to learn the skills of capital preservation we need to understand the things we can do to keep ourselves safe no matter what the market does we can profit no matter what the direction but at least we have to protect because\nIf we wait to their house burned down\nBefore we ensure its\nIt's too late now the insurance is going to cost the replacement value of your house think about that\nSo we have to be proactive and have a plan in place where if the market collapse as we're not going to take the brunt of the loss and we could still take the upside of it goes in the direction we think\nThat's truly understanding market movement in price and the problem is with the masses Adam they're convinced that up is good and down to the bad and they don't want to touch their money because if they touch it they say I don't know what to do that there's a lot of simple things that you can learn process he's that can help to protect and preserve and most importantly\nKeep you on track for those financial goals long term well\nJim you said all the time it's it's it's a skill learning how to

know it's key when you're trading investing as managing your own money a lot of people out there the average guy who's working for corporate America or the lady who's you know\nWorking out by the corporate ladder you know they have four one K. is they have maybe some old four one K. they moved to ... raise the average person's not managing their own money and that's paramount when it comes to having long term success in the financial markets let's take a moment let's talk about what that means really the self directed self manage\nWell the problem is many people don't they they're sophisticated enough demand your own money 'cause Wall Street has I'm convinced of that maybe they think it's way too complicated and it's really not a hard process which you understand it\nThe key thing is is this if you don't learn how to control your own money then you're going to have money into management you gonna pay exorbitant fees it's amazing that\nAnd the average four one K. people will pay over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees over the course of a twenty five year four one K. think about that folks hundred and fifty grand goes to some Wall Street firms some entity\nGoldman Sachs citadel UPS CIA crafted their those trust you have your phone K they they wrote the charter they wrote the prospect is and you\nPay them and you pay them whether you make money or not the only guaranteed return on your phone case the fees that you pay here's the problem most you don't understand the fees 'cause you sign the paperwork with the lord you\nWith the match the company match so when you sign up for the four one K. they offered you the company match you went whoa that's free money chip it's not free money because now you're gonna have to basically put your money into a position where somebody's going to manage it you've got to pay a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more in fees over twenty five years and you can only make money in one direction\nThink about that you bought that you you you went all in and the reality is is is those fees are going to crush your ... your long term profitability they're going to hurt you badly overtime and what we see is that when people learn the skills of self right when you take that bucket of money yourself\nAnd there's not a complicated process to do this you can learn the skills of self directing and you can profit regardless of direction and you don't have to pay those fees which long term gives you a much better chance of hitting those financial goals\nWell and that's the key it's long term being able to set up a plan that's going to be able to work for you now be able to work for you later and ultimately get you to where you want to be chipped there's a lot of people out there if you ask them one day when do you want to retire and their answers now it's like well what are you doing now to get ready for retirement and the thing they're doing nothing there's this",
