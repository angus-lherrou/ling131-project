{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "The two greatest concerns that those between sixty and Seventy five that shared with me\nEspecially over the last nine months has been in the area of the concerns of the economy right the uncertainty of when this Bull Run is going to come to a screeching halt many people are predicting that loss worse than two thousand and eight\nThat's coming from people like Warren Buffett and some of the top economists in the country on top of that\nThe other big concern is unknowingly or unnecessarily giving up unnecessary taxes to the government\nNever see anybody that loves to pay taxes right in fact I share with people this is not about being unconstitutional this is not about being not being patriotic folks ... former judges have even said it's not our economic duty to pay more than our fair share of taxes in fact\nI I Want to share with you an actual quote\nA with that actually in mind which I thought was very interesting this comes\nAnd I talked about judge hand back in Nineteen thirty five and stayed at any one may arranged his affairs so that is taxes she'll be as low as possible\nBooks that's what we do a for a fact that's what we do that he is not bound to choose the pattern of which best pays the treasury folks that is what we see\nUnfortunately we see that every day\nThere's not even a patriotic duty to increase one's taxes over and over again the courts have said that there's nothing sinister and so arranging affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible that's what we teach people everyone does it rich and poor like an all do right for nobody knows any public duty to pay more\nAnd the law demands folks let me teach you something the law is going to demand view unnecessary tax I see it time and time again\nAnd the sad part is whether you call that tax a truce tax tax on your income tax on your growth tax on your Social Security tax on your Medicare tax on your kids the reality is taxes are everywhere\nAnd the good news is as predictable as those taxes are likely exposing you'd have to pay them there is ... ... unpaid by not having to go the direction of the government's perfect tax planning plant right don't become the perfect taxpayer [noise]\nAnd I teach people just because when you're able to show people the retirement road there on the truly exposure that if they continue on this course it's a crash course for a major market correction this going to set them back and maybe even force them back out of retirement\nOr it's going to force them to pay such a high tax than in some people's case they're going to have to work or take a part time job just to pay the tax to sustain or maintain the lifestyle income they're looking for and focus isn't fear mongering this is what almost a quarter century of having a front row seat with baby boomers\nI I've learned by having that front row seat of the very real challenges\nThe boomers have and will continue to have if they don't get a complete plan and part of that plant starts with what's predictable well it's predictable folks that if we're nine and a half years in to the longest Bull Run in history and no bull run has ever last uh ten years\nRight and you've got some of the biggest and brightest out there like a Warren Buffett saying the market will lose it will lose fifty percent plus and it will lose soon and you've got J. P. Morgan predicting when the financial crisis is going to hit\nAnd you've got the ... congressional budget office predicting how high federal tax rates are going to have to do which by the way is north of sixty three percent\nAnd we've got our own Social Security administration telling us that Social Security benefits are going to be cut by twenty twenty nine to the tune of about twenty nine percent\nAnd that's down from twenty thirty for folks and you've got Medicare saying that premiums are gonna have to continue to go up up up\nBut you've got a government that continues to spend spend spend right I Love the tax cuts the folks somebody's gonna have to pay for them and get to those of you that have saved money in tax deferred accounts you are the biggest tax target of the federal government\nAnd the reality is some people are the last to know it\nWill folks here's the opportunity\nThe we we helped Cindy and Jerry this week\nAnd you know they had a couple of objectives right one was to not outlived their money uh to was to learn the key tax savings strategies that saved them the most tax because they to understand it's not necessarily always about what you make it's what you keep and they didn't want to become a financial burden to their family because they each have taken\nA elderly parents one already through in one currently through\nAll farmers in dementia\nAnd folks if any of you listening I've ever had to do that it's a it's mentally exhausting and its financially devastating and the fact is our own health care is projected costs somewhere to the tune of about two hundred and eighty thousand or from age sixty five on many people are are woefully unprepared\nSo here's the good news by sitting in understanding exactly the retirement road Cindy and Jerry we're on\nWe're able to demonstrate for them what that road looked like if that played out as it were but we're also able to show them where the proper detours right or the bypasses\nThat could be implemented that avoided unnecessary tax avoided unnecessary market loss exposure risk avoided losing purchasing power to inflation I'll talk to you about a couple of those number one a city had a couple of different pensions that she could elect from her employer but that didn't neither of them had a cost of living adjustment\nWell for those of you listening if you've got to make a pension decision\nPlease make sure it's fully audited\nBecause in this particular case or not only was she able to get a better rate of return on her own\nBut also able to make sure that the income lasted for both her and her spouses' lives on top of that with the ability that the pension didn't die when the second spouse died it continued on to their two daughters\nAnd not to mention the fact that when you do take the pension into your own hands right you also have the ability to an tax it well\nThat was a huge hidden wealth transformation for this client because we were able to show them how not only that but how on tax all\nOf these to lump sum pensions to the tune of about four hundred thousand dollars\nThat not only will they not pay tax on their children and their children's children will not pay tax on that money\nAdd to the fact that had they continue down the retirement rather on their exposure was constantly having eighty five percent of their Social Security being taxed basically by where their assets were position so shifting and timing so by shifting assets in timing the shifting of those assets in particular with the timing of this\nTax reform bill that's going to expire this tax sales going to be over by the end of twenty twenty five\nIn teaching them one that they qualified for that's only good through twenty twenty two we're old actually untaxed them to the point to where they will not face a required minimum distribution when they turned Seventy half because we got the IRS out of their IRAs completely\nTherefore none of their Social Security will be tax which also they were setting themselves up to have a higher Medicare part B premium penalty\nAnd if you looked at what the tax was going to steal from them and what the Medicare stealth hidden tax of higher premium penalties what's going to cost them that was going to be about Nineteen thousand a year\nThat they were woefully unprepared uh realizing that they were going to have to pay and very grateful for realizing now that they will not have to pay it\nFolks here's the opportunity I'm going to be teaching one of several of our crediting or one of our a couple of strategies one I'm going to teach you how to have crediting of indexing where you get credit on your money's growth on the market's up never exposure when the market's down\nBut also to teach you how that's designed as the ultra

I got into it is one of the best parts of the week up I was having a good time but you know what one of the things that we need to talk about is there are individuals out there that are trying to figure out how to generate additional monthly income there are people out there that aren't financially where they want to be mean husbands wives all the time they're like man if I could just make another five hundred or a thousand bucks a month\nThings would be so much better for me let's take a moment let's talk about how someone can utilize the market really and talking about trading for income how someone can do them\nWell most people being seen ... academy traveled the world I've been all over the planet talking to people about trading and investing and what's universal is that people want to make income they want to generate additional income and the markets are a great way to do that and the problem is is that a lot of people when they hear the word trader\nThey check out they think Wolf of Wall Street the movie Wall Street greed is good some guy in suspenders sitting on Wall street overlook in Manhattan and that couldn't be further from the true some of the most successful traders that I Know people for income that generate an income in the markets on a daily weekly basis\nOr people just like us that you blue collar white collar stay at home moms I mean pizza delivery people barbers I mean scientists we have a lot of surgeons that have had success in the market so what's important is that it's a skill set that you learn over time but once you learn the skill set think of the benefits there's about forty million\nTrading accounts in the United states you know a trade Schwab GD marriage rates got trade\nAnd most of those traders based on our knowledge are not successful they love the sexiness of the opportunity of being able to sit at their home and speculate on price change in a marketplace they loved that but if they don't have a good system in place are good set of rules\nThey normally aren't successful and those are the stories you hear so people think the market's a casino and it's not if you understand\nHow to play the game it gives you a unique advantage and the problem is is that many people have this preconceived notion that the markets are nothing more than throwing your money and hoping it works\nAnd it couldn't be further from the truth is ways to generate high probability low risk decisions\nAnd if you do that consistently it could turn into a compounding growth curve I've seen it personally I've seen people that have come through the process and learn the skills and transform their life with trading and they had no knowledge coming in they didn't understand the first day and even notice the difference would a stock and bond\nAnd yet they learn the skill and what's great about that as it opens the door for people instead of having to get a second job punch a clock somewhere go wait on tables not that there's anything wrong with doing that I've done all of that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bulls & Bears Online Trading Academy", "city": "Tampa", "day": "07"}
