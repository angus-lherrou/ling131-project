malefactor jumped all over him hidden wealth radio [noise]\nHi this is just out of a weapon to hid wealth Radiohead if you're just joining us\nAll of our radio shows are are kind of hidden wealth radio dot com well we've been talking about the tax cut two point oh and we've been talking about the impact because the two point oh just passed the house this last week\nWhich I'm excited about making the tax cuts permanent now that's a that's a whole because they're still got some ways to go\nEspecially of Trump's impeached and this tax sale that I've been teaching people about has everything to do with what you shift in time so if you don't remember anything else I share with you remember the words shifting and timing as we like to say in our practice shift\nHappens but it happens with strategy\nWe've been talking about a Forbes article that talked about why we have this retirement crisis really comes down to the basics like when you think about football comes down to the basics of blocking and tackling well folks in in the world in the realm of retirement planning it comes down to number one Ford says having a plan\nAnd I've talked about a few clients that we've met with your friends and neighbors boomers typically between the ages of sixty and Seventy five those view predominately that have saved at least a quarter million or more towards retirement between husband and wife\nAnd likely it's in a tax deferred account now remember with all these tax cuts\nThere's going to have to be a payday of when somebody's gonna have to pay for these tax cuts and and the harsh reality is for everybody happy about the tax cuts are predominately the people that are making more income and have saved more\nAnd the reality is they're gonna end up getting stuck paying more if they don't shift in time while the tax sale is in place\nAnd Ford's goes on to say a having a plan we had a ... a couple of clients this week and said you know we really like about the hidden well solution is that you find strategies in solutions that other people miss or we've never heard of\nBut what Ford's goes on to say is not only having a plan but implementing a plan but also making sure it's a holistic plant in other words that plan is obviously a plan that encompasses all things financial taxes inflation market upside without market downside\nWe're seeing a lot of people fully exposed more than even realize they were exposed with a an assessment that shows them if the next oh wait hits\nOne client in particular we met with just this last week would lose forty six percent almost fifty cents of every dollar folks and that's assuming it's only as bad as elite some people are predicting the next crash will be worse than a weight\nNow that's not the fear martyr you but it's the wake you up because having a plan than implementing a plan taking a step further they said the key piece to that third step is then in proving aunt pond the original plan in other words finding ways to continue to optimize it so what I Want to encourage you to do\nIs the mindset of having the importance of the investigation\nInto retirement optimization in other words really having the understanding of how all the different puzzle pieces fit together and can synchronize those orchestrate those where you're paying to lease legal amount of tax\nYou're protecting the greatest amount of what's going to support your lifestyle income and we've been talking about the the the pyramid problem\nAnd I'll make the simple you know back in the day when many of us listening our parents or grandparents retired\nThink of the pyramid in sync at the bottom of the pyramid being so you understand think of that being your the pensions that our parents and grandparents received\nThat was kind of the basis or the foundation of supporting someone throughout their retirement years then there was Social Security and the consistency of that Social Security and then that little point at the top of the pyramid that was just the supplemental kinda portion of savings that the other two didn't make\nA U.S fully hole that we could count on because at that time banks actually paid interest in people didn't have to take unnecessary stock market risk\nWell now you take that pyramid and flip it upside down and that's where it is what I call them my books the yo yo plan your on your own right no more defined benefits pensions now defined contribution pensions\nRight so if the top where the pyramids no upside down right now we have the need of what we saved to produce the foundation to our retirement\nThen we've got a shrinking Social Security with lower cost of of living adjustments\nEighty five percent of our Social Security can be tax now and of course Social Security being bankrupt and having to make massive cuts here within the next foreseeable future years by around twenty twenty nine many people are predicting at least a Twenty one percent cut before even twenty thirty\nIn the very bottom right of that pyramid is unfortunately the few people that have the next little to nothing of pension like our parents and grandparents had and folks that's what's creating dilemma so by getting a complete plan a holistic planned a plan that incorporates all the different facets\nBy having a plant implementing a plan and then optimizing the plan on an ongoing basis is hidden wealth helping people discover and uncovered they're hidden wealth I'll give you a couple of examples\nSeat few very many clients are sharing the concerns like a shared last week to be two top boomer concerns so I'm Talking to those of you between the ages of sixty and Seventy five predominantly\nIn predominately those of you that have saved at least two hundred fifty thousand or more towards retirement folks there's never been a more important time especially being nine and a half years into this Bull Run and noble runs ever made it ten years folks\nAnd because of this first tax cut some of these articles are saying all that went into his first tax cuts were for corporations to turn around and the tax corporate tax havens turn around and buy their own stock back\nFolks companies have been doing more stock buybacks and individual individual investors now for three four five years that's what's artificially propped up this marketing folks this market that the party can't go on forever\nAnd eventually the party of tax cuts can't go on forever 'cause someone's gonna have to pay for the tax cuts and eventually companies aren't going to be be able to continue to buy back as much of their own stock to artificially propped up this market so the two biggest concerns is you can well imagine a very simple the uncertainty of the economy and when the Bull Run is going to stop and when people are facing\nYou know a downturn that they don't want any more of a downturn and they can stomach because they know they can't stomach one that's going to last them especially if you get those of you listening in your sixties\nAnd the the the known of what's predictable of higher taxes having to come to pay for all these tax cuts especially with two point oh tax cut just passing the house\nI'm a big believer in tax cuts unfortunately what the government's not telling you is where they're going to go collect the needed tax from from these tax cuts and it's very simple it's going to come from you in the form of your IRA distributions with a higher tax rate because it's going to push you into a higher tax rate\nEventually as they changed the tax rates if especially if they're not made permanent which I think's a long shot and taxing your Social Security taxing more of your Medicare part B Andy premiums called penalties\nAnd folks who doesn't have to

least I and I have hair [laughter] gee I've always having a good time here you know one of the key things to the financial markets is when someone's investing in when someone's trading they can do however they want there's people out there that a long term investors there's people out there that day traders and the reality of being in the financial market for anybody\nIs to make some money whether or not you need a daily basis or an annual basis you're trying to grow the account was take a moment let's talk about the guy out there or the lady out there be some of the best traders I Know are women let's talk about what is it looked like for someone to trade for income if they want this to be their income and quit their job what does it look\nLike well it's realistic if you go through a learning curve and obviously like any skill set what I Love about on like tree academy to sponsor bulls and bears is that they used to constantly speak of skill building\nIn other words if you want to get good at something you have to build a skill think about it I was a builder I mean I build homes I was a framer idle learned UBS frame that's the skill I had to learn this surges as doctors this pilots the secretaries this\nPizza delivery people you've got to learn the skill and through the process of learning the skill you get good at it and repetition serve you well it's the same thing in trading\nAnd so a lot of people when they hear the word trade or they think gambler\nHigh risk couldn't be further from the truth I Know people that trade in their spare time maybe an hour a day\nThat are moms there on the PTA there you know they they they they do use Cooper church and they trade during the day they treat with a good system and a good set of rules and it's safe and it's not ... it's not risky it's risk averse\nBut more importantly allows them to get consistency over time and it's a skill set that they built over a period of time we always talk about a three to nine months learning curve to get the skill of trading under your belt\nImagine if you commit thirty to sixty to Ninety Days to learn the skill of trading or even up to six months and then you could basically go into the markets on a daily basis it didn't matter how much money you had or a weekly basis and you can make a good decision\nIf the market fell you could profit the market up you could probably you'd have to leave your house that's the dream and for a lot of people it replaces the second income because they don't want to go punch a clock or leave the house they can do it from their home\nAnd it's amazing because when you start to realize that it's not the picture that Hollywood creates of what a traitor is that Gordon Gekko guy with suspenders\nOn Wall street somewhere in the big tower overlooking the city no it's just people like you and I that are looking to make a little extra money and with some of the products that are available in the markets it opens the door to everybody if they're willing to learn the skill and start the process of putting a system to gather\nAbsolutely and the key part is what you're saying champion learn the skill learn the skill learn the skill if you think about it no matter what your profession you hit this earlier\nEverybody has a skill set everybody understands what a checklist is a recipe is and trading investing if you think about high probability low risk you can figure this out it's like what you said three to nine months someone figures out a second stream income let the account get big enough to be your primary and get\nOne of
