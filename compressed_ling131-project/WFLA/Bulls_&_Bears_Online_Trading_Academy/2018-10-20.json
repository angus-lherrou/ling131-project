{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "I mean there are some sales manager jumped out of his window just hearing that say that right but yeah these types of things that that if businesses buy into then the other\nHow many million people that don't listen to me\nCan benefit as well and so you know real number seven is about spreading it's my way to spread this knowledge by encouraging business owners and business managers to run their business like I Do in a way to put consumers first in a way that reinforces the rules and the principles we teach here on the saving thousands radio network\nA real number nine is a practice what you learn and always learn more\nSo this is this is one of yours Rob Rob Newton contributed this one\nOr if you don't practice it what's the point I mean if you're not going to do this stuff if you're not going to shop around if you're not going to do your numbers if you're not going to wait three days if you're not going to\nYou know refuse to abuse credit and if you're going to fear credit and if you don't want to know their tricks and if you do know you're still gonna let them pull them on you then why do you do flip over to classic rock or a pop music or something I mean what why waste your time listening to me if you're not going to put this stuff into practice\nSo real number eight is practice what you learn that you've always got to learn more I Am a I'm a constant student I can still learn you know and I think no matter how big my company is no matter how much I\nDo and how much I Know I can always learn more and there's always someone I can learn from and I'm always reading books and I'm always listening to other shows and I'm I'm\nAlways trying to educate myself and and I think that's important rule so that's number eight practice what you learn and always learn more and then rule number nine to share your successes I said this is different so sharing the knowledge ripe sharing the knowledge about telling other people\nWhat what's going on and and and sharing the the resources in a way to learn sharing your successes is when you didn't go back and say hey you know what I did some of this stuff and actually save some money this is what sharing your successes rule number nine is all about because when your friends and family other listeners here that this stuff does work and\nThat you did try and if you don't have to be a financial guru you don't have to be the owner of a big company wants to be a mortgage guide to be a financial but I'd have to be a talk show host on the radio it to do these things anybody can do um\nAnd so you've got to share your successes because that was going to help us spread this culture to other people because it really makes the whole saving thousands charter powerful is when enough consumers are following it that businesses have to\nChange and businesses have to react and businesses have to stop the abusive practices that they've gotten so good at\nRight because we're done as consumers we're not going to do it anymore we're not going to put up with it we're going to follow the rules and we're going to only want to work with businesses who encourage people to follow the rules and it's gonna be a total revolution\nAnd so you've got to share your success with other people have to be aware and have to know that this is working for you because that's going to be their motivation to do better and to be smarter and to stop being a financial zombie and the stop me and you're out there floating in a raft with no anger and and becoming a financial ninja and making the decisions\nYou know I've known people whose lives were wrecked the cause of overspending and missing payments they really had no hope and and they just went from paycheck to paycheck I mean we're constantly behind\nThen they finally copied those Fifteen saving thousands rules the success and began to put the rules and the motion now before long things begin to clear up and they actually took charge of their money\nShe these guidelines aren't theory they're Proven Ways to find me become empowered and it can happen with you follow the saving thousands rules\nListener Beth writes in I'm listening to the show every week they're not sure what I've learned with my friends and family can you tell me what is escrow\nThat's a that's a good question you know the little things that ... that I forget about you know you but you do it for so long you forget what some of the the thing is it that you know that the normal average person does not know yeah\nSo the whole idea behind escrow is that we're going to pay the taxes and insurance for you out of the mortgage payment and so what happens is Rob obviously you make your mortgage payment monthly mhm right but taxes property taxes here in Florida are only do once a year and that's a November\nAnd then uh insurance is do usually once a year and it's on the anniversary of when you got your policy right so we bought your home in March then you're you're ah insurance is do every year in March\nAnd so a lot of people all of a sudden get hit with this bill and it's like all of a sudden they owe six thousand dollars in taxes or two thousand dollars in insurance and uh not everyone has budgeted a recording Leon and kept up\nAnd the up and so we decided in the mortgage industry it would be helpful if we collected one twelve of the taxes every month and one twelve of the insurance every month so that when the bill comes we pay it and say like the the homeowner now some people don't like that right\nSome people want to wave escrow they want to handle the account themselves they want to you know tried to collect interest on it and then pay it themselves and\nAnd that's fine and the problem is we charge you a\nWe charge you a little bit higher rate for that because it increases the risk because the chance of someone defaulting and then also we as a lender don't get to make the interest on that money you know we we have millions and millions of dollars of people just grow money sitting in an account and so there's a will become an escrow waiver cost right and so it increases the cost of your loan\nI usually about an eighth the interest rate is not a huge consideration in some cases\nUh you know you can buy it out with a small like a quarter or half point of discount or to get rid of that as a waiver cost but most people take the escrow account you know it's one of those things are it's convenient we take care of it for you we pay it and then if you are putting less than twenty percent down\nOn those loan programs you have to have an escrow account because the idea is if you're putting limited money down you don't have enough liquid cash laying around that you can handle the big hit for the escrow account everybody asked grows once a year to pay your own tax payer and insurance so\nI obviously I recommend people just let us hand live for them it's it's cleaner it's easier you can budget monthly instead of worrying about once a year\nOr a good a very good okay now that we know that now sometimes and calculating when you're going to get your home loan you might have to put some money up front right because they're very very seldom are you going to buy your own exactly on the anniversary of either the ah the property taxes or the insurance\nAfter the insurance what happens when you're buying a new home uh the insurance you're going to pay for one year at closing\nAnd then we're going to collect a two month cushion to put into your escrow account and that cushion is there because taxes and insurance will change a little bit things happened things go wrong\nNow with the taxes you're absolutely right very rarely are you buying a home exactly in November to where we can collect right on its access to what happens is that we have to figure out how many months of taxes were going to need so let's say you buy your home or in in August right\nAnd so if you if you close in August your first payment is not do you skip September right because you pay interest in her ears so when you close in August ... and then interest will accrue the entire month of September and then you make your first mortgage payment to us on October first\nRight so we'll we'll gotten one month from you and then in November we have to pay the taxes although we're going to be eleven months short so the idea is we have to collect all eleven months at the closing mhm and then you'll receive a tax preparation credit back from the seller\nOr so the title company will figure out and say okay well the seller lived in the house through August so they do this many days worth of taxes and they give you a credit back for that and then we put eleven months worth of taxes into your escrow account and so again when it ends up being is about three months worth of\nYou have to put about three months in because the sellers putting the rest in you're going to put about three months and then there were in a collective ... they'll collect arrest as we go\nSo they wouldn't November rolls around we have enough money to pay your taxes which is really what what this is all about making sure that your taxes get paid on time and that your insurance gets paid on time because we don't want anyone to have a home and no insurance on it and us having a forced placed insurance so if you do not as and grow and you do not pay your insurance and your insurance gets canceled\nBut what if something's already at a high price and it falls well shorting was short selling as a way for us to profit from that and I'm going to give it a real world example you\nLook at a stock ... clack gets Kaylee ten core ticker symbol K. L. A. C.\nAnd they've been around a long time in ... near and dear to the heart of our light treat academy used to be a stock that a lot of people used to learn on and trade back a few years ago but ... as early as September ... September or early September it was right around a hundred and twenty dollars a share\nAll right so if you got to buy a hundred shares that will cost about twelve grand and so what's important to understand is that as the market started to fall and we started losing the technology sector because this stock sits in the technology sector there's been up to to make money when it fell\nAnd so shorting was short selling would have been a really good opportunity for if you understood what to do and so clack Kaylee sea in early September trading at a hundred and twenty bucks this year and now here's the thing that a lot of people get confused on\nHow can I make money selling something if I don't already own it in other words how can I sell ... if I don't if you buy at the store with well that's the beautiful thing about the financial markets that are broken will allow us to sell shares of their inventory into the market\nBefore price falls with the goal of us than buying it back and giving it back to the broker after price fall so let me give an example on ...\nLet's just say um September eighth of tens of right around that time you decided to use the clock was going to fall in price and you went to the markets and you said I Want to sell a hundred she has a clock\nNow it's a hundred and twenty bucks just share so your broker would basically say okay we have inventory that you can sell and we'll let you utilize our shares of clock to sell into the market at a hundred and twenty bucks a share so what we're doing is we're going into our training platform\nOr executing a short sale and what that does that sells a hundred shares of crack into the market at a hundred and twenty bucks a share on our behalf\nNot understand we don't own the stock broker owns stock they're allowing us to utilize their shares to sell into the market at the market price which was a hundred and twenty so we do that now with considered short the stock now here's what happens\nWe believe prices gonna fall well here seven weeks later clocks at Ninety and it's it's actually happened so we're using a real world example it clock at Ninety you decided at night and you're going to bite back so when you go into the market and buy it back because you Ninety bucks this year to buy it back when you sold that you took it a hundred and twenty\nWhen you bought it back it cost you a Ninety\nNow the moment you bought it back the shares that came out he broke his image or a originally now when you buy back immediately go back and you broke his inventory in other words they're made whole with their shares of clock they got their stock back\nNow what did you do well you sold at a hundred and twenty and seven weeks later you bought it at Ninety think about that you bought low in Seoul high you just did it in reverse order that's the beautiful thing about the markets we can do that\nIt's a real strategy it's called shorting short selling and that's why we're talking about we bend the drum every week you need to understand how to make money regardless of direction and because of that you just made thirty bucks a share on the stock that fell that you've never own think about that\nSo in a hundred shares you made three grand on a thousand years you made thirty grand\nThink about that folks that opportunity is real and exist and it happens all the time and the market and when we get movement down like we're seeing a lot of lately there's tremendous opportunity in the market now imagine if that Ehsan ... forty to fifty percent like a lot of people are calling for magic view is short that position what could that turned into your financial life seat the beautiful thing about the markets is\nUp is good and down is good once you realize that it's a game changer well exactly and that's why online trading and kept me the sponsor bulls and bears they teach people how to short so they teach people how to capitalize on a downward movie the market the average person knows it can happen they don't know how to do it and that's why they teach the class\nAnd the five hundred dollar class that they teach at the campus and we actually have a few seats for this class to give away the losers right now now if you have money out there in the market and the ... and the IRAs if you're concerned about a correction you want to capitalize on that correction this is the

places and then we'd ... races letting them get but you'll see the real reality when you go to the faces exactly\nDon't forget to check that out she has one of the things that you know it's key when you're trading investing as managing your own money a lot of people out there the average guy who's working for corporate America or the lady who's you know\nWorking out by the corporate ladder you know they have four one K. is they have maybe some old four one K. they moved to ... raise the average person's not managing their own money and that's paramount when it comes to having long term success in the financial markets let's take a moment let's talk about what that means really to self directed self manage\nWell the problem is many people don't think they're sophisticated enough demand your own money 'cause Wall Street has I'm convinced of that and they they think it's way too complicated and it's really not a hard process which you understand it\nThe key thing is is is if you don't learn how to control your own money then you're going to have money into management you going to pay exorbitant fees it's amazing that\nAnd the average four one K. people pay over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees over the course of a twenty five year four one K. think about that folks hundred and fifty grand goes to some Wall Street firms some entity\nGoldman Sachs citadel UPS CIA crafted their those trust you have your phone K they they wrote the charter they wrote the prospect is\nAnd you pay them and you pay them whether you make money or not\nThe only guaranteed return your phone case the fees that you pay here's the problem most you don't understand the fees 'cause you sign the paperwork with the lord you\nWith the match the company match so when you sign up for the four one K. they offered you the company match you went whoa that's free money chip it's not free money because now you're gonna have to basically put your money into a position where somebody's gonna manage it you're gonna pay a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more in fees over twenty five years and you can only make money in one direction\nThink about that you bought that you ... you were all in and the reality is is is those fees are going to crush your ... your long term profitability they're going to hurt you badly overtime and what we see is that when people learn the skills of self directly you take that bucket of money yourself\nAnd there's not a complicated process to do this you can learn the skills of self directing and you can profit regardless of direction and you don't have to pay those fees which long term gives you a much better chance of hitting those financial goals\nWell and that's the key is long term being able to set up a plan that's going to be able to work for you now be able to work for you later and ultimately get you to where you want to be chipped there's a lot of people out there if you ask them one day when do you want to retire and their answers now so well what are you doing now to get ready for retirement and the thing they're doing nothing there's just there's working well the average American is way\nShort financially of ever been able to retire at their current standard of living see that's the real issue\nAnybody can retire but can you retire at the lifestyle that you currently live the lifestyle you want to live\nAnd the real problem is and the biggest issue with the baby boomer generation is that they're worried about run out of money before they die so the system that you're in for one k.'s managed diaries has you worried about run out of money before you die now I have students at all like you to get him that's been six to ten hours a month managing their own nest egg they manage their own IRA\nAnd they make decisions in that and those decisions are built around trying to make one percent a month thinking about that\nIf you can make one percent a month with Amal goes up down her side we can do that consistently over time you put that compound and calculator it gets powerful\nAnd the problem is is that many people can't make one percent a month because the market goes down they don't profit they lose they needed to go up for them to profit and ultimately because of all of this turns in price of the market and these fees they never hit the goals\nSelf directing learning the skills to take control that bucket is essential to long term success and more and more people we're seeing this Adam are coming out of the woodwork saying I Need to learn how to control my own money because the mass of my account says I'm going to run out of money before I die in the ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bulls & Bears Online Trading Academy", "city": "Tampa", "day": "20"}
