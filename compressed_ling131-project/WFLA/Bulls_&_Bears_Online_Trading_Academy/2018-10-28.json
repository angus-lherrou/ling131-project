{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "Even right against the backdrop of a booming economy now think about this before the federal the congressional budget office pass the tax cuts a few months before it passed they predicted the government would take in three point five three trillion in revenue\nThis past Monday the treasury reported that the revenue was actually only three point three three trillion a two hundred billion dollar shortage folks guess where they're going to get the shortage from\nI think you're probably guessing yourselves and if you're guessing yourself you'd be right especially those of you listening that have worked hard and save hard in tax deferred accounts like four one K. is IRAs for three days et cetera folks that doesn't need to be that way and the question becomes what have you done\nTo have a tax savings solution plant right not everyone can say they have an accounting right serve you share with me while I had no idea about the civil attack saving solutions you guys are taxed planners\nNot tax accountant in such as a big difference between people that know what boxes to check in what dates that that there needs to be meeting deadlines\nOr you can do that on line folks\nAh but there's a difference of getting strategy especially like we do with our clients and have for years before in that fourth quarter\nIt is vital to have reviews to know exactly what steps can be taken to strategize to legally reduce morally and ethically I just legally reduce your taxes for that actual tax year\nAnd folks the windows closed and very very quickly but the opportunities still there and I'll tell you where it becomes so important you know ten thousand people retiring a day and is this article goes on to say\nI think is rather alarming says why retirees tax rates may be higher than they expect\nRight as this high in higher income retirees and they see their tax brackets fall\nBut still face higher levies of taxing the form of taxes on Social Security benefits and higher premiums for Medicare part B in the in fact it said considering those additional taxes right there marginal tax rates could jump to be as high as forty percent or more\nNow think about that in in a year that we ... the first year implemented of the greatest tax cut in our country's history\nMany retirees taxes are actually going up and folks I see it first hand I've witnessed it I can talk to you about a few clients that that hit home that we just met with this past week right so for example\n[noise] ah I think of Marty and daddy okay\nAnd Marie and daddy had no idea about having up to eighty five percent of their Social Security being taxed right but they also didn't realize that they could actually zero out their entire taxable income for two thousand and eight team which is one of our kid well tax saving solution strategies\nAnd they were able to do that\nI think Don and ... um they had some highly appreciated assets that they sold this year and as a result of that was exposing them to a massive capital gain and some of you may be the same we rented a lot of clients have sold now the real estate's come back they sold off\nOf the you know fully appreciate it out rental property or commercial building a or a business and the capital gain is pretty sizable\nAnd unfortunately that game then gets transferred onto their ten forty and then it's looked upon to determine then how much of that as as a taxable income is then going to subject taxing their Social Security\nHow much of the as an example of they're required minimum distribution\nThat for those of you listening that's when you hit Seventy and a half some of you that er Seventy half know exactly what I'm saying that the government then forces you to take a certain percentage of the universal percentage formula out of all the totaling of your IRAs that you have one or more however many you have they are going to take the total\nAnd then force you to take out a distribution if you don't take it it's a fifty percent penalty of what the distribution should've been\nAnd folks I just met with a client this last week whose requirement of distribution was almost Ninety thousand dollars\nBecause he waited and waited and waited he deferred deferred deferred and now the day of tax reckoning his hit him and as a result now in it he at AT and his wife at eighty eight they're paying more taxes in retirement\nThan the amount of taxes that they pay to their highest wage earning years books we see this time and time again but the goodness as it doesn't have to be that way also think of mark and Donna\nWho legally untaxed their IRAs right so they they took money out of virus but they they that's a district distribution of of of tax exposure but they used another section of the code with the hidden well tax savings solution to them directly offset that tax with a tax deduction\nIn essence zeroing out the tax liability on their IRAs which means they will have those pesky required minimum distributions because there before the age of seven and a half which is the ultimate goal is not to have requirement distributions for those of you listening to have requirement of distributions let me talk to you about Mick\nMix somebody that had requirement of distributions and we actually eliminated\nHim ever having another required distribution by using a proven tax savings solution this year in twenty team folks are you ready\nFor the taxes are going to pay in twenty four twenty team\nOr are you ready to see how much unnecessary tax you can avoid for twenty team right one of the most important steps that people can take is getting inform dry\nTaxes are on sale folks but they're not going to be on sale for long back Andrew shelling said don't wait to get ready for the twenty Nineteen tax season right avoid making huge tax mistakes ahead\nOf the next year right were ahead of retirement even goes on to say to validate seniors are likely to pay unnecessary taxes and retirement if they fail to avoid making financial mistakes before they retire\nAccording to marketwatch to improve their future right client should not assume that they're going to move into a lower tax bracket and they should avoid ending up being forced to have a high or large required distribution because that sets off a triggering of other forms of taxation right\nAnd when you have more money in your pocket and let's go into the government folks that's money for you to use for your grandchildren for your travels to visit and do the things you can do while you're still allows you to do them\nAnd don't forget what judge hands said right because it's true and I've seen it I I'm somebody that you're listening to that for years overpaid unnecessary taxes and then got super serious\nAbout learning what the ultra wealthy do and what the tax savvy due to pay my legal least required amount share and unpatriotic folks I have no problem paying tax I just have a problem paying tax on not required to pay and he said it best you said you know in America there to tax systems one for the informed one for the uninformed but both are legal\nFolks get informed here's the opportunity [noise]\nI'm going to give those of you that are very curious to say how much tax in my overpaying or how much unnecessary tax can I be avoiding and especially for those of you that are likely predicting your taxes are going to be higher\nIn twenty maybe you sold highly appreciated asset\nOr maybe you you this was the first year you had your required minimum distribution maybe some of you this is the first year you elected your Social Security maybe that's some of you ... have not requested or locked in your\nApplication or choice excuse me of election of Social Security because you may find that you can prevent that Social Security from being taxed like one of our clients we were able to show them how to avoid having up to eighty five percent of their Social Security tax and you know what it had everything to do\nWith whether he they were going to elect the lump sum pension option from the employer\nOr the pay out of the monthly payment from the employer you see if he elected the payout from the employer for the rest of his wife and his wife's Social Security eighty five percent of it would have been tax which would have given up anywhere from six to ten thousand a year of unnecessary taxes as the Social Security benefit continued to draw higher\nFolks simply email here's what we're doing um we're we're there's

it's key when you're trading investing as managing your own money a lot of people out there the average guy who's working for corporate America or the lady who's you know\nWorking out by the corporate ladder you know they have four one K. is they have maybe some old four one K. they moved to ... raise the average person's not managing their own money and that's paramount when it comes to having long term success in the financial markets let's take a moment let's talk about what that means really to self direct to self manage\nWell the problem is many people don't they they're sophisticated enough to manage your own money 'cause Wall Street has I'm convinced of that maybe they think it's way too complicated and it's really not a hard process which you understand it\nThe key thing is is is if you don't learn how to control your own money then you're going to have money into management you gonna pay exorbitant fees it's amazing that\nIn the average four one K. people will pay over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees over the course of a twenty five year four one K. think about that folks hundred and fifty grand goes to some Wall Street firms some entity\nGoldman Sachs citadel UPS CIA craft there those trust you have your phone K they they wrote that shorter they wrote the prospect is\nYou pay them and you pay them whether you make money or not the only guaranteed return your phone one case the fees that you pay here's the problem most you don't understand the fees cause you sign the paperwork with the lord you\nWith the match the company match so when you sign up for the four one K. they offered you the company match you went whoa that's free money chip it's not free money because now you're gonna have to basically put your money into a position where somebody's going to manage it you're going to pay a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more in fees over twenty five years and you can only make money in one direction\nThink about that you bought that you you you went all in and the reality is is is those fees are going to crush your ... your long term profitability they're gonna hurt you badly overtime and what we see is that when people learn the skills of self directly you take that bucket of money yourself\nAnd there's not a complicated process to do this you can learn the skills of self directing and you can profit regardless of direction and you don't have to pay those fees which long term gives you a much better chance of hitting those financial goals\nWell and that's the key it's long term being able to set up a plan that's going to be able to work for you now be able to work for you later and ultimately get you to where you want to be chipped there's a lot of people out there if you ask them one day when you want to retire and their answers now that well what are you doing now to get ready for retirement and the thing they're doing nothing there's this\nThere's working well the average American is way short financially I've ever been able to retire at their current standard of living see that's the real issue\nAnybody can retire but can you retire at the lifestyle that you currently live the lifestyle you want to live\nAnd the real problem is the biggest issue with the baby boomer generation is that they're worried about run out of money before they die so the system that you're in for one k.'s
