I then when we use the term second home in the industry\nUh we're talking vacation home right so this is a home that you're going to spend time and you are not going to rent it out this is your second home this is your vacation home\nI and what we find is there is a lower risk to us as a lender for someone who is buying a vacation home that they're going to ... to use personally or the rest of the home they're planning on renting out and the reason is if you're buying a vacation home for your own personal use\nYou are planning on making the payment out of your personal funds for the entire year mhm if you are buying and investment property that means you are planning on hopefully having a tenant's re rent or who makes the payment for you\nSo what happens if said tenant or said rent or does not make the payment for you what happens if they lose their job\nWhat happens if if a flake out what happens if they pack of ... and disappear now you don't have the money coming in today that payment and you are never planning on paying the payments out of your own money the way you were if you were buying a vacation home that you are just going to have and you're like hey you know how many were doing well this year\nWe love to go down to new Smyrna beach let's buy a little condo on the ocean over there and we're not going to rent it out we're just going to use it for personal use\nWe can afford the thousand dollars a month in our budget let's do it lets her award ourselves that's different than saying I'm going to buy a condo and I'm going to rent it out I'm going to make money off of it and all of a sudden if I ever had to pay that thousand a month out of my own pocket I Would be in trouble and so again Rob this again gets into risk\nSo if you can afford the rental property without its tenants\nThan if things ever go wrong\nYou will ... you'll be okay you can order the payment if the only way you can afford that rental property is by having a tenant in there and by utilizing their rent to offset the payment what happens when\nMoved out what happens when the tenant filed bankruptcy what happens when the tenant can't make a payment you now cannot afford to make the payment so while there are some loan programs that will allow us to consider the potential rental income of an of an investment property\nThey have a lot of other gadgets we want to see a lot of months the reserves and we want to see a lot of history maintaining rental properties it's not just an easy yes and my personal advice is\nIf you cannot afford the rental property\nWithout being vacant if you can't afford to go twelve I Want you to sit there right now and say if I had to go twelve months old without a tenant\nWould it destroyed my life financially\nAnd if the answer is yes then don't buy their own property because you never know ... and the last thing you want to do\nAnd I understand why people by rental properties mean they're they're trying to better themselves they're trying to build for well they're trying to expand their financial situation but if you are not in a financial situation where you can afford to go twelve months and will you ever after your twelve months probably not but who knows\nI mean who would ever thought home prices could drop the way they drop off in an eight nine ... rock so if you can't afford to go twelve months without getting a dime of rent my advice to you\nIs do not buy that rental property do not take the risk do not put your finances in jeopardy by taking on something you can't handle by a smaller rental property right maybe you've got maybe you've got twenty or thirty thousand dollars the down payment you thinking you're going to buy a nice little hundred thousand dollar investment property\nGo buy a thirty thousand dollar investment property cash or by sixty thousand our investment property and have the mortgage be low enough that you could afford to pay it the other thing I Will tell you to be cautious of the same conversations we just had\nIf sixty thousand dollar home a is a condo\nAnd monthly dues or a thousand dollars a month or yeah that will be more than your mortgage payment this is a problem uh so keep all that in mind you've got to look at the homeowner's association or condo do's the property taxes and here's the other guy with an investment property you don't get to file homestead exemption\nSo if you're buying a house right so if I'm buying robs house Rob lived in the house Rob had homestead exemption and now he's selling it to me and it's going to be my rental property the county will find out that there is no longer an owner occupant there they will revoke the homestead exemption and the taxes will go up\nBy seven eight nine hundred dollars a year I'd\nSay instantly so don't be fooled is you're looking at us and saying well these property taxes are only a thousand dollars a year\nOr if the person you're buying it from has long said exist in ... county\nAnd find out what the property tax Bill Cosby went into an investment property\nAnd there is no longer homes that exemption leg robberies and brings us giving into show but there's more empowering information is the website I mention savings out you know and you can always hear boom versions of saving thousands\nRadio show by accessing Robert\n... station on the eye heart radio when

and that's the problem that a lot of people are facing well\nDo you have you know a lot of individuals they think they don't have enough time they don't think they're smart enough they think you know they don't have enough money that it's you know they should be focusing on it and people make reasons and they make excuses all the time either don't miserable money and realistically you know how much time as they can take somebody six to ten hours a month I have students that I might try to get him but I personally coach to manage their wealth in six to ten hours a month\nThey don't have to

those money managers that they put you in some sort of a position where if the market was up to make money to mark goes down you give it back\nAnd if it doesn't go up dramatically enough the fees that they're charging you take up the profitability that you do get so we've got a plan in place where you can make money regardless of direction more importantly\nYou'd have to pay all those fees and

to Facebook Like us that bulls and bears radio\nSee some of the behind the scenes content some of the stuff that doesn't always make the show well and we have a video camera reading whenever we do the show so there's a lot of great counted that comes through that which really is stuff that just is hysterical I mean we've just one of the fun of\nThe hours and hours that I Am every lack the idea is just sitting here I got into it is one of the best parts of the week up I was having a good time but you know what one of the things that we need to talk about is there are individuals out there that are trying to figure out how to generate additional monthly income there are people out there that aren't financially where they want to be mean husbands wives all the time they're like man if I could just make another five hundred or a thousand bucks a month\nThings would be so much better for me let's take a moment let's talk about how someone can utilize the market really and talking about trading for income how someone can do them\nWell most people being seen ... academy traveled the world I've been all over the planet\nTalking to people about trading and investing and what's universal is that people want to make income they want to generate additional income and the markets are a great way to do that and the problem is is that a lot of people when they hear the word trader\nThey check out they think Wolf of Wall Street the movie Wall Street greed is good some guy in suspenders sitting on Wall street overlook in Manhattan and that couldn't be further from the true some of the most successful traders that I Know people for income that generate an income in the markets on a daily weekly basis\nOr people just like us that you blue collar white collar stay at home moms I mean pizza delivery people barbers I mean scientists we have a lot of surgeons that have had success in the market so what's important is that it's a skill set that you learn over time but once you learn the skill set think of the benefits there's about forty million\nTrading accounts in the United states you know a trade Schwab GD marriage rates got trade and most of those traders based on our knowledge are not successful they love the sexiness of the opportunity of being able to sit at their home and speculate on price change in a marketplace they loved that but if they don't have a good system in place are good set of rules\nThey normally aren't successful and those are the stories you hear so people think the market's a casino and it's not if you understand\nHow to play the game it gives you a unique advantage and the problem is is that many people have this preconceived notion that the markets are nothing more than throwing your money and hoping at work\nAnd it couldn't be further from the truth is ways to generate high probability low risk decisions\nAnd if you do that consistently it could turn into a compounding growth curve I seen it personally I've seen people that have come through the process and learn the skills and transform their life with trading and they had no knowledge coming in they didn't understand the first day and even notice the difference would a stock and bond\nAnd yet they learn the skill and what's great about that as it opens the door for people that are having to get a second job punch a clock somewhere go wait on tables not that there's anything wrong with doing that I've done all of that\nBut what's important is if you could generate that income from your home\nYou know in in your spare time that's the opportunity and many people don't get it because they have this preconceived idea what a treat or is it couldn't be further from the truth\nOne you know what a lot of people think that it requires a lot of time they think it requires a high IQ and it's just a skill it's like any skill you said all the time you used to be a framer champ no understanding how to use the proper tools are professional grade broker dealer understand how to actually minimize risk increase probability\nJust a checklist of things that keep you safe and the market and a lot of people think it's just so out of reach that they can't do it and it's not I mean I tell people if you can drive a stick shift you can learn to be a successful trader because it's nothing more than learning the skill and repeating it over and over and over again one of the most important things I tell people is\nTreating and investing shouldn't be exciting if it's exciting you're doing it wrong it's just a decision\nAnd when you have the ability to make that decision what's great about that is the doors open anybody I mean I mean people that literally have very low capital I mean they might have a few hundred bucks to work with\nAnd they're able to go
