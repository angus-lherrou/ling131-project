{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "Are you the judge has vacated the foreclosure and the person thought they were getting their house for free and then the bank goes back and falls for emotion and gets it reversed mhm and almost every time that there have been there have been very few cases where it has stuck\nAnd so people like oh one and then two months later they know you didn't win ... thing is even if even if they're able to remove the lean from the house you still have the money is still on your credit\nRight you know like that doesn't go away so that this loophole may have worked for a couple people got the leaner moved from their house because the banks fail to to show up and do what they're supposed to do but they can still sue you they can still sell the the note to a collection agency and come after you for that efficiency balance just because they can't take your house the way to meet you don't know the money\nAnd again these are very rare cases usually there's some other something else happened and they're not giving you all the facts like the the the people who have gotten a house for free or sometimes it was a house that wasn't really worth what it you know the house was in such disrepair the bank didn't want to deal with it\nOr there's usually something else going on if you're living in a brand new beautiful home is worth more than you owe on at the bank is not going to just walk away and lay down right\nThere are some scammers out there who may trying to convince you to pay them a few thousand dollars and they don't get to your house for free\nBut you know what in the end you're more likely to be out that money you could be homeless earlier in the show we talked about the importance of managing credit\nAnd the fight go was the most important source when it comes to what credit information is being used so Robert you're a student of mine is kind of walk us through how you research and then analyze your own grid\nSo when I when I Do a three I Do a three school report at FICA my psycho dot com and it costs sixty bucks so it's not cheap you know now now there are some ways you can get your credit report for free X number of times a year if you've been turned down for credit or their credit monitoring you can do where you can monitor one\nUh you know one bureau for cheaper but to really get the truth ... score on all three bureaus is sixty dollars guy\nAnd and so I just logged into my psycho dashboard and uh so there there's these different versions of the psycho score\nAnd so you come in here is going to you're going to sign up and if they don't want your money and whether you just do one euro which is like twenty bucks or you do all three beers which is sixty dollars are really depends on your personal budget and how interested you are in this ... I Would say if you've never pulled your score it all uh I Would start with one\nEye and the one that has used the most around in this area of Equifax okay so each of the bureau's kind of used to a different part of the country\nAnd so Equifax is the the kind of preferred or for the southeast is the preferred bureau now lenders pull all three\nUh I Know that uh like when I when I bought my wife said engagement ring they only pulled Equifax is that right I can see that because I can see on my report in my psycho dot com who lost all of my credit\nAnd and so in here you know I log in\nAnd it shows me my three scores are and then it it gives you the psycho score versions which is pretty cool and you get the credit at a glance you know some I credit history is Fifteen Years I have thirty five total accounts I have zero past due accounts twelve revolving accounts eleven installment accounts twelve mortgage accounts\nOr and then it has like the online disputes you go in their personal information which show all the addresses\nThat I've ever had my credit pulled under\nYou know ever Mm ah across here today I can see the addresses of where I Believe that I go to my revolving accountancy each of my credit cards and so what what they keep on you in the credit file is that the name of the the the creditor\nUh the loan type is it a credit card installments as an individual or is it with someone else the dates you opened it and then they keep a payment history\nAnd so they show this usually using a\nOnes are ... is a ... on this case it's just like a a green bar that shows all the payments were made on time ... and so you know looking at his car's a number of times thirty days late zero number of times sixty days late zero number times nineties late zero worst delinquency nine\nHigh balance ever scheduled payment credit limit remarks contact so they send all this information how many times you've been late when you relate and now the key is a late is only late\nIf it's thirty days late right so there's all there's no\nAxon here for Fifteen days late there is no bottom line here for twenty days late there's no box on here for one day late so even though the credit card company will charge you a late fee\nAfter after just Fifteen days\nOr they don't charge or in some cases I guess one day depending on like a mortgage is Fifteen days credit card usually hit you immediately after you missed a payment date\nBut again that's not when it's late to the credit bureaus is not late the credit bureaus until you go a full thirty days late right so uh you go through here so they they they take all this data may take the list of every creditor you have and the date you opened the account and a payment history how many thirty six to nine days later you have\nHow many payments you've made on time and they bounce all that information over to bear Isaac psycho and then psycho gives them back\nOr the credit score and that's that's how they get calculated and sort of one according to what you can see the inquiries right so like looking at at some of the last credit I've applied for a the the engagement ring only check Equifax\nUm I I did a a I got a credit card to chase and they checked Equifax Experian\nOr at least a a ... this is a while ago but I at least a copy machine\nAnd for our pie funding and they only check Experian\nWill be kinda weird and then also our furniture release when we moved into a building I at least all the furniture they only checked experience so it seems like for business stuff maybe a ... more people are checking Experian ... for personal credit more people are checking Equifax\nBut you can see that so when you can see and hear on your increase who's pulled your credit when they pulled your credit is a great way to avoid fraud I was going to say your identity theft yeah there were no when people pull your credit and the next section as collections which I have nine the next section is public records which would be like bankruptcies foreclosures which I have nine\nAnd then every one of these are the very bottom has at a dispute dispute errors\nAnd you click on line this year you can call the phone number ... union to dispute any inaccurate information that you see on your credit\nAnd so that you know some of the key there at the age of your credit card and then under your psycho score\nIt gives you the reasons it gives you the so on my my psycho five score\nReally pick a good one here uh it says so my my negatives are I have recently been looking for credit I guess because I have the increase for the engagement ring and increase that new chase credit card I got which by the way I got because of the the hotel chain it was a was tied to Iceland got I got platinum or\nOr diamond or something with that hotel chain because I got that chased credit card and so I I have not put any money on it\nAnd it's got actually got a pretty interest rate like I Do shop around and I follow the rules a little three days I follow the rules but when you got an opportunity so because of that credit card which they will never make a dollar off of me for\nA I now get like free upgrades at this really nice hotel chain and said to me that's the way in it I mean money that that's how we say thousands die recently looking for credit that's one of the negatives I have not established a long revolving credit history\nWhich is kind of funny I mean I've got a Fifteen I've had one of these credit cards for Fifteen Years right you don't have a long and ... says I don't have a long enough credit for yeah and the ah it's it's my mid Florida credit union card\nAnd uh let me see ... credit union a date opened a this one was open in two thousand five and my oldest no two thousand for\nTwo thousand or two thousand one yeah so I my first credit card in two thousand and one is like a long time to me in January two thousand and one mid Florida schools credit Mitt order schools credit in January two thousand one uh and and I made the payments on that card on time or Fifteen Years [laughter] works for me yeah\nThank you and Robert now remember that the better your credit the better your rates will be on everything from mortgages credit cards to car loans and even car insurance so you really need to create time on a schedule to watch your scores and pay your bills\nOn time better

[noise]\nI'm John my question our top story at eleven o'clock coming home to nothing in the panhandle [noise]\nAnd I see the same thing the people that don't hit the financial goals take too big a losses at certain times and they're investing career in other words if you've got twenty five to Thirty years to build your nest egg\nAnd two or three times over those twenty five to Thirty years you get a thirty or forty percent move down in the market and you take the brunt of that 'cause you just write it down because you know how to make money one direction when things go up\nAnd you don't know how to protect against loss of preserve capital you run out of time because you have to try to recover from the loss and it takes years to get back to where you were and now you were you wherever you ten years older\nAnd that's not the plan because you're never going to hit the number of the goal to walk away number if you will that nest egg number if you don't learn how to protect against loss and the scary thing is that I mean you see all the time\nPeople have gone through it twice already and just people in in the the baby boomer generation and and people in their thirties and forties they've already gone through it in two thousand and in a week and they have done nothing differently\nThan with the way they were structured in two thousand two thousand eight to protect against laws and here we are sitting again saying tied to protect tied to learn how to hedge tied to preserve capital and which just begging address because if they don't learn it they're never going to hit those numbers world champions the definition of insanity if you lost money in a mutual fund in two thousand eight you lost money in a mutual fund in two thousand one and two\nWhat do you think's going to happen in your mutual fund again and that's the that's the biggest picture that were banging the drum on how do you figure out what type of position you to be at how to protect us and it's a skill champion said all the time well it's amazing because when you hear the term hedge fund and people here that they think Bernie made off\nThey think it's you know something bad and hedge funds inherently a really good because they allow you to take advantage of the movement higher in the market and not take the loss in other words you take a very small loss when you're wrong but you don't take those large losses at cripple you overtime\nAnd many of the listeners don't realize that they could do that exact same thing that a hedge fund does in their own portfolio\nYes you can it's not a complex process and see a lot of the money managers and certified financial planners and registered investment advisors up there they want you to think that you're not smart enough because their Wall Street they want you to the ... you're not smart enough to do that and you can't do it a hedge fund does and yet the reality is is you can\nAnd there's things you can use like options you realize you use an option to protect against a position in the market in other words I could own stock her own and exchange traded fund which is very similar to a mutual fund I could have an option as insurance of the market collapse as I can walk away at virtually all my money intact\nThere's so many things we can do do you realize that this funds where if the market goes down you make money in other words when the market collapse as you profit there's things that are out there that the individual trader investor the person is driving down the road right now is maybe never even looked at managing their own money\nDoesn't realize is available that you and I can use\nIt was to keep ourselves safe and help us at our goals in long term hit that retirement number and it's not a difficult process but yet people want to believe it is because they've been trained to think that way by Wall Street\nWere telling you you don't have to be smart to be successful in the markets you have to follow the rules understand some basic principles and you can be successful and capital preservation is paramount to long term success\nBecause if you don't measure risk you'll have\nNo risk to manage well and that's why a lot of individuals are out there they're concerned about this market they are concerned about what can they do a lot of people don't think they have time to take the time to figure out how to preserve their capital and ship you say this all the time it doesn't take a lot of time to figure out how to protect your money but you got to want to protect your money I I'd have people that I Know that man is their own money and six to ten hours a month\nThey're protected in the collapse if the market and the S. and P. and the dog goes down dramatically they're going to walk away almost unscathed they'll take a small loss but they've got protected positions on and most importantly\nThey're able to participate in the upside in other words they get the returns of the market when it's happening in the way they needed to and if it goes against our starts to fall or collapse they walk away virtually unscathed because they have a protective position\nCapital preservation is not a complex process it's just something that you have to understand first of all and then once you do it becomes a simple system that you follow time and time again well there's many listeners out
