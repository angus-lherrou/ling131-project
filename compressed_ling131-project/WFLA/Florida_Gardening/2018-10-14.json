{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "He's so it's not only about making their life better their family's lives are going to be better because of the relationship they're going to be able to have late in life with people right\nThat's right and you know we always say if we can help somebody with a hearing loss we can help a family if we can help a family we can help a community so one by one where he can have a large effect on on a big community here in the Tampa Bay area by just helping those people here and understand like they should\nI think it's important to the we had on a again the policies that you guys have in place to make sure that you can do the best job for people because everyone knows money's tight for every one so when you have\nTo think about jeeze I might have to pay this this the if I were turn them live to return them within thirty days you guys are doing better than that for people aren't ya\nWe are we give him a forty five day risk

hearing aid studios\nAnd we're proud of that because of the job that you guys do we'll talk about it for one more segment on the other side pat Donovan Randy eat here ... hearing aids or nine Seventy WFL am\nSixteen ... day your next chance to win a thousand bucks coming up tomorrow at six six am I. nine Seventy WFL a\nHearing loss on a ballot as American own and operate in\nThat's right ... and Randy even live from the audible hearing aid studio talking about\nThe importance of getting your hearing taking care of and these guys can help you out [noise]\nAnd we've talked throughout the show about\nNot only how important it is for you how important it is for your family how important it is in general for you to have good hearing\nAnd it's one of those things that a lot of things you deal with medically they're painful or they take a long time or you're not sure how they're going to work none of those things apply when you go to Florida hearing dot com and get an appointment over at audible hearing aids talk about that I mean it's it\nWas so many things Randy when you're talking about your health ... it's not an easy thing to go through this this really is the hearing loss ended fixing it is\nThat's Wright Patt it's it's it's basically painless I mean people come in our office where a patient base\nA pretty were friendly we're we're family it's like you're part of our family we greet you we we love and have a new there we we don't wish I'd hearing loss on anybody I Want to tell you hearing loss is not a fun thing\nI'm sure you love to tell people when they've got some ear wax\nSometimes I Do and then we'll tell them that we're going to be honest with them we're going to be direct with them we're gonna we're going to tell them\nThat things are it's just ... we have a fifty inch screen in our offices with a video camera that looks in the air the patient's going to see everything we see at the same time they're going to get the results of their hearing analysis right then and there it's about an hour worth the time it's probably the most important now or you could ever spend\nAnd we talk about the emotion of it and it really is difficult for anybody who's ever dealt with a family member who's losing their hearing interest not only how it affects them in their relationship but you can see how it affects your loved one\nWhen you go into a location I have to imagine you've seen quite a few situations with people who have been over ... with their emotions after being able to here for the first time in probably a long time\nI think you know that was the one thing when I started in the hearing industry in Nineteen Ninety six I started feeling hearing aids and what captured my ... my passion and then went created my passion I should say was seeing that for the first time when I had somebody sitting in my chair or put hearing aids in their ears\nThey could actually share their loved one that they haven't heard in Twenty years and they started crying and I just wanted to cry with them\nI'm sure I mean I'd rather we would I'm a Sufi man I'm Dick for me all over here every time a you know the hall of fame announcements come on the NFL that works out to be doing the same thing I've had people come in my office literally not\nSaying much of anything all to themselves you know just very quiet and very like an extrovert very quiet very um just just\nMundane and I put a hearing aids in and they almost like dance all the office is a crazy they become a new person because now they're reconnected to their environment and their loved ones and you know I'm going into one of our locations I mean they're so convenient we got over twenty seven Barry locations you can come in and takes about an hour and a half it it'll it'll change your life\nI ... and I know you've talked about this journal Michele we've talked about how important it is but\nWe we have to look at every side of it I think sometimes we forget about oh yeah you can't hear well and and maybe you don't hear your family members but I have to imagine in to what you said people coming in and it just changing their outlook if you don't hear well\nLike you said you're probably going to speak last because you are less interested in hearing what people have to say because you can't you don't want the stress of I Can't hear you and I have to ask you to repeat yourself I'm sure people get really reclusive when it becomes more difficult to have a conversation\nVery much so it's it's amazing how how it really affects them and it doesn't have to be that way it's stressful on the family as well as the person with hearing loss the family gets tired of repeating they start just saying well just forget it I'll tell you later the person with a hearing loss will see people laughing and look at I don't like what are they talking about me\nWow yeah I did I don't think about the aspect of it\nWhat are they laughing about it they're laughing at me I didn't hear what they said\nNot only am I missing something or they keeping something from that to be when you hear someone speak a different language sometimes you have that are they saying something they don't want me to hear and I'm sure it's the same thing when you can't hear well enough\nIt is and they'll you know there'll be isolated they'll think well there are they'll say a joke maybe they'll say a joke and they'll they'll laugh and then they won't laugh at the punch line because I didn't hear it or they'll laugh when they're not supposed to because I didn't hear it or they'll answer inappropriately\nSo they're trying to compensate or they'll just keep on their head yesterday everything because they can't here and they don't want to deal with it they don't want to they don't want to ask people who are ...\nJust a few minutes left in the shell we've talked so much about the importance of having your hearing checked again you can do that at Florida hearing dot com you can set up an appointment very quickly\nFor those who don't know let's talk a little bit about some of the causes of hearing loss some of the things that get people in these situations where my hearing isn't working well enough I don't recognize it or I don't want to recognize that there are a lot of there are a lot of positive for hearing loss out there\nThat is true you know when you come into auto bell the whole reason we're there is because of our patients you know it's all about hearing it's about hearing loss it's about helping that individual when they come to us for help\nWe take that very seriously we want to help him we want to give them the result they deserve we want him to leave our office delighted with the with the the outcome of of their hearing journey we called the hearing journey from the time they first enter our office to the time they leave\nWith their hearing aids and that's why we're all about where a different type of company where we we deal with hearing we hearing is our concern we look at the hearing we take it seriously and we want to give them that result\nBut we also want to fit their budget so we're we're cognizant of that but at the same time the person can be rest assured that they're going to get the best care possible\nAnd when you talk about trying to fit their budget are are there different levels are there different kinds of pricing a pricing options on on the hearing aids or are they just different ones that people can take a look at based on kind of their their ability to pay\n... you know the interesting thing is hearing is unique hearing needs are unique the the person's hearing loss is unique\nWe have multiple treatment options that allow us to find the best answer for different hearing problems we have everything from basic hearing aids to advance we had it ever anything they need rest assured we have something that will work for them to come in please come in if you're having trouble hearing your loved ones\nIf you're having trouble understanding the spoken word were there to help\nYeah and you can make a lot of investments towards having a better life a lot of people do it's difficult to make a better investment than an investment on your health and you're hearing and and as we've talked about today you're hearing had to have so many facts on your health it's amazing\nThat does that has so many effects on your health and once again we mentioned this earlier we have a forty five day risk free trial with hearing aids so when you get your hearing solution I'm sure you'll be delighted with it but if there were any reason you're not it's a risk free trial we don't do that because\nWe don't really sell hearing aids we fit hearing losses right I'd say we're saving lives up so that earlier and I really believe that we save people from their emotions from there from their depression and things that they don't necessarily need to go through any more\nAnd you don't need to go through it and it's important that you get your hearing looked at and make sure you go over to Florida hearing dot com check out all the great options will get you in quickly twenty seven\nBay area locations you've got to check out an audible hearing aid if you're having any kind of hearing loss and if you don't know have yourself checked again Florida hearing dot com ... this is nice Seventy WFL a\nProceeding was it paid program
