{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "You're listening you ask an attorney all about for logging them attorney Joe pippen practicing attorney's office as open as it is every other Sunday Morning here on nine Seventy\nAnd if you would like to a\nCall to show the remaining moments here and we have a toll free number one eight hundred\nNine six nine nine three five to that's one eight hundred nine six\nNine nine three five to eight one three as you're a Hillsborough number nine nine zero nine three five\nTo in Penelope seven to seven for six one nine\nThree five two phone lines are open\nSo do you put an automobile and the trust [noise]\nNo you know you'd you you don't because the ... you have a husband and wife doing a joint trust\n\nSo the housing in the first of all the cars should never be in joint names\n\nShould not be husband or wife because you've that makes you both the owners and since you are both owners if the cars in an accident they see both of you if they can see both of you they can get to his than hers joined assets so the smartest thing to do an automobile on the ship is to have a car and one name\nAnd you put that in the uh\nYou play the odds a little bit you put the car and the name of the primary driver so the primary driver is driving owns a car has an accident they see the primary driver they cannot get two assets held jointly between husband and wife\nSo assets held generally between husband and wife or a special class of ownership where you'd have to be able to both of them to get to those assets you can't just see one\nAnd the ... the spouse of a bad asked that by taking that asset so if you own a car in both names\nThey ... they will be able to see both of you when the cars in an accident\nSo you don't don't really do that cars a spouse can easily upon death of a spouse go down to the end the with the death certificate you get the car transferred to the surviving spouses or name without appropriate process\nSo you have the same type of titles to a car I should do to a mobile home so that pretty much the same\nOr rules would apply there\nSo are there other type of what about airplanes no I've discover all kinds of different uh types of ownership documents concerning the airplanes\nSo the generally answer there is that would have to be reviewed before he decided to put an airplane and trust you have some liability issues there on airplanes and boats as well as cars though\nSometimes people will create their own separate trust a for an airplane or large boat\nOr for example and but generally the biggest mistake people that make it do living trust is they're not always fully funded\nSo what is fully funded me\nWell fully if you had like five but you had them living trust and you have life say five bank accounts well he put for them you went to the bank on for the banks you went to the bank and told the bank you had a trust and they did a little name change on the count\nThe name change will make how would have been from John and Mary Smith to John in Marion Smith trustees and the data that trust\nThey did that on four of them but they forgot to do one bank account so what does that mean that means that the Ford that they took the time and effort to go put into a trust would avoid probate\nIn the trust sort of been well worth creating because of what he probate on for those bank accounts however they forgot one bank account and that one bank account will have to go see probate\n\nSo they didn't get the full benefit of having a trust because they've gotten a little bit lazy and never got around the putting one of the counting the name of the trust and never fully funded the trust with all of their bank accounts\nSome people have real estate like I say a time share and they have a living trust and they have a timeshare in another state\n[noise] well just like their home you do a quick claim due to their home to the trust that you have to do a time share a you have to do a quick claim to eat at a time share to the trust of word probate\nReally a trust his great when you have multiple properties in multiple different states can solve the problem is going to be put in one trusts to avoid the probate\nProcess but\nYou know a Florida attorney for example is not licensed in North Carolina where you have a timeshare so you have to get on North Carolina attorney\nTo uh do that but it is it worth it sure [noise] cause real estate as probate it wherever it's such a way that you put it in the living trust you can avoid the probate process or in the living trust so there are lots of\nUseful tips in there about how to keep your family out of our probate process which is very very expensive process and if you have a living trust you can put things in the living trust too easily avoid the or the probate process\nAnd there are a lot of good reasons to ah to create trust when you definitely want to stretch out the assets trust is great when you have two great children and everything fifty fifty outright super the make their job so easy and quick in private\nWhen you have a ... if you don't there's a up to a year probate are pretty high expense\nAll right if you'd like air free estate planning poster sheet [noise] it's a double sided cheat there five articles on ah their front side of the sheet all about what is the state

Mike I he's the owner president of Florida fresh lie verbs and we're talking about how to play it where to plant or live verbs\nI Do you want your lie verbs out in full blazing sun or do you want them out in the afternoon sun morning so where where are they going to grow the best\nUh once once you start getting a higher eighty five degrees they're going to want something light all day long if you have it\nOkay if if not you they made a minimum of four hours a day\nOkay I'm In with an afternoon sun so OK\nMorning afternoon ... wherever you can get a good four to six hours the sun for the plant is okay\nThat were coming what we are coming in the shorter days and cooler temperatures so you want to get as much as you can ah for now until next summer now\nOh I Know there's a lot of people out there that will will clip or\nYou know a a generous portion of their plants and dry that out and then store that is that how you like using your ...\nI like using fresh off the plant\nRight in my food but herb do like it is it is good for the plant 'em to cut them up if if you don't cut them back I'm allowed new growth to come out stuff you get overly forty so if you if you have to you that you can\nSure um you know I always I'll like if I have a whole bunch your base will make\nSome extra pesto and just use it as a you know as a condom is putting on sandwiches or whatever\nSure um but I always recommend fresh drawing them out you are going to lose some of the labor within right wind up having the fresh live herb um at your disposal\nNow when you cut back or\nHow far out and um you know I I don't want to go into all the individual varieties are herbs and spices but how far normally do you cut back\nWhen you when you start start taking your cutting you go because you know in the plant world I always say no more than a third off the plant at any one time is that the old drew with spices and herbs\nI asked at\nThe deepest I Would cut it back is to make sure that you have at least two nodes left\n... most of your um\nAlso depend how big the plan of the big giant Rosemary you can take about two thirds ever in all of these five\nReally okay so for Rosemary Rosemary is a little bit more forgiving and ah from what I Know about Rosemary sometimes they liked being cut back\nAll the ear of like being cutting back ... cutting up cutting a bagel stabbed more meant them a rose Mary time what that does is it triggers the plant to push out\nOh okay so you're going to have that then you have watched that\nAnd the the freshest or the newest growth not the older grow up to the newer grove really that you're aiming for correct\n... yeah like if I were both married in ... it'll tend to get what are you down the base right on the earth but that time at a regular you're not gonna really notice it does\nYou will notice as much cause it to get her off\nThe plane to begin with 'em and if you do have a ... with no matter what kind it is and this that and they get what he cut it back a little bit there now you will get to go back to the man I got\nTo go for brag I'm going to put you on hold again and oh geez I I'm going to put you on hold again we've got to go to the news we've got our very own John requested in standing by the news room\n[noise] he assumes radio nights out of that when you have to LA you ... to clear water you two seven five easy Wesley chapels how\nThis could be yours good luck All right let's see we're we're\nTalking with Matt my car and I went to see if I can get mad back battery there Yes sir y'all are okay a man of\nCourse he is the owner for the fresh live verbs and we were talking a little bit about trimming back our arms and spice plants to in order to number one or the\nTo Bush out ah to me ah some of the older leaves\nThat some of our plants produce\nIf they're not pushing out new leaves ... leaves have that oh that that that really just that burst of taste\nOr when you use them off for cooking\nAnd I always like to use those fresh leave that come out we were talking about Rosemary Rosemary kind of hard and is often and and I don't want to eat like grains of rice\nThat aren't cooked [laughter] okay ah I like mine to be there but not something that sticking in my teeth [laughter] right so I like to cut my back\nRegularly to flush out that growth especially several days before I Know\nI'm going to need it is that something that you do as well\nYeah well I I I just break off fresh plants whenever I knew them\nAnd yeah you you get that convenient you have the convenience of going out and just bring in some brass plans but for for for those of us that are actually having to grow these in our ah outside the home and in the four to six hours a full day or you know we want to make sure\nThat we have the best that's available\nTo us now\nWhat about ... what do we do we have a a past 'cause you know sometimes I've I've had people bend discouraged\nAbout growing ah herbs and spices\nBecause\nIt's always possible that you could get some aphids or something that show up on your plan what do you do then\nThe the people are a little bit surprised sometimes when I tell them the\nBest thing they can use the aphids and ... and stuff like that is in either the insecticide will soap or household dish soap as long as I say so\nAnd not a target because of the courage it will kill you plant\nA so look on the label of your\nOf what you're using you don't want detergent or you just want us a simple dish so is there are a variety of dish soap do you prefer\nIt wouldn't matter as long as it I always recommend you go to either it in a ... organic store one of your big\nBox stores sure actually actually get an insecticide all so\nOkay so ah ... ran out there called safer s a F E R\nAnd safer carries all these natural products that you can use on your vegetable gardens and of course you're herbs and spices too so uh the the products are available to you out there\nOr if you are interested in in you know a protecting your plants but only if you see a problem now when when you take your cutting off the plant I mean you always wash those first\nAid that okay we want you you ... you want to watch anything that is on the planet including a trope rather do if you use I use and you're so it will leave a little white residue is not going to hurt you but if they're right\nAnd if if you do have a a straight insect the to\nWash them right off sure that is sometimes if\nI if I Do notice that I have a a little bit of a ... a ... a fate or something like that on a stronger\nPlant oh you are very natural uh insecticide which is just that light sprayed with out\nOh there you go so uh either light spraying the hose over the top because some of the plants are are some herbs and spices ah they're they're very weak stem\nSo you don't want to blast of of of water over the top but a light application through a garden hose sometimes watch the the aphids or or or the other insects are directly off the plant so you don't have to worry about that\nExact but uh you know I I think that if you go to the store may even the big box stores carry the safer brand I think there has a safer brand product as well and a bunch\nOf them out there yes and if you just pick up the these these are are are ready mixed\nAnd basically you you they're they're ready to go you all just to squeeze trigger and are just you know put her on and spray and you spray or plant and disclose it up I always make sure you shake your container first to make sure you you know a this and it is settled in there is is is shaking backup\nAnd uh do do it once and then maybe wait till the following day and do a second application just to make sure you got everything but there is nothing in there that's going to hurt you are in in you know making sure that\nUh you can get rid of the past on your plants or\nWhat about you because you you only do\nUh some of these uh spices but sometimes you you you sell some tomatoes other things don't you\nKnow we do a little bit we do a little bit of tomatoes and a little bit of pepper than we do mainly from hot peppers and they'll tap as jalapeno\nA couple of different kinds of tomatoes um same thing same insecticide um uh for the for the as far as a prison fix a stuffed go if you have a soft body insect like a a like a caterpillar a worm or something like that we use a\nDry flow of all I'm back here with you if it's a big long name\nIt's ... and that are on for Beatty boy time a BAT die pal or third side all three of those names products that's just a ... diet dealt with what I Do\nYes and all three of them are the exact same product are the only problem with it for caterpillars if you're using it because the herbs and spices duty caterpillars absolutely\nOr if you have ... and you use either the the beach teeth are aside or die pal the only problem with it is if it rains or if you watery or plants you're washing it right off so that\nMakes sure that you you you hear the thunder rumbling or not the best time to spray or those products on your plans because it's going to wash it right off your plant\nIt no it normally has a a five to seven day I water every day\n... find the seven days through the water\nWell okay uh so uh\nOne other thing um once your plants out grows\nThe ah let's see if you took your for a six inch plant and it it all grows that uh other container that that maybe you put it up into a six inch or or or a a one gallon container or do you still want to report that into a bigger container or do you just want to cut the plant back and cut the roots off put it back in the same size container\n... you can decide ... if if you don't want to put a big fan of cutting back you're going to hit a point where you you're going to have so much roots\nAnd the part that you're gonna have to have to transplant or status ...\nOh okay ... ... they will get ... and then they'll they're really won't grow wealth note with them and it's a new show\nWhat about the life expectancy or I go out today and I buy myself the four inch herbs from you how long if everything goes great and I plan on him in the perfect spot and watering them I take care of them how long will those herbs really be viable before I should start looking for something different\nAll depends on the variety oh I'm located ... based on your own with my other non laugh longer um plans like cilantro tend to die more quickly and collateral we'll go to go to seed in the summertime and that's it\nOkay now what happens when you plan to go to seed\nA different different ones do different things like that you're a salon frozen you delve they get a big fat them on them right and it will come up you get a nice big beautiful flower and then on the list of\nAll in the eyes of the older I guess um and then the plant it it'll it'll go to see it in the fall off now you're ... Rosemary um they'll fly though actually fly put out little tiny flowers on all over the plant among the ... as long as you cut them off your base on the roads are going to continue to predict\nA so even if they produce the flowers or do you still can go ahead and cut those back off and and just trimming the ends off sometimes isn't isn't as good as trimming back in and actually lowering the height of those plans correct especially ... pretty tall and Rosemary to\nExactly ... is as ... is a very big plant cutting it back like you said you'll get nice fresh leaves again you wash it out and you'll get ... effect regenerating\n... sure it's going to be happy they\nAre like to be caught they like to use that triggers them the Bush out and um and they continue to grow it um it instead of I'm trying to find it you can always add for as long as we still have some decent amount of oil or haven't rooted all up\nHarm you can add fertilizer and they'll they'll they'll come right back OK well man\nThe train traffic than our power by climate design we do have some smuggling and Seventy five north bound between thirty first street south than I three Seventy five on the side that she's in an accident and talk to the shoulder but there is one lap lanes still blocked by emergency vehicle to travel\nReports sponsored by ... protect your world get your flu shot today at Walgreens or receive a coupon during the ten dollars reward on your next purchase a thirty dollars or more rewarding valid on feature ferocious vaccine restrictions apply terms and restrictions apply to coupon K long is right and I'm Seventy W.
