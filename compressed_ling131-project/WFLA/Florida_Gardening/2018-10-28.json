{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "Absolutely ... and I mentioned Neal lost both my grandparents last year both of them\nWere dealing with some kind of hearing loss and I I remember towards the end wanting to have more meaningful conversations with my grandfather so it's not just about in the moment it's like hey here it is I'm about to I Know about to lose my grandfather and I miss those old stories and I just want to ask for some of those and\nSo it's not only about making their life better their family's lives are going to be better because of the relationship they're going to be able to have late in life with people right\nThat's right and you know we always say if we can help somebody with a hearing loss where you can help a family if we can help a family we can help her community so one by one where you can have a large effect on a on a big community here in the Tampa Bay area by just helping those people here and understand like they should\nI think it's important to that we had on a again the policies that you guys have in place to make sure that you can do the best job for people because everyone knows money's tight for everyone so when you have to think about jeeze I might have to pay this this fee if I were turned them live to return them within thirty days you guys are doing better than that for people aren't you\nWe are we give them a forty five day risk free trial you know we're all about the patient hearing is our concern we want them to get the result that they deserve that is what we're going to do everything we can to make that happen\nAnd you can tell it's a priority for you guys and that's why we love having you here and having you as the naming studio or or the game he writes ... studio here at nine Seventy WFL a it is the audible hearing aids studios and we're proud of that because of the job that you guys do we'll talk about it for one more segment on the other side pat\nDonovan Randy eat here probably hearing aids nine Seventy WFL at Qom\nHearing loss of Dallas American owned and operated\nThat's right ... and Randy even live from the audible hearing aid studio talking about\nThe importance of getting your hearing taking care of and these guys can help you out [noise]\nAnd we've talked throughout the film about not only how important\nIt is for you how important it is for your family how important it is in general for you to have good\nHearing and it's one of those things that\nA lot of things you deal with medically they're painful or they take a long time or you're not sure how they're going to work none of those things apply when you go to Florida hearing dot com and get an appointment over at audible hearing aids talk about that I mean it's it\nWas so many things Randy when you're talking about your health it's not an easy thing to go through this this really is the hearing loss ... fixing it is\nThat's Wright Patt it's it's it's basically painless I mean people come in our office where a patient based company were friendly we're we're family it's like you're part of our family we greet you we we love and have a new there we we don't wish I'd hearing loss on anybody I Want to tell you hearing loss is not a fun thing\nI'm sure you love to tell people when they've got some ear wax\nSometimes I Do and then we'll tell them that we're going to be honest with them we are going to be direct with them we're gonna we're going to tell them that things are it's just Iraq we have a fifty inch screen in our offices with a video camera that looks on the air\nThe patient's going to see everything we see at the same time they're going to get the results of their hearing analysis right then and there it's about an hour worth of time it's probably the most important in our you could ever spend\nAnd we talk about the emotion of it and it really is difficult for anybody who's ever dealt with a family member who's losing their hearing and just not only how it affects them and their relationship but you can see how it affects your loved one\nWhen you go into a location I have to imagine you've seen quite a few situations with people who have been over ... with their emotions after being able to here for the first time and probably a long time\nI think you know that was the one thing when I started in the hearing industry in Nineteen Ninety six I started feeling hearing aids and what captured my ... my passion and created my passion I should say was saying that for the first time when I had somebody sitting in my chair I put sharing is in their ears\nThey could actually share their loved one that they haven't heard in Twenty years and they started crying and I just wanted to cry with them\nI'm sure I mean I'd rather we would I'm a Sufi man I'm Dick for me all over here every dime ah you know the hall of fame announcements come on the NFL that works out to be doing the same thing\nI've had people come in my office literally not saying much of anything all to themselves you know just very quiet and very like an extrovert very quiet very um just just\nMundane and I put ... and they almost like dance all the office as a crazy they become a new person because now they're reconnected to their environment and their loved ones and then I'm going into one of our locations I mean there are so convenient we got over twenty seven Barry locations you can come in and takes about an hour and a half it change your life\n... and I know you've talked about this journal Michele we've talked about how important it is but\nWe we have to look at every side of it I think sometimes we forget about oh yeah you can't hear well it and maybe you don't hear your family members but I have to imagine in to what you said people coming in and it just changing their outlook if you don't hear well\nLike you said you're probably going to speak last because you're a less interested in hearing what people have to say because you can't you don't want the stress of I Can't hear you and I have to ask you to repeat yourself I'm sure people get really reclusive when it becomes more difficult to have a conversation\nVery much so it's it's amazing how how it really affects them and it doesn't have to be that way it's stressful on the family as well as the person with hearing loss the family gets tired of repeating they start just saying well just forget it are all tell you later the person with hearing loss will see people laughing and look at and that's like what are they talking about me\nWell yeah I did I don't think about the aspect of it\nWhat are they laughing about it a laughing at me I didn't hear what they said\nNot only am I missing something or they keeping something for that to be when you hear someone speak a different language sometimes you have that are they saying something they don't want me to hear that and I'm sure it's the same thing when you can't hear well\nEnough it is and they'll you know there'll be isolated they'll think well there are they'll say joke maybe they'll say a joke and they'll they'll laugh\nAnd then they won't laugh at the punch line because I didn't hear it or they'll laugh when they're not supposed to because I didn't hear it or they'll answer inappropriately so they try to compensate or they'll just keep nodding their head yes to everything because they can here and they don't want to deal with it they don't want to they don't want to ask people who are ...\nJust a few minutes left in the shell we've talked so much about the importance of having your hearing checked again you can do that at Florida hearing dot com you can set up an appointment very quickly\nFor those who don't know let's talk a little bit about some of the causes of hearing loss some of the things that get people in these situations where my hearing is it working well enough I don't recognize it or I don't want to recognize that there are a lot of there are a lot of positive for hearing loss out there\nThat is true you know when you come into auto bell the whole reason we're there is because of our patients you know it's all about hearing it's about hearing loss it's about helping that individual when they come to us for help\nWe take that very seriously we want to help him we want to give them the result they deserve we want them to leave our office delighted with the with the the outcome of of their hearing journey we call it a hearing journey\nFrom the time they first enter office to the time they leave with their hearing aids and that's why we're all about we're a different type of company where we we deal with hearing we hearing is our concern mhm we look at the hearing we take it seriously and we want to give them that result\nBut we also want to fit their budget so we're we're cognizant of that but at the same time the person can be rest assured that they're going to get the best care possible\nWhen you talk about trying to fit their budget are are there different levels are there different kind of price things a pricing options on on the hearing aids or are they just different ones that people can take a look at based on kind of their their ability to\nYeah you know the interesting thing is hearing is unique hearing needs are unique to the person's hearing loss was unique\nWe have multiple treatment options that allow us to find the best answer for different hearing problems we have everything from basic hearing aids to advance we've done it ever anything they need rest assured we have something that will work for them to come in please come in there if you're having trouble hearing your loved ones\nIf you're having trouble understanding the spoken word were there to help\nYeah and you can make a lot of investments towards having a better life a lot of people do it's difficult to make a better investment than an investment on your health and you're hearing and and as we've talked about today you're hearing have so many facts on your health it's amazing\nThat does that has so many effects on your health\nAnd once again we mentioned this earlier we have a forty five day risk free trial with hearing it and so when you get your hearing solution I'm sure you'll be delighted with it but if there were any reason you're not\nIt's a risk free trial we don't do that because we don't really still hearing aids we've been hearing losses right I'd say we're saving lives up so that earlier and I really believe that we save people from their emotions from there\nFrom the depression and things that they don't necessarily need to go through any more\nAnd you don't need to go through it and it's important that you get your hearing looked at and make sure you go over to Florida hearing dot com check out all the great options will get you in quickly twenty seven\nOh absolutely I even told even though it which we're going to get into it a little while even though a lot of our uh but but the pineapples that we have the the roots are basically they're just to hold the plant up they're not really a the even though they just take a little bit of nutrition I guess from the roots\nThat's very true pineapples usually take their nutrients in through the leaves and that's why it's important if you ... ... best way to do it aerial through the ...\nLaw so uh we I I Want to get into all the uh\nGrowing ... pineapples him why we should do things but I I Want to know I ... for most people that are out there in in like this whole motor that had been planting has in in containers items driveway what how do you started by that but let's let's start there how do we start one\nWhile you're best stop one from a crown of a plan I Believe or to God because their roots are actually in the bottom of the crown and when you get the crown the best thing to do is to peel away one or two of the leaves around it and they will see the roots\nSo little knobs sticking out underneath where you pull those bottom leaves off after you've cut it off the top of the pineapple\nThat is right but that don't recommend cutting off because of the cut it off you may cut off those roads best is just a twisted off twist it off and then put it out with the the the er the base\nPointing up to the sun so to court arise if you put the role wound into the soil it my rod yeah your quarter rising first and then put them in\n... now if you twist it off the top or you're not getting any of the pineapple than with it so well how most people cut the top softer pineapple they're they're having some of the raw flush it out on their right\nYes and that's bad because that can rot and induce brought into the crown\nOkay so I always thought that you wanted to you wanted to have a little bit of that and have it dried off [noise]\nNo no no not not correct knock her hey we're learning were already learning how to play it by the apples here so a lot of people uh you know if you go to the grocery store they are going to buy a pineapple from the grocery store\nAnd they'll take it home and they make that first caught so now or if they take that first got you weren't just right at the bay or twist as you say now what if it doesn't twist off because it okay to cut it right at the very top of the pineapple\nWhen it's the pineapple is ripe it look for stuff without too much problem\nOkay so uh but they come Greenland there in the uh you know food food area at the at the grocery store or I don't think I can twist went off good\nYes because when the pineapple comes into the grocery store is right\nIt is right yes a pineapple does not ripen off that it is obviously it's not like a banana all the sweetness this into a pineapple fruit is already there\nAnd it carries the stocks reserves in his route it sends them up through the pie Don ... stalks we recall it into the fruit\nAnd the moment is twisted off it's not going to get any sweet or has no more sugar it's just going to start to deteriorate right there that's why a freshly picked pineapple taste for best and when you go into the grocery store you should find the newest one that they have in the stall\nWow so a lot of people will put those colors for like three or four days to to start ripening up and they're not ripening up at that point\nNow they are going downhill they're\nDown hill at that point the they think that they're going to because now they give a little bit in the middle of a squishy that are a little softer that law now by pineapple is going to be really juicy and that's not the case that is absolutely true wow that's that's that's interesting I didn't I didn't know that either so\nOne other point I'd like to point out there as you mentioned the color of the color green or a car a gold makes no difference whatsoever the outer shell of a pineapple has no relationship to the rightness inside is controlled by the environment\nSo many places you can get a a naturally gold pineapple and in other countries of well different environment you have a deep green pineapple the rightness will be the same inside\nWow so how how would a somebody tell if they're pineapple is right because we don't grow the gold variety here I have seen the gold at the Dole pineapple plantation out in Hawaii they grow the list I think that's one of the uh variety they grow there they've got about twenty eight lifted under little board and at the Dole pineapple of\nUh the I guess as a souvenir place there\nOkay well the variety this growing commercially throughout the world and now it's the same quote MD too and if you buy a pineapple in the grocery store that's what is going to be now if you run your own pineapple\nIt's usually hired for the homeowner for us to decide how it's right or the first thing you do you do not depend on the color at first depend on the ... of the ice when the eyes of the pineapple are all flat\nThen you can ... bending over slowly every day I go to that point and apple and bend it one day or snap off that's when it's right but if it does a snap off itself you are taking it before it's right now I taught\nYou say when the eyes are flat so look at look\nThey look at the eyes of ... where are these eyes you know the\n... that the individual Florence there around the fruit OK okay has you know it's it's such a composite fruit of many many little fruit right right okay well then that's the outside part of that just cold night that's where the flower wise\nAnd is now dried up but it's usually pointed when it gets flat but no those are all flat\nThen starting to ... and you wait and and you should stop pushing it over a little bit on the stump\nAnd eventually it will snap off ... now I find that a good point it's a ... starts to note what color it was at that time my experience in West central Florida\nA but you you walk into a lemonade any uh the fungi or possibly bacteria that possibly could get into that as your routing\nUh when we come back after the bottom of the hour of course we're going to be giving away that great a farm daddy I\nGrow box but uh we're gonna talk about the types of soils that you want to mix up\nOr to put into I to put your pineapple cutting a or start into ought to grow some of the best pineapples an hour to do that you don't pineapple growing is so easy and we have the perfect climate here to grows many pineapples as you want right\nWell we have the ... is a great time for planting them the right time of year but we can't grow them successfully all year round right because it gets too cold right pineapples like heat heat all year round all year round yeah and that's what we don't get right so well\nSome some years we might [laughter]\nThis era of uh uh we had a lot of heat so far this year and who knows uh but\nUh if we plant them like you said in December and January December and Jay is what we've got to do\nOr to get that pineapple Eighteen months later right that's right All right All right we've got to go for a quick break here of course you are listening to Florida gardening right here on news radio nine Seventy I WFL aid don't forget to stand by we're

course ah I he is also a member of the rare fruit cause so correct\nYes that's correct I'm a member of the ... counts of Tampa Bay\nAnd if people want to uh visit a with in at the next baby plan show at the University of South Florida botanical garden you're usually there aren't you I usually am so ah and and do you are bringing the beautiful pineapples that we see there's sometimes\nNo I don't actually do that um because I'd be in competition with him on top and I well I don't go to me and my own home anymore no\nIt's still it's still nice to to be able to do it correct Oh absolutely absolutely All right so we were talking about a a how to get the proper top instead of cutting that the top of the pineapple off we're talking about just just twisting that top off\nSo that you don't have any of the meat of the pineapple are still on the top than letting that dry off or at least three days that is absolutely correct okay now we've got the pineapple top dried off or what size container do we need a oh first of all\nUh you remove the bottom two rows of leaves understand that you're going to play it now because that will expose the little route no jobs\nThat are below those leaves correct that is true and what type of ah planting medium should homeowners think about using and sort of what type of soil should they be using\nWell they should do something it drains very very very well you must have well drained the soil\nPineapples wrought route very easily so they don't want any water hanging around in the soil now that helps us here because most of ... sand in a dry and really well so you don't need to go out and buy\nTopsoil partying saw and running this just use regular God in the soil from around Tampa\nWhere we are talking about than than regular regular gardens and works just fine and does acts or so that the finally are used for this stuff right outside of a beach front property a\nAh we finally have a use for ... for regular than now uh what size container do we need to fill\nWell I recommend using a ten or twelve inch pot\nOkay so about a three gallon or ... maybe a five yellow container would work fine\nYes okay and I put these pots out in rows of three so that ah when the pineapple grows up and you ... and you've got a big heavy federal um federalized pineapple it will normally start to fall over\nOkay and then also a little harder to find the essential elements would you add that to it and I'm about ready to\nMonitor essential elements are always going to be something that helps a you should always have that either in a liquid or a gradual form if you have it in a granular form Ron Mix it into your uh planting mixture that you're planting your your particular plant into ... if you ... if you can get it as a liquid then of course spray the leaves\nOkay that sounds great thank you always always mark\nAlright thanks Katz thanks bye-bye I'm with the pineapples ah once we plant those pineapples out you say it takes about how long for those roots to really start growing\nBoth for the first few months so growing very slowly environmental shot or get a real good strong root system after about six or seven months\nSix or seven months so we're planting our pineapples between December and January now it gets cold then our our do we have any problems with the cold on them\nNo no no problem at all no so they're not going to freeze on us or anything else while if you get free zone them yeah that will all we've gotten a phrase\nI because we ... we would last year it was here before we had a couple of days out there oh my gosh\nYes I have to you have to cover them over a ... and that's also after they'd been growing for one year that big they're strong and probably about five ... ... pounds white five to five enough parents they're already for differentiation\nLet them get the cold weather so they will the French but don't let them fish though when I was at night coming in scouting for you need to cover them over to stop the frost just\nWhat I tell people above my primary as the the night the weatherman says this is that you got to do something you got to prepare correct so you you have to cover and do some ...\n... we have to take a quick little break I of course you're listening to Florida gardening are right here on news radio nine Seventy WFL a dot com\nFrom ... am to P. M. sixteen K at day your next chance to win a thousand dollars coming up tomorrow it's six oh six AM on nine Seventy WFL a\nFlorida gardening with Marco van on nine Seventy WFL a\nRat's right we're back again [laughter]\nAll over again\nA while you are of course are listening to Florida gardening and hey I I wanted to let people know or as\nYou know I I I write articles for a nine Seventy WFL a once a month and my new article about shade loving plants or you know as I always get these emails from people\nAnd you mark I I I Can't I'd love to use your ... areas in my landscape but I've got all trees or a I've got ... too many shrubs and you know I I I've got this wall and cast all of the shadows nothing will grow\nSo I said well you know it's about time I read I I actually publish something that uh was good for you and I gave you a in this article which his daughter are on my blog\nI hear news radio nine Seventy WFL away all you have to do is go there and download the article and I I give you examples of two separate areas that you can plant with all the different plants that you can use in those areas and believe me by far that is not\nAll the plans you can actually use that is just a taste of plant that I have recommended so ah hopefully that will help you of course I again in Studio today I have in great he's a graduate of the California Polytechnic university\nIn tropical in sub tropical crops science and of course he retired back in Nineteen Ninety five but then spent ten years as a consultant in pineapple production in South East Asia Central America and Africa you've been all over\nYes I've ... I've been all over the most teaching as run this crime must have been a fun fun life to to to have Oh yes Oh absolutely\nAnd uh you know anything and and the fruits and then the fresh fruits and vegetables all wonderful to me\nYes I have made too [noise] so\nNow that we have a a dried off are are cutting we twist off are cutting for five apples the request with twist off the top with will cut the top off\nWe twisted off we let that dry off for about two or three days we plant and regular sand out about time we have a use for that stuff a plant in regular sand it at least eight or three get on or a five gallon container\nAnd uh we fertilize full usually with a twenty twenty twenty liquid fertilizer at one half strength every three to four weeks right every three on\nThe top of the leaves and that on the top ... not down the center throat of the plant and the top of the leaves All right so we do that we plant them out in uh January December and January that's where we plant about and uh in rows of three is the best of in containers\nSo now we've got our plants I in the ground are in the pots or do we have to worry about pass\nI'm not really I'm the only pass it really going to blow the pineapple when the pine up his ripening and you're going to get a raccoons and all kinds of animals like\nBowling help protect your your protect your crop when you're pineapples that formed and are are getting ready maybe some hardware cloth or something like that would offend wire chicken passing something like that over ... to ... you know group them together and you can do it much\nEasier than uh it may look bad but you know the pineapples are precious right don't let them don't let them come and get it from the\nThe only passed you may get isn't really a past his weeds yes need to pull weeds um but there's no real passed here as long as they got good drainage they won't get ... rod they are susceptible to root route or from the fungus qualified ...\nThat always comes when that don't have good drainage\nSo don't put up a plate underneath them to hold Delano let them drain that em drain right through so\nI Will if your plants are are are doing well how wide or should that plant be during the growth cycle to produce what I Would call a fair or decent sized pineapple\nWell a applying of a plan should be a when we were in the field we would measure up to a belt buckle level\nOf his stand by side the plan and is in a pot than it should be say six inches above you your belt buckle down an average size five for five five for\nSure I tend person [noise] um and wins if you've got them in a ten inch pot they will be mixing leaves backwards and forwards between the different plants sure\nBut and and that with should probably be in a three foot range of life right\nNow I wouldn't get that much you don't think so I don't know if it's doing that much then you may have over ... have you made and [laughter]\nAnd all you may have missed the cycle of course she planted in the wrong time okay pineapples we'll get to a point where the too big\nDifferentiate mhm if you if you plant them in December and they grow through to the next December January\nAnd they differentiate that's fine but if you plant them in the middle of the year shall we say and they come to the next cold spell that either will differentiate where the pine up all the size of an egg all they will go all the way through to the next winter\nAnd you have a problem they made the French shy but they may not differentiated all because it to bake\nOkay so and you say differentiate and I'd say produced by apple\nYeah arranged between a vegetative growth and the fruit\nTo a fruit ... okay so uh yeah if you plant them wrong time of year you will you say you get a tiny little pineapple\nRight here also if you tried to plant them here and the off season and um and you get in the French I say in the middle of the year so the fruits gonna come at the end of the year that fruit will taste very good at all because during cold temperatures like we get here\nAt the end of the electorate is right now the ... in the fruit which given the distinct pineapple ties will not blossom\nAnd that's the ... you say yeah that's the things that make the the the assumptions just a whole month to make the pineapple fruit pies like buying up all\nA similar to what what's happening with yours\nA I think it may um [noise] it may be\nSomething that you might want to consider is to lift that plant back up a and push it back up about an inch or if it's not that okay if it's not that big resettle the plant but when you re satellite make sure that the final grade is going to be at least an inch inch and a half higher up than what it is\nAnd you know no no bats no bats and if\nThe tree last minute we survive or it may be something where\nYeah yeah I'm just being honest you know I I've done it before myself in the trees now you know after that weren't length of time
