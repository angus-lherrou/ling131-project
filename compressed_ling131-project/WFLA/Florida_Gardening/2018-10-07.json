experienced it to be with the companies that the banks are have with their range when there's going to be\nA little bit higher because you have the choice of two calling new three people getting quotes\nAnd you have different options in those quotes in the bank has a standard company they usually work with to provide insurance to people who default on their insurance default in the bank wants to make sure you have it so they have a way of just having a company with a standard\nPlan in that plan is most likely going to be maybe not as good or more expensive than the one that you would choose yourself\n\nHow much alone\n\nUm yeah they base it on what you do it alone will they basic no they base it on the value of the house you know most all insurance companies it by you insurance going to base it on the value of the house\n\nYou know they want to protect your house burns down in the fire or it's lost in a hurricane or a big tree falls during the middle of the house and kind of destroys the house and you have to move out they want to make sure they get paid paid on the mortgage or get paid off in the mortgage\nAnd the bank the mortgage company that you have the bank you have has requirements on what level of insurance so I mean it's all kind of tied into that\nI have right now\nWell insurance companies can pick and choose their clientele the area that they were a part of the state of Florida they want to cover so you think the insurance company counsel for no reason they didn't give you a reason\nAnd it wasn't true what was the reason\nThey hurt your [noise] mhm [noise]\n[noise] [noise] how are we didn't get what they [laughter] found my way back\nYeah they uh over the years insurance companies have come and gone and they pick the client in the areas they want to have clients and all of that so\nYou have a contract period in when the contract period rolls around they don't have to re new they can give you notice they're not going to uh be ensuring homes in that area whatever the reason is they there is usually not that hard to find another company though\nI have for for the first half their second ... where\nDo you want to call me I can tell you the company that I ah have my insurance through represents multiple companies and the actually the same thing happened to me you know ten years ago or so I don't remember exactly when to the same thing happened to me and I had to hire to get someone to shop around for insurance\nFor me and if you want to contact me I'll be glad to give you that name and they might be the good resource because

go by and you stay tuned for ah for his show following mind but there was an article in the paper this week I don't know if you saw it or not ladies suggested that you are the some people of course who had never thought about this including me\nTo give your plants to someone in your will to will them to somebody you ever heard of that well a whole big article in the St Pete times I thought it was pretty interesting ah\nYou know I don't know how they would will a living thing that's in the ground of a home or property that they might pass on to somebody else or sell\nAbout ... what about indoor plants I mean you have a big psychotic ... well I I could\nSee some of these old bonds I plants as a possibility that are a over a hundred years old or something that you could physically carry on that would probably be a possibility but I don't know of any other plants that are that valuable as an ... yeah when I rarely\nThat I'm saying I'm thinking to myself who's going to do that and he was going to give a rover shrubs or a or now you have a lot of fruit plants though right\nSure Oh absolutely but I don't know how you develop a large tree or to to will to somebody\nYou know some palm trees are very expensive though [noise] [noise] well yeah but not that it's not not that I liked that\nFive dollars a strange article and I didn't know how many people were anything\nFor you know I didn't read the article that if you have a copy that you could wind forward to me I'd be yeah loving to see that but I have a legal question for you All right go ahead\nOkay so I had a a client called the other day\nAnd they have an Australian a pine tree a sixty foot tall and it is leading it's either a property of tools they have one that's straight nice and straight sixty foot tall and then one right next to it\nIt's sixty foot tall but leaning out a forty five degree angle over the neighbor's home now I Know the neighbor has every right to at the property lied to\nTake off yeah they can trim it but that aside was going to kill the tree\nHowever if they get an ... such as myself to come out and say that this is a hazard tree and present that to the neighbor and the neighbor doesn't remove the tree because now he's been notified as a hazard tree that can cause damage to Earl\nCould that tree be removed or could they have a liability against that neighbor if something does happen\nWhilst exactly what I tell my clients who do get a get an expert to come out in signed a statement that this tree is is dangerous\nIn a threat to you your property or family youngsters in the yard and it should be removed and you ask them to remove it and then I think you can also report it to the county\nSure there's some way or the county can are treated as a dangerous tree has or ... ... so but the laws are a little vague about that then usually you have the right to trim it\nAnd unless it's a even if it's dead decayed in great danger I I don't think you can for\nDoes this would be of a expensive a problem to take care of\nYou know so All right so anyway but he got\nMy time is up in this next guy's coming in is going to kick me out of my chair and make me move All right

[laughter]\nAh but we have a lot funnier and we are both going to be at the planet ... University of South Florida botanical gardens\nOr next week and are going to be a big show a fall plan shows are are are usually pretty nice 'cause they're not as warm as the summer I'm all bets are off\n... ... it's been really warm out here in uh we've been getting quite a bit of rain and the ... ah I was here for the last two weeks but I was out in the Houston area and I really tell you it was raining out there and now my daughter was kind of updating us out here indicating she was a little bit of rain so just a little bit\nOf rain that are not not a whole lot usually I'm going to tell you you you know we used to fertilize a back before the bands were in place\nOr we would fertilize march April September and October\nAnd we would be boy we'd be waiting for that fertilizer to come out right September first and the old days it was when we would start fertilizing lawns and so August hot ... oh my gosh it's just just terrible\nSeptember first or the rains just right off the man you snap your fingers and we would see no more rain out till the end of the year\nOr at least this year we are getting a little ... rain a which is good I dealt with the ban of course the the bad witches God thank goodness thank God that the the ban is now off\nOff for the rest of the year right right so June first through September thirtieth that ban is a seven days gone\nAnd if you have not applied fertilizer to your turf grass you're citrus trees you're on a mental plants you're missing the boat you gotta put your fertilizer down right now get out get it done or if I can ... can stress anything else your plants need it because during the band they they were getting nothing\nVery and then that's the bad thing about the ban is is when you know a growing kid needs to be fed one has grown to actually your plan should be to him exactly you know they're they're growing during the summer and that's when they need their food\nOr an unbelievable but hey that that still also we follow the law ... absolutely though we we we do what they tell us that we have to do\nA so June first September thirtieth that is one of the ban is I've been now is oh you you got to fertilize I Will probably have some fertilizer at the plant show some eight ten ten always bring my tent and\nAh because it's a great citrus type fertilizer flowering plants does very very well uh All right let's get some Ralphie has been since the program started Ralph has been out of this go right to him he's got a ... tree question Ralph good morning\nCome on and Sarah appreciate you taking like online joy show and I uh I'm In Maine man with the interest is on so I have a question that's probably a very minor but to me I have a very young ... year old Meyer lemon tree\nAnd I'm a lime tree as well and they seem to be getting some ... some curling on a leash and um those leave or you know that just crawling at the edges of fruits or on a tree right now and I just wonder if you can and light man tell me what my problem\nWell a lot of leave curl is due to insects sucking on leave so I mean you want to kind of open up the leaves and take a look and see if you've got either scales or a smaller insects you can treat them with a\nUm you know or something like ... say like a mouth I on and that that should take care of that you also um you know the ... are affected by some of the nutrients wouldn't it never hurts through your fertilizers citrus fertilizer\nTo make sure it includes migrant nutrients like iron manganese magnesium\nCalcium is important too and then there's some small metals like ... and um all the ability and the Jews who see there\nYou want to look at the I mean mark does he's going to have a good citrus fertilizer it'll probably have the micro nutrients in it so you know if you go plant show next week because I take a look at that I'm also if ah you know you don't see any bugs out on your on your leaves you can always take your leaf down to the cooperative extension\nAt a you know at your local county and and the are they usually have an animal just\nOr a a a plant person on staff that can take a look at that is it's hard to diagnose stuff whenever you don't actually see it but sure usually leave girl is either an insect sucking on it and sometimes my ... affect the structure of the year lease to so you've got both those things\nAre working against you but if you're a leaves are nice and green and healthy and not every leaf is curled you're probably going to be in really good shape now do you have a key lime or a Persian line\nOr a Persian\nLine okay great yeah both ah both ... and the Persian lime ah especially\nIn the current disease climates we haven't citrus are excellent choices for a for citrus I mean there there are at the upper scale of tolerance against the uh the greening and what they call\n... being a gel be him if you've ever seen the literature read and going to say it again ... ... it's a long long being long long dream being being yeah\nSo yeah it will be a tale of the green a yellow dragging disease or there's a couple of different names of it but yeah both of those ah fruit trees are excellent for um for um you know in this current environment so you should be in pretty good shape\nLike Mark said you want to stay on top of your fertilization it's ... it's not going to help so your regular irregular nitrogen phosphorus and potassium along with the micro nutrients are important to keep the the healthy your tree elevated\nGreat yeah I'd I'd been fertilized and um but you know that I've seen it though is it okay to treat them while this road on the train or\nThe thing is is of course you want to wash your ah a washer fruit before you consume and the only thing is if you're using you want to be a little bit careful if you're using the fruit for zest obviously a ... comes from the\nIs having to worry about you line the dot com indeed use that over three million businesses for hiring were business owners

just\nJust have a question I've got a a I've got a red line tree\nAlready one and I've heard and make\nThings on when I take 'em but I've got I mean this sucker is about ... foot tall and it's got about sixty eight the freight on its heavy\nHeavy and smoke and I was just wondering if you could tell me when I should pick up and do I wake up their bread or is it like\nWell we'll talk we'll talk of the the expert here Jeff\nToxin from dodge since interest in tropical well well the ... the the red line as a uh is is actually a sour orange or ... and the sour orange family and basically what I I Would do it it's probably a mid to late a fall early winter fruit\nUh it's it's as your fruit is starting to break color\nI mean I mean everything was green and now it's all turned yellow\nRight well I what I Would do is I I Would like sample one of them now and see well you know how it tastes and then basically you know sample one every week till it gets to the taste you want and then if you you've got a plan for them like making a marmalade or you're going to make a\nYou know and and they like a lemonade with them or you're going to use it to you know based a turkey for ah for Thanksgiving\nUm didn't didn't you'll know exactly when you need to uh you know ... start you start your base but usually\nI'm I I don't know a huge amount about the red lines other than the other in this hour orange family but basically I Would say if you're breaking colored they're starting to get ready and they're going to be a sour fruit anyway so you're going to have a decent windows to whenever they're going to um\nOne of the reasons I was thinking about pick it up one of those a beehive and put it on our place because I've got a couple of trees out there that just don't want to do anything sure than a boiling they're always in my own\nWyatt ... are right next to one and they're doing fantastic yeah and why we're in a car\nWhere that is yeah that that's that's interesting 'cause

the bees left off you know uh you know we're all that the Russian side each one of the blossoms and go from blossom blossom\nDo you have done it and you know a boy and there's still a boarding\nYeah so I don't get it but I really need to ask you about my Clementine yes\nWhich is not like an economy tanked I ever bought [laughter] at their it really shady\nOh yeah well here here I'll tell you the story like ... there's a lot of different varieties of Clementine tell you what let me\nOkay I got to take a break a lord you might holding\nYeah that's fine\nLet me put you on hold and we'll come
