I got to tell you the attorneys have not helped her I thought they were really really hurt her through the whole process\nHere here's the other thing that when she says the attorney never told her that she had a ... they would come out to her ... I don't buy that it was like I mean\nFor ... ... I'll tell you why I buy it and I'm not a conspiracy guy\nI'll tell you why by because those those attorneys were playing some democratic politics in all of this so flat and and they knew that the hearing in DC in front of the cameras was going to be much more powerful than Republicans went out to California so I Would not be surprised if those attorneys you don't\nYou don't think you heard about it on the news on the pay for fifty thousand\nMaybe I Know I Know we would initially said that and think that by you real quick you also have to remember at the time she's getting death threats she's moving out of our house she it's a state of chaos she's probably staying away from some of the news because\nThe incoming on social media and everywhere else is very negative so again I I could see an explanation for that not saying that's what happened but I could explain that I think\nYou know ... and ... and granted I I have somewhat of your point but we can kind of it when you add one on top of the other and then she's afraid to fly but now I'm uncomfortable with flying yeah it just I mean I'd rather hurt just say look we needed an excuse and I needed some high\nRight right absolutely I maybe that was the result OK\nMhm and and then I'll I'll leave you on that though ... ... it's and they're\nAt and it was not in she said something to the fact of well not Feinstein she had it if she needed it meaning the letter\nBut she got ... ... ... real quick I only have like less than a minute left or do any of the parts of Kavanaugh's testimony that don't necessarily seem to add up some of his explanations for some of the the yearbook staff and things like that did that bother you at all\nI I ... it\nA little bit ... but you're really talking about protecting his friend who's\nYeah but he's on the road there's there's no exemption for protecting your friend under oath\nCorrect correct and he was vague it up to that you can't really crossed that line ...

breaking news throughout the show a because there would be some big Kavanaugh development some of the developments that have taken place though I gotta tell ya\nI did not anticipate one of the most interesting developments has been this this Republican senator Steve Danes from Montana who is going to walk his daughter down the aisle for her wedding on Saturday regardless of\nWhether or not the boats happening that day for him data the year I got I think if the votes going to be really close and Mitch McConnell feels like he needs every Republican they're going to have to believe that boat

guess and figure these things out I Would say that this editorial this op ed\nIs directed at just a handful of people Collins Murkowski flake mansion\nI'm sure he's hoping to win over Americans across the country to but again\nThis is about a handful of people and it's been about a handful of people for quite a while now so let me read you a couple of the parts of this op ed that stood out to me it's titled I I Am an independent impartial judge Kavanaugh says here\nDuring the confirmation process I met with sixty five senators and explained my approach to the law I participated in more than thirty hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary committee and I submitted written answers to nearly Thirteen hundred additional questions I was grateful for the opportunity\nAfter all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded I was subjected to wrong phone sometimes vicious allegations my time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted\nMy wife and daughters have faced bio and violent threats against that backdrop I testified before the Senate Judiciary committee last Thursday to defend my name my family and my lifetime of public service again this is an op ed from Brett Kavanaugh in the wall Street Journal\nMy hearing testimony was forceful and passionate that is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegation against me at times my testimony both in my opening statement and in response to questions\nReflected my overwhelming frustration that being wrongly accused without corroboration of horrible conduct completely contrary to my record and character my statement and answers also reflected my deep distress at the unfairness of how this allegation\nUh earlier in the wake alright let's

latest plus my analysis and your phone calls eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two will start on that\nIn the next segment that will get that role in the first thing I Want to touch on though because this is totally getting over looked\nAnd I feel like I I've got I've got some music to play wall I kind of run through this\nWas that music yeah OK was typically for what I'm about to do right\nI feel like this is kind of appropriate because this is your favorite thing more you\nKnow and then on the right thing\nI've got a job numbers and economic numbers to talk about on a\nOn a friday Monday topic can we spice it up a little bit maybe it was doing something very go right see but they do it if you'll keep me away with that are important\nPeople need to know that the U.S unemployment rate fell to a three point seven percent in September the lowest level since December Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nAnd it's the longest streak of hiring on record with the recovery now and it's a fear citizens exciting that\nGuy that isn't that great I have a couple of more points and then I'll wrap it up I guess I'm not going to go on forever with the economic ... the the Labor Department says employers added just a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs the fewest than a year bots Hurricane Florence was a big reason for that and now the fun stuff the really good stuff\n[noise] big were visions for previous months July is now with a hundred sixty five thousand jobs created instead of a hundred and forty seven thousand in August went up from two hundred and one thousand to\nTwo hundred and Seventy thousand so the average job growth over the past three months\nAbout a hundred Ninety thousand which is really really good so the economy is doing really well wage growth over the basketball much two point eight percent not great but not bad either and other breakdowns of wage growth show things are trending in a positive direction so all it all good stuff\nGood Friday good news for them for friday\nThat's why I wanted to make sure we lead with that nobody's going to talk about that because of all the Kavanaugh south of the job numbers in the ah economic numbers are really important so I Know the minute you see on the grid that a segment like that's going to appear\nYou immediately have this thing in your head but it shouldn't it should be this job numbers I can say that every time I Will be happy good style hold my attention uh also I uh\n... what the focus on national politics twenty four seven the past couple of days just a few states stories that I Want to hit on here in the first segment [noise] Rick Scott and Bill Nelson during the debate on CNN here in Tampa October sixteenth\nIs the time that has many shaking my head ten PM\n[laughter] yes sets both of their bad times they're they're getting up there so you you've got Scott well especially senator Nelson how are you going to stay awake\nYou've got gotten Nelson debating on national\nTelevision with Wolf Blitzer hosting which is going to be all areas are here in Tampa October sixteenth at ten pm with those two I mean let's be honest there too with the more boring politicians on the planet\nI stay up 'til ten ounce plenty for\nIt to me it's like televised Ambien\nLasik Lee if you have trouble sleeping don't bother taking your prescription that night yeah just put the debate on at ten pm you'll be asleep by ten o five I mean you could drink like five cups of coffee and still managed to does off before it's halfway through\nSeriously\nI think this is my suggestion to both campaigns the Scott campaign to Nelson campaign\nWhat they should do is they should send every Florida voter a little bottle of five our energy [laughter] this way people can actually make it through at least some it probably not altogether debate at least seven to ten PM I mean come on\n\nEspecially with those two though I Know you got out when when if you're going to sit down and watched Nelson and Scott go back and forth for an hour you got to do that when people are super awaken energize\nYou know what I just I think they didn't want to interfere with the time of PM Tampa that that is true that that air raid they knew there may be bad if they did it between six to nine\nThat is very very true I didn't even think of that ... point yeah Ali one up for more than\nA also there's a brand new poll a the Mason Dixon poll there was a Mason Dixon pole of the race for governor\nAnd that one had Gillum up only one percent overrun dissent is showed a tightening of the race or the Mason Dixon poll for the U.S Senate race\nHas Bill Nelson holding a one point lead over Rick Scott in July a Scott led Nelson by three points so a cording to the Mason Dixon pole you're starting to see a shift towards Nelson um if you do the real clear politics average you've got Nelson ... Scott at about one point eight percent\nAnd then the average for the Florida race for governor has Gillum up about three point seven percentage points at the end of the day both races are exactly where I've said they were going to be from the very beginning\nThat both toss ups and they're going to be that way for the foreseeable future unless something earth shattering happens in either one of those races\nA eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number of all things cabin on next including the three individuals most responsible for getting him confirmed I'll get to that

were less than thirty minutes away from your neck news update on nine Seventy WFL a this is Pam Tampa Bay with Brian Gorman [noise]\nA day what a week [noise]\nSo many twists and turns\nAnd now we finally have an idea as to where all of this [noise] is headed the um Tampa Bay on friday ... with me and my producers Morgan lashing James for land or the phone number is eight hundred nine six nine Ninety\nThree fifty two so earlier today Brett Kavanaugh advance to a final vote on his confirmation to the Supreme Court the tally of that a vote to end debate on his nomination was fifty one forty nine of\nUs Collins flaking mansion voting yes with Murkowski voting no so the big headline there those for how they voted\nA den Lisa Murkowski ... explained herself a bit saying that uh she actually changed her mind on the way to the Senate floor\nShe said and I'm quoting here I did not come to a decision on this until walking into the floor of this morning\nAnd\nOf course that led to her no on the cloture vote it sounds like that's how she's going to vote on the final ballot as well again the vote earlier which is to end debate and move it to a final vote\nShe went on to say I have been wrestling with whether or not this was about the qualifications of good man\nOr is this bigger than the nominee and I believe we are dealing with issues right now that are bigger than a nominee I Believe that Brett Kavanaugh has a good man I Believe that he is a good man it just may be that in my view he's not the right man for the court\nAnd all in the\nArena of public opinion because if you listen to that speech and how she laid things out not just about the allegations but about him as a jurist\nIt was impressive\nNow is she necessarily right about everything she said ... not so sure I mean Republicans seem\nPretty convinced that he's likely to overturn roe v Wade she seems pretty convinced he's not going to do that somebody is likely going to be wrong\n\nBut she made a lot of other compelling points talking about how you do for Democrats who were so against Kavanaugh and ... and ... from the very start we're not talking about after the allegations were talking about before when they all said they were never going to vote for him\nOn the cases that they voted together Kevin on Garland agree Ninety three percent of the time\nShe made a lot of interesting points\nAnd I thought made the most compelling case for getting to yes on Kavanaugh that I've heard so far\n\nSome of the comments that she may throughout her speech she defended his judicial record said the allegations against him failed to meet a standard of proof\nTo prevent him from serving on the court she said some of the allegations against him were outlandish while noting she believes Christine Blasey Ford was sexually assaulted she said quote I Believe that she is a survivor of sexual assault and that the trauma has up into their life\nBut Collins said other individuals allegedly at the party were Ford's if Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in the early eighties\nCould not robbery and her account first hand Collins added that have senators rejecting cabin all over the accusations it would be hugely damaging to the confirmation process this debate is complicated further by the fact that the Senate confirmation process is not a trial\nBut certain fundamental legal principles about due process the presumption of innocence and fairness do better on my thinking and I cannot abandon them she said that for delegations did not meet the more likely than not standard\nBut tried to stress that she was not saying sexual assault is not a serious problem in the country she also said I could not help but feel that some people who wanted to engineer the defeat of this nomination cared little if at all for her wellbeing\nAnd she's right about that my fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh war to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court\nSo that we have far fewer five to four decisions and so the public confidence in our judiciary and our highest court is restored\nI mean that that's just part of what she had to say it was a lengthy but very compelling\nSpeech that Collins gave today as for my thoughts on all of this uh I'm Glad I'm not casting a vote here I think this whole thing is such a mess\nIt was going to be damaging to the country one way or another whether he wound up getting confirmed or not\nUh we'll talk a little bit about that and also we'll start getting to your phone calls and get your thoughts on what is likely\nTo be the confirmation of Brett

I mean I put a lot of thought into this and and if you listen to the show you know I'm not one to just you know say oh let's get burned them no matter what her oh no let's see he can't be confirmed no matter what this has been a very difficult one for me\nGoing forward because he's going to get confirmed my big hope is\nThat he becomes the jurist that I originally thought he was likely going to be\nThat's what we have to hope for and that he stays out of the public I mean between the Fox news appearance and the op ed enough\nYou've said what you had to say to the public now it's time to go be a Supreme Court justice once you're confirmed focus on the cases in front of you and be that\nImpartial jurists\nThe claim to be that's best case scenario\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty Tuesday number eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty to\nLots of calls lined up we'll get to all of them we've got plenty of time for phone calls all throughout the evening or it will get it all rolling in just a moment of European Tampa Bay eighty five sixteen\nCan date from ... am to hear your next chance to win a thousand bucks hunting up at six pass the top of the hour nine Seventy WFL\nA bee to join the conversation going now eight hundred Ninety nine nine three bind to you are listening to me in Tampa Bay with Brian Gorman on nine Seventy ... LA and\nWe'll get to some of the politics of all of this uh coming up here in the next hour right now I Want to go to the phones eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two again eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two let me go to Jen in St Pete on line one\nJen how are you I'm good and you good for the call yes I\nWanted to shed a little light on some things that have been in the news that have kind of dropped out of\nThe news number one or Trump or you know before this a ... a confirmation I hated that he had announced that he was going to declassify all the fights a warrant information all the supporting documentation all the evidence and stuff like that and yeah but then he backtracked on it\nAnd well he's trying to just laying low right now into a cabinet I'll get 'em\nConfirmed it but this week James Baker the top FBI attorney was interviewed and testified closed doors uh-huh and Jim Jordan came out and said we got a lot of new to leave and we got a lot of good information from this guy he's apparently turned\nJim Jordan said a lot of things that this this was going in a lot of different directions and I haven't seen a yeah when I see the evidence then I Believe it but what what is the broader point here\nWell Lindsey Graham you notice how he's going to become involved and if you go back to his question if Kavanaugh during the hearings he asked Kavanaugh specifically about trees and\nAnd what his opinion was on trees and if someone's convicted of trees if a civilian yeah is convicted of trees and and the death penalty involved and I think this is why the Democrats are so worried because they're worried about what's going to come out with a five to warrant\nNow I don't think that that at all this was all about roe v Wade this is all about Robie away and this was about executive power\nWith eight years of Reagan or over weight wasn't overturned and I'd just like to say I was more left that just like this lady clay and she was ... and it didn't destroy my life are traumatized my ... in fact more than one\nWell I don't think it's destroyed her life she's had a very successful career family and all that I mean why something she's dying with\nCharges why didn't she it there's no statute of limitations why hasn't she filed charges a good question I don't know\nBecause this is my theory if I show\nYeah I I I don't want to get into any more thinking for the call Jay and I appreciate it I I'm I'm kinda done with the the theories of all we're beyond theories now now we're into confirmation mode here I mean there's there's votes happening this weekend is has moved a significant\nAmounts or over the past just twelve hours\nYou're eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two of them go to Mike in Tampa on line to Mike how are you\nFine how are you doing good thanks for the gal oh you're talking about is Kirk from Illinois you know\nYou got to think about it what would your temperament really if you were to the electric car in the ... and ... for for a tribute for your for her life\nWas not exactly what I said I I've been very clear that if I were him I Would have come out as angry and passionate and ... as he did\nIn his opening statement I probably would've stay that way through out some of the questioning from Democratic senators what I had a problem with was some of the words that he used some of the partisan attacks city but he chose to\nThrow out that was more the issue and then certainly his attitude in the back and forth with Amy global Charles problematic and look that's not controversial because he had to come back out after the recess and apologize for it so\nHe wrote my court could added yeah we've never seen anybody under that kind of ... the ... district and whatnot and weren't parental ever not one shred of evidence I mean I look I'm sixty year old guy yeah I I [laughter] I I Would lose my mind\nRight now he's going to be a Supreme Court justice I look I don't paint on some some some people view that as as you know not a big deal like he should be able to be however he wants to be I view it differently I hold them to\nA far far higher standard and I think that's fair when it's a lifetime appointment and you were making the kinds of decisions that he's going to be making\nYou know I Would uh whether some type of allegations that that hard on you I don't know really people I don't I'm Sorry I\nAgain I'm not saying I'm not saying I'm not saying they didn't have a right to be angry I'm not saying they don't have a right to be passionate and not get injured so\nNo I I agree I may not see I did not say any of that I ever said he had an absolute right to be passionate he had an absolute right to be angry I Would have been the same way he ... he wrote that\nOpening statements what was in there the more controversial items that bother me again we're trying to get an impartial justice the or at least somebody who doesn't appear to be overly partisan and\nThat was all pre written that's not emotion that's written in advance laid out and he was comfortable with it and I have a problem with that\n... and they have for your time on the show that\nYou're you're not assuming I'm Sorry Mike you're ... you're you're not getting the point here it's not about\nThe motion and the passion and anger it's about the words he it's about the words in especially in the opening statement which was prepared in advance\nAnd then I\nDon't think he handled himself well especially in that back and forth with Amy cloture\nAnd again\nThat's not a controversial thing to think because he apologized for how we act that that's my ... it's not about him when he first came on and he was loud and he was passionate\nAnd he was angry about what he had been accused of I had no problem with that I have no issue\nI mean you hear me on this show day in and day out I think you can imagine how I Would be so I get it\nThere were other aspects that bothered me and I think they're fair game eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number the phone lines are packed will go back to the phones and we'll talk a little bit about the politics of all of this because look\nHe gets confirmed over the weekend this whole thing is not over and I'll explain why it's all in the way on PM Tampa\nNews radio knives seventies WFL age [laughter] and so when you went to the Clearwater\nYou have the timeframe adjusted a little bit yeah\nThey are and why would you leave her best friend in the house with right that\nAh you know that one again when it comes to some of her potential decisions I I just think you know we've talked to enough people on the show and\nAnd I talked to enough experts in these fields to know that sometimes you know people act in different ways so ... you know I my bigger problem with some\nOf the parts of her story was that again how she didn't remember how she got home\nThat was an issue for me only beholden to halt members want to be well yeah but but but only because it was so difficult back then he didn't have a cell phone and did not move or anything like that so that that well the hero in her memory I always that one always kind of set out but regardless of all of that there was no first hand ... operation\nAnd that was a big problem for me and there was no first hand preparation on the Ramirez allegation either um you know you want to let me\nLet me say let me let me say something to you and it's probably going to make everybody and when I say that some how old are you [noise]\nThirty five about no I'm I'm ... I'm ... I'm exactly thirty five\nI'm sixty two okay what the ... or what sixteen candles how do you watch back to the future have you watched\nAnd you're you're not going to go the route of making an excuse the boys were boys background in this house that\nNow you know okay that's not acceptable it is an acceptable what he did ... like you know what that then that I hate to say was different but you know what I could say no to somebody ... except for that one time and it was no I'm a\nMember of race different men with race like that and they were it was just different right I ... I go up in that era it was a lot different than it is now\nCindy I appreciate the call and Sandy Banks for I tuned in to us for the first time ... hopefully it'll keep doing it I don't mind you have a good night eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two you know we can we can rehash or her story his story all that kind of stuff\nI said it\nFrom the moment the story broke this was likely just going to be a judgment call\nI said it\nWhen the hearings were scheduled we're likely weren't going to know much more after the hearing than we did before I said it when the FBI investigation was an ad for probably not going to know a lot more after the ... FBI investigation and we know now\nThis was always going to be a judgment call and you saw that play out today where you had and and I do think politics played some role in their decisions but you had\nLisa Murkowski who wasn't comfortable with everything she'd seen and I think kind of reading in between the lines on what Murkowski said I think\nA lot of it wasn't necessarily the allegations it was more what I've had a problem with it and it was some of what Kavanaugh said during the hearing and how he's acted in\nA sense\nAnd then you add Susan Collins who made a judgment call and say look taking a look at everything I feel comfortable moving forward it was always going to be that got judgment call\nAt the end of the day\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty to go to Alan tamp on line three al how are you [noise]\nGood how are you doing good thanks for the Gulf\nAppreciate your shoulders I've got a\nI've got a little bit different perspective on the side of a couple of ... um you discussed I'm hearing a lot of it and I don't want to get into the details I mean the details discuss you know to exhaustion but on the on the point of his ... ...\nWhich I find it interesting because I think what's happened and I and I and I I think you did the same thing here man there were two different theories which which we're drawing on two different totally different subject yeah do you\nFeel that he was had the proper jurors prudence in the first year as\nWell as jurors Darwin's hasn't been his his jurisprudence hasn't been an issue with me in terms of how he views the law his his demeanor and the way he acted in what he said in the first hearing I thought was fine I thought the Democrats made fools of themselves in that hearing to be honest with you the ... and and and that's that's my position\nAnd also in the second hearing again I Want to make sure everybody here's this clearly\nBecause I said it a lot but I think some people are still misinterpreting my position I didn't have a problem with the anger and the passion because I Would have felt the same way even some of his pushback on occasion I thought was okay\nThere were other instances where I felt the back and forth wasn't appropriate specifically and I brought this up time and time again the Amy Clampitt sharp back and forth\nAnd I thought that he used words that he had previously laid out that he decided this is what I Want to say at this hearing I thought some of the\nThings he put in there were very problematic and I also thought a couple of things that he said in his Washington or in his Wall Street journal op ed\nWe're a little problematic so that's more it's less the temperament side although there were fewer changes where I thought he was a little bit too far it's more what he said\nThat concerns me because you know we don't want to look at him going forward and say\nYou know is he trying to get back at Democrats and the left with this decision that that\nCalls into question the legitimacy of the court and that's my big big concern here\nI don't I mean and I don't disagree with your position on its face but looking deeper I think this man who is careers show of or even have to\nHave a judgment yeah reason to say no no\nWe're again we're we're we're looking at it in hindsight right we're sitting here and nice and calm and assessing every word and every inflection of is over his demeanor but when when you think about him being in that place man I mean it's\nYeah but that opening statement and using it for the fire\nYeah but some of that opening statement okay that was not in the moments that was planned this this Wall Street journal op ed that was plans\nThese these are words that are written down thaw it out and he decided this is what I Want to say so you can't give him the well\nYou know he was emotional and all of that now when it comes to the written statements you know what I mean and that's where I find the most problem and the most concern again like I said in the open today I Hope that he goes about his job as a Supreme Court justice the same way he's done his job as\nA judge all of these years because I don't think there's\nAnything disqualifying about what he's done that's my hope going forward but based on some of what he said I think it is fair to at least be concerned that he might look at things in a bipartisan manner especially after\nThe way he was treated by the left [noise]\nI got about ... dirty job yep ah the guy showed me showed me a battle\nThat frankly I did not take this guy or are they going to be a fire strategy was to get them into full he showed me metal man than I Do I didn't I just on on the initial says but I didn't think he that very well listen I enjoy your show thanks\nFor
