him on Twitter at Stewart and Kaplan an on line at caplin Parker law dot com Stewart one more quick question before we get to the cabinet stuff when you do these these background investigations we always hear so much\nThey go all the way back\nYou know how far back are we talking uh\nGreat question yeah listen when you talk about arrest records\nOr convictions or things like that we go all the way back to the beginning or when you're born believe it or not whether or not it's been ... funds were sealed et cetera when we talk about alcohol related\nIncidents meaning you've been in treatment or who have been recommended for treatment or you've been hospitalized\nGenerally we go back to the last seven years when we talk about the ... drugs that use of marijuana cocaine et cetera we go back to your entire lifetime when we talk about your former residents we wanted to know where are you a cliff basically Central High school days so it varies depending on the topic\nAre you going back in reading the high school yearbooks of the individuals that you're investigating\nA so [laughter] you know and that's a great question because I boarded by the same question yeah my question\nAnd I know it's counterintuitive so generally Washington say generally it is not unusual for derogatory information to surface when we go out and we interview varies people\nGenerally quite frankly it generally happens when you go out to do with neighborhood campus just see what type of person\nOr what kind of person the guy the person makes as far as being a good neighbor yeah\nAnd as you can imagine sometimes neighbors don't generally get along and so sometimes you get your go knock on the door neighbor and he gives some derogatory information it's not unusual be noted and let's assume that this labor volunteers that this person that lives next door to him that's going to be a candidate for the next\nSupreme Court justice is throwing crazy parties and drinking and staying up all night\nThat ended up self is going to be documented in my ... to nothing more is going to happen other than I'm going to\nConvey that information to FBI Headquarters they're gonna conveyed by White House if the White House does the term it to be that big of a deal it's going to it that's it it dies right there on the line if the White House says well that's a real concern and upsetting to us\nAnd we want you to go out you need to reintroduce the individual or contact\nAuthoring a style or corroborate\nThat then that's what we will do now here's counter to the point\nIf I was conducting a quote unquote investigation that I had for unfettered discretion\nI Would follow it to its logical conclusion that I Would say to the ... what can you volunteer some other individuals may have the same Indian or who know about these parties and I would go out and contact the individuals in a background investigation such as a presidential appointment we don't have that discussion we have to stick to the script\nAnd Ford aside from those parameters is it possible that just talking to the individuals they talked to weather was Ramirez and and judge and a couple of other people are and and then the testimony they already had from the Senate Judiciary committee hearing is it possible that would just be enough to put together a report\nGoing on in this particular case unless something ... four feet came out with any of these new witnesses and again you know let's assume you know someone on known to us as it is and he or she on kids reach on them to us\nAnd it goes through math quiz actually

that is set\nFor for tomorrow or which will be exactly one week after a\nJudge Kavanaugh was approved by the Senate Judiciary committee if Kavanaugh is approved by the cloture motion tomorrow which

could take place\nAs quickly as Saturday So if you were hoping for an easy friday and an easy weekends well you could just ignore the news but if you're in our business and we have to pay attention to it it's going to be a a full weekend of work just catch me up on my [laughter]\nI'm not in it all out I'm enjoying my weekend thank you very much\nThat that is the timeline that we're looking at\nIt could shift a little bit we look we still don't know where certain senators\nStand on Brecht cabin up the votes aren't there again if McConnell doesn't think the votes were there that could change everything but I tend to think the boats are going to be their cell in the next hour coming up here just after seven\nWill tell you what some of the the big players\nHave been saying today will tell you what Senate Democrats have had to say about the FBI investigation here's Hans they're not happy with the big surprise uh and and then we have a couple of other stories related to all of this I don't want to get through plus I can be a\nA might take believe it or not I have an opinion on all of this I Know that shocking to do a lot of people a plus a source of your phone calls eight hundred

you're at home or the stadium knew I our Radio Free ... collections\nAnd how much the capital issue was playing in North Dakota how much the voters they're passionate about it\nBut I think what she decided now her brother said that that she's voting no so she can look herself in the mirror every morning but I\nYou know there's always some politics at play I think Heidi Heitkamp calculation here is that she's trailing and her only chance of winning\nThis reelection is if it's a blue wave and the base shows up in big numbers and she gets all of those votes\nAnd\nFor her there's no way that that happens if she votes for Kavanaugh so if I had to gas\nAnd bats I Would say that was part of Heidi Heitkamp a calculation\nSo let's get to a Senate Democrats here who had a lot to say top Senate Democrats that today uh that the FBI investigation was incomplete and too narrow in scope\nSenate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Judiciary Committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein spoke with reporters after getting briefed on the report\nWhich senator says about fifty pages includes interviews or statements from ten individuals'\nThis is from Chuck Schumer quote we had many fears that this was a very ... very limited process and that would constrain the FBI from\nGetting the facts those fears have been realized Feinstein characterized the FBI's investigation as incomplete flooding that it might have been limited by the White House of course a Chuck Grassley\nSaid I told you a moment ago he found no hint of misconduct regarding Kavanaugh Schumer disagreed he said quote I disagree with Senator Grassley statement that there was no hint of misconduct by Schumer didn't respond to follow up questions asking what he met her what led him to that conclusion no surprise\nTo really nothing that we're seeing from the Democrats is very surprising here\nA Senator Jeff Merkley said he read the report holdings sham Senator Warren not even a full week for an FBI investigation complete sham sham it's pretty much the word that\nThe Democrats were using a Tim Kaine senator Kaine Morgan what do you think if you had to take a wild guess what do you think Tim Kaine called the investigation\nNow while Watchmen what's been the pattern\nThat I've just said over the past like minutes\nRight I Am writing this as [laughter]\nListeners up they call that a sham sham everybody counted a sham\nA Kamala Harris she she said and completing in insufficient\nSo she didn't go to the sham holidays as you can call it a sham nine to ...\nThe Senator Whitehouse considerable restraint ... blah blah blah blah blah so so that's what the Senate Democrats are saying uh which was very very very predictable attorneys for Ford criticize the FBI over the scope of the investigation here's the\nThing if you're going to criticize anybody criticizing the FBI for they gotta go by what the White House says we we just had that in that interview with former FBI agents door caplin who did these background investigations apparently\nFord's attorneys have not talked to anybody like a store caplin realized it's not on the FBI does is on the White House who gets interviewed and what's gets discussed are they called the review of staying on the bureau which is ridiculous it's one that's so out\nOf bounds and that's this is why I\nOriginally before the second and third allegation came about I didn't want the FBI involved in this because I knew the FBI was going to start getting trashed over it and they shouldn't be uh let's see here in Denver cats Lisa Banks and Michael Brown which the attorneys for foreign\nSaid they would have provided the FBI with their medical records and information pretending to a polygraph exam she took in August they also said they uh would have provided the FBI with eight additional witnesses who they said we're willing to speak with agents but weren't contacted\nThe here's here's the problem even if the FBI were to have taken a look at the polygraph\nAnd talk to the person who administer polygraph and looked at the therapist notes and talk to the therapist and talked to all the people that Christine Ford\nHad mentioned a sexual assault incident from her childhood to that's still not first hand corroboration of the events and that's what they were looking for\nThe only people who could have provided that were people who the FBI\nTalk to you mark judge some of the other individuals who Ford alleges were at that party so you could say they didn't talk to all these different witnesses all those different witnesses would have said forward told us about an assault that took place in the teens when she was in high school and describe the events and all of that\nBut they weren't there they can't actually corroborate her story\n\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty twos the number let me go to Steven in Tampa on line one Steven how are you [noise]\nSo what what are the odds Sarah ... is he getting in or out\nI think there's a pretty good chance the cabin I was going to get confirmed tear it sounds to me like Collins and flake will find their way to yes\nI'm Heidi Heitkamp as a no I again I thought that one could win either way I think mansion would like to get to yes the only way that mansion wouldn't be able to get there is if he were to be the deciding vote there's no way mansions going to be\nA the deciding vote to confirm Kavanaugh so if you all know the FBI\nAgent that the investigation was he the guy was doing the flipping a nightclub shot somebody\nDo what\nYou don't remember the story the the goofy FBI agent that did the flip and the oh no I just I just want to know if he's the guy that conducted investigation or not\nI don't know who conducted I think it was multiple FBI applicant Joe brother ah okay [laughter] [noise] right no no I don't I don't bring or was that guy uh\nBut but I I think there's a there's a pretty solid chance that he gets confirmed at the moment although we are still waiting for more definitive word from columns and flake and we we haven't heard from a\nA Murkowski it'll Murkowski is a tough one\nBecause you know if you if you have taken a look at any of the state politics in Alaska and some of the groups there who are really lobbying Murkowski hard\nUm that's gonna be a tough one to get\nRepublicans don't necessarily need it though I I think it would be really unfortunate if this wound up being a situation where you needed the vice president to break the tie I'm hoping it doesn't come to that um\nBut it's possible it's also possible Murkowski can be the one who votes no and you could have imagined\nCollins inflatable boat yes and and uh\nAnd it winds up being being fifty two forty boating and Kevin ... gets confirmed with a Democrat or on board there's a lot of ways this thing could play out but it looks like it's certainly going to play out a very quickly over the next\nTwo days let me go to Rick in Palo beach on line to recover you\nHey Ryan how are you good expert adult they're uh they're listening\nTo you since you first came on the radio here and a half the value of that sometimes that good at it but ah most of the fire and said this pretty straight down the middle\nThank you I appreciate that\nThis whole whole Cather all thing in my opinion is a scam from the beginning and if you look at all the evidence starting with a bar in star and hold them back the ladder a or a doctor for getting under current recommended by firing starring role for him and then the\nEvidence I mean there's absolutely zero cooperation from Warren\nYeah that is if this happened\nYeah and I I didn't think I said I said when the FBI investigation was launched that I felt like there was a really good chance towards the end of it we're going to be in the same place we were at the time or were there wasn't gonna be any new information to go off of but I still felt like you know what a will of will have\nGone through a week where there was some due diligence that was done and I thought that Kavanaugh might wind up actually being in a better position than than he was\nAt the time and I think that is the case right now uh I think happened I was in a better position I think at the end of the day this this whole thing that took place with Jeff Flake forcing this this FBI investigation or could have been a a plus\nFor cabin I end up helped him get confirmed I\nI totally agree I think are Democrats so over for their hand on this and ruin miscalculated because if you looked at a at her the man\nI'm you know if you can't remember exactly the party argue gotten home and this is one thing that I really really sticks with Lee is if she didn't last that party sadly just walked out the door like she said she did wouldn't and then she said there should be concerned and they're looking for\nDone um so so that we do know a bowl of water and look up what happened with ... and ... yeah I remember I remember those\nTwo individuals who came forward and said it was them and and I remember that story going nowhere I don't I don't know exactly why it\nIt died out I think it was a a credibility problem but we'll take a look and to see if there's anything there for you\nOkay well thank you so much\nFor the call Linda appreciate it eight hundred nine six nine Ninety\nThree fifty two phone lines are packed

individuals who came forward to men and said that they were the ones I'm set assaulted Christine Blasey Ford not Brett Kavanaugh first of all I think whenever something\nLike that happens you know you always have to take it and look at it a little skeptically like why would you come forward and say hey I was the one that did the sexual assault thirty six years ago a Lindsey Graham dismissed the two men saying that they were incredible so uh that that's one of the\nLatest updates we have and that story kind of died down I think for that exact reason because they weren't credible eight hundred

I thought you kind of touched on it here and there but I never thought you'd completed the whole thought\nWas that I don't ... the Democrat ever really thought they were get Brett Kavanaugh gladly or accusations all they want to do was to get him before the committee and a public forum so they are\nAsking embarrassing questions about drinking and Ralph ing and see if that you get them to lie about something where that would be the disqualification can't have a liar on the bench yeah they try to try to try and that's why he was kind of the faith that at some of the answers because they were trying to trap them\nEither I think that's part of it I I think they were certainly trying to pin him down on some things they felt like he might not tell the truth about and I do think there were a few things that he didn't tell the truth about but I I also think part of the better calculation was if we get for to understand I think they were confident\nThat her compelling testimony would put a cap and not in a really really difficult situation and if you watched the first part of the hearing and\nThat was pretty much what everybody was feeling\nA once once Ford was done and it was like Kavanaugh's in serious trouble here he's got to bring his a game\nAnd it came out swinging and Lindsey Graham came out swinging too and it really turned the tide back in his favor and then again this is something I've said I Know a lot of people disagree with me but I think Jeff Flake doing what he did in the end is going to have wound up helping Brett Kavanaugh\nYeah well I I Walk them I welcome
