F. L. A. dot com just go to the PM Tampa Bay page this was a story I've had for a couple of days and we haven't gotten to an authorization bill\nPassed for the FAA er which would pass the agency would setting minimum seat science requirements for airline flights\nThe five year authorization bill passed by the Senate last week doesn't stipulate any specific size limits because for the FAA to determine seat with and space measurements between seats it's headed to President Trump's desk now after the Senate passed\nThe legislation by in Ninety three to six votes seats size and see which certainly is\nThe ... I mean if you're in that middle ... odd for that yeah if you're in the middle seat and you've got larger individuals on either side of you\nYou're in a rough\nYeah you're you're not going to become for like two and I'm not comfortable on airplanes so there's no help for any of that\nNo and and I it it says here it's it's the with um the space measurement between seats but I'd also like give me a couple of more inches in the leg room for yeah I don't\nDo the exit aisle for the extra a lot of people do the exit out for the extra leg room I don't do that because there's a lot of responsibility that comes along with that and I just want to relax and put my headphones on and take a nap\nI don't worry about saving ... you know I don't need that kind of responsibility every man for himself and go yeah every man woman child for them and let somebody else deal with all the instructions and having to pay attention to what they're supposed to do fly on a not proud to be looking back at the oxygen mask on right\nBut but see I Would have liked for them to have done a more comprehensive bill and I I'm not for overregulation generally I'm very skeptical of regulation\nBut included in this bill should have been in this seems like a no brainer to me hand sanitizer above every trick [laughter]\nRights what what's the biggest issue on planes it's the germs that that's a good point it seems a little unrealistic out that the airlines should be forced out of hand sanitizer available to every passenger at every moment on the flight is that too much to ask\nI think a little bit too much to ask\nI mean I Would love to the hand sanitizer in my purse\nI carry it too but but I just think that something because everything you've touched on the plane is is gross and and dirty and you know not cleaning those planes so we know that\nTook care of your at any and you got kids running around yeah but that for him I mean we're paying for\nYour bags these days you know at least they could do without some hand sanitizer on the flight for us and then I also think there should have been part of the bill to this has been my other big thing\nAnd there's absolutely should have been included people who don't wear shoes\nOr take my shoes off don't fly on planes I'm Sorry all back on that line if if you're gonna wear\nSandals or something at least keep the sandals on the entire time or I don't we we don't need your feet\nUp at trade level ... barefoot I don't think so\nI've seen people walk down the aisle to the bathroom there yeah out of the most disgusting thing that should\nBe a federal offense a federal offense with jail time included yup uh also I look I think this is probably going a little bit too far but if I were putting together this bill I Would have been cleared the amount of perfume or body spray somebody can where that\nShip potentially be regulated because the last thing on earth do you want to do is is ... sit in between two people who\nGot married to write it on I mean somebody it's can be suffocating I'm surprised you don't want to regulate the number of baby well that was that you didn't let me guess you're kind of jump ahead to my fourth point ah yeah and they are interested in screaming children there should be some kind of regulation in there for screaming children\nOr you're not going to ban them but I ... I Would find some kind of way to regulate them it than\nThey are really two parts is like a one a in a one be if the screaming kids one day and then it's the kids to kick the back of the cedar constantly you know\nThat's the worst I think uh\n[noise] I don't know I don't like him yeah and they the ...\nMaybe it should just be a one a in both should be included I Would say yeah you know when I kind of agree with you because the screaming kids you can get the noise cancellation headphones and you can potentially drowned them out although it depends how noxious they are but they're kicking the seat you know constantly hit in the back of the seat that's something that\nThat could really you can't get sleep when that's happening so they can't uh they're they're just a couple of ideas I mean it it it's nice that they're looking at the minimum seat size requirements but this is the problem with Congress they they don't do a full\nAnd complete and throughout brands of not comprehensive enough for me more I Wanna just a\nFew more simple I mean the hand sanitizer and people with bare feet that doesn't seem like something that couldn't be included yes ...\nDeodorant mandate a I was just told that that's another complimentary snap\nAnd that's what I'm going for yeah but then you get into like a I I don't even know how the new peanuts on the flights I mean they don't they ... it's pretty much completely I think my parents don't do it gets very it and then people have the gluten and all of that and they're on their begins its ban them tell it's two cuts all too complicated\nAh American Spectator contributing editor Jeffrey Lord coming up next year on PM tamp news\nRadio ... seventies ballet [noise] and so when you went to the Clearwater [noise]\nI'm White House ceremony I leave seller Sarah Fox news his work in the high court it's already be gone but President Trump held a ceremony at the White House was Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh Dr Steve rapid board has more live\nOh yeah he was definitely an example John McCain\nCetera ... and and he has been painted as this absolutely wretched I I I mean this is just mind boggling and you know on a personal note I came of\nAge when JFK became president\nAnd he was an inspiration to me I ... I grew up in Massachusetts and that whole inaugural deal of after which can do for your country as ask not what your country can do for us what you can do for your country yeah inspired a whole generation to public service\nAnd now we're seeing that if you if you dare to go into public service they're going to people be people out there who want to absolutely destroy you your family and everything\nAnd you've got going for you in life\nI I think that certainly I think that's certainly a possibility and certainly a part of it but I also think that I I I don't think it needs to it should be overstated because we did have another confirmation process in Neil Gorsuch then went through and it wasn't this crazy so ... was\nNot the deciding I mean in the view of a lot of these people he was not a ... quote unquote deciding vote\nNo but he was American or Lindsey so there was another issue there\nAre wow there's another issue there but as Mitch McConnell's pointed out you've got to go back to Eighteen ...\nYeah I I I don't want to get into that old but but you know what I mean in terms of the left being outraged by the the nomination of Gorsuch in the confirmation I mean that may be dying here had stolen seat so they were just energized about that scene as they were this here's\nHere's the deal right if if the Supreme Court had stuck to the deal that their constitutional role of interpreting the law we wouldn't have these problems but the American left long ago has tried to remake the Supreme Court into an American super legislature one by unelected people\nThat's what causes the problem and they're very concerned they're going to lose that ability I mean look whether it's roe v Wade or any other decision why not go out there persuade the American people and make it the laws of land make roe v Wade a constitutional\nAmendment which requires a lot number of votes in Congress and X number of votes in state legislatures right let the American people decide well have Congress make this stuff up as they go on well I'm from me in court\nEven if we're over you Wade where to get overturned which I'm I still don't necessarily think I a lot of people are focused on how Kavanaugh will vote my focus is on Roberts because I think Roberts becomes the new Kennedy in this equation maybe a little bit more conservative than Kennedy but I still think Roberts is going to play\nA a a swing vote on some crucial issues moving forward but to me he ... the way it is is the concern\nThere is a way to deal with it this is not like going to be a situation where just outlawed everywhere it's going to be up to destabilize dry and so do we in yourself the state legislatures and governors ships that you need to deal with the issue like this is going to be a problem for people in California and New York in Illinois\nA you know in in other areas it's going to be a problem if you are a pro choice but there is a way to deal with it and that is to get people elected\nRyan I Am literally shocked to say this but you and I are in perfect\n[laughter] they they the constitution gives the ways it's just sometimes it's more difficult to people online in that\nAnd that's and that I mean I don't I mean we use roe versus Wade but good lord it could be you know raising insurance rates they could be anything well and even on a lot of the regulatory majority of your fellow citizens that this is a good cause you know and get them to vote for it\nAnd even on a lot of the regulatory issues if you look at what the real problem is as they get shot down in the courts sometimes it's because of how they were written\nYou know that they are a lot of times it's how the law is written so there are ways to to get what you want it's just through a more difficult process called legislating the nobody seems to want to do anymore\nAnd the one thing run is when you do it that way the laws accepted why why does why this Great Britain and not have all these problems with abortion where abortion is ... ... the answer is it was passed by parliament\nRight well they are concerned I wouldn't say it's always accepted Obamacare was passed with you know a over the B a was kind of jammed through jam through but you still had yeah I mean you're still talking about more than than a a a basic majority and and it won't hand side of the way\nPeople dealt with it was to vote against a ... ten and twenty fourteen in terms of MIT terms and given control of Congress back to Republicans that's the way to do this completely agree you know I mean this is this is so on democratic small D I mean it is very scary\nContributing editor at the American spectator Jeffrey Lord joining us on piano Tampa Bay right now you can find him on Twitter real Jeffrey Lawrence so let me go back to something I brought up a moment ago is I Want to get your thoughts your somebody who watches the core closely do you agree see I I think again there's there's a lot of focus on Kavanaugh because he's replacing Kennedy\nBut the two most important members of the court now to me are Roberts and Kagan\nI think Roberts becomes the new Kennedy more of a swing vote on certain issues we saw that with the Obamacare boats\nAnd based on what Kagan is has said recently I think she's going to work with Roberts to build a consensus where they cancelled the court isn't viewed as so partisan it seems like those two in particular recognize the legitimacy hit the court has taken the past few years\nI you know I I got to tell you and I I have absolutely no idea you know and let let me go way back in history long before any of us were around Theodore Roosevelt appointed I think it was Oliver Wendell Holmes\nTo the Supreme Court thinking that he he agreed with him on important issues and and the Oliver Wendell Holmes got there and went against Teddy Roosevelt and some key issue [laughter]\nWe we have seen it quite a few times on the court where people were appointed can write and living in a\nRow so that was just beyond belief I mean he was furious\nThat kind of temper my point is that really getting getting Roosevelt to get a little uh he can get a little frustrated ... times right that who can't I'm Sorry I said he Roosevelt he can get like down a little bit yeah [laughter] I'm not I'm not the bully pulpit and all that yeah but\nBut my my point is is that once anybody gets appointed to the Supreme Court there and then on their own\nYou know they're not going anywhere\nAnd they could go on any of a thousand directions I mean Richard Nixon too was dying day defended you know go to a ticket to the court was poor Harry as in Port Harry black men whom he appointed to the Supreme Court because he had a uh been partly responsible for the wedding\nAnd and Nixon felt it was unfair that this was not is\nAnd that's after two of his choices were voted down were rejected\nYeah well that's right I I was a dot to date myself I was in college in the day ... those were furious fights they rejected climate hey it's worth from South Carolina and then when Nixon was so mad he nominated as somebody from Florida Carswell\nA yes or a judge held Carswell and he was rejected and Nixon was so furious and and this was clever on next to this party came out and said well it's a parrot that that the Senate will not approve a southerner for the court so we went to Minnesota\nAnd nominated a hairy black man who was a a friend of a chief justice Warren Burger also from Minnesota well the the the big about they will nominate anybody from the south you know you got to to two years later in Nixon's running for election or the higher levels [laughter]\nHow things change so quickly we're talking a contributing editor at the American spectator Jeffrey Lord\nAny chance the two sides can agree to bring back the filibuster should day when it comes to the Supreme Court nominees huh I don't\nKnow that's a very very good question Ryan I I I I I have never been in favor of that filibuster thing to begin with\nA but a ... Democrats abandoned at their peril and now they offer you exactly what I mean to cut to the chase here the reason the reason that I'm\nBrett Kavanaugh is on the court is because Harry Reid\nYeah I I mean let's go to\nYeah yeah that's right I mean well the Harry Reid thought he was being cute and clever by doing this\nAnd you know as people tried to tell them at the time if you do this Republicans if they win will do the same thing and you'll regret it well that's exactly what's happened uh but I mean I I'm just one of these people would think the United States Senate is built on the principle of a hundred Senate or you know\nTo for each state and and it requires a majority I eat fifty one votes and that should just be it\nI think on some of these bigger things to me the sixty vote threshold where there has to be a little bipartisanship isn't necessarily a bad thing um but I don't see either party bringing the filibuster back they're going to use it to their advantage where they can't final thing um I think this whole Kavanaugh issues going to energize\nNews I'm rich Dennison President Trump tonight apologizing to Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and his family for the often contentious confirmation process\nSo's who stepped forward to serve our country deserves a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nAnd I had been accused of sexual misconduct in the eighties by several women claims he denies earlier today President Trump was in Orlando speaking to a meeting of international chiefs of police there he urged Florida residents to take all precautions necessary as hurricane Michael approaches was landfall expected on the state's panhandle Wednesday\nAnd we urge all residents to be prepared and to heed local officials\nStates of emergency urban issues in parts of Florida and Alabama was some evacuations\nAlready under way this is Fox News [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nEven rape may apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier so Oscar fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with aids lists male Macs a patent pending formula within a greeting if that helps boost your total testosterone promoting greater increases and muscle size and twice\nThe reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide\nUses mayor or terrifying attraction one location designed just to get\nThis audio is for your review for broadcast Internet posting or distribution of other ... copy of the air quality original and as a property by our media Washington DC\nOptimal hills introducing new Medicaid claims in Virginia and helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more in line to go family care dot com that's go family cared dot com or call a three three four six seven eight to five nine for Medicaid plans from optimal health\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute of maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician severe of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call a\nMosque care from the odd about hearing aids studios Ninety six seven F ... went up to nine ... nine Seventy WFL a all over the Tampa Bay in Tampa\nBay on this Monday October eighth I'm your host Ryan\nDoormen and joining me on a hard line right now for our weekly looked at Florida politics we a publisher of Florida politics dot com Peter ... you can follow on Twitter at Peter ... Peter how are you\nI'm good just I'm waiting to see what the song does here\nOh yeah so so let's start with the October surprise that nobody saw coming a major\nHurricane this is you know a serious life threatening situation for the panhandle but for the purpose of this segment let's talk about how it could impact the big state races so far we've seen Governor Scott senator Nelson and Andrew Gillum suspend their campaigns what about dissent is\nYou know I don't know if they're actually um if they're if they'd gone that far yet this I haven't seen that from a Santas this campaign yet um\nI think that they were all it was a little odd yesterday on Sunday the way each candidate was shocking to see who was going to suspend who was going to cancel event that you know I I I think there there was still a fundraiser\nThis morning in Key West\nFor Andrew Gillum so he had not fully suspended he had left Chris King down there to handle it um and now we've gone to the point where Andrew Gillum and filling out sandbags yeah in Tallahassee and so he's there uh the Santa\nYou know got out in front of it I think it was every Sunday at eleven and said that he was asking his panhandle volunteers and supporters to focus on their communities but he came short of suspending his campaign\nAnd this is gonna be an interesting situation to follow it seems like a situation that could benefit Scott and Gillum mainly because they're going to be front and center as governor and mayor of the city most likely to be impacted by the storm a and they're also going to have to put politics aside and work together you would think\nI mean it's going to be such an interesting juxtaposition in about thirty six hour when after eight I'm eighty see you're going to have Gillum and\nAnd Scott both in their blue work shirts and probably a baseball cap on right I'm standing next to each other it would probably be the last image we would have expected a twenty eight days out from the election\nAnd how important is it for both of them to show that they have a handle\nOn the situation I'm sure this is something that that has been discussed a into campaigns you know regardless the these are people who are going to want to do a good job for their constituents but but again we're right in the middle of a a midterm election here with a less than a month ago before election day\nWell I mean this stuff matters I mean we think about how Chris Christie embraced I'm Brock Obama and it was the right thing to do for a state but it probably around his presidential ambitions um I don't know if we're going to have backed Rand of a of a of a moment here uh with Michael but\nYou know I think Rick Scott all he has to do with kind of what he's always done which is\nKind of over prepare yeah or hurricane declared a state of emergency a couple of days out when these guys are still blue and tell people you know stock up et cetera et cetera and you know it's going to be\nAnd check on the nursing homes jak on the nursing homes\nChecking on the nursing homes have you got to you about your cell phone number ... make sure you answer it um it reminds me of jet in two\nThousand and four um when he\nAsked me he was basically a able you know you're able to lock out uh your opponent when there was the ... the succession of hurricanes I think there was over and over the five or six weeks or it basically locked or John Kerry out of Florida and and certainly helped his brother that that wasn't his goal but that was the end result of it\nIllinois on the other hand had little proving to do I think that's why he's\nProbably um it was interesting\nI'm not on the local Tallahassee media list\nBut now I'm getting the updates from the city of Tallahassee on what Andrew Gillum is doing the first time I've ever got that as a reporter and it's because I think Gillum because of its history in a few years ago the kind of underperforming during a hurricane is overly sensitive\nTo um to the perception that he uh is not prepared to lead the state there were a storm\nYeah he's getting hammered for his response to hurricane her mean it certainly did he think this could help him put the brakes on that criticism and also we've seen this ant is kind of made me pull a little bit a closer recently of the polling trend is correct could this potentially put the brakes on that\nAs well because now you're going to have Gillum front and center getting more airtime probably been he's gotten in a in quite a while during this campaign but\nIt is it's going to you know in the end result will be that it will hurt on to Santa just slightly um it is going to stall out the momentum like the score um uh out in the Gulf he's going to stall out here just when you get thirty\nUh to get going he really can't he really can't say anything critical of Gillum uh at this point you know there's called Mozart\nTo take down negative that Charlie Crist came in for Andrew Gillum yesterday and fall and asked Ron Santa fall down in TV ads Gillum had old down as television ads but you know just stamped is has a highly effective TV ad that is critical of Gillum a performance during\nHurricane her mind and they don't want to take that that um they know it's effective and the girl and people know it's it's it's hurting people and so I think they're kind of hesitant to take away to unilaterally disarm at this point\nI've ever had on top of my pillow itself now it has three layer design one is my pillow phone for their support for institutional fall to help relieve pressure points and also the ultra saw

painted nails are top story at six hurricane Michael is now a major category three with one hundred twenty miles per hour winds gusting to one fifty has it's slowly approaches the Florida Panhandle Governor Scott continues to warn residents in the path of the storm to get to safety now\nAs a state prepares for hurricane Michael make landfall later this week the emergency declaration which is retroactive to Sunday\nIs going to provide additional federal assistance and resources to Florida\nOr in its preparation and recovery efforts are the measure also includes additional debris removal an emergency protective assistance to several counties they're expected to get hit hardest by the storm you've got Gulf Hamilton Jackson Jefferson Mattis\nAre all going to get a get hit pretty hard once hurricane Michael er makes its way to the pan handle the department of homeland security and female we'll coordinate response efforts a Governor Scott ... earlier activated the state's own emergency response warn that the impending hurricane\nAnd it's expected storm surge could be life threatening for residents in certain parts of the states ... this this was\nYou know when you have a a major hurricane like this making its way towards landfall rarely do you get a light hearted funny story to come out of that\nBut this I think is one of those are the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office pokes fun at Weather Channel meteorologist Jim can't tore by issuing a fake trespassing\nNotice it said quote\nEveryone knows what's in store when Jim can't tore shows up so we still do issued a little notice they put this on Facebook\nCan't tore he's wherever he goes that's where the worst of the storm is so uh the the fake notice says that a non business related visits only for a gym can tore and that winter month visits are preferred\nSo I'm pretty pretty amusing post there by the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office telling gym can toy please don't come to this area in far away they are way I'm also there's a bit of an issue going on right now with voter registration here in Florida\nIt it is a today's the last day for you to register to vote you have until eleven fifty nine pm tonight to register online um but\nThe question is in areas affected by hurricane Michael ... what do you do do you extend the voter registration period and that the secretary of state's said that um he put out a new directive\nThat\nBasically gives individual county elections supervisors a heads up that if they plan to close tomorrow to notify the state and if they can work with them on that aspect\nOf all of this um bought\nThe Florida Democratic Party announced this morning its filing a last minute legal complaints in an attempt to get to stay to extend the registration deadline until October sixteenth so it'd be a week from today it'd be it'd be a week extension\nI I I don't know why that is an issue I mean if you've got a hurricane that's about to hit the state to me in all the major counties affected across the panhandle and and probably north of the citrus county\nUh area they should all give them a week extension who cares you know give them a little extra\nTime life had such a big deal I don't I don't know why that would be a a big issue only because the last thing you need those people worried about it focused on his\nPrimary but trying to do in trying to evaluate in yeah merging the preparation\nUh so I I Will have to see how that all plays out but to me again you know for here in Hillsborough County doesn't need to be extent\nI see there is a governor there is senator Nelson up there and we know run to Santa is down here in Tampa Bay area today uh what is that dynamic like\nWell let's see senator Nelson was in Tallahassee today the emergency operations center okay I'm In their Gillum has been active he's been going out doing a lot of public events like filling sandbags checking out on hospital power that's\nAs far as the governor he's been doing is gloom and doom mature and this is just I I hate to look at this in political you know fashion but that's the way it is\nHe has been able to use the bully pulpit to the governor's office and he's been doing this little tour around the panhandle holding press conferences in East Point\nIn Pensacola in Panama City in Tallahassee and he has been getting plenty of time so this has been a real good for his Senate campaign Charlotte you know most people would tell you it's rather insensitive or ... you mentioned that you would never dare to politicize hurricanes ... points for race but\nYou know life you know just life has given them an opportunity and advantage\nExactly this is you know you're in the middle of the midterm racier this all plays a role I mean this is a moment for for Andrew Gillum Jews getting pounded on the airwaves about how he's handled past hurricanes in the city of Tallahassee\nIt's a chance for him to show that he can handle a this one which is likely going to be worse than the previous ones that he's dealt with so\nUh you know there there is some of that dynamic at play and I was just curious to see who was where up there as the storm approaches and then of course after\nThe storm passes or I'm sure there will be a a lot of work to be done and you'll see all the leaders like Governor Scott like mayor Gillum and like Senator Nelson up there are trying to do what they can\nThis and it will be interesting to see how this affects the dynamics of the vote you know as you mentioned the Republicans have really been hammering Gillum on this whole hurricane thing but you know as one of the people who lived through that\nI got to tell you a lot of those criticisms are unfair yeah and they came from say came from Republican operatives of people who started complaining most about Tallahassee not having power well it started with one person who was not even in Tallahassee she was over at a rental you go to Mexico beach\nAnd was certainly a tweet after tweet after ... criticizing the city\nAnd I had my power back on and two days most of the city was restored three and a half days we did better than most state recovery\nFrom that but still it was one of you know as long as you can make that\nClaim as you can throw that much water then\nYou have to respond and and and one thing to keep an eye on two is how how senator Nelson and\nAnd run to stances are affected by all of this in particular because uh they're the two that are kind of sidelined here I mean Governor Scott in in mayor Gillum have serious work to do I mean they they have serious jobs to do right now in terms of getting they're getting the state and getting the city of Tallahassee prepare for this massive hurricane\nOr the other two senator Nelson and especially round as soon as there's really not a lot they can do a in terms of helping or assisting a little bit here and there so it kinda puts them on the sidelines here in in a crucial point in the mid term race\nSo absolutely ... it and frankly this also gives the governor and their element to it or they're on it and say oh I'm doing the work is more important than politics so just just take a hike out and uh that's that's a really good advantage with what is it for weeks left\nRight watching yeah it's it's a out of nowhere a mother nature October surprise that kind of a crept up on the state of Florida

Haley's replacement will be announced in the coming weeks [noise]\nThis is Fox News\nFrom the odd about hearing aids studios Ninety six seven FM Pashto went up to nine ... nine Seventy telling you lay all over in Tampa Bay\nDM Tampa Bay on Tuesday October nine some your host Ryan Gorman and joining me on the hotline right now we have Weather Channel meteorologist mark given over you can follow on Twitter and teen WC\nMark T. H. I. B. mark how are you I'm doing good my friend how're you doing good thank you so much for joining us to talk about hurricane Michael let's start with the five PM advisory what stood out to you about that\nWell we definitely saw some changes at five o'clock and not for the better I became a category three hurricane which is a designated as a major hurricane\nWinds jumped up to a hundred and twenty miles an hour and I keep in mind that not through the whole hurricane yeah but the maximum sustained winds near the center a hundred and twenty miles an hour mainly north and east of the center of the pressure took another drop it went down to nine hundred and fifty seven ... twenty eight point to six inches which for those who knew that ah\nHave a home parameter in your house let's just say they barely go that low or most of them go down to about twenty five and that's a cut off so uh it's a deep strong hurricane\nAnd it may not be done strengthening yeah looking at the latest uh go sixteenth satellite water vapor imagery of a lot of really nice toys available to us today to watch these storms and it looks to me like it is still\nA gaining a little more steam it's possible to get up to one twenty five or perhaps before it makes landfall expected to make landfall at some point later my afternoon near Panama City\nAnd then it went up through a north Florida maybe passing by to the west of Tallahassee there could be some major impacts there with a hurricane force wind gusts maybe Seventy to eighty miles an hour and a big win storm for Georgia central and south Georgia in the Carolinas over on Wednesday and Thursday\nSo because of this speed that this storm is moving at it's unlikely for it to strengthen all the way to a category for at this point right\n[noise] I Would not say that's totally off the table to for without get up to one thirty yeah\nAnd you know we're not far from that now so or whether it makes landfall is one twenty five one twenty even one Fifteen or one thirty how the impacts are going to be\nSure uh right now the forecast this rap electrical a beta have possibly a nine foot storm surge in some places which is addicts playing out storm surge works\nBasically bring the water level up nine feet or from where you're standing so that's about ... you know one and a half times the two time Cy to most people and\nThen you put the battering waves and wins on top of that so it this is a very very dangerous and it's a fast moving hurricane to\nKind of like hurricane Oprah was in Nineteen Ninety five so once it makes landfall it will weaken as they always do going over the over the continental United States but the problem is it's going to weaken a little slower than it normally wouldn't because it's not going to have as much time to just sort of run up overland mhm and spend down in\nFact I think it might actually increase in forward speed there's a there's a trough low pressure wrestling over the southern plains right now that is what's causing all the weather if weather from Minnesota to Texas today fits in tornado warnings out there a lot of people have not been talking about those we had severe weather in the high plains down into parts of Texas but\nThat frontal system that trough as what's going to pick this hurricane up and push it up across the Carolinas and south Georgia a running into Windsor so the weather pattern is really going to be crazy over the next twenty four hours at the mitten upper level so the atmosphere with us from coming in as hurricane coming in\nAnd once that front moves in and picks up this hurricane is possible we could be looking at a forward storm motion of the hurricane Fifteen miles an hour somewhere in that and that's why we think there could be a big win damage potential\nUp the road a little bit up Seventy five for places like maybe live oak a north of us the way it looks and up in the south Georgia they'll Dazs to make in places like that up towards out of the ... of South Carolina places like Colombia could be looking at tropical storm force winds without the potential for maybe even in South Georgia to see some inland hurricane force wind gusts so\nAll off guard it's a it's a real shame for those in the panhandle Weather Channel meteorologist mark timid oh you can follow on Twitter AT T W see mark th I be marked we appreciate the time thank you so much they keep me safe thanks are you to be safe as well uh and and hopefully everybody up in the panhandle is taking the proper precautions we've been through this with ...\nUh we just did all that coverage for for the Carolinas with Hurricane Florence and this storm could potentially be stronger once it hits land in both\nOf those ah hurricanes let me go to the fall on real quick ban in Tampa joins us on line one Ben how are you\n... yeah there's one one particular thing about this storm that people need to be aware of that storm is going to disrupt gas shipments to Tampa Bay times because the tanker we damage\nRefuel from Galveston and Biloxi from the oil refineries they're bringing the gas I used to haul fuel for a living okay up several years and\nThe terminals get about a tank or a day from a from Galveston over in ... when the state like that out there in the Gulf they're not they're not gonna be able to bring the barges over\nRight right with the ... it's kind of sitting right in the way right now\nJak their gas tank and they can serve what they've got a couple of days yeah because we can be looking at a gas shortage um bought because people were evacuated shark goes to Charles may run out of fuel\nGood adds up from Ben Ben we appreciate the call thank you so much yeah eight hundred nine six\nNine Ninety three fifty two is the number are coming up next now that we've got your caught up on hurricane Michael will shift gears and talk about Taylor Swift and Kanye West because why not of course if you haven't heard about those two stories yet we'll fill you in a moment here on PM Tampa's dot\nCom thick team can date from ... am to hear your next chance to win a thousand bucks hunting at that fix passed the top of the hour nine Seventy WFL\nInformation and discussion for Tampa Bay nine Seventy to the west LA is alive and mobile now more with Brian Gorman fun ... bay it's\nTwenty eight teams who of course when we get into the political discussions now [noise]\nTaylor Swift Kanye West in Riyadh are involved [noise]\nHow it is these days [laughter] hey\nLiking me entertained\nBeing Tampa Bay on your host Ryan Gorman with me my producers Morgan lash and James Berlin or the phone number is eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two so Taylor Swift uh over the weekends broke her\nCareer long silence on politics I mean she was one of the biggest stars in the world now for a long\nTime and it's never really commented on policies seem so quiet and\nThere was one minor post awhile ago during march for our lives that she put out and that was about it otherwise she stayed out of it she did the Michael Jordan you know Republicans buy shoes to I'm not commenting on this stuff meanwhile other stores like Katy Perry Lady Gaga you know beyond say Barry Barry involved\nVery vocal about their opinion very political or\nUm but she broke her silence on Sunday to endorse former Democratic Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen over representative Marsha Blackburn in the states Senate race\nIn an Instagram post ah she wrote that black burns voting record opposing terrifies her she said quote\nAs much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office I cannot support Marsha Blackburn I Will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for house of representatives or the British and Blackburn race according to cook Political Report a toss up\nThat that's going to a that race is going to replace Bob Corker who's retiring\nThere's some recent polls that show black burn with a couple of percentage point lead anywhere between potentially five and eight points so uh it it could be moving more towards the Republicans as in the past\nCouple of weeks but it's still a pretty close race\nSwift also listed her stance on a couple of different issues including support for el GB T cure rights and condemning racism she said quote I always have\nAnd always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I Believe we all deserve in this country I Believe in the fight for el ... rights and in any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is wrong\nI Believe the systemic racism we see in this country towards people of color is terrifying sickening and prevalent I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity of all Americans no matter their skin color or gender or who they love so afford not not just a political statement from Taylor Swift but a forceful one\nThat I laid it all out there a\nTurning point usa founder and president Charlie Kirk somebody who I really don't talk about much ... because I don't think they're all that important a in a broader political discussion in this country a said hey tell us right before you endorse a candidate maybe you should learn something about the candidates\nYou have no idea what you're talking about Marcia strong woman who will be the next US Senator from Tennessee hey maybe she does know what she's talking about you just disagrees with you\nWhen people act like celebrities aren't entitled opinions about\nThings I mean I doubt I I highly doubt Taylor Swift did this without examining\nAll angles of it that ... oh yeah I can assure you look at over\nRight a ... and look\nYou know there are some people are going to like this and I get that for for me when it comes to celebrities and musician speaking out I don't care as long as like Taylor is not doing it on stage during a concert that\nI paid money to watch her ... if she's doing it on her own time on her Instagram pages Twitter I don't care that that doesn't bother me\nThe problem I've had is when people like Jimmy Kimble I go to his show\nTo be entertained and to laugh that's what it shows all about and it becomes an advocate on TV that annoys me\nI don't care if You're Joking about things I don't care if all your jokes are about President Trump if they're funny and you're not crossing a certain line into advocacy that's fine to me okay I don't care if all your jokes are about Hillary Clinton as long as you're not advocating something during\nAn event or a show where you're technically supposed to be doing something else that's fine okay but but if she were to go on stage in the middle of the concert and do a monologue\nAbout how you shouldn't vote for Marsha Blackburn you should vote for Brett is and I would have a problem with that this I don't have a problem with uh the president had such a great comments about this\nPresident Trump said yesterday he likes Taylor Swift music\nTwenty five percent less after her endorsement of a Democrat in Tennessee Senate race how great is that it's only five years that I just want to know what went into that thinking how we came to that figure\nHe's highly that they said let's say that I like tell us was music about twenty five percent less now okay [laughter] that is so\nGreat to put an exact figure on it or we're not going to get to this uh innocent man when we come back I'll tell you how her Instagram post has affected things she's had a direct effect in terms of voter registration also we have to get to a another musician who's telling people to get out to vote and\nKanye West taking a trip to the White House or to be a fly on the wall\nIn that many Eighteen without a lot it Kanye West Jared Kushner and President Trump I Would ... if they put\nThat on pay per view for like Nineteen Ninety nine just to watch the meeting I Would totally by it may be right that it would be absolutely worth it will get to those stories and the resignation of Nikki Haley it's all on the way in a moment here on PM Tampa Bay\nNews radio knives seventies WFL eight times when you went to the two Clearwater [noise]\nAnd\nThat played the biggest role if any thing in their decision ... campaign and what you're saying Taylor Swift I think here is basically the same thing\nTargeted audience is not you know older uh\nAmericans who lean more Republican and conservative her target audience people forget or women in their twenties and I would say probably early thirties not even so much in their teams at this point because she's\nKinda aged out of that a little bit you're more than you're you're white in Taylor Swift we'll have\n... twenty four I feel like that is her primary age demographic ... twenty four to probably thirty four she's been around for a little while ... kind of like watched her grow up right from the country up to now yep\nSo you could have some people in their early thirties who were started ... you know a couple of years ago when they were spending a lot of time with music and are big fans of her still I mean if you go to a tell us what's concert you're going to see\nA a lot of again younger women some parents there with the younger kids yes but that's not really the driver of the Taylor Swift\nBrand I think it's closer to my age then right\nSo you're talking about mid twenties woman in this country you're talking about more of a liberal leaning\nDemographic yeah thanks so this again this is nothing shocking ... rising up and it was just more that she had stayed silent for so long and all of a sudden now like decided hey I'm Out about\nThat but everything is political these days politics seeps into every aspect of our life and and you know these\nIt's becoming harder and harder for people like Taylor Swift and and companies to to sit on the sidelines it's just not as possible anymore so I guess she felt she had to weigh in and\nAnd I'm sure look I'm I'm not saying she doesn't believe what you're saying I think that's part of it too I think she genuinely believes what she's saying I don't think she would just you know back a Democrats and attack Republican just to do it for for financial reasons but I think it all plays into the decision to go public\nAh Riad or another musicians saying that it's time to a registered to vote she uh encouraged her fans to do that because today of course is the last\nDay to register to vote in a lot of states across the country including here in Florida you've gotten till eleven fifty nine pm tonight to register if you're not already registered re on a road to her Instagram a following of sixty five million who was awake this morning and who is what\nShe said today is a crucial day the last day in fourteen states to register to vote you have one job today and that is to properly register to vote so re honor [noise]\nFell and people get on it [noise]\nI I I like it when [noise]\nCelebrities push the registered to vote push the get out and vote and I especially like it\nWhen they do it in a non partisan when they're just telling people like I don't care how you're going to vote just go out there and being engaged in the process\nIs really important I think it really does make a difference sales down\nNow somebody who is certainly taking aside these days I wouldn't I wouldn't call him non partisan a\nHe's there to visit the White House this Thursday to have lunch with President Trump and meet Jared Kushner where he said to discuss\nThe manufacturing resurgence in America which I'm sure there and watched as many thoughts on the resurgence of manufacturing across the country that seems like it's in Kanye West we'll houses\nSo bizarre lately and like I Can't even ran out around\nThat he's a he's also got to talk about how to prevent gang violence and what can be done to reduce violence in Chicago which is an important issue ... courses from uh Chicago so that that might be an issue he knows something about um that of course his wife\n... visited the White House and a couple of occasions this year and really did influence the administration on clemency in prison reform\nAnd and made some positive developments and I thought\nI laughed and now\nWe we did we we laugh about it we made fun of it but some some positive came out of her meeting with the president look if Kanye West can go in there\nAnd and came crashing can go talk to the president especially about prison reform and criminal justice reform it it is kind of amazing the dad issue which has so much bipartisanship you've got Kamala Harris and Rand Paul working together on this I mean you could not get\nA two people on a more opposite sides of the political spectrum they're working together on that issue that seems like something far ahead of of immigration or other major issues that are front and center these days criminal justice reform prisoner formed things like that\nThat's an issue you would think the party to come together on and get something done you've got a lot of people from both sides already working together I think if if I were the president and and Republicans and Democrats no matter how the mid term shake out\nThat would be a leading issue for me in twenty Nineteen because I think that wouldn't be one where you can come together bring both sides together and do something bipartisan after and what's what's been and is likely to continue to be a very contentious\nA ... I Can't take any more Kanye West of mid term race so are we will certainly see what comes out of ... meeting with the president if he wears the make America great again hat like you were on Saturday Night live some\nVery very supportive of the price of ten years ago can you imagine saying ... are going to the White House to meet with President Trump ... well like you have an email ... time\nNo I could see you saying that that came crashing and Kanye West are going to the White House to meet the president\nBecause celebrities ... I mean a lot of them went in and hung out with Obama and the difference here is that they're going to talk policy\nThat that's the difference I mean are being taken seriously\nThey are and and actually and in at least ... case getting things done right it's amazing eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number coming up next we'll talk about Nikki Haley's resignation
