[laughter]\nThat guy that I'm I'm gonna I'm just going to quote the a ... with us I don't believe the crop you see from these people the fake news what you're saying and what you're reading if not what\nHalf that none of the quote I can stand in the middle of this as an avenue and shoot somebody and wouldn't lose any voter right that's President Trump\nYes that is President Trump that is something that is a pervasive in a lot of what I'm hearing from some of the call and the thing is is that the there was a gentleman to recall as it goes and he he's a described it\nPerfectly ... the person that forward persons that have been committing or have said these ... these are terrible yup\nAnd the thing is is that we are here questioning whether it looked like it is fake or what ever oh curses ... what they're planning on trying to\nDo is to feel some sort of fear and the thing is if that if there were bombs or something like that that was sent to let's say Paul Ryan Kevin McCarthy Mitch McConnell or Trump Donald\nTrump there there there was a rise out there have been sent to the drums before and it was caught lately outrageous\nExactly but I'm just saying the level of what we're hearing people talking about false flag and people not taking this\nSeriously it's just a hey I all I Would tell people to do is if they haven't read the book in high school reading Nineteen eighty four because if they only applicable to like what we're dealing with some people are both ...\nBoth to just believing a coke with purple do just\nWhat he says yeah and it was really well and I think it would\nCut it it was rich at Wisconsin I'm a rally that he was blaming above the level of of a\nRhetoric and and this course negative this course yeah he is the one that is the one that has the list of the majority of\nAdam ... with a girl I appreciate it as always thank you uh look I I think you're going to find people not just\nTrump supporters ... there are people on the left who are all about the cause okay and you can't move them off their positions even an inch so this issue in terms of this this idea that there's a whole doubt there when you get to the extremes on both sides\nThat's exactly what you see but it's not just on on one side uh let me give you a little bit of breaking news here the Seuss or on CNN or the NYPD is responding to reports of a suspicious package at\nShops at time ... at the time Warner center\nWhere CNN is located\nUh we don't know much more than that at the moment um but there could potentially be another a package at the time Warner center where CNN is located so we'll keep an eye on that story as\nIt develops it looks like there's still a lot of people kinda\nMilling around ... or doesn't look like there's been some kind of a mass evacuation just yet but authorities did warn that there could potentially be more of these packages out there\nOr somewhere in the mail system so this this is a worry\nA of authorities and we'll just have to see if this is another instance that is connected to the other uh packages that had been sent out or if this is something different and now it does look like the there are quite a few people outside of Time Warner center so again will monitor that breaking news as the uh\nComes into us You're on PM Tampa Bay eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number I got to get to the ah give it a toy will debate that took place last night between Gillum and dissent as he was very heated or we will get some phone calls on it a play you some audio of the most heated moments and\nI have a couple of other reports on both to Santa's Gillum that I Want to get too so we'll get to that next on PM Tim [noise]\nRadio ... seventies WFL aged ... to clear water\nAnd for people with preexisting conditions I spent a lot of time on health care and that issue as\nThose bills are being worked on in Congress and\nI can tell you the answer made no sense dissent has also said he'll stand by people with preexisting conditions\nBut a plan to do that's nowhere to be about I looked at the plan that he talked about on his website it was a couple of paragraphs no specifics on immigration there was really testy back and forth up at the same as I thought went too far by claiming Gillum wouldn't let\nIllegal immigrant child molesters roam the streets after serving their jail time Gillum had\nStrong response or didn't they wind up going back and forth about corruption that came up again and I thought the stance is one that exchange whenever the corruption issue came up this and this one the exchange last night\nOn the racial issues this is where things got the most heated the moderator asked about bats conference that's\n... that's a while back the question was it was about Horowitz the organizer of of that conference the question was\nAh this country's only serious race war he's against whites the moderators quoting Horwitz\nBlacks are oppressed and America why isn't there a black exodus Santas and set in the past about Horwitz and his conference an organization that he's been admirer of it all so that's why this question was coming up\nThis Santas jumped in with McCarthyism accusations before the question\nWas even finished and then this was how\nA dissent is\nThis was how he responded to take a listen here's Mike as always hear that even made those statements then I guess he had sort of the first thing was made a mess I mean how how am I supposed to know every single saving money and\nSo then he went on to to\nTalk more about the whole situation I think for people who liked to Santas for Trump supporters you're going to love that it was very reminiscent to me of of Kavanaugh at a second hearing during his opening statement\nAnd in some of the changes he had\nWith with democratic members of Congress\nI think for independence ...\nI thought it was a little much I thought I thought he lost it a little bit in that moment um I wasn't surprised I mean if you've if you've followed the Santas I wasn't surprised that was his reaction\nUm look I I think people can disagree about how we respond to some people will love it I wasn't particularly thrilled with it but also I understand his frustration about the entire issue so\nTo me I thought he could have given a solid answer there something along the lines of obviously I don't condone those statements by Mr Horwitz and\nAnd gone down that route and that would have been a better answer than you know the how the hell am I supposed to know and then Gillum responds to all of this with the moment that went viral let me play that for you take a listen to this\nLet me first say my grandmother used to say I have a dog will holler [noise]\n... spoken a first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in this day [noise]\nUh he has spoken at racist conferences he's accepted a contribution and would not return it from someone who referred to the former president of the United states as a Muslim in I. G. G. E. R.\nOr when asked to return that money he said no he's using that money is enough one negative ad now I'm not calling this the dissenters races I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist\nHell on the line a moment that certainly went viral and I thought it was a low blow\nYou think the synthesis of racist and call him a racist just because you've got people who maybe are races out there who supports Sanders doesn't mean that he's a racist\n\nSo to me I I saw why that moment would be be featured moment of the debate it was a drunk driver\nBut I didn't particularly like it\nOr Gillum also responded to accusations by the Santa ... city having a murder problem with and I'm quoting here maybe he wants to reconsider whether he wants to be governor the governor's mansion is in Tallahassee\nI Would hate for you to be hurt\nThat's not cool especially in light of yesterday's events so it was one of those debates and it was a race to the bottom debate and\nI don't think it was going to change many minds what took place\nI think it made for a couple of viral moments for me again as an independent\nI wasn't thrilled with what I saw\nI thought there were a few moments where where in Santa certainly got the veteran Gillum and I thought they were a few moments where Gillum got the better Santas on on the most heated moments I didn't think anybody one eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two let me get a bill in Clearwater on line one bill how are you\nGetting Yes sir thank you for having cameras show um I listen to nine Seventy or every morning every game and I just had a comment about\nHow you were pointed out that ... percent is that not show respect for\nAndrew Gillum as being a a mayor or what not and I I totally understand that you know you want to have mutual respect across all party lines but if anybody actually watch the entire debate until the very end I just wanted to point out one simple thing\nAt the end Andrew Gillum is a walking off the stage and Ron dissenters actually approached them to reach out and give him a simple hands and instead of Andrew Gillum given him a handshake\nDecember little fist bumps and you'll meet as a potential voter looking at both sides of the party is trying to figure out who I'm going to go for I actually had a little disrespect for Andrew Gillum because he's not giving him the respect for the person that he has been throughout his career so\nI think that people can recognize that you should give you know a respective opinion or you know for sauna towards each individual and I think Andrew Gillum kinda lost a little touch with his voter base\nBecause of a fist bump over the handshake\nYes sir\nOkay I I didn't see it uh I I got to be honest with you bill personally I Wish everybody would do the fist bumped because I'm a ... chicken people's hands um but that aside I I guess I understand where you're coming from I don't know it seem ... I Would have to see and I didn't see that moment so I really can't comment on it\nRight or you rather have a fist bumped into and say I mean you're shaken a man saying that ... been doing for hundreds of years the fist bumped is just another way of just saying yeah I don't want to touch her hand I'm a German folk whatever\nNo it's not about that and just wrapping Amanda I'm heading me I'm a I'm a man a but in that instance the eye can see how that could be a a little disrespectful I didn't see it as he enjoyed\nIt yeah exactly if he didn't call him a mayor and he doesn't shake his hand I mean I mean it it could go either way\nYeah I I I think it was pretty clear though that the defense is trying to\nPull something by calling I'm Andrew the whole time I mean it just did it in the previous\nCBS I on veterans presented by their works really\nThere are dozens of veterans running for Congress in this midterm election [noise] some of the more progressive candidates are being indoors find a veteran political organization vote ... while the group is firmly planted on the left side of the political spectrum and only supporting progressive veterans and their bid for office\nBoth Fitz director of government relations will Fischer\nA Marine Corps vet says he expects positives from the vets on both sides of the aisle elected into office particularly when it comes to civility\nAnd he says seems to be missing on Capitol Hill these days I certainly think that they will be able to sit down and have a conversation with each other and respect each other and treat each other with dignity I maybe veteran Eric day from connecting that dot com for CBS News\nTo experience relief or muscle cramps and your legs and feet used their works really fast acting foam get their worst released today and the pain relief violate your local pharmacy or their works relief dot com\n[noise] New Year's traffic and whether hard radios nine Seventy WFL\n\nFrom the praying perfect center power fiber just hitting an error is about four after the ... says you work your way towards the fiftieth street exit on the left side of the roadways and reports of some heavy traffic nowhere to medical reasons though cell phones Seventy five ... has been using up as you approach the ...\nAnd also do major problems on the big bridges a Saturday for the driver crossed our Franklin each wife for more real time traffic updates on your route\nDownload the total ... powered by traffic ...

I don't know\nYou can have that ... game then but certainly there was a little bit more jumping that game wasn't there\nI think that the lightning seem to rise to the level of their opponent as well and it was a great game for one nothing game there was a lot of excitement a lot of entertainment a great goal tend to ending battle as well but both teams kind of exchanged opportunities and momentum\nThe first half the game obviously I thought Colorado with their power play generated a lot of momentum Dave and they were able to get a lot of shots on both\nOver half of them coming on a power play in the first period and then it was a lightning\nHid when they did them in the second period even think they did a really nice job I thought it was on especially defensively\nDisrupting their plan makes play especially that hotline\nNeeds to get in line in their own down so it was a really really exciting to watch I thought and\nSubtly nearer six wanted one three game [noise] personally speaking I thought that was their best [noise]\nSixth of the first date and they pointed at seven in the first aid\nBut I think they're going into Denver which is always tricky because you're an altitude\nAnd that complicates things if you get from long shift [noise] especially when you get long shifts\nEarly in the game in other words where you're supposed to be off the ice and you get stuck out there it can affect you it has a cumulative effect because of the altitude factor it as well to the odds are rolling they had\nArguably the hottest live\nThat cable is the way the lightning handled the second period which can be the trickiest period to execute wind changes 'cause your dad\nIs across the red line from your vantage blading handle that terrifically well and they were the ones who if once he was getting paid back was Colorado and the second period not a lightning so look I Know that it wasn't a game with fifty\nFive shots but I think the way the lady competed in that game the\nWay they manage the puck in that game [noise] how hard they conceded the way that they took away the time and space for that big line which the pocket wind a lot of heavy lifting in that regard [noise]\nEspecially when we first period on [noise]\nSurvive and and it ended want nothing but it wasn't short of excitement from beginning to see what happens tonight in the building that very loud\nVery exciting to plan I think it's a straw and mentioned that this was even though the lightning lost one of the more entertaining ... out on the road last year\nThought even after that game on the road last year that was maybe the most emotion I see from any of the players and talk with them in the locker room even came close in particular obviously to lose in the fashion that they did with just a couple of seconds or two point six\nSomething around that lasted the game I don't think there was a single gold scored an even strength\nUh from what I recall but it was definitely an emotional game and how to play out like atmosphere and every new city is always going to be exciting for teams but as you mentioned intends Rahman said just a lively now and what they've been able to
