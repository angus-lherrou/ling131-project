although there are all important and I'm just not sure people understand\nWhat a Speaker Pelosi means to heartbeat away and you have a woman who says we have to pass the bill to find out what's in it

are off 'cause I don't think Trump supporters of the type of people are going to answer anybody's call for any poll ever I don't I've been on calls me I never get called for a poll\nAnd polls you know I look at them I Know a conventional wisdom is I read real clear politics every day you know Nate Silver as as an eighty five percent Democrats take the house\nUp but I also know that they got it wrong in two thousand for two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and sixteen and not the only did they get it wrong they did it in a colossal spectacular way\nSo I'm just saying to the American people don't be swayed by polls don't be dispirited if you think you can't win assume that you're behind and go out there on the field that's why we play the game and you know sometimes your favorite team wins and sometimes your favorite team loses I didn't particularly enjoy election nights and two thousand and eight\nYeah because you can't tell you cannot complain if you don't vote so go out and

we all need you go\nDo when you know at the end for example we sucked up Obama for eight years it wasn't good for the country will we would suck up a Nancy Pelosi as speaker one more time but I'd

F.\nL. A. dot com just go to the PM Tampa Bay page I Want to start with some new polling that we have on the big state races there was a new Suffolk University poll or the came out today it had Gillum at forty five to ... to ... forty four\nNelson at forty five and Scott at forty three the problem so so both races toss ups which I think they are are the problem with the poll to me was to Santa ... Scott had an edge among independents\nAnd that is a big outlier typically ... you're not seeing that in poll after poll after poll a Reuters had a poll that came out today had Gillum at fifty to Santas at forty four\nAnd it had Nelson a forty nine and Scott at forty four and back in September what's interesting about the Reuters pull back in September\nThey had Rick Scott forty six and they'll send a forty five so at one point advantage for Scott or in this October poll\nThey now have ... up five points so that's that's a six points when it's a big swing are there and the Reuters poll so taking a look at the the bigger picture here the real clear politics average of the polls and and for those of you listening right now we're automatically dismissing all of this is fake news and the polls\nI just remember the real clear politics average for the entire country was Clinton winning by three point two percent she won the popular vote by two point one percent so they were almost they were within a a percentage point of being spot on\nAnd in Florida they had Trump winning by point two percent he one by one point two percent said they were within one percentage point there\nAnd they accurately predicted the winner or the real clear politics averages right now you've got Nelson plus two so a slight lead within the margin of error races a toss up could go either way\nBut Nelson does lead in six of the last nine which is a big shift since July and August\nSo the shift is certainly headed towards Nelson's favor at the moment\nAnd we were doing all the storm coverage we were talking about whether or not risk I don't get a bump from all the media kind of coverage and he got constantly out there meeting with you know the people who have been a campaign out of it really not seeing them not much of an effect uh\nIn the real clear politics average Gillum ease up three so still a toss up race are still very close but Gillum up three and since the primary only one poll is ... so this has been very consistent every single poll showing Gillum uh with that\nThat slight lead now I've got a couple of other numbers I Want to run through real quick here\nIn the Hillsborough County sales tax referendum says according to saint Pete polls\nThe transportation referendum ... forty eight forty three in favor of passing that sales tax ah with nine percent undecided so it could go either way\nAnd ah the school referendum the funding for schools in a little bit better shape fifty five forty with about five percent undecided so a couple of big referendum so you're in Hillsborough County also I have some numbers on amendment for amendments six\nOr will try to get to that a little bit later on in the show coming up next we'll be joined by Tampa Bay Times columnist John Romano here on PM Tampa Bay life lightning creditors tomorrow night at six thirty nine Seventy telling us LA the home of lightning hockey ...\nPm Tampa Bay with Brian Gorman do

on the hotline right now we have Tampa Bay Times columnist John Romano you can follow on Twitter Romano hunter sports team be times John how are you\nHiring well good for you here I Am thank you so much for joining me once again let's start with the issue of civility we have a few things that we're gonna talk about er during the interview the rhetoric is heated these days we see from the president we see it from both candidates running for governor here in Florida we see it from the Democrats from the media\nAnd and especially online and through social media which I think acts as an incubator for hate and division and raging grievance ah\nHow bad is it and is it likely to get better anytime soon\nWell it's as bad as I've seen it\nIn my lifetime I'm\nI talked to a woman who survived the Holocaust over the weekend\nUm she's Ninety years old she said it's as bad as she's ever seen it in her lifetime um you know I don't know that there's a single way to define that but I think we can all agree it is true nasty out there it it is device of it is ugly\nOr as as to whether it can get better I I just don't know because we sort of are in New territory\nAs you point out with social media that allows people to sort of live these verbal bombs\nAt one another a true the safety of their their telephone or their tablet or whatever they're using\nAnd and I think it it ends up growing from there it's you know it starts off as almost this anonymous kind of\nA insult or threat and people get more and more angry and become more and more ... and then you start seeing it spill into everyday life you know on the streets and and unfortunately and synagogues in schools and and wherever else we have crazy people\nOne thing I Know academia is looking at is is what's changing in American society to lead us down this road and\nYou know when you look at politics in particular we could go back and we can say you know it was this instance you know some people like to point to Newt Gingrich or other people like to point to Clinton or\nYou know a Bush and the Iraq War or Obama or Trump or whatever but to me it really I I really focusing on the Internet and social media because I think it's taken it to a whole\nI made a lot of sense to me Tampa Bay Times columnist John Romano who again you can find on Twitter at Romano under store TB times John appreciate the

F. L. A. and legal analyst Felix Vegas my producer James Berliner here as well eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number one to spend just\nA few moments on the proposed constitutional amendments that we're all voting on on the ballot this year some of my thoughts were now we did a breakdown of the amendments on this show that they took a couple of different segments are because there's so many and and that was one where we just tried to keep it informational right and you can find that\nAnd nine Seventy W. F. L. A. dot com just go to the PM Tampa Bay page now I'll give you my thoughts on this whole thing\nEven bracing myself all week for this\nIf it's a bundle on voting no vaping and oil drilling shouldn't be combined it's idiotic\nThis isn't rocket science [laughter] come on belly button vaping an oil drilling together for ... that that is the amendment that I've seen commented on the most\nOn social media people getting to the ballot box not everybody does a ton of homework before they go see a lot of people who are going they\nHaven't really looked at the amendments don't know much about the amendments and then they get there and they see one where it's about oil and drilling and in in vaping and they're like what in the world is going on here we had somebody asked us on on Facebook on our nine Seventy WFL a page today\nWhy are they bundled together and we had to you know we we posted a link to the segment you an idea where you explained how the bundling came about\nRight and it's allowed under those there was constitutional vision commission amendments that are basically six through a\nWell was Thirteen Down the Tim ring six amendments they are allowed to be bundled because they're coming from that committee to judge the forest court ruled on that\nAre in several the case of several them I think about four of them are struck down by the lower courts in early on taken off the ballot and then they were all punted up to the Supreme Court decided no as I get to find the way it is if we can trust of the commission but\nBut they were still one amendment ate the was bundled that got taken off the one about charter school yeah what about charters grain of sand either because there was like that one was more tied together I thought and oil drilling and vaping right\nAnd now with the oil drilling and vaping if one of them it's updating the statue or the the amendment on smoking in a private workspaces so OK you see where that is going to go but like to retire to an environmental issue rabbi and middlemen with oil drilling it made no sense whatsoever and somewhat on Twitter\nLast week I was having discussion while we're on air and you're asking me what do we do if you like one of the parts of the amendment but not the other ... it's right it's not all a cart you don't get to pick and choose which one you want\nNow I look some of the issues included I'm sympathetic to win support but most\nAnd to me you should be handled by the legislature first of all ... and they certainly shouldn't be combined into one amendment just because you can do it doesn't mean it's a good idea right a stupid idea\nUm the legislative amendments because there was a couple that were put on there by the Florida Legislature I I don't like when the state legislature runs through the ballots trying to get things done that they can't get done on their own uh that goes from one two and five\nThey put stuff on there that sounds good in theory but as a lot of unintended consequences which is why they haven't gotten it done on their own um ... village it amendments\nTo me or three amendment three the gambling amendment and amendment for the voting rights restoration amendment those are the citizen driven ones and I think they should legitimately beyond their\nUh they make sense as constitutional amendments those are worth having the people\nYeah just to get in mystery out of here one of the most cogent remark was from a previous judge said those are not abuse it'd be great at it or lose all income that provides for\nProjects for the call Ron I appreciate it I\nI'm not necessarily sold that that there aren't things happening in the greyhound racing industry that that I don't like or if it does go to other states to me I'm I'm worried about Florida of first but it but for for me again when it comes to that amendment\n... it's it's a battle to me between being a purist and not wanting some of these things in the constitution and\nAnd thinking that you know certain issues okay well I I Want that done\nSo do I bend on the purists part or do I bend on the pragmatist part that's the struggle that I have with with some of these amendments but the bundled ones at the end of the day that's just I I think that has has messed up this process and made it so much more confusing for so many people\n... and this is one of the more complicated groups of amendments I've had to cover a in the ... been on airs and legal analyst and it's just amazing how many different issues that lead seems or should be more streamlined process if you're involving the CRC and remember the customer vision committed daily meet every twenty\nYear yet they only made every Twenty years they come in ah one's in Twenty years and they screw the whole thing up when they make it all a confusing and making the giant mess great job\nSumming up so in this business I'll be sixty by the time I had to deal with them again\nAnd then it's not such a bad thing probably eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two coming up next we have the latest on the package bomber and the synagogue shooter one of them there was a big update today rice or which what which case we down\nThe package Bob ... knew a lot more information came out about that details of what the they found not only in the suspect's car um but also things on his cell phone and the ... how they build how he went about building the bombs which would have made them much more potentially lethal\nSo we are going to talk about that we're both of those cases stand and also Twitter's failure in all of this uh CNN the K filed there they did some really great reporting\nOn the tweets that the package bomber has sent out thousands of tweets they poured through I'll tell you what they found it's really it's infuriating we've got that for the next ...\nA day from am that PM your next chance to win a thousand bucks coming up at six bats the top of the hour on nine Seventy WFL a [noise]\nNews trafficking whether in less than Thirteen minutes you are listening to be in Tampa Bay with Brian Gorman on nine Seventy WFL a\nBrian Gorman here with nine Seventy W. F. L. A. legal analysts Felix Vega and we have some updates for ya on to the the big stories from the past week plus the the package bomber and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter let's start with the latest on the package bomber because there's an update in that story that broke\nToday yeah they're releasing more information they filed a federal charges against the suspect last week or that opportunity to go through the complaint found some more stuff that we can dig into but I think more importantly they're kind of now strengthen their their case in releasing more information uh they've now searches cell phone they searched his computer about a lot more basically that this plot went back to July of this year\nI'm a while in order to start planting as targets or some of the things I noticed that he had pictures of the Obamas and the ... homes were found on a cell phone also a picture of a show a bomb his driver's license apparently\nOr that they found um they also found a when they were looking at the bombs actual pipe bombs themselves taking the part they actually found shards of glass\nIn the majority of them which could do potentially be ... if they did in fact exploded heard those reports before but now it's convert rights and now they've they've done a lot more release a lot more information and so that I came out in court documents\nThat was filed in order to make sure the suspects dating custody you'll have another hearing on friday and they're going to turn and wondering and sent him to New York\nOr to face charges 'cause that's where the whole case was filed\nA in the southern district of New York or they also released more information about DNA samples ... originally they said there was to a possible samples one was found in a one of the packages addressed Maxine Waters another one from\nThe idea of a century president and Mrs Obama now they're saying that the ah federal investigators saying there's now ten potential DNA samples they found on separate bombs are separate packages so you're now seeing that linkage yeah I saw a report last week after he was taken to court or earlier this week\nAnd his attorney there was appointed a basically says that you know there's not enough evidence are never going to survive this charges\nI all sort of thing that was like an open and shut case well the ... the thing is a kind of like we've talked about some more fact evidence and some of these cases we've been covering over the past few months\nIt's all the same thing you've got establishing link all these packages together 'cause you have I'm going to you George Soros him go after the bombers the Clintons\nThe whole litany of I mean they're basically all made on at the same material they're all very Larry Larry Nassar and now if you have DNA evidence or to link them even better\nAnd it was something else that I found them to complain that we really didn't get to touch on but in for the packages they actually had found photographs of the targets with a giant red extra rhythm and that was found in\nThe Soros package the one for President Obama the one to over to CNN Center dress to you or the former CIA director James Brennan and also the the second package was mailed Maxine Waters that are California office so you see that pattern is running through with certain packages that seem to tail\nOff with the wonder what the Biden Cory Booker kale Harris but in those first initial for ah they found that they also discovered a most of the packages went through the sorting facility ... where he was actually found and arrested\nOh so this kind of like they're putting their case or more and more together and rubber Wednesday we were on air talking about this and people were calling in and saying you know it would possibly a false flag and we kept saying we got to figure out what exactly happened where evidence out there so we're now developing a much clearer picture\nOf what he did he's facing five federal charges was fifty six years old how long can they lock them up uh anywhere from forty to fifty eight bucks for the rest of my life been seeing yeah\nAnd there and they also made a point today that there may be more charges coming during a hold on different theories of the case or possibly or if they based on what they released now possible attempted murder charges right now they basically everything focuses on interstate transport the bombs threatening federal officials and former federal ... they might get more serious as we go forward\nI Hope they do a show there's this this CNN investigation into the package bombers a social media accounts his Twitter account and and they dig dug through thousands of his tweets and he would say that about pizza gay Kim trails birth of ... all kinds of stuff he was obsessed with George Soros\nBut but what they found is that he began to\nStart threatening people um in\nApril twenty Eighteen that's when you move from just tweeting about like conspiracy theories to regularly threatening\nAh people\nAnd they found that he treated more than two hundred and forty threats directed at least fifty public officials news organizations and media personalities saying things like your time is coming your days are over your next hug your loved ones real close every time you leave your home\nUh he he attach photos to his threats some included pictures of decapitated goats\nAre photos of homes and families of those he was threatening ah he frequently suggested that people he was tweeting a would vanish in the Everglades not far from where he lived here in Florida\nSo you know this is different\n\nThere is obviously a big free speech debate when it comes to social media\nBut when you're threatening people like this that's a that's a whole\nDifferent ballgame to me or he was tweeting pictures of sources home with you address typed over the photo nine times in a row uh\nYou tweeting pictures of Maxine Waters is home a ... so he's threatening people nonstop and one person who he threatened to political analysts reported it\nIn this guy convicted fan right and that definitely was and what happened to one analogy I Want to draw going back to you or the ... Mother Emanuel church shooting in two thousand Fifteen ...\nWho was Twenty one year old white supremacist who was convicted in federal court receive the death penalty he then turned around two months later and pled to all the state charges they didn't take the death on the off the table and he gets a life sentence on though so I Would expect a lot of similarities between those two cases and how this will brass and how\nLong this guy he'll be in prison for the rest of his life but\nAt least wife or not it wasn't the data yeah you get the death penalty so that's what the feds or going out there go ahead and you will probably are now so they're seeking the death penalty but more than likely at the same plays out like Charlotte are in the church shooting then he'll wait till life after being sentenced to death if he is in fact sentences of federal system\nPart time now to talk about birthright citizenship which has come up over the past couple of days a President Trump is planning to sign an executive order that would remove the right to citizenship for babies of non citizens and unauthorized immigrants born on\nUs soil he said to act CEOs it was always told me that you needed a constitutional amendment guess what you don't\nOr when he was told that very much in dispute he replied you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can just do it with an executive order\nHe said we're the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states with all those benefits it's ridiculous and it has to end now that's not correct more than thirty countries most in the western hemisphere provide birthright citizenship us and Canada and the only two developed countries to have that policy\nThis all centers around the fourteenth amendment which are part of it all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there of a key phrase that's being tested now are citizens of the United states the first question here\nBefore we dive into the amendment itself the first question is it constitutional\nTo make this change be an executive order remember President Obama when he couldn't get anything done said I've got a pen to take executive actions were Congress won't and he was blasted by conservatives for that\nThe big Obama executive order that's become a huge issue DACA involving illegal immigrants who arrived here as children Trump campaigned on repealing it conservative said it was an unconstitutional move and this ending birthright citizenship through executive order is even bigger than that\nBecause this is a constitutional amendment we're talking about it and don't forget the Trump Administration is challenging the legality of ... in court and the whole point of that challenge is that they think the Obama administration acted\nBeyond his powers so\nI mean that that's where you have to start here before you get into the\nBirthright citizenship debate you have to start at the executive order idea this is a law and an understanding of the law that's been an active for decades and Congress has been front and center they can't find the fourteenth amendment\nAnd there's a congressional statute that's been in effect since the Nineteen fifties\nReaffirming it so this is a big deal trying to change all this through executive order forget the courts decided on the true meaning of the jurisdiction part if it's changed be an executive order\nThey're likely to just strike it down by saying it's an issue for Congress and maybe Congress will take up the issue of Lindsey Graham said he's going to put forth legislation\nHarry Reid back in the day put forth legislation ending trying to end birthright citizenship he now says\nThat it was a huge mistake on his part he said that he realized that almost immediately after he offered up the legislation him and his wife talked about it and you realize what a big mistake he'd made despite the fact that a year later he was writing an op ed backing up\nThat legislation that Harry Reid put forth\nA whole nother debate for a different day so so the executive order part if if you didn't like Obama doing these kinds of overreaching executive orders you can't be consistent and think this is okay you're either conservative on this or you're not\nNow\nAs for the fourteenth amendment I Want to read a couple of things here and it's gonna take me a second to bear with me because this is important this is from a leading constitutional authority on the fourteenth amendment the citizenship denial lobby has focused on the words\nSubject to the jurisdiction its members argue that citizens of foreign countries even if they live in the U.S are not subject to us jurisdiction and us their children are not covered by the claws\nPretty simple he says to test this idea ask\nYourself\nIf for foreign citizen rear ends your car on your drive home today will you or the police allow him to drive away on the grounds of the foreign citizen can't be arrested ticketed suit\nThe answer is an easy one it's no\nThat's why foreign citizens are subject to the jurisdiction of our police and towards when they're in the U.S whether it's Taurus legal residence or undocumented immigrants illegal immigrants only one group is not subject to the jurisdiction that's accredited foreign diplomats and their families\nIn granted birthright citizenship and also established equal protection and due process under the law the fifteenth amendment was one that gave equal voting rights all us citizens and remember this is the time of slavery the end of slavery\nThere was a three Fifth Amendment which said that African Americans are slaves only count as three fifths of a person for voting purposes that was the first real voter suppression that existed in this country so when they did say pass the fourteenth amendment for birthright citizenship that was for the children of slaves were already here in the country\nThis is not because of you know illegal immigration yes there's an argument that they came here and there were dragged here and became immigrants are forced to become a number against\nBut the immigration issue was once they abolish slavery anyone born in this country to a slave or a former slave than they were granted citizenship along with the slaves themselves so that is important to realize the historical context where this comes from especially\nWhen you're talking about are originalist jurists deciding this case like Gorsuch and cabinet that's what they're going to be looking at\nRight and the other point is that you think about all of us were your parents came from like my my grandparents came from\nUh Europe my grandmother was from Ireland and she came to remember rates in the United states and then she had my mom and my uncle and they were you know American citizen she went through the citizenship process and became a citizen\nSo you think back just you know two generations me aware ... grandparents came from and then you have this in place and you can make the argument like well technically you're not a citizen anymore you know is that really some\n... it could certainly be a slippery slope and a lot of people bring up Europe and in a how their process with immigration works in comparison to what we could potentially become if we were to start going down this road\nBecause in Europe they're very protective of bloodlines and that's what they want to maintain whereas we've always been you know the American principles come give me your tired your poor your and everything's on the statue of liberty yeah so it's just important but it taking politics out of it that's historical legal context uh\nAgain and taking a look at and some of the key\nQuotes from the time uh obviously James Madison prior was was prior to the the fourteenth amendment but but if you look at the founders and their quotes on on this issue and then if you look again at someone like Edward Bates president Lincoln's attorney general back then just\nA few years before the adoption of the fourteenth amendment you see where\nThe thought process is here and that's something that the originalist are are going to go back and look at they are going to look at that they're going to look at past precedent and past president so far has basically said that the the current interpretation of it holds up a so\nThere there there is certainly a issues to talk about on the fourteenth amendment itself on the executive order part of all of this I don't think there's really a discussion uh I I Know the president's getting advised by some people but I think I don't think it holds up\nAt all even if they wanted to repeal the amendment or part of the amendment you still need two thirds of ... there's a product\nTo do and just not the executive order and eight hundred nine six nine Ninety
