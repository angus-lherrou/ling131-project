S. C.\nGuy every now and then okay um\nI managed to watch it without paying for it or leaving the house is totally legal way to do it but\nI'm Glad you're admitting that now periscope\nSo people stream their team ie on periscope this isn't\nThe first time I've done it either the I'm a big New York giants fan and and you know I'm not getting the NFL package or anything like that so on Sundays over the past couple of weeks\nPeople will stream the giants game on their TV they'll just put like their phone or their camera in front of the TV and stream it on parents go well it's totally it's got to be totally illegal\nAnd and the U. S. C. fight they did they say there were tons of people who are doing this and the one that\nI watched I think it was out of Russia because if you turn the volume up you know they were talking and background I didn't understand where they were saying\nAnd one of the fighters in the main card a is from there so they probably stole all my info in the process but it was a great stream it was like perfect quality and it was a great fight and then there was a fight after the fight every mayhem in Las Vegas so\nI you know I I probably should relax I did I probably shouldn't be talking about this because again I don't I don't think you have any I don't think I Would get in trouble and they ... they should totally get in trouble\nAnd they were like they were like at one point during the height of the stream that I was watching on periscope they were over twenty thousand people watching because it has the little figure so when I logged on to that stream I think it was about six thousand people and then the by the end of the night it was like oh well over twenty thousand people watching that\nStream so all those people aren't uh obviously aren't paying for the fight\nYeah so you think that they should be punished for their wrong doings you're going to walk but I don't I don't I don't have it and I don't think I don't think this\nShould be the top priority to prosecute these people but a ... now let me get to my my\nTrip to public ... on a on Sunday we've discussed this before ... pm Tampa Bay and on AM Tampa Bay I find the checkout conversations\nTo be very awkward I'm not a big chit chat you don't like kind of guy no I don't like small talk like if they want to talk trade policy in the checkout line I'd be more than happy to I think that would be fantastic but that's that's not what they usually want to do so the bag or ask me about my dog which is always a problem because it always becomes a long conversation they say what kind of dog do you have\nAnd I say a ... and nobody knows one of his energy is so then I got to explain it's an African hunting dog and then oh can I see a picture of it is I\nAm showing pictures and and they're asking me questions because every time that comes up it's a long conversation yeah okay\nBut but that wasn't the worst part didn't the cashier rang up my cheesecake show in the public's bakery they've got these little cheesecake but you can get there two slices him one package right right and she says to me I Hope you'll be sharing the other slice [laughter]\n\nAnd I just want to respond no I'm Single and depressed them I'm eating both of these places don't judge me this is all I have to make me happy tonight\nShow I Walk away having to do a long conversation about my dog and depressed about the fact that I don't have anybody to share the other cheesecake slice with it and I was planning on a ... on all of it myself\nAnd it's unfortunate that yeah I write a good weekend no\nNo and I didn't even do anything and it wasn't a good you are in a much better we can you went to the lightning\nOn that are lining up in her one in ... oh my God it on a real\nVery exciting game and it was a good weekend for bucks fans they didn't play so ah all positive and USF now rank there in the top twenty five I think the rank twenty third in both polls so off for sports in this town it was a good weekend\nThe gifts that we have on the show this evening mayor Bob popcorn coming up in the next segment we have a lot to talk about with him we'll talk about hurricane Michael a tomorrow the last day to register to vote in the midterms and we'll get a raise stadium update from him also\nNews channel eight chief meteorologist steam ... going to be on with the six thirty five we'll get an update on hurricane Michael from him and what to expect over the next few days here in the Tampa Bay area I got to be honest I Can't believe we're talking about a hurricane\nIn audio right yeah and a major hurricane this thing was going to be like a tropical storm when they hit the panhandle maybe a category one now it's going to be up to a category three one that hit up there I mean there's a serious situation panhandle as of right now\nIt does not appear like we're going to have to step in and help because I Know if if I were in the panhandle last thing I Want to hear is that Ryan gourmet Morgan last in the Tampa Bay team are going to be doing storm coverage because you don't do you know small storms ruined it big ones yeah\nUm but as of right now it sounds like we're not going to be called in to do that\nSo it's not that serious yet well it's it's serious but not not ... theory they need at the violent and more we need to do nonstop coverage for them but but that could all change I mean just waiting a phone call but yeah\nUh and and we joke we thought that we weren't going to have to deal with hurricanes this year after year last year but apparently that's that's not the case or so we'll hear from Steve derby at six thirty five get his thoughts on what to expect\nAre also American Spectator contributing editor Jeffrey Lord's going to be on at eight oh six we'll talk about the cabin off confirmation that happened\nOn Saturday nothing unexpected we knew were all the votes stand at a friday evening when we did the show but it's all no official I'm so we'll talk to Jeffrey lowered about that and then finally at eight thirty five\nWe'll talk to Florida politics publisher Peter shores well talking about the politics of hurricane Michael because this has shaken up some of the big races in the state\nUh and there's a new controversy in the race for governor of course so we'll talk to him about that as well plus we have a lot of other stuff to get to you and your phone calls eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two back with Tampa Bay or Baba core next on PM Tampa Bay\nLightning can next Thursday night at six thirty nine Seventy WFL a the home of lightning hockey\nAnd

the segment on the very first show this time he was he really he was on\nMy side I appreciate the fact he called a few minutes early did I not joining us on the hotline right now we have the mayor of Tampa oh you can follow on Twitter about about corn mayor bus tour and how are you\nRide you know I I'm so humbled by the fact that I missed the first ...\n[laughter] I early life [laughter] you know I I'll call it a good at the\nMoment that you're good grades were never going to let you live that down ... I mean it's just it's an all time story um let let me start with hurricane Michael doesn't look like it's going to have a major impact on the Tampa Bay area but it'd be taking any precautions just in case it takes a hard right turn\nYeah we have um actually we're you know cracking up not to the level that we were obviously last year or at or above what your\nAre starting to activate to a much lesser degree some of our ah you know emergency operations centers staffing up\nAre getting our people prepared if necessary um I don't anticipate that that will be the case uh we anticipate there will be some high water or there will be some search but not to the degree that anybody should have anything to worry about\nIf need be will activate the sand bagging sites are at this point that's not necessary but we are monitored or all of our people are paying attention very closely and our thoughts and prayers are with our fellow Korean soap in the panhandle\nAbsolutely ... strength in really quick and it looks like it's going to be a a rough couple of days up there in North Florida tomorrow is the last day to register to vote here in the state of Florida this is a probably gonna be a high turnout mid term right it seems to be trending that way\nIt is right in and you're absolutely right ... thank you for why do people because you know you have one day\nTo ... to register or if you're not registered particularly some of our younger folks and in high school kids that are turning Eighteen or now's the time to do it and and I think you're right there is a lot of passion\nIn these midterms for a lot of different reasons are certainly a young folks are more energized than I have ever seen that before perjury because of park with a but I think also you know what's going on a national level um has really energized people on both sides dial 'em\nAnd that's a good thing I Want people to participate in our democracy we can't we can't have a democracy without folks are registering to vote in or importantly Ryan and I can't stress is showing up to ... ... one thing to register\nUp what if you don't show up your vote doesn't matter and that is unfortunate because then you end up with you know ten or twenty percent of the population dictating for the remain the remainder of the eighty percent of the population that didn't show up exactly what the policies and the people that are elected\nThen you end up\nKilling the goose laid the gold beg so it's all about the economics into business model not just\nDoing something to do a piece of the teachers union this is going to create jobs and opportunities for companies to move here and for indigenous companies to grow it their all their ranks with foreigners students who have a great educational background\nWe're talking to mayor Bob ... pm at Tampa Bay rays ballpark last two times you've been on with me but the probability that it gets built in ... city and around fifty fifty or is it more likely than not that it gets built there were more likely than not that the funding is in there and doesn't happen\nYou know that a big number has it changed or the war has uh the raised contribution um even if you assume I optimistically riots that\nOther race agree to pay half which I Hope they do um that still leaves a gap of about four hundred fifty billion dollars give or take yup you know\nI don't have that money and I can only speak for the city not the county and I don't plan on writing a check for any portion of that money now where I can be helpful is to create some of the instruments that down the road\nEvery choose from development around the stadium could help pay down some of that debt but at this point I'm Still going to be a tough slog or still hard at it still trying to put our best are much to the task\nBut we also heard that\nIf it's a bad deal we need to be willing to walk away if it's a deal that that doesn't make sense in the long term future generations um we need to walk away but race deserve our best efforts to try and make this happen and that's what we do and that's exactly what we will do\nAre you more optimistic or more pessimistic now than you were ... you know back when we first spoke about this march\nYou know I say I am about where I was back in March and I think that much has changed um I think we've identified what some of those instruments may be a but the problem is right now none of them are generating revenue right to pay down the debt and and your\nRace can't expect the city to guarantee the debt so future development end up having to pay off the debt service but until it developers in place and jewelry six or seven eight million square feet of properties developed it stopped throw it off any money\nReal quick to Hillsborough County sales tack referendum on the ballot next month one for transportation and another for education what do you think about them\nI'm supporting boats and I'll tell you exactly why\nWe don't invest in our kids

eighty mile an hour winds making it a category one storm and she probably been following this it's been it's been really changed quite a bit here in the last twenty four hours\nIn fact the guy's forecast to strengthen into a major hurricane will likely stay well to our west will have some effects and the way of higher wind gusts coastal effects were sort of a tropical storm watch tropical storm warning for citrus county and it will really have to watch the high tide and of course\nUm there were a couple of outlets to reach out to his campaign to to get a statement the campaign I guess didn't\nA which is really surprising so not really sure where he's at um there was a controversy the bubbled up over the past few days and\nFlorida Democrats are attacking the dissent this campaign is racist because of the comments they were made by congressman Matt gates who's a Republican congressman from the panhandle\nWho nicknamed Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum regarding his record on crime\nGates made comments or while he was stumping for him to Santas\nAre here in Florida over the weekend he said and I'm quoting here this is in Cape Coral Tallahassee is like the murder capital of Florida I don't know whether to call him Andrew Gillum or Andrew Gillum I mean this is like middle school stuff\nSeriously where people find these people to work on their campaigns\nGates responding to criticism over the comments by saying Democrats started attacking him because they have no defense for Gillum Democrats can't defend the horrific crime rate under Andrew Gillum in Tallahassee so they blame\nOthers sad exclamation point could you be more like Trump I mean come on seriously wow look\nI there there are certainly issues with Gillum rain as mayor in Tallahassee you can certainly question his actions on crime in that city but to go the\nMiddle school rally ... his last name and then responding\nOn Twitter or just like President Trump would I mean come on the person you're oh man\nI like a grown up really to me that's just on becoming a member of Congress St Petersburg Mary Price been called gates is remarks reprehensible a Terry ... the Florida Democratic Party chairwoman labeled gates is name calling as a quote racist and despicable attack I\nI don't get the racist part Democrats always reach for the race card ... right out of the box I\nI don't know ... yeah I don't really seem much racism in that state\nMan I don't know what was racist about it is is this your mother and\nA name calling issue but not ... they always go for racist it's oh it's ... it's like you know take the when he got the credits to criticize your opponent on just take the wind don't go too far and blow it they always blow it always\n\nJenna cruise House Democratic leader running for a Senate hearing the Tampa Bay area said gates comments completely cross the line that that's all you you say they're immature under coming up congressman and then and then move on\nYou have to go down there racist wrote they always go down that road but seriously and that's that's working they were going to\nUse the last names of people and [noise] ... as the kind of politics that just drives me insane\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two\nIs the number we have a a a new poll in the a race for governor and the U.S Senate race it only\nA was conducted with four hundred and Seventy six likely voters that number is a bit low for me in terms of the amount of people polled so this is one that again and I say this about most of the bowls taken with a grain of salt but for the trend lines things like that\nAre in this poll Gillum leads to sentence by three points forty seven forty four which is pretty much what we're seeing across the board the same poll shows Rick Scott with a ... a slight lead over a Nielsen forty six\nTo forty four and a half percent so one and a half percent lead um that's about what we're seeing Bullock boat braces are toss ups and downs I going to say it on the show and they're gonna be tossed up all the way through election day unless something monumental apps\nLatino voters are leaning strongly for Democrats in this survey Gillum leading dissent this among Hispanic voters sixty three and a twenty four that seems a bit much\nIn the U.S Senate race Nelson leads Scott fifty five to Twenty one among Hispanics again that seems a\nLittle high not sure I quite believe that number a Gillum leads to Santa's forty six thirty three among independents might be a little closer than that it's not far off and Nelson leads Scott forty six thirty eight percent among independents that sounds about right or the voters polled\nAre almost evenly split on how they view President Trump forty seven percent approving of his performance in forty eight percent disapproving that's basically spot on uh with what we typically see from uh polls\nEight hundred nine to nine Ninety three fifty twos number I Want to go to Adam in Tampa on line one Adam how are you\nGlad right are you doing good I sort of go\nJust a just a little bit about what you said as far as the comment that offered for that\nYeah well get just answers didn't say it was at a campaign event uh it was it was Mac gates that set it\nThat's why I said an operator for uh oh okay okay now\nYou and you ask for the fall I'm going to race car\nWell Democrats are calling it racist\nOkay I just wanted to say that the thing is that what you see and how you see the census as well as the operative acting just like their mentor is which is forty five\nRight but that comment in itself how is that common in itself criticizing Gillum for the for the murder rate in Tallahassee how is that ... ... you know it's a dumb thing to do good calling Gillum Gillum but how is that racist\nOkay well I'll explain the thing is is that I'm forty five you this what is called ... and the thing is is that there's a very sort of narrative that is always said about African American mayors of large city they say that is overrun with crime\nAnd that they said that um financially that it's not a ... a it's not managed well\nYeah but it's not just African American mayors I mean you if you look at some of the mayors in California if you look at rama manual in Chicago you know they're they're individuals\nWho get hammered on on crime in and fiscal mismanagement and they're not African American\nMale I understand what you're saying but the thing is is that when you're talking about African American mayor you're talking about you're talking about large what is called urban centers\nThat have large African American population\nAnd the thing is is that we have a caller knew where the ... and under this president will become because of the thing\nIs yeah but I I'm not worried about I'm I'm just looking at this particular comment this comment right here they have a I don't see it I I mean\nThey look at the you know there are certain things where I think you can make the case All right that's a racist dog whistle distance doesn't seem to be one of them to me [noise]\nThe thing is that right and why you're not you're not African American or you're not a person of color\nKnow that you're saying you're you're going to look at things differently\nYeah but also but by but also also just objectively I mean ... to make it seem like you you're you're definitely making a leap you're making a connection that on the face of it isn't there your\nEar and suffering from it it's that they meant something racist by it's not just there on the surface\nDoesn't that doesn't have to be a it doesn't have to be all for the uh as now because I can say or what it's called rate thing and he can say no I didn't mean that if you thought about that that more about you and the thing is that we know they're\nAll in all respects they set thing\nAgain you're talking about the president I'm Talking about ... gates who may be specific comments and and and and run a Sanders who was there I Am\nI I'm up against our break but I appreciate the call I always like it in your perspective on these kinds of issues eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty Tuesday number I'm just not seeing the racist angle on this one I I wouldn't have set it I think it's a stupid childish thing to do but when you bring racist into it you're taking a to a\nA whole different level and I again I'm just not seeing it on this one eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty Tuesday number will get some more phone calls next year on PM Tampa\nWant to come before Mitch McConnell has been the key player [noise] for blocking America and companies [noise] funny because a lot of Trump supporters they like to do a ... a lot of flak you've gotten through Supreme Court justices on
