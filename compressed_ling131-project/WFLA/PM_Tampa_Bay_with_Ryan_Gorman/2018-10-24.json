Des ... to be more forthcoming about how the journalist was killed\n\nIf I were the president you know the Saudis lie to him at first and it seems pretty clear they were lying to them I'd be pretty angry about that\nNow today the president had more to say\nHe said Saudi Arabia's efforts to hide the killing of ... is the worst cover up ever\nWhich I I\nThink it's a fair assessment ... bad coverage\nHe said quote they had a very bad original concept it was carried out poorly and the cover up was the worst in the history of cover ups not really missing words here they have the worst cover up\nEver whoever thought of that idea I think is in big trouble and they should be in big trouble nobody likes what happened the problem for the president obviously as it sounds like a crown prince was\nThe one who either came up with the idea or okayed the idea President Trump went on to say in terms of what we ultimately do I'm going to leave it very much a in conjunction with me I'm going to leave it up to Congress adding in hopes that decision will\nBe bipartisan so we're gonna have to see how that all plays out but the bottom line here is ... it's the Saudis haven't been able to answer a bunch of key questions and and I think the main one being they're claiming\nThat he died in this brawl so there are acknowledging that he was killed\nThat he's dead where's the body\n\nThat's that's the end of the day that's the question where's the body\n\nAnd they have had no answer for that so far\n\nI mean this story stumped from the very beginning and\nAn hasn't gotten any better and then and then that revelation of the body double I mean not a good luck you had\nAn individual wearing as close a fake beard glasses on the day of killing\n\nYou don't have a body double\n\nUnless there is a plan to kill his show and cover it up you don't just randomly happen to have a body double on standby after a ball that doesn't that doesn't happen\n\nJames's are sending me a story about the\nDo we know how has this been verified by a bunch of different okay there there are reports that his body parts ... body parts have been found\nA\nIn the garden of the Saudi console house but it's going to I I really haven't seen a lot of confirmation on that so yeah I I Would I Would er\nAnd I I just found this to be really horrible\nA king Salman of a Saudi Arabia and a son the crown prince they met with Jim ... family to share their deepest condolences and sympathy\nAt\nI mean the the sun has been banned from leaving Saudi Arabia since last year because of his father's criticisms as the sun can't even get out of the\nCountry and they make the family meet with them to offer their condolences and sympathy so the families got to stand there in front of the king and the crown prince\nKnowing\nThat at the very least the crown prince likely knew\nAbout this plot\nPossibly even directed and they've got to stand there in front of them and if you see the pictures because there were photos taken at that meeting\nYou could see the sun is thinking to themselves God only knows what he's second hand look happy that's for sure why why would you do that if you have a king of ... and the crown prince\nSo the story continues to develop the one thing that we have and that hasn't been released and maybe with the CIA director over in Turkey she's finally going to\nGet the check out this evidence the apparent audio potential video that the Turks out\nOf the killer\nWe haven't or the audio the audio hasn't been linked yet perhaps the CIA director is over there right now will or become privy\nTo that information because if they have something like that it could it could blow up the Saudis entire story so we'll keep an eye on that or as it develops here I'm PM Tampa Bay coming up next\nI Want to get to a spark more if you've been looking forward to going out there and checking out the new uh set up to have to wait a little while longer we're gonna tell you when the the opening date is now for that also\nLove to do at up to check into that problem is\nAre they going to want us\nTo kind of crap to there I you\nKnow I said\nFrom the beginning it's a nice name\n[noise] didn't really think about what I gave my on me at all the name I Know a foundation coffee is going to feature cold brew an espresso along with house mange a lotto\nHow do you pronounce that A.

how are you\nI'm doing fine Ryan listen you and I agree on some stuff disagree on on other things that I think that's how life should be right absolutely um I'm\nA lip or not a liberal I'm not a conservative I'm what I Would consider a moderate I'm not a Republican or Democrat I'm a registered independent eyesight with neither party vote on the individuals not on party lines okay so let me get that out first yup second of all I Am apparently deranged\nUm according to Ben Shapiro who am I follow and a respect\nBut I Will tell you that first of all I watched it MSNBC after the shooting yup and\nThey had an anchor and an analyst on MSNBC who both speculated that this was a GOP plot right to uh to to get 'em some sort of sentiment toward the Republican\nIt's in response to do it\nIf there is possible but why and you know what has happened here is TV news in particular if not news anymore it's\nOpinion that's all it is is opinion its its opinion and its attempts to influence people to think the way that was aligned with\nThe agenda of these networks and that's what it's all about and\nIt's irresponsible in my opinion\nYeah reasonable people like yourself and myself I think a tend to say well let's wait for the facts to come out now that doesn't that didn't stop me from leaping\nTo a conclusion in my own mind that this could be a false flag operation especially since the package that George Soros received strangely was hand delivered so these things just wave that\nIn my mind no I'm not going to go around at a spouse to every one night falls flat operation I got\nI got to run calling up against the heartbreak but I appreciate the call and look I think it's different if you and your head think that okay well maybe some doesn't add up we'll wait and see

the first time in more than a century World Series on ESPN Radio he's on the\n[noise] neither\nActually called him out recently on this show because he thought he said that it was okay for these mobs to take place where you just go to public officials in ah when they're on their own time in restaurants and things like that and I said that's wrong that's not right you actually did that Monday Night yeah that that was this week\nAll right well I ... I did it but I Am not that I was like every time something something that can be taken out of here are real\nBut yeah I'm not just say on this show that did I not just say like a few minutes ago that the what they were saying on MSNBC and their speculation was just as bad I I think I just said that\nYet [noise] okay\nAll right thanks for the call David I appreciate it eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two you're not gonna give me an inconsistency because I'm not inconsistent\nIt's not going to happen\nI call it like I said it's not a stack anybody who knows me off the air I say the same thing sometimes a little worse eight hundred\nNine six nine Ninety three fifty two let me go to Richard Indonesian on line three Richard how are you\nHey how you doing right next door to go\nTo your screener I used to work as a contractor with the um [noise] with the postal service down in Fort Myers that man processing center okay and I have worked before where senator Rubio's office on the IRS and on recovery I'm uh thirty seven year I think that mainly um\nSo he I work but uh my time when I was with the\nPostal service it's kind of strange because they're saying that there wasn't any tracking on any of these devices meaning that if someone did come and it wasn't sent FedEx UPS which would require either on the counter or face to face contact with an agent actually send these things\nFrom what I'm hearing from all of the media is everything was sent with the postage and they were wobbly built in other words like um explosive powder available outside the actual device\nWe're we're still learning a lot of those details I don't want to know pure ... out here\nI'm not I'm not pointing anything I'm not there but a lot of the stop this thing they think it's the work of single person and what I'd like to get out of the world is\nIt does look highly suspicious at least from my time with the postal service that only thing coming across and I can tell you this from my time with homeland um is the fact that\nThe postage on a package and the way it is yeah a lot of the systems and the automatic processing it's a red flag\nRight and that so they were looking at it and stop right there that take that well the thing is that would have never left the facility so that the first thing is yeah\nIf they were all sent from one location the processing facility will not let a truck loaded with anything suspicious so in other words if someone sent\nSomething from Tampa uh the ... center in Tampa before only trucks are loaded or anything is airmail immediately a red flag because if they're exposed to the material in the package righty alarms would have gone on screening systems so the one we know it didn't go through the regular\nPac okay yeah so um what I'm Wondering is there because they give you an example let's just say you were sending Christmas cards to your family and friends to different states ... every package is going to rise on a different day\nI can have a family member in Daytona receive a card today's ... who ... in Connecticut\nAnd I find that suspicious that\nAll these packages all hit these locations all on the same day\nYou know all around the same time\nI I don't I don't know that we know that\nWell the Soros package and then you for the call Richard I appreciate the source package was the other day and that apparently was was a hand delivered not delivered by the postal service I I don't know that we know when some of these were intercepted yet I haven't really they might have been today but I but I I think again these are details that we're still getting right\nRight now to the point about whether or not they were keep saying that they were mailed out we haven't heard officially from you know the FBI and you know the actual investigators are doing and we've heard from your local officials in New York and the police saying that but if\nThey know the one from CNN was was a a I Believe that was the one that was sent by courier ... there's still a lot of things a lot\nOf things we don't know right now there's a lot of things we don't know that's why I'm telling everybody just take a deep breath on this one I'm going to Steve in St Pete online\nFor Steve how are you I'm good how are you good ... good\nUm I um I guess my only point was was the gentleman who called right before you I'm Talking about why why you know you and not just you but others won't call the other side out I Do call the other side out\nOh yeah no I'm Talking about the greater you in other words in other words why why is it that we that um what about as well what about the other side and what they do why not just say this was bad on the face of the night and and and and have that be enough for now\nKnowing that I'm getting calls where out while the bombs big no off and and there's somebody there's somebody on the line by now who wants to make that point I Am not taking those goals so if it why why why the bonded and go off so it's no big deal to save your bread I don't want to hear from you tonight\nHave you ever heard of outcomes razor yeah\nI had and I usually agree with that to be honest with critics plane to everybody else what it is\n... is a full is a philosophical rule that that says when presented with a problem or or with a with a dilemma it's generally the most reasonable are easy solution or obvious solution is the right solution ya so instead of\nTrying to protect a bunch of dogs to say that well it was a false flag operation and this that well for the time being just go with what is obvious because chances are statistically that's what it is\nWill say oh I'm I I ... I guess\nThat's my only point is is that it's very frustrating for people that are here to for me anyway to hear people trying to twist and stuff a little ... to try to you know in the other side it ... and it doesn't get us anywhere\nNow and I agreed Steve thank you for the call on this one though the only one I'll disagree with is I I don't think we know we we don't know if it is somebody again who wanted to get Democrats or somebody who wanted to make it look like they were getting Democrats or\nOr a foreign we we have no idea and when I find interesting and I I'm okay with not knowing if people just foreign okay with not knowing and that's the problem here\nBut you know people forget you know if you're not in the news business or you don't think you know having covered the news for a long time and follow the news and you know I was ten years old I remember certain stories the Unabomber comes to mind that went on for I think almost over a year before they figured out what was going on\nThe bomber in Texas took a while right ... more recently to figure out this this might take him into this is not a a simple situation here in terms of going to connect the dots new tomorrow or you know what happened and why this is my take 'em to that's why everybody has to take a step back\nAnd say let's just let the information come in and and we should all agree on two things number one regardless of the motivations this is wrong taking this tactic and number two the rhetoric in this country is out\nOf control and it's got to get rained in it's not healthy let me go to Rick in Palo beach on line three\nRecover you Hey Ryan are you doing good thanks for the call\nA yeah I I just say that I think people are clues and it's based on a there was a political operative treads\nActed in the past and won't example is during the presidential campaign and when you ... um that Democrats were caught um you know hiring\nProtesters to go for alleys and stir up trouble and that was proven through the various things\nOn them too much credit to the berets as thing but I get what you're saying record begging for the call I\nGet it but this is like you know\nSentimental to friends with my fully or this is this is not paying the protests are okay this is sending out bombs\nAnd apples and oranges eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty to get a couple of more quick call and then we got to get to the constitutional amendments stuffed because that's going to be on the ballot and uh and it's it's it's important for Floridians to understand what's going on there let me go to a Jeff online foreign Tampa Jeff how are you\nHow you doing good thanks for the call\nI was a I was actually looking at this story earlier today I was looking up on CNN they uh they showed a picture because I Want to look at the though that he washing the shelter was the return address right but then I saw the stamps\nAnd you know the guy who lived or worked for the U.S for us for so long you would notice that the stamps didn't have the little marking that that they had been gone through the postage at all\nYet again there's there's a lot ... I think that that point makes my point that can be told Jeff there's a lot we don't know right\nThat goes to the point where the CNN bomb for the ... it was possibly over by Korea or hand delivered her somehow made it in right building that didn't go through the normal channels and they still have not said we've not seen any of the labels and the packaging the went to the Clintons the Obamas they went to we saw the one that went to you I'm I'm\nThe former attorney general was returned writing was on CNN and ... none of their soldiers every other ones that we haven't seen so I mean that's just going back to my prosecutor roots like I Would ask everyone you know investigations take time handle cases where we thought we were going in one direction and we go a totally different direction you know several months later so this is not gonna be something\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two if you have any questions on amendments one\nTwo or three we can get to those in the next segment and then we'll start moving on to some of the uh next amendments that are going to be on the ballot again if you have questions on amendment one\nThe increased homestead property tax exemption amendment to the limitations on property tax assessments or amendment three voter control of gambling and Florida eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two and don't forget we have a\nComprehensive written breakdown of all of this on the website and we're going to pose the segments on that same page at nine Seventy W.

F. L. A. legal analyst Felix Vega and right now we are\nDoing a deep dive into all of the constitutional amendments that are going to be on the ballot that are on the ballot for this mid term election there are a lot of them some of them are rather confusing\nSome of them contain multiple issues we know this is is a problem for a lot of people trying to\nA fully understand what it is they're voting on so we wanted to take a lot of time to dive into each of them or we're going to be doing this for the next couple of segments and we have\nA full written breakdown already on the Web site at nine Seventy W. F. L. A. dot com just go to ... pm Tampa Bay page to read that so in addition to the segments we're doing\nA Felix did a great job of of really breaking down each one in written form for you on the Web sites you can refer to bat before you votes or after you listen to be segments and will post the segments on that page two\nAnd one of the things real quick that we did was actually keep the actual ballot titles imbalance summaries on there so you can follow along with um your ballot at home exactly\nWhere we're just giving you the the basics on all of these\nSo we're not including any opinion uh we'll we'll talk about the uh amendments on the ballots and and my thoughts on some of them at a different time right now we just want to get the information out so let's let's go back to the beginning right\nAnd let's start again let's let's do a recap of amendments one two and three the first two were put on the ballot by the Florida Legislature the third one is a citizen or initiative\nRight so minimum one amendment you real quick they're going to deal with your property taxes amendment one deals with your\nHome state property tax exemption and basically they want to create a third tier of a inspections for property values are one hundred thousand dollars for one hundred twenty five thousand dollars\nAnd so that would do is increase the maximum homestead exemption up to Seventy five thousand dollars or if they vote no on it and it doesn't pass it leaves the current property values in place your maximum homes things I'm sure we'll be fifty thousand dollars so that's the effect\nOn that how much you can actually some property from rice for property taxes not school taxes\nSo this could potentially if you're a homeowner could potentially save you some money and tax dollars one of the other affects it is likely going to have it's going to take a lot of revenue out of local government\nCorrect and also in every ... goes into a higher property ... property value so that for people that have more expensive homes\nOr him into we were talking about earlier this is actually comes from another amendment a ballot initiative that put eight ten percent limit on the amount of a property taxes can be assessed on your non homestead properties\nThings like your second home rental properties Mayo and commercial properties vacant lots of you may be thinking about building your dream home down the road so that would keep if you vote yes on amendments you keep that ten percent cap what happened previously they kind of put it in a sunset provision were set to expire in two thousand Nineteen on January first\nThey want to strike that language out of it leads to temper sent in place and so otherwise we vote no on at that cap expires and then you'll see a property taxes on those non homestead property start to rise eventually\nAnd that would raise more money for local governments so if you vote no and\nThe ten percent expires that will raise more money if you vote yes and you keep that ten percent things will continue to stay the same as they are right now where the homeowners yes let's go to amendment three this is voter control of gambling in Florida again this was brought on by as citizens group\nAnd and I think the initial question a lot of people have is is this for the the seminal driving their casinos in the state how does that affect them because they're the most well known when it comes to gambling what exactly will this\nDo seminal tribes have a separate packed with the state government that they have to renew and go through every single year this is specifically about bringing more casino gambling in the state of Florida and expanding casino gambling be on what is already here for the seminal tries or certain para mutual betting facilities that are in Miami Dade and Broward County already and it's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PM Tampa Bay with Ryan Gorman", "city": "Tampa", "day": "24"}
