excited him I mean I didn't want to get started on it and\nI think you'll have some time it's not ... or so the voting God is up the constitutional amendment breakdown is up I Want to spend a second talking about something that's driving me insane this election cycle [noise] these campaigns are using texting to communicate with voters have you\nGotten any attacks I'm getting a ton of them you I I don't have a number of them maybe that has something to do with it\nA federal law bans robo messages but apparently nothing prevents campaigns from texting individual number you're getting these came I'm getting them to see [noise] I got to deal with robo calls I got to deal with robo\nRobo text and then a robocall it still annoying\nAnd if you're wondering how campaigns if you're getting these if you're wondering how they're tracking down your personal cell phone numbers\nYour cell phone can be listed on your voter registration which is public record ... that's how they're getting a hold of a doctor McManus was quoted talking to a ABC action news and she said that they're using text messages to target young independent voters and of course\nHave anywhere else our young independently they independent bars a\nDoctor McManus war and the laws are often too slow to catch up with technology she says for now the best way to opt out of these messages is to reply stop I just got one today and said GOP alert your early vote has not yet been logged on to Florida roster find your polling\nPlace here yeah I haven't done early voting I haven't gone done early voting yet and I'm not going to I'm a person that likes to go on voting day I don't like to do early voting I I like to wait to see how it all plays out there can be a surprise that could shift everything and the next couple of days I wait until\nVoting day I go in I vote I get my sticker that's how I Do it\nLike it's so funny 'cause for anything else you'd want to get in before the crowd writing ender over that yeah possible like the only thing that\nI'm really tired of these text messages that so that's one I got that one today I got a I've got a couple the last couple of days and I've been responding to them to when they come from campaigns\nAnd what have you been saying all the one uh hit me up about Rhonda Santas and all of that and I asked when he's going to come on the show and I got no reply there was another one from governor Scott's and I asked when he was going to come on the show and God Knows no reply\nSo I've been replying to them but I get nothing back ... so um I I wanted to also touch on\nPulling for a second every now and then I ... are\nAre nine Seventy WFL a Facebook page I Love seeing what people are commenting [laughter] get an idea of you know uh what's on everyone's minds in our audience a\nAnd I saw a couple of of comments about\nThere was one individual who said that he had gotten over three hundred calls from pollsters this election season I find that a little hard to believe but okay let's just said\nHe said that we haven't answered a single poll in this household for votes are all gone Republican candidates\nAre ... there are a lot more of us Republicans not answering the polls than Democrats to do this was in response to a poll that showed I think it was the Gillum with a slightly huh they don't ... like if they don't get a hold of you they don't just like fall short\nOn the amount of Republican they have in that poll I I\n... that's not how this war yeah that's not how any of this works they reach a certain number they have\nNumbers they after they hit for the poll before it's put out and if you look at the methodology you could see the percentage of Republicans Democrats and independents in each one of these polls so just because you don't answer and maybe some of your friends don't answer it doesn't mean they're like under sampling Republicans\nIn polls that's that's not how it works also there was somebody had said well in twenty sixteen every poll him to say that Clinton beating Trump how did that outcome look that is completely false that's that's fake news if you look at the real clear politics average of Florida and the twenty sixteen race they had Trump with a slight lead over Hillary Clinton\nThere is no suggestion by law enforcement that they have any idea who's behind the series of packages that have been sent I've heard those kinds of conspiracy theories but I think at this point less than twenty four hours after the first one too early to go in that direction good for Steve ...\nThat's the responsible way to handle this the irresponsible way is what Lou Dobbs did he suggested today the bombs were fake\n\nJobs called the bomb speaking the tweet asking who could possibly benefit by so much bakery well that's interesting because the NYPD said they weren't fake maybe that's why Dobbs deleted the tweet a few hours after posting it if you're going to post something like that own it\nOh it it don't back down from its own it nowhere else to lead the tweet remember Kansas oh and so I told you about yesterday\nThe young so called conservative who's trying to make a name for herself\nAnd she said it was all a false flag operation she do it in Detroit if you're going to put that out their own it\nShe put out a new ... instead after saying I'm going to go out and said that there is a zero percent chance he's packages were sent out by conservatives the only thing suspicious about these packages or is there timing caravans fake bomb threats these left this or do an all out for midterms\nDeleted that sweet didn't stand by it and said she put out a new one that said I feel bad for the people that work at CNN who had to evacuate today that's got to be a terrifying thing to go through as an employee of any organization I'm truly suspicious of the origins of this packaging\nAnd I'm looking forward to having the whack jobs bond is caught huh that's quite a change in tone\n\nNow there was one person who I thought really stood out today as being responsible about\nNot just the situation but the rhetoric and the tone in this country in general\nComing up in the next segment I'm going to tell you that is ... and I have to take issue with Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton I've got some audio to play for you and I'll explain why they have orderly failed\n\nAnd then we'll of course get to what the

South Florida\nSo let me talk a little bit about Hillary Clinton Maxine Waters and then we'll get to President Trump and then the one person who I thought handled things correctly today\nKnow Hillary Clinton came out and you know all of a sudden talk\nAbout about civility and the tone in this country and all of that and how she's worried about it let's not forget that this is what she recently set\n... several with political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nHouse and or the Senate ... can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect his strength\nSo if you don't come out and Hillary didn't come out and say this if you don't come out and say that the very least I Need to do better myself like we we've got to fix the tone we've got to fix the discourse in this country\nThe rhetoric is too heated it's all out of control and I've got to start with me I Want to take\nI made recently if you don't come out with that you've got no credibility in matter\n\nSame goes for Maxine Waters\nWho said\nI think the president of the United states should take responsibility for the kind of violence than what you're saying for the first time in different ways\nHere's what Maxine said not too long ago and that is nice we\nSo I think we can cross Maxine Waters off as somebody who has any kind of legitimate say in this matter because nowhere did she say maybe I should look at what I'm saying to\nThat would've\nBeen the responsible correct thing to do what's my role in disability problem in this country in the discourse problem in this country she didn't do that\nAnd then the president\nHe placed a very big part of the blame for the anger we see today in our society on the news media and its fake news\n\nThis was a tweet he sent out today a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely balls and inaccurate reporting in the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news it's gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast\nIf you don't think that the president bears some responsibility\nAnd the lack of civility we have\n\nWhich what we want to call civil discourse you know I'm fifty six so I remember the days during the Clarence Thomas hearings that was certainly not civil what happened to Brett Kavanaugh was not civil and what they've been doing to Donald Trump from day one\nIs has not been civil across the media so what do you suppose fake news I think it comes from a place where if you were being attacked everyday lives told evaluate every day on you crazy bring up the twenty Fifth Amendment ... said you're the\n... owns you what's the ... winter that idiot on late night called them ... a\nLot of ... you know what whole you know it was it's just a constant barrage against the president so I'm not I don't think when he says ... usually says okay we're just going to make up a story even though I think they do sometimes I think it's the\nIt's the constant belittling ... ex using this man of things that he's not and because she goes on each talks difference honestly we aren't going to acknowledge that he communicates to America different than any president in our lifetime\nBut I Believe that that is what's what's attractive I did not support him in the primary I didn't trust him I don't I never trust who\nThe Democrats won as as there is the Republican nominee which they've got it three times in a row with Romney gay and and what a Trump is well it's clear job but that's just said this is who we want to run against that they thought he was beautiful it we know that that's in a covered his rallies during the during the campaign\nRight I think is what Keynes rallies and John McCain\nGot blistered was ... you know John McCain never understood and I and I love the guy and I respect it means to him than I\nBut he never got the notion that the media only love to talk to him what he had something bad to say about a Republican\nRight on the door of a nation he was you know Don ... Carney\nDone I I think I'd let let you get it all in here ... uh the the question I have for you is what comes next\nSo do you just want to see the I ... I agree that uh what Democrats did during the years of Obama when they were using the racism and racist term\nA way to lose weight is that one that was wrong I think a lot of what the media does a including what a lot of them did yesterday and trying to immediately to enact this all to the president when we don't know who is doing this or why\nWas irresponsible I bought but for me I'm looking at it and I'm saying okay so we've got both sides and I consider both by default here because I don't think anybody can watch with the president's done or from when he launched his campaign to today and say that he's not at fault here a little bit too so where ever\nRemember of advocating violence are you serious I really can't I Love for somebody I don't know if somebody says\nOh come on and on come on and on you sounded reasonable I mean come on you're you're telling me you're telling me that way done you're telling me that the rhetoric the president uses on a daily basis is an inflammatory in any way\nI planned matory as far as political rhetoric goes and unusual for a president advocating violence like life\nEric Holder has not liked rock Obama did what he said if they want to come through it and I fight we bring that\nGuy why put well when the president said it's OK if you're just not the criminals head into the car if it's okay if you go hit somebody in my rally or do any of those guys that that wasn't advocating for but that wasn't violence there that and in other words we found wanting guarantee you when it was said that's not there's not really not up for debate whether or not he sat around the bottom line is your the bottom line is\nYear where do you go from here do you just continue down this path where both sides just keep racing to the bottom or does somebody stand up and say All right even if what's happening to me is unfair I'll be the bigger one here\nLike remember when we were kids and somebody had to be a bigger one nobody wants to be the bigger one anymore and that's why we're in a race to the bottom\nWhile that may be true but I got to tell you the person the party and the people out here the the Christian conservatives in this country and the conservatives across the people who love this country we happen to everyone but I think I\nDon't know about that I think the sort of bomb I ... I I go I got you got to make it real quick ... I'm going to take a break here but go ahead\nI just think something rotten in Denmark I that's just how I feel I don't trust that they automatically or from a Republican just because we watch all the\nTime we have no idea we have no idea where we have no idea where they're proud of feeling and we have no idea where they're from or why these things were sent out and thank you for the call done I appreciate it nobody gave me enough time uh I think you're giving more time in almost any other color ever before uh we have no idea where they came from but but the point is in this race to the bottom\nDo do we really think it's going to end well if we keep doing this going down this road ... going to have like a happy ending for the country because I don't see how that's possible were divided country\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty to get an eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two more PM Tampa Bay including your phone call to home care\nSixteen K A day

of a\n\nRegardless of who receive\nThese things regardless of the motivation of the person or persons sending them out this is a direct attack on how this country operates on the foundation of this country\nThat's why I've said\nBut\nIf we had another situation like nine eleven\nI I'm not convinced this country would come together like it did\nBack on September eleventh two thousand one that's how fundamentally\nBroken I think we are at this point\nSo we we can do this debate all day long about who's more to blame whether it's the left or the right or the media or whoever but at the end of the day the question really easy and who's to blame\nIt how are we going to fix it how do we get out of this or you know what the ... the other question rarely\nCould be\nMaybe I'm wrong maybe the question is do we even want to get out of the cycle or is this\nWhat everybody wants\nOr people feeding off to fight now is the fights more interesting more entertaining than actually solving problems\n\nBut if we do want to get out of it at some point somebody's got to stand up and being adult here and say you know what\nMaybe\nI've been treated unfairly\nYeah well uh yeah that's moving I think it was staged by the Democrats and I don't I have a lot of people believe that as well yeah OK nursing well thanks for the call to him I appreciate that you have to have a good night's yep\nYeah I was totally reasonable conversation\nI Want to live in his happy little corner I Know where everyone is ... loving lay down like a laser light on even know where he labs\nYou know there's no big deal just the uh New York city police commissioner saying that their line devices not hopes devices that\nThey're being treated a suspected explosives sent to former high ranking officials to former presidents former CIA director former vice president former attorney general sitting congresswoman no big deal\nI I guess I guess\nIt's no big deal did this Republican candidate running for Congress in New Jersey got a letter that threaten his children and told him to drop out of the race\n\nSomebody somebody wrote him what to believe is wrong with you you ... you better hope that you don't win or else how many kids do you have seven unlucky seven this is what we think you time to get out of politics and no big deal either\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI mean okay\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two again eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two let me go to Gino in Sarasota on line one Gino how are you\nDoing good right how you doing good ...\nI just heard the last caller and uh yeah not not so perfect care about that pretty good [laughter]\nI'll do it I mean it depends on what you're talking about and I think it depends on who you are\nOkay\nRight and and I've been paying attention to all this in a you know I've seen the whole uh it it just seems to me there is a perfect storm of animal regarding the\nYeah the the ... the Russian collusion then we've got the uh the caravan and then all of a sudden we have all these devices and on the list is almost hand as far as you know every\nYou know little about the only thing I don't understand and and look maybe maybe I'm not looking at this from the right point of view the caravan so you think that's the Democrats or distribute care of and\nThe Democrats no a far left ... driven yeah\nOkay this is what I Know is what I don't understand the caravan to me helps the president because it puts immigration front and center and that's more of a winning issue\nFor him than it is for Democrats to I don't understand how the caravan helps Democrats in the mid term it's actually firing up Republicans\nMy response to that a cabin out are fired up the Republicans\nIn writing that if I were to Republicans too so\nAs far as the optics involved if something happened at that border there is a perfect uh\nThey're likely not reaching the border until December\nRight and that's after the midterm yeah and I'm aware of that and they're\nAbsolutely and uh but still the optics of what's going on still\nHave I think the optics hadn't been great for the the optics have been better for Republicans especially when I hear gas and when they when they were trying to knock down the fence I mean that was good for the president how is that yeah\nI agree there ... ... ... yep ...\nThe the uh the uh the devices being sent 'em I've seen you know the news or just recently as far as what they're made out of they didn't have a um I forget the word the detonator is that uh were really able\nWe're we're getting some of that information I wouldn't leap to conclusions just yet on the specifics of the bombs and I talked to you\nPlan on that either because I I don't plan on that either because we could get surprise here but it it it seems more right now at this point\nTo be a a a a publicity stunt or a political stunt but I've got it opened enough mind okay to understand that very well could not turn out that way and ah I'm keeping my ears open but I just wanted to weigh in on this because yeah\nI'm not as a as a cat and misses\nThe prior caller as far as it's completely just a a a plant by Democrats I Need to hear a lot more before I arrived at that because\nI can appreciate that they give it to go Gino alright ...\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two\nI guess I guess when I when I hear this idea\nThat far left elements are behind all of these things like this or the Caribbean or you know all these big news making events\nYou know whether it's the Russian desk all this stuff I the the problem I always have with that is that the left can't win elections\nThey they don't they don't have any power in DC they don't\nSit in the White House they don't control Congress they don't control the Supreme Court they don't control the majority of governorships across the country or state legislatures so if they're so good at these giants\nConspiracies came when that's always what\nBothers me about that like they're not\nOrganized or in a lot of instances in my opinion that bright yet they can do all of these things and then they wind up losing you wanted to they wind up hurting themselves the Taliban is good for the president's mecca for Democrats\n\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number let me go to a GW in Tampa GW how are you\nVery well sir I'm thank you for taking my call this the first time caller\nTry appreciate a Yes sir I appreciate what you're trying to do and in college debate instead of getting the same old she fan everybody believes the same thing\nMy concern is is I just hear the same\nI'm a I'm\nSure out as a leadership when Steve still nice guy shot almost\nYou know I don't know there was a lot there was a lot of concern about that\nYeah well maybe so um\nI mean do you remember the softball game you're worried about\nThat yeah excuse me I'm a pretty avid a listener to your radio shows and stuff and I just I Know on the right side we're we're not blaming Bernie Sanders\nThey're nine six nine Ninety three fifty two let me go to a window in lake went online to Wendell how are you [noise]\nHey good Ryan my show I like it thank you I appreciate them\nGot yeah hey I what I notice no paid for three years old\nI have seen uh a lame are being banned by media by politicians twenty Thirty years ago we didn't have the media that we have today no the volume of media I'm ... and we didn't have\nThe that you\nKnow and you go back Twenty years ago there was not there were political side but there was in you know I Can't go out no matter what yeah side you know I think that media really fanned the flames and and then the politicians get on and they found a plane and it\nSeems to me that it's just been trending and trending then people get on social media oh yeah so\nSo I think what we've gotta do and and there's so many people getting those planes and you say okay well Trump has to be that one man a stand up\nWell I'd like to see them all do it but I'd like to see him be the first one to take this step [noise]\nI I couldn't agree with you more but it is so hard like going back to Romney Romney with like the nicest\nGuy and and and he tried to take the upper wrote on everything and and they were so many people waiting the way that gets them you're right they shot him right down the up\nUm so I I don't know one man is strong enough to do that but if if you got ... I never get so many network yeah and so many things so it might take a group of people I'm\nA coalition yeah you might be right window right your window thank you for the call I got to run 'em up against a break but I appreciate and thanks for listening [noise] yep good shot man I I think\nWhat makes a a a great point there and look at you know could the president alone change the entire time of the country no not likely but again to be a first step or you know what Hillary Clinton had the opportunity she didn't walk back those civility comments she said look like a hypocrite\nEight
