out\nNews radio knives seventies WFL ain't going to be interesting to Clearwater\nAccording to his [noise]\nThis is a Fox News alerts while I'm rich Dennison ... state media is confirming us by Saudi\n... and another thing that kind of plays into all of this is the fact that this is taking place with turkey epicenter of it\nAnd they don't have such a great record when it comes to journalist right now either in fact I think they have one of the most uh numbers of journalists jailed Adam ... all of the countries you know that you would come to a top of the mind when there's an issue like this\nYou'd think correctly turkey is the number one a government that has been president for journalists in the last year according to the committee to protect journalists they have more journalists in prison than China or Russia or North Korea or Saudi Arabia or Iran\nAnd turkey is a NATO ally of you on that it's it's that's pretty horrifying\nWhich I'm a senior vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute Danielle Pletka I let let's assume the worst for a minute the crown prince water the murder of ... in your opinion what's inappropriate punishment for the U.S to dish out in one that would would send a strong message but not completely shattered the alliance\nWere really caught between a rock and a hard place here and that's why if indeed Mohammed bin Salman on the Saudi crown prince is\nProven to have been responsible for this we really are stuck because Saudi Arabia is has become so central to our foreign policy in the middle east so central to our efforts to isolate Iran so central to our effort to\nUh to isolate Islamic extremists like the Muslim Brotherhood I'll Try to ISIS terrorists groups so\n... what what is the right thing to have the right thing is\nAn investigation the right thing is sanctions for those responsible the right thing is accountability that's what mature governments do they have they are accountable for their actions and they are accountable for the actions of their leaders\nHow much leverage do we have over the Saudis and how does that compare to their leverage over us\nThen there's no comparison between the amount of leverage that we have over the Saudis and the amount of leverage they have over us you know some of the Saudi ...\nPress in the middle east has been issuing threats to the United states well we'll go over to the Iranian side so we'll take oil off the market raise prices\nAnd the answer to that is no you won't [laughter] that's not in your\nInterest what's in their interest is to maintain a very close relationship with the United states that's why this is in such a fiasco that's why this is such a miscalculation it's true that military sales don't give us leverage and I don't agree with anybody who suggests that it does\nBut we are the United states of America there at the end of the day a fall kingdom with yes an outsized economic role in the region that they have a terrible military they don't have a huge amount of influence elsewhere in the world we hold the cards here\nI've seen hot takes to make this out to be everything from essentially nothing burger to something similar to the events distorted World War one uh where are we so somewhere closer to the middle I'm assuming [laughter]\nYou know I saw I actually saw that that World War one yeah yeah and I saw [laughter] and I thought Julian Castro a member of Congress\nAdjusting that that that the president's son in law had conspired with\nHow ... says man to to murder that you know people have become on hand right and that's that's really why I talked about Donald Trump's\nAt the outset because my feeling is that Ninety five percent of the people who are talking about this don't\nYou have a good gosh darn about Jim out of ... or about Saudi Arabia they see this as a weapon which which they could be the president of the United states and while\nPlenty of criticism is due to Donald Trump for this and for many other things at the end of the day this is not really about Donald Trump it says about the government that is facto run by my comment is that a man\nI don't think that it's the I don't think that it's the beginning of World War three I don't think this is a nothing burger I think it needs to be dealt with quickly and seriously on account of life\nAnd kind of going off of some of those more extreme comments that we've seen some of the left are trying to make the case the president's rhetoric about the media has given leaders like the Saudi crown prince the okay to do these kinds of things do you buy into that\nI Would be a much more comfortable buying into that notion if this had happened uh plenty of times under the Obama administration the Bush administration the Clinton Administration but let's face reality bad guys\nThat governments dictators autocrats don't like the press they don't like a free press and they have four ... time immemorial been in the business of trying to suppress their opponents wherever they see them\nAnd final question for you the fact that this continues to kind of stretch out and we're in this ... you know waiting mode right now as investigations take place in potentially wrap up\nOr is this really just a situation where both sides are buying time to us and the Saudis or to get a story together where it will do the least amount of damage to both sides is that what you're sensing from all of this right now\nNope ah actually I don't think that they're buying time going on at least not in the United states the Saudis are in confidence there's just no other way to say it interesting\nThey are incapable of managing a crisis like this\nThey have no public relations strategy the crown prince has been basically for the last few years the stole the sole spokesman er of the country the foreign minister who used to have a higher now is largely silent and\nThe Saudis just don't know what to do and that is the reason for this island we have not heard a word for them for\nThe last five days yeah that is that is no matter no matter whether they were responsible for this or not responsible for this that is crazy\nAnd and one more thing sorry I I Know I said the last question was going to be the last question but I've got one more now uh we we talked about turkey a little bit before and how they jail or the most amount of journalism any of the major countries that you would think of a when that issue comes to mind than just worried about them right now where they're acting like they were outraged over all of this but at the end of the day\nOr they don't have a great relationship with the Saudis can be kind of touch on that a little bit in in Turkey's role in all of this\nAbsolutely says to turkey isn't interested party or the the\nAuthoritarian although democratically elected I Would say cause the authoritarian leader of turkey I'm a ...\nIs a really positioned himself as the godfather of the Muslim Brotherhood in the in the region I think his dream honestly is to recreate an an Ottoman Empire a turkey that has a huge influence throughout the Muslim world and he has\nAbsolutely set himself out in opposite Saudi Government which has\nBanned and designated as a terrorist group the Muslim Brotherhood for sure and interested party\nBut but I think it's important to say one more thing here which is that a lot of people have said hey you know so what this guy this is\nHow ... he was in his llamas and who cares if they're there are getting rid of him this these are bad guys my\n... no it's not okay right he was not advocating violence or is he was an advocate of a better government in his home country and that is that should be at least people's rights not for one for which they have to pay the ultimate size\nSenior vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute Daniel ... who you can follow him on Twitter at de ...
