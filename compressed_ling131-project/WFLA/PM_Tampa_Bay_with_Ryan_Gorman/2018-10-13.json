S. S. P. dot org and when you go there\nOr you can see you can look for these specific chapter here in Tampa Bay area it's very easy to find and you can find out more information about the events that are doing including the upcoming out of the darkness a walk let me go to you brandy I'm ... what are your thoughts on some of the more important parts of the programs that you guys do\nAnd what I Would think about my own experiences and what I've gained from al ... and I really think a lot of it comes down to awareness in education in our communities I think\nSuicide and suicide prevention isn't necessarily the most common topic of conversation so I think that's probably where this organization drives the biggest value um we are the largest private funded organization that's really driven turned mental health and suicide prevention\nAnd this is an issue that lately has gotten a lot of attention and there's been a lot of focus on because of some of the more high profile suicides that we've seen recently\nWhen you have a celebrity like Anthony Bourdain or somebody like that who winds up committing suicide and then the bad news becomes front and center how does that impact the work that you do and the attention that your organization gets\nYou know so it's always sad when you lose a life um and we would never want a celebrity or a non celebrity to lose their life or the west side\nSo I just want to put that out there first there's obviously benefits when it as something that is being talked about it a national level because it's a it's bringing the conversation home yeah and really opening the door to to actually mentioned the word suicide and have those conversations so I think whenever there is\nA a celebrity that has died by these means on it's a time for us all to recognize that this happens all over the world and it's actually very common and we had ... over forty one thousand death by suicide every year just in the U.S alone while\nDo is there a specific issue or need here in the Tampa Bay area that you see we have a very large military community and veteran population here we know the suicide rates among those groups are are extremely high uh what what is unique to the Tampa Bay area\nAnd you're working in either of you a hand or brandy can can comment on this or that you've seen ... you know working with Tampa Bay chapter\nI think that's a really interesting question obviously we have a very high military presence in the Tampa Bay area and veterans are at a higher risk for suicide and\nSo that's always something that's really prevalent in our area and and it's very important to all of us I can share myself I lost my fourteen year old son to suicide on and suicide is the second leading cause to use at our country so um I see I might be slightly invested in the fact that\nI'm understanding suicide rats for all categories of our population is really critical\nWe're talking to the American foundation for suicide prevention here on best of the bay in Studio with me I have had a giants brandy Pauline in ... when uh the website is A. S. S. P. dot org they've got a great walk which we're gonna talk about and just to be coming up here in the Tampa Bay area\nUm let's talk about youth and and if you don't mind are going through your story renting in particular so kind of step us through how this took place in your life and and how you know eventually you wound up working with the organization\nSure absolutely and so as I mentioned I lost my fourteen year old son to suicide actually almost five years ago five years in December and and I\nSay that we are a normal family we have good jobs you know we don't we didn't necessarily struggle and it was our we were had a teenager at home which is always challenging when you have a\nA teenager at home and um there were things that Tyler really enjoyed and we started to see some some warning signs that um where he didn't want to do the things that he enjoyed his grades started slipping on he was I'm\nUpset all the time and so what was really hard for us is whenever you go out to Google or talk to any of their parents are like that's a teeny\nAre for you yeah and so\nWe can do almost or do you handle teenager just going through something\nExactly and you know as a mom as a parent in my ... was telling me me and something doesn't feel right here this doesn't feel normal for the person that I knew 'em and because I was an educated about the rest signs\nIt was really easy for me to say okay you're right it's a normal teenager behavior and I think what's really really important is that we always trust our guy and we always err on the side of caution so if there is a risk there\nUm and I know I'm getting a little off topic but no oddly jump on that ras but I did not because I liked the idea that this was\nThis was just a teenager I Am a normal family of course suicide isn't going to impact me\nUnfortunately suicide did impact me\nUm and that's what got me to be involved in a F S P it was actually really ironic um because the Tampa Bay walk\nWith on the one year anniversary of my son staff or while it ... it really hit home so it really hit home and what else am I going to do but I'm going to go and fight for suicide prevention and through my efforts with a F S P I Know I personally become educated on those warning signs and what I\nCould have done differently but also recognize when you don't know you\nDon't ... ... what are some of the things looking back now and knowing the warning signs the ditch band out to you\nI I really think it was that drastic change in his behavior and the swift ... change a so he wasn't enjoying the things that he normally enjoy he had a very negative view on um everything so and then it was this\nUm he things that he didn't care about he would give away that's a huge sigh over the army's giving away cherished items yeah\nUm and I I think no one really big item for me is when I started seeing these what I Know now as I actually should have confronted him and it was okay to say I recognize that this is not your normal behavior\nAre you thinking of suicide\nAre you considering taking your life\nIt seems like that's probably a really big leap for somebody to make it's almost like you don't want to mention that was that kind of what you were feeling\nAbsolutely out as a parent of you I'm In being an educated I was afraid to say that word 'cause I was afraid that that might place the idea in his mind which makes sense which we now know six six so that is actually very inaccurate sofa so think about us\nAs humans when we have our mindset on something it's set on something if you're not thinking about suicide at all and you're just going through a hard time someone suggesting it isn't going to just put that idea in your head unless it was already in your head\nAnd so when you asked directly like brandy was sane it opens up that conversation it frees the stigma at less that person know wow\nThis person cares and they're open to talk about it and then that's where you can prevent suicide and if the person is not thinking about suicide and you asked that it's still okay because it's still shows that you care for that person so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PM Tampa Bay with Ryan Gorman", "city": "Tampa", "day": "13"}
