there's so many of them [laughter] I Know a lot I only want to be honest\nI don't get near that I'm Out so I I think they're just targeting you 'cause you're clearly a very important voter\nI got ya ya I got to tell you I haven't voted yet I don't do early voting I we all do voting day till election day to go and vote and and if this keeps up I may start to make my decisions based on a\n... who is in the ... campaign tax and the male you know that that could that could definitely\nSway my vote here are All right we've got some really important stuff to get to the top story they don't want to start with a bad couple of days for America last week as former presidents and high ranking Democrats were receiving package bombs\nI sit on this show it was irresponsible for Rush Limbaugh to float the false flag theory on his show that it was some liberal loon who was doing it to make it looked like it was done by a Trump supporter we know now that that wasn't the case\nIt was an ... an example of ... razor\nThe simplest explanation is often the correct one\nI said time and time again last week okay we don't know who's doing it and we don't know why let's just wait instead of jumping to conclusions in this country we always jump to conclusions we never\nOperate with any patience I got a call from someone saying Russia's normally right and and\nWhat will I say if he's proven right on this\nI Wonder if that person is going to call back today and admit what Russia did was irresponsible and what I did was the right way to go about it I doubt it in fact\nThere were a lot of well known people who floated that conspiracy theory and\nI haven't seen any of them issue apologies not surprising\nBut it should tell you all you need to know about those people\nAs for the beep package bomber and the mass shooting at\nA synagogue in Pittsburgh there's a lot of blame to go around and I'll get to our political leaders including the president and the media in a bit but I Want to focus first on the biggest driver of hate and division in our country\nThe Internet we we've always\nIt's been divided politically people have always hated other people and people have always been attracted to conspiracy theories what's different today is that there's a forum available twenty four seven ... drives that hate in division there is a place where people can go\nTo have their views constantly reaffirmed by others whereas before they'd be more isolated today they're empowered the Internet\nIs like an incubator for grievance and rage got a problem Internet has someone for you to blame hey the person or group of people\nThe Internet has a place to reaffirm that hate got some ... theory about something somewhere on the Internet someone will agree with you the Internet\nIs a place where facts all too often go to die and miss information derives people were ... nonsense talking points about public policy that they got from some entertainer or website without knowing the first thing about the issue they suddenly had this strong movable opinion on\n\nSo what's your the package bomber and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter really have in common hate that was nurtured on line until they decided social media posts about it wasn't enough and they had to take action\nBut the Internet isn't just some independent entity it's us so\nNext time you spread hates and misinformation on line whether it's about a group or a party or a political figure just remember that you never know who's going to see that or how it's going to affect them we have a mental health problem in this country remember that\nGo back and look at your posting comments is it all us versus them stuff\nOr you advancing a substantive debates or just taking a quick drive by shot that feels good because if you're doing the latter\nYou're part of the problem\nAnd you're complicit in making this country dumber more hateful and more divided we're the only ones who can fix this and if we don't the end result is not going to be pretty\nWell up the phone lines\nHere now for reaction to any of that an eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty to a next\nI'll talk about the president the media and other leaders in this country and how they're also part of the problem more than a moment on PM samples being that it's six thirty nine Seventy WFL a the home of lightning hockey [noise]\nYeah I mean that that would have been a map assassination attempt it it was a mass assassination attempt but it would have been one that costs lives on a scale it's hard to comprehend and then a lot of cases you know it it wasn't going to be the former presidents okay that we're going to get\nHurt or potentially killed if those bombs that operated properly it was going to be people in the mail room it was going to be members of Secret Service it was going to be law enforcement there we're going to be in harm's way in perspective\nFor those similar perspective just imagine if you're worth a mail carrier sharing that package\nYeah [noise] it I mean it is for it hatred is a horrible thing shows bigotry and unfortunately\nEvery one is a big hit to one extent or another it's just how often do you want to be one and that's the thing that everyone has to\nCome come to some kind of decision on Andy my worth it\nThank you for the call I appreciate it eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two\nAt the end of the day this is going to be a collective effort\nIf we're to dig out of this whole that we found ourselves in and we are in a whole as\nA country maybe not economically but you know the economy isn't the only thing\nI always hear them all the economy's doing fantastic I get that and that's great but it's not the only thing when it comes to our culture and our politics were in a hole right now\nAnd the only way to dig ourselves out of that whole just to take some responsibility for our part in getting there in the first place\n\nIf you don't like fake news go take a look at your post your own little research or you spreading it was actually a lot of people on social media who decry fake news who spread it\n\nTake a look at your inner circle what are you doing to make it better\n\nIt has to be a collective effort no one person is going to turn this thing around\n\nTo fix it all we're going to have to do this one on our own to were not the shoulders some of the load

F. L. A.\nHere this new show at in the new time nights from nine to midnight on news radio nine Seventy WFL a\nPM in Tampa Bay on this Monday October twenty nine thumb your hopes Brian Gorman with me in Studio we have news channel eight anchor Keith kid who you can follow on Twitter W. F. L. A. Keith and of course you can see 'em at five PM six PM an eleven PM how're you doing great right thank you so much for for swinging in here I haven't made over we're we're going to talk about your\nBig story coming up at eleven in a moment but just kind of going off the discussion that we've had you know over the course of the first hour on this show let's talk about the media and politics or for a moment I think there's a big difference between the local media\nAnd the national media I think there's greater trust in the local media and I think you guys have a far greater focused on reporting\nAs opposed to ... pining right or would you say that's the case I\nDefinitely the case I mean when you think of national politics I mean you think of in a national broadcast typically NBC CBS ABC the the big three if you will back in the day you get thirty minutes you take out the commercials you only have so much time so they really focus in on\nThe big stories of the day and politics is a big story during election cycles but here locally we're definitely concerned about we have ... many more hours that we can devote to local politics as well as news\nAnd we do I believe do a little better job on the local level obviously not the national level right on the local level of of letting you hear from your representatives your local elected officials\nHolding those who are running for office accountable for what they say and the follow up and let the viewers know a from a fact basis as you said on your program earlier we we try to get to the facts\nAnd just let people form their own opinions and that's where we come from we're not here to as you say oh pi yeah we're not editorializing about who should be the next senator the next governor and who failed who didn't we're asking questions and that's the that's the heart of what we do as as television journalists\nAnd look on cable news you know they're going twenty four seven I get ... ... there's a place for analysis and commentary the problem I think is the cable news is dominated by analysis and commentary and they're ... they I think they would be in a better place and there'd be a lot more trust if their model was more based off a local news broadcast\nOn a national level with a little less of the ...\nYeah I don't want to say how the networks and cable channel should run their bad enough survey and I have to do it I I Know I don't know I'm no fool here we know a lot of this has to do with with advertising has yeah they said oh yeah if you're watching a particular network you're going to be fit a certain amount of\nUh a diet of those commercials that would feed those particular viewers so no matter what you're a political persuasion there there's a ... year the word algorithms and all that sort of young but I'm In sales in sales I mean this is a there's a sales business going on on cable news\nWhat's the biggest difference in the job now as opposed to back in Nineteen eighty four when he started to date you\nNot time time out of what did you start to [laughter] if I were gonna do it or whatever but yeah I started in radio just like you know in radio you know I had to put a newscast on the air every half hour on the hour\nAnd we had to constantly update those uh update those stories in the world of politics we had what was called the town crier back in the day or the public affairs show and you would spend a half hour to an hour weekly on a topic\nToday you don't have that kind of time there's a there's an attention span that people have and when it comes to television you have to get it to them quickly efficiently and\nAnd to hold their attention it there's just not the amount of time that they're used to be long stories in segments where we bring a politician and maybe even talk to them live during the newscast yes you know where do you stand on red tide talk to me about taxes where are you on health care how am I going to be impacted if you are elected and what happens if the other guys elected or the gal whatever the case may be some quick\nClipping go viral nights when we have a political affairs program on WFL a news channel eight it airs Sunday right before meet the press so you can see we dedicate the time to it but it's not nearly the kind of time that you had back in the eighties in the nineties I don't think\nWe're talking to New Delhi anchor Keith Cade here on PM Tampa Bay real quick or issues with the national media having an impact with what you do locally or how you do it\nI don't think we're [noise]\nNo no I Would say right now are only where we are in our own laying them and you're going to watch I mean we're NBC affiliate and\nUh so what what Lester Holt and the team is doing it at the at the headquarters I mean that's kind of what they're doing we're not letting it dictate how we decide to cover Andrew Gillum yeah or run dissent is or you know whoever may be running a race\nWe're going to do it our way but I Do think it's interesting that the national media is watching our our race Holyoke closely ... are you are hot on the up and I think there is something to be said for this\nGillum campaign and enthusiasm if you'll let me just say for for half a second I was thinking when I came over here\nWhen I was in Iowa the Iowa caucuses I'd never been before the last election cycle I was there was fascinated with the way it works you can go to rallies you could go over and over and over and hear people say well Andrew Gillum Scott all of this moment um that's true there is a lot of momentum but so did Bernie Sanders centers that I could not believe what I Would go to a Bernie Sanders rally how many people show up\nBut Bernie Sanders did not win the election so I'm not sure it translates you vote however there was a big difference between when you go to a Hillary Clinton rallied versus Donald ... and I don't know if you've been an end to cover these events it does give you a feel for who's ...\nReport it to years if the state is so convinced that this man\nIs guilty\nProbably should have been put to death years ago I\nThink I mean forty two years on death\nRow that's a long time it's a long time and counting and from what I can tell I don't think there's any attention\nReally to execute Thomas Ziegler because I don't think the state can look themselves in the face and go I think we got it right I think there's a chance they got it wrong raises the question if they got it wrong is there a killer that is out there somewhere that they fail to look at why didn't they have all of the witnesses appear at the trial\nA wire the appeals falling on deaf ears millions of dollars have been spent keeping Thomas Ziegler alive he has a pro bono attorney\nAnd he has a bay area private investigator by the name of ... working on his behalf ... who has uncovered many new things that have been used in court\nSo tonight I'm going to I'm going to revisit the ... case or in hopes of keeping a spotlight on what to me seems to be a a an injustice that that someone could sit on death row for forty two years and counting\nAnd then there are bigger um issues at play here you know we we are a lot about criminal justice reform we hear a lot about the death penalty especially right now in light of the the situation that we saw it took place with a package bomber and with the uh Pittsburgh synagogues shooter the death penalty is back uh you know in discussion\nIt's back to the discussion but in the state of Florida is you know it's the law has changed so you need a unanimous decision and a judge can no longer over rule a jury that is unconstitutional today in the state of Florida back then that was allowed\nAnd so there had been changes there had been reforms that are improving but I think that we're going forward we will probably see fewer and fewer death row cases because it is the amount of money that it takes to prosecute death row K yeah and the fact that you could get it wrong rises way too many red flags for too many people and I think the jury's\nMental health is an ... a little mini angles that come along this and and you know when you start getting into the mental health issue using\nCan you get a jury to come together and say yeah let's let's put sending somebody to death it's getting harder and harder to do that and I think the state's not you know prosecutors really don't want to go down this road of of of spending that amount of money right I'm not saying I'm for or against the death in ... I'm just saying the facts of the case are millions of spin on this\nAnd Florida leads the nation when it comes to getting it wrong twenty seven men have been exonerated from Florida is death row that's more than any other state in the country\nThat's incredible yeah so this sounds like it's going to be an interesting story tonight you'll run through start to where we are today I absolutely eleven PM on news channel news channel eight anchor Keith kid who you can see it by PM six PM eleven PM and of course follow him on Twitter\nAt W. F. L. A. Keith Keith really appreciate the time thanks so much for coming in Studio to my pleasure thank you rise to you're getting real soon back\nA next with the latest on the package bomber the synagogue

politicians\nEntertainers and members of the media or there was another one that was sent to CNN there was intercepted at that Lana facility today so we had more than a hundred targets clearly if he
