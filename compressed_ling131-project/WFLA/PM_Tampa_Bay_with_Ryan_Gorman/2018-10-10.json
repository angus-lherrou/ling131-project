go a John thanks so much for the call we appreciate\nIt very clear\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number a real quick I Want to get through a couple a Florida stories here\n[noise] [noise] [noise] this one actually know this one is an out of Florida this at Indiana sorry\nOr a father is warning parents that mold may be lurking\nIn your child's juice box a camera in hardware posted a video and photos on Facebook to show the mold like substance inside a capri sun juice pouch see this wouldn't be a problem for me because I could never get the straw into the capri sun\nTo drink and in the first anyway I I don't I never understood that whole set up with ... sons it always seemed like you had to be so precise with how you lined up the straw to puncture that whole yeah you you use a pointy end but but still it\nYou couldn't get it now I still love ... as a kid I had run in my lunch box every day and you never had a problem with the straw sometimes you'll get like a tricky pouch yeah for the most part I seen that before I've seen is shared on Facebook before mold inside one of those package as\nAnd it's hard because you would never no no that's drawn and during the whole thing and make the third one\nThe ... yeah well that they have I guess some of the bottom is now or or see through but but I I just always had an issue it was almost like with chopsticks like if you got for\nWhite struggle you know what I mean if you've got a a a juice pack why make it to where you know when you're on the little box the ones booms drawing right in with capri sun you've got to look up at the stars you've got a law angle at a certain way you're going to get your ruler out and get a good tools out\nWhat to tell you because second graders across the country are able to somehow so I think that's a personal problem\nAh another story or this one out of the Salt Lake city area a two year old shredded over a thousand\nDollars of his family's cash oh no this is why I don't know if kids are apparently the ah parents' noticed an important envelope containing a thousand dollars a gun I'm seriously missing that have been trying to save up um\nTo pay back or the husband's parents for some season tickets to University of Utah football games and they were looking through the trash\nAnd then eventually they found it and the cash was in the shredder in a thousand tiny piece oh no oh this is horrible\nAnd they knew their their two year old was the culprit because apparently he had been helping shred junk mail and document\nSo they must have said hey you want to but it was sad and so you must have liked it and then he didn't know about ... search reading the cash\nMy by my initial thought is why did you two year old out a shred stopped by you know what if you can find something that'll keep a two year old ... get out of time and that's a chore you at what you mean that seems like a good idea you're like wow and that's very productive backfired though overall\nApparently the bureau of engraving and printing offers a solution in the event that something like this happens um they they've got a mutilated currency division which give this was devoted to redeeming burned waterlogged\nChemically altered rodent shoot or deteriorated money okay free service to the public it handles like thirty thousand claims a year and redeems more than a thirty million dollars in cash so there is actually a way if that were to happen\nTo you if you're a two year olds were to shreds over a thousand bucks a for you to get that money redeemed\nYou know a beleaguered president um and you kind of lost the fact that all that\nParent had gone on and then ever fused all those elements all that well and I think in this show where you have to be able to fuses that what happened a mystery into the more episodic format and I'm not sure they found that formula quite yet it's a tricky thing to do and not all shows can do it well\nAnd the other show that I've been to watch was the first the Sean Penn show on Hulu are about you know a a a manned mission to Mars\nIt was pretty good I mean I I didn't think it was great um I there was some odd aspects to it that\nLike if anybody watches the show there will be a mystery man they'll see and I really didn't know what was going on over there\nThat that that device really bugged me and if they are the very end because I thought that was going to build something that didn't yeah it's almost like that with the literary device and I I Wish that somebody had told him don't do that because it took me out of the show and it didn't need it the show doesn't need it now and I think it's\nSo interesting that the first came along and you know several weeks before the movie that's going to come out this weekend but I think a lot of us are very eager to see first man yeah and and this is a fictional version about somebody who is going into a ... a pioneering and very dangerous uh enterprise know what I thought the first dramatize really well\nWas this idea of the personal stories of these people who were going to make this ultimate sacrifice they make they may come back or they may not\nA lot of people thought it was going to be a show about that was going to be set on Mars and I know some people were disappointed because it wasn't but I liked the idea that it was telling me an astronaut story I hadn't seen before\nAbout the tensions but among the crew about the politics involved and all the other kinds of things that would go into actually putting a mission like this out there\nAnd also the psychological impact on the families\nAnd I think you know the character of sun pins daughter who was a troubled child and there were there was a family that felt a little bit like you know some you'd see in a regular TV show but Sean Penn was terrific I thought the woman who was the you know designated survivors first lady that yellow her off and then she moved over to this show\nAnd I thought she was terrific here playing the founder and the the person behind the entire project and so\nAs a as a as a as a drama goes I thought it was really strong and again it was the ... I hadn't seen the show before I I don't feel like you and to me that's that's worth ... that's that's worth a lot to see something that is trying something new and actually doing a pretty good job at it\nMy only complaint might have been I thought they probably could have done two or three seasons just leading up to the mission to Mars like they they could it could have been even more depth in terms of the personal challenges and things like that they knew it was kind of a lot for one season they skip ahead and certain parts but I enjoy it Sean Penn was excellent like usually is when the X.\nEvil was slow burns go I think that if they hadn't got taken off by the end of the first season there have been a bit of even more revolt against it then there was in some quarters a family like the show wasn't\nThey want to do ... and I and I had to have an ... to my to my knowledge they haven't been\nOne of the big pushes is to make it available in rural areas and they started this in Kentucky\nConnecting vets dot com reporter Jonathan ... tells us the idea is to get telecom firms to donate high speed\nConnection to lay down broadband cable so veterans can come to a central location and used how\nSome of the sites where ... go to talk with health care providers on big video screens part meeting halls of the American legion VFW for other veterans service organizations\nTo come up with areas in their post so when veterans go to get their treatment or their with other veterans as well as Henry connecting ... dot com\nOr CBS News to experience relief or muscle cramps and your legs and feet used their works really fast acting foam get their works released today and the pain relief violate your local pharmacy or their works relief dot com\nAir traffic and whether by heart radios nine Seventy WFL a [noise]\nThe traffic center powered by Burgess heating and air on the interstates big bridges and toll roads throughout ... counties nobody's ... sections southbound on two Seventy five in palmetto VR preempted north of Seventy bucks shut down for ongoing roadwork players get off at forty one years ... as your alternate there\nIn the past go county area north bound lanes of us Nineteen we're getting reports of a coalition at marine park way to expect some minor delays Steve Foster news radio nine Seventy WFL but [noise] windy conditions\nExpected on Wednesday as hurricane Michael passes off to our west out in the Gulf will see the potential for some coastal flooding with higher than normal high tide cycles expected for the next couple of days both Wednesday and Thursday fast moving showers and thunderstorms expected on Wednesday it's about a fifty percent rain chance\nWindy conditions with high temperatures in the upper eighties still breezy on Thursday of forty percent rain chance those high temperatures back in the upper eighties I knew she had a late meteorologist ... a news radio nine Seventy WFL a\nI'm rich Dennison hurricane Michael now a category ... storm was wins or more than one hundred twenty\nMiles an hour is expected to make landfall along the Florida Panhandle around noon tomorrow governor Rick Scott urging residents to pay attention to emergency personnel\nIf you don't follow the warnings from these officials the strong and kill you forecasters\nSay Michael is pushing a deadly storm surge of up to Thirteen feet President Trump is in southwest Iowa holding another GOP campaign rally in those planes to allow the sale of higher ethanol content fuels throughout the year unleashing\nThe power\nOf the Fifteen to\nCountry all year long not necessarily\nWas so cold winter blend year round will help reduce gas prices and booze corn production helping farmers critics say the move will harm the environment\nAnd this is Fox News [noise]\nThis audio is for your review for ...

and joining me now for our weekly tech segments wants to connect was helping their partners their head of technology we have seen it senior editor Bridget Kerry who you can follow on Twitter at Brigitte Carrie\nIt's an all Google tech segment today because they're making a lot of news to a there was a Google event in New York City this morning correct\nYes and Google announced a bunch of new gadgets along with a they're highly talked about new takes on\nLet's go back before we get into today's event because they've got this big event where the rolling out all these new products it's supposed to be very exciting time for Google you yesterday this is from your website CNN dot com of vulnerability in the Google Plus social network expose the personal data\nOf up to five hundred thousand people using the site between twenty Fifteen and march twenty Eighteen\nOf Google said about new evidence of data misuse still as part of the response to the incident Google plans to shut down the social network permanently the most surprising thing to me wasn't the data a you know ... was breach or anything like that our exposed it was that some five hundred thousand people still use Google Plus who knew\nWell well actually if you think back to two thousand Fifteen a lot of people did um\n[laughter] you know that yes who's who's got\nThe plug you want to be on my space to these people I mean come on yeah\nYeah I Know I Know but the the ... got people kind of like I'm bothered by this news is that Google never reported\nIt and so people you know although there was nothing nefarious in terms of the information used perhaps because they couldn't find anything but it leaves a lot of questions as to okay when there are problems with these massive companies\nAnd they see that there could be a vulnerability or way that people have seen private data should we as consumers know or do we only get to know when it's already been used in the wrong hands so so this is a discussion of disclosure\nAnd should Google have said anything and do we as customers deserve to know when there's like this big window where people could have seen are private profiles and done something with it you know\nI mean we absolutely should know so we can ... take some steps or keep a closer eye on ah some important activity financial activity online activity or to make sure people are using that information\nRight in this case it looks like um uh what was accessible was the kind of stuff you'd have set to private in a profile\nYour home address your phone numbers that kinda thing no financial information\nOkay but it's still uncomfortable and so and so here we go about to have a big event showing you all the reasons why you need Google in your life monitoring everything gadgets at a list just quickly killed Google Plus because that was\nA mess [laughter] um so that was awkward\nAnd how they address its day was not actually mentioned in it but instead talking about how much they care about your security and how how secure devices are so I'm kind of I guess talking about it in a backwards way\nWell I think the big picture issue to me is if they didn't report this what else are they potentially reporting because the Google Plus isn't used by a lot of people but other Google Services are so and Mike were actually\nYeah there is a lot unknown sometimes about cybersecurity world what I'm seeing from some experts say hey you know what a lot of companies find vulnerabilities\nBut but that's what you do is part of being you know a computer engineer you're like oh I found you know a little mistake was corrected and unless there's something wrong a lot of them say there shouldn't be any different poured it because nothing happened you know it's like finding a glitch that you fix\nBefore it gets out um I think the when you hear about a ... like this on a social network right after Facebook had this whole incident up with its problems\nWere all little an easy and uh there needs to be just more clarification on what goes on\nFor doing our weekly tech segment sponsored by connect wise would seen a senior editor Bridget carry you can follow on

news radio seventies ballet [noise] go when you went to be clear water\nGood evening I'm Dina meals are top story is six the strongest hurricane to ever hit the Florida Panhandle came ashore at one forty five this afternoon near Mexico beach with one hundred and fifty five mile per hour sustained winds just two miles per hour short of a category five and gusts up to one hundred and Seventy five\nAnd it's still a category three late still rolling into Georgia at a hundred fifty miles per hour maximum sustained wins this\n... and what's been interesting to watch with this storm you know when Irma was coming towards us it was a slow build across the Atlantic and it became a monster and we just watch this monster make its way towards us for felt like forever days right um but but it was pretty steady and consistent\nFlorence was basically the same way Florence develop pretty quick in the Atlantic but it was a strong powerful category ... storm as it made its way through the Carolinas\nBoth of those storms once they really hits\nOnce once Irma hit a in southwest Florida and one's Florence hit in the Carolinas they both are weak and very quickly in fact they weekend as they were approaching land so the Carolinas didn't get hit with the category for\nAnd Florida didn't get hit at least on the southwest part of the keys got hammered but on the southwest part uh and when it came through the Tampa Bay area it was not a category for was it was a much weaker storm\nWhat happened with Michael was their ritual forecasts had possibly a tropical storm coming up to the panhandle than it was maybe a category one then maybe a category two last night when we when we were on the air talking to meteorologist it was probably it was a category three at that point it might become a category four\nAnd then today it wound up almost making it to a category five\nAnd it just exploded a short period of time right is right almost as it was going to landfall you have to win streets were still going up the last update right before landfall it bumped it up to one fifty and then one fifty five one it made landfall so it was extraordinary to watch and just you were talking about on the\nLast year when it hit the keys was a hundred and thirty miles an hour when it moved further up a little bit of went down to a cat three are that are ready to go into Marco Island yeah were turned and\nWent up to us about a category one maybe a week we category too when the roll through some of our listening area\nA this was a different story this storm kept strengthening as it approached the coastline uh which was incredible and did an incredible amount of damage I mean if this storm is hurricane Michael had made that hard right turn a that we would have gotten wiped out here in the bay area I mean it would have been catastrophic\nAnd think about how many times we have said that over the past ten years we had in hurricane Charlie we started last year in ... you know in these storms keep coming and you look at the number of storms that have taken this track and this one the one that compared to most was Nineteen Ninety five\nMaybe ... hurricane ... life weren't around the same exact area in the Caribbean around the Yucatan strengthen rapidly into a storm and then it hit somewhere around\nBetween Pensacola up around the Alabama\nOr Alabama Florida wind but these trucks with the storms you know this time of year in September and October\nYou see these intense storms and then you'll see him getting more and more intense yup\nAnd and the intensity and the size of some of these storms over the last couple years has been just devastating a devastating and where we didn't even mentioned Hurricane Maria a and the damage that did last\nYear so last year you had Irma yeah Harvey and you had Maria who did a lot of damage and then this year you at Florence who really had a big impact in the Carolinas and now a you've got hurricane Michael doing what it's done to Appalachia cola or I mean Mexico City the Mexico beach or just got completely destroyed\nA in Bay county has some of the images I'm looking at him right now uh CNN scaring some of the video out of Mexico Beach Florida a just a houses leveled a the the water is in places it shouldn't it looks like a you know they just kinda put these houses in the middle of an ocean\nRight you know just you can see the storm surge on only upper arch coal they were talking about boats displaced cars underwater houses underwater but they whereas Florence was more a rain event were parked over the Carolinas for you know the better part of twenty four hour yeah this was definitely the surge and the wind event that you know we also fear or the other components of the storm\nIt's it's hard to make the case that anybody in the panhandle right now is lucky the only instance where they're a little bit lucky as the storm move that a good clip it it it moved its moving right now are at about let me see here it's moving aunt's\nThirteen miles per hour north north east\nUh and it's moved between Thirteen to Fifteen miles per hour generally over the past twenty four hours so it didn't linger a over that area for too long as almost a category five storm one thing I found fascinating was a this was out of the Tampa Bay times\nAnd it's kind of an explainer as to why we didn't get\nHurricane Michael here in the Tampa Bay area\nYou don't have we been complaining over the past month about the heat it's so hot to record hot September when is the heat gonna go away\nWhile the heat's helped keep Michael away from us uh apparently\nHurricane Michael was kept in place in on that particular track up towards uh the Panama City area or buy a leftover summertime weather pattern\nThat's been you know doing its thing here in in southeast Florida and in our Tampa Bay area this is according to forecasters with the national weather center it's a typical summertime pattern\nAn area of high pressure it's this year the generally settles over the southeastern portion of Florida for the duration of the season\nThis year the high pressure has been especially persistent resulting in one of the hottest September is on record that fick air pressure acted as a shield keeping the hurricane at a distance\nSo it with out that extremely hot September ... record hot September or if that hadn't taken place there's a chance that we don't know where the storm could ... it could have taken that heart rate eastern and come right for us\nRight and that's what they're called blocking highs they come into a lot of times and play with these storm system whether it's it moves over Florida weather muzzle eastern Florida then you've got a trough in a cold front that may drop in this time of year which will drag it where it's going to go across\nA Georgia the Carolinas eventually back out to see but you know that weather pattern you know depending on where it sets up\nYou know he'd have been that long which today is or you know drives the storm elsewhere\nA meteorologist quoted in this uh Tampa Bay times article said quote the pressure itself prevented the storm from moving east and help keep it in the Gulf of Mexico a storm can't really move through an area of high pressure so it has to go around it and that's exactly what happened unfortunately or fortunately for us unfortunately for the post in the panhandle who have had\nThis storm going to have on red tide is there is going to wipe it out or is it going to push more to the shore like\nMillion dollar question yeah we're asking ... typically with a storm like this you would hope it would either drag it out but the position of it may have pushed morbid back towards that goes\nRight it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out um but but in terms of the power outages real quick I Know feel like you've been tracking that how bad is the situation up in the pan ...\nFrom the panhandle um they their power company a goal power they stretch from about a blunt sound over to the uh Pensacola area they were putting out a hundred and Seventeen thousand a five hundred outages it stayed pretty consistent throughout the day and they got out of\nThe other foreigners details and customers they have they are about twenty five percent which is Maine or read about the same house she's a little bit of a different story and kind of surprising because right now they're about sixty three thousand customers without power\nIn Tallahassee and we've been watching the radar and you know I've been talking about it and really they've been dodging a lot of the heavy rains so interesting to see but a lot of trees so out of our lines\nAre coming up next we'll check in with the weather channel the latest on

F. L. A. and legal analyst Felix Vegas\nWere doing some hurricane Michael coverage lots to talk about and joining us on the hotline right now we have whether it's you know meteorologist mark dip into a mark how are you I'm doing good my friend how're you doing\nGood thanks so much for joining us so last night when we talk to you we were discussing whether or not this thing could strengthen into a category for it was category three at the time or it almost made it to a category five so it\nReally did it got very about it's about as close as we can get without actually being a five in fact I Wonder uh myself when they go back and they actually studied this and this will be a case study\nA because there's never been a storm made landfall in many years at this particular strength there's been plenty storms on the Gulf that have been a strength yeah but there is never been a storm since hazel which is back in the fifties\nThat is actually made landfall with max sustained wind up a hundred and fifty five miles an hour and just for our listeners one fifty six is a category five so yes this thing has been a over achiever as we call them ... as far as hurricanes go\nWhat was it caused it to strengthen so quickly as it approached land\nWell I think what happened with the storm is it bought off the drier very well to the north and west ah the water is very shallow and it's very warm\nOn your apple electrical a bay and that hurricane took full advantage of that and it was able to do something that not many hurricane and can the canes canoe is able to modify its own environment or around the hurricane and actually modify the atmosphere for hundreds of miles around it which in turn\nOr let the hurricane to ingest Ninety degree water which was in front of it and I almost zero wind shear so that open the door for this to become a total monster\nWhich did and I I have a feeling of the pictures are just coming in the videos just young and I'm feeling when we look at this completely this is going to go down as one of the worst hurricane to ever hit the Florida Panhandle if not one of the ... the worst um even right now as a move inland up through Georgia\nYou're still a category three is that how impressive is that in terms of taking a look at the hurricane that five hours later it's still a category three overland\nA that is extremely impressive um that's a very very impressive the wind is a you know I'll be interested to see what the seven PM physician is in the wins a that does come out or if they wait till eight PM see what it is them because ah\nThe fact that this is a right now especially as a six PM which has moved further north east since then\nUh it was fifty miles south west all Albany, Georgia right now it looks to me like it's about maybe thirty five miles or so south west of Albany, Georgia the maximum sustained winds are a hundred and Fifteen miles an hour now that being said in all fair play ah the hurricane does look like it's starting to lose its I feature\nIs beginning to feeling a little bit so I Would say at best were maybe a strong category too right now okay a an unofficially\nOfficially it's still a hundred and Fifteen miles an hour now the thing is moving off to the northeast at Thirteen miles an hour and a cold front that we're talking about yesterday comes in from the lower Mississippi Valley from Arkansas on Texas\nAnd picks us up that's going to shoot this thing northeast overnight so we are going to be looking at a lot of trees coming down with a rapidly moving decaying very strong hurricanes and moved up across southern and central Georgia I think it Lana Georgia will probably miss the absolute strongest wins\nA but even in that area we can be looking at them brief spin of tornadoes in the Northeast Corridor into dirty side of the hurricane like we're talking about an hour last night that or the side of it and then a big win straw into for central South Carolina places like Colombia and maybe Charleston towards the morning\nOr you take your turn the gusto maybe three or four in the morning and then I buy term afternoon we're going to be looking at probably some a high winds across Columbia South Carolina that's how fast the thing is moving so it gets out quick but it leaves a nasty markets and move them by\nIt's been quite a back to back hurricane season ah for the United states I mean last year with the with the huge storms this year with two big ones\nAre coming later in the year it's it's really been something very unfortunate too familiar is getting affected a mark ... Weather Channel meteorologist we really appreciate the time will tell you getting real soon\nOkay sounds good to be safe\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number in the next segment will go up to the panhandle and talked to somebody who's been on the ground there and get a feel for what they experienced as hurricane Michael this historic hurricane made its way a on shore earlier today more PM Tampa Bay and eighty\nFive sixteen K A day from ... am to ... pm your next chance to win a thousand bucks coming up at six past the top of the hour on nine Seventy WFL a\n[noise] trafficking when they're in less than Thirteen minutes you are listening to be in Tampa Bay with Brian Gorman on nine Seventy WFL a\nDamn sample bam your host Ryan gourmet in with me in Studio my producers ... also nine Seventy W. F. L. A. and legal analyst Felix Vegas coming up just after the top of the hour Tampa Bay times military reporter Howard Allman who's in one of those are hurricane hunter flights civil\nOr find out what that experience was like right now on the hotline from the Florida news network we have Rick Flag who's live up in Tallahassee Rick how're you\nDoing good doing good we came through All right so nasty store out there just finishing up a recurrence of the areas and fell as he\nGot trees down everywhere we got up with what's but a real serious damage this yet but I can find here in Tallahassee\nSo so was that the big concern and the Tallahassee\nArea you know you're not along the coast for the storm surge was it the fact that there are so many trees there and that it was likely with the wind speeds that we're seeing some of them are going to come down\nThat was a ... as far as they had predicted originally so the completely which was\nA rather nice I'm Still wins in fact this is now the one thing I discovered is that has apparently are unaware that I'm an intersection where the traffic but it's always\nA people always forget how that up and how that works it's silly Australian\nThrough um like maniacs and it's like I I just get stationed here so I can finally relax [laughter]\nOver now it I mean every storm and you know we try to remind people if the lights are out of four way stop and people just ... passed in ... I'm All right so what what was uh the the worst part of it for you in Tallahassee\n... were there a hurricane strength wins that hit the area but you were in\nWe did not get actual hurricane strength with I think the worst get was somewhere just under Seventy four so yet below that\nI'm honestly\nIt's part was waiting for it or not or what we the original forecasts had this thing coming right over Tallahassee so everyone was expecting the worst when it's sort of there there was the last minute hitch up north into Georgia you know we we got to get the eastern side of it which is the worst but we avoided the direct hit and uh\nWe we got lucky you know all of our ... year but the generators kicked in\nAnd and you guys you guys are in that\nEastern part of the storm you didn't experience any tornado a tornadic activity or anything like that right\nDid we lose ... I think we lost them\nAll right we'll try to get him back on the line and see if a piece alright there uh it sounds like a they were able to write out the storm a pretty well in Tallahassee\nBecause again it didn't quite go directly over them like the original forecasts had stayed more to the west of Tallahassee and\nThat was the main concern and like we've been talking about that was one thing they were concerned about the most was the trees coming down not because they're further inland there was predicting storm surge was really you know looking at the city itself that was their biggest problem was they were worried about damage as we're seeing the power outage is still a climbing up to about sixty four thousand\nAre approaching that right now but I think as we were watching the radar alternatives very surprising to see the storm lifting up in a way\nAnd clearing you know the most of it there's the bans deliberate heavy has stayed far enough west to them so I think spare them the brunt of the storm we were saying\nYeah Panama City Appalachian coal and those were the areas that really got hit by the storm surge and got hit with some of the flooding and all of that Tallahassee\nIt sounds like according to Rick they never even got to hurricane strength wins so very lucky for ... for them because if they were to get hit with those you know hundred thirty hundred forty a hundred and fifty miles per hour winds with the amount of trees that are up there it would've been a far worse situation than what they are likely to have experienced over the past few hours\nAnd wondering you know one thing I wanted to ask where it can we still had him was the fact that you did they get a sense from emergency officials that they were even\nMore prepared less prepare yeah last time they got the wedding was her mean that went up that way because this happened so quickly and moving you know getting everyone into place getting prepared as quickly as they would have to getting a sense of like what the comparison between this storm in the last storm even given the intensity of the storm as well\nI think that's what caught people off guard the most the fact that it it it became so intense\nSo fast you know when it came to Irma or even Florence uh we we can see those storms coming from a mile away you know we knew exactly for the most part\nWhat to expect we prepared for the worst luckily it didn't turn out as bad as a we have gotten as bad as some of the forecast said it might be um but we had a lot of time to prepare and and we we knew there was a potential it can be a category for category five hitting our area at the same for the Carolinas\nThis storm is a little bit different because the original forecasts at a tropical storm maybe a category one and then all of a sudden it's too it's three now you know people went to bed last night with it as a three day wake up today and it's almost a five\nA and and I think that can be really frightening\nAnd a lot of people that were not able to get out or they saw locate which is gonna be a two or three we Britain that out before\nAnd you know paint on city the officials were extremely concerned because they had reports about twenty five thousand people stayed out on the barrier island yeah we still have not seen essentially what the condition for them was how many you know hopefully no one was hurt or seriously injured or even\nYou know lost their lives but that was one biggest concern is people didn't feel like they had enough time to get out it was either\nYou cut and run and leave your house behind him you know pray to God is still there yeah or because you didn't have time to you because you've got to ride it out you put up a\nBoard up your windows up your doors get all your belongings and you have like we normally would have so that's gonna be interesting to see how those people feared after the storm wants to get out there\nYou know the barrier islands that's a bad place to be when a storm like this rolls through just taking a look at at uh the Mexico a beach area I mean\nUh the way they got hammered I Can't imagine the barrier islands didn't get hit that hard as well and I go back to Rick Flag from the Florida news network was on a hotline with us Rick\nReal quick question for you or emergency officials I'm sure you've talked to some of them and you've been monitoring the work they're doing do they have a good handle on uh what took place being that the storm's strength in so much over the past twenty four hours\nYou know they I think they're still trying to put everything together\nAnd it's there there's still adding up but they have a ... here in Tallahassee it's not that bad you go over in the pan handle it looks like a bomb went off in some places in fact we were talking earlier today to the emergency operations center in liberty county which is to the west ... street and they said tell everyone here to stop calling nine one one or communications than it was not up to\nThe store and we had the most everything into a different operations so\nYeah it it had an impact in the panhandle\nA law on the roads are terrible there are trees everywhere I look at the list we've got probably over ... roads Tallahassee are closed by downed trees while but you know honestly we've still got lucky yeah that would actually get lucky on this one the panhandle did not Mexico beach Panama City wants town ...\nThey've got a really really hard well Rick uh we're glad you're safe uh we'll let you get back to going out there on the streets and telling people to a stop at a a a a light that's out that's a four way stop maybe ... maybe make assigned go put it out there so they know what to do\nYeah will break for food [laughter] Ricky take care glad you're safe\nThat their life or coming up next after the\nTop of the hour we'll talk the Tampa Bay times military reporter Howard all men who was on a hurricane hunter flights for hurricane Michael that's next on ...\nRadio nine Seventy WFL a\nWednesday October then what's new today on the free I her radio\nFor decorating the house or just setting the dairy mood\nComments by the platelets has Joe ... with labor in my life and we've\nEveryone's talking about like the fantasy football or saw\nThe Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite said\nNews radio seventies ballet WXXI the\nTwelve thousand feet and you're flying right into the storm only tell you\nWait so you see you're not above the clouds anymore at that point in their you know and you're out and you start hitting me out or bans and you're shaking your did two in two three jeez\nAre strapped in for you about two and a hundred feet or show and the planes can withstand those points you they're amazing um and so you fly in and then you see this I wall is just the most stunning sight clear blue calm let me go back out again\nThey are hitting the turbulence and and so I mean if these can be very dangerous flights there was a counter like it a couple of years ago there was a flight that was a it was actually find a mission or a Nova Scotia area\nAnd in the we're for an hour and they had a um saw up at altitude the free engines\nAnd so they're kind of going down and there's no way they could survive but fortunately they went through a rainstorm and it kind of got the engines going again our ... show I mean there's these the the men and women are no risk their lives to gather the data helps really save lives by being able to\nGive it ... you know intensity and the direction of storms so it's always a pleasure to go with those folks did they have any\nIdea that the storm was going to become or even intensified more like a dating so quickly right before landfall based on the data that they record collecting out in the show they were there\n... by but once we were on this flight they knew they knew that it was going to testify or was he turned into a category phrase are out there\nAnd uh they knew what we got the flight and and the fight director rich Channing said that this is going to hit landfall as a category for an intention finances through the awful to the people are gonna be in a world of trouble\nIt on on the coast up there and you know like my thoughts in or out there is a little advice for those people they're going through hell right now\nAnd when you were flying over the storm on this flights you didn't in this particular flight you didn't go over the eyes so you know with that\nProbably about ten thousand feet higher than we were we were consuming was accused like white you know it's like flying inside of a pillow\nOr it's we got close to the Iowa bouncing a little bit get some turbulence frankly it was nothing that you have any experience on a commercial flight okay and and nothing like the the the pizzeria we when we got to the air operations center at at in the lake when I saw one of the pilots I knew from the the three is coming up a flight\nAnd he was just say oh my God that was the worst that was like this was not fun ... professionals shore ah you know because he spanning\nSix eight ten hours sometimes long or\nA beep bouncing around like inside a blind eye substance on line but it's you know it's it can get a little scary were they also surprised by not only the how fast to intensify like we were talking about but\nJust the Fort Worth speed of it we were talking to one of the major out is when the weather channel and basically it just kind of barreled its way through the Gulf\nAnd didn't lose any steam bright but to have it hit land what were their thoughts on that were just\nThey were trying to I mean they were gathering data and framed from the data that they were gathering terms of the water temperature and all the other things they are they weren't really surprised by that because the data showing that this is this is going to happen um most of the big surprises came earlier is this thing managed to testify despite the the wind shear\nYeah and they they had no idea as to why that was happening that something they're going to have to look\nThey're going to have to get into that and well you know get the warm waters of the Gulf and that's a that's a big factor and having it was particularly the late fees and\nYou've got the the storms of the pop up in the Gulf patient but then you've got a couple of storms out there and you laminate dean and yes if you get the other one uh they Leslie still tours around a little trailer out there so we're\nWe're trying to Tampa Bay times our military reporter Howard Albany or you can follow on to what our age all men he was on a hurricane hunter flight yesterday flying over hurricane Michael\n... the the wind shear issue what what interests me and this is something I brought up to a meteorologist that we had on in the last hour is that you had Irma and you add Florence that were big powerful storms category fours and a minimum and\nThey weekends you know as they came onto the coastline a but Michael ... Michael kept getting stronger and stronger and stronger or all the way up until it was completely over the panhandle so it it acted in a much different way than to the more recent storms\nWith one of the reasons why they want it to a examine what the environmental aspects of this storm or so they can figure out what happened I mean it because it popped up so quick\nYou know a lot of the environmental factors that might diminish it didn't really get that affect your the warm water and it was you know bringing a energy up you didn't have anything to stop that mouse once they realize that this dry air wasn't coming anywhere close to the core they knew it was basically you know the doors open this thing is barreling right up to the coast\nI'm In a covered the military and yeah during the ... force base which is a just a southeast of Panama City ah they have extensive damage that was where that's where they have the raptor twenty two rappers amazing fighter\nAnd the the thirty eight talent trainers attacking them on Monday and they said they were going to you know they knew this has come and so they were flying out the sheltering some of the aircraft replace her flat out most of them to go to a fiftieth raptors in about twenty some towns um so and now they don't even know the extent of the damage there really are off\nA power lines are down to like cities um but they don't know if the root of the condition runway at least the last thing I check on her Facebook page about an hour or so ago so they're gonna tomorrow they're going to really take a look and see how badly damage that is\nDo they usually have everybody who's on the base hunker down there or did they evacuate and go to other places\nEvacuate they've actually all nine essential personnel how do they need so people could place running but they evacuated all non essential personnel and I think they're still out until\nA or a Thursday or so at least a is a is a a\nAnalyze how badly it said here MacDill air force base uh obviously with no real major in Tampa everything's you know was normal um so that's\nReally the crystal river area north of us that citrus county area was about the closest that ... area that really saw some effects from the storm an island in her native down\nIts wife MacDill air force base ever get fit with direct a storm it's going to be it's gonna be devastating to so much that it's it's all alone line the new Showtime building that they built a is is actually take into account\nThe storm they have some most of the equipment oil attracts everything's up up higher so with and it can withstand hurricane force winds\nUh I don't know I don't think it's a shame that the ... building which is much older so and and much of that will be underwater\nIt'll be interesting to see the comparisons between what happened in the panhandle versus what happened with Andrew in homestead air force base which was pretty much you know decimated in that store under very similar conditions with a high winds and homes that being further inland versus Jindal being very close to the cubs he handles got a hundred\nAnd twenty six miles of coastline a hundred and twenty miles of coastline and I think twenty six acres or twenty six thousand acres of land so it's big it's a big a\nRice a show yet originally I'm Wondering one or the uh flight directors on a flight yesterday a jak parish e as his homes destroyed and Andrew so he knows he's always noticed is like automatic homes destroyed\nWhere it's going to Tampa Bay times military reporter Howard Altman here on the Tampa Bay final think I Want to touch on the story did last week a pass\nFail man has been accused of counterfeiting currency using a printer at a public library\nI some people check out books um you know leave I knew ... decided he was going to make ... for money\nYou been doing some reporting for past couple\nOf weeks back now but a subtly Pascal kind of stories all the the detectors that there are noticing an uptick in a in ... for a cases and and so this was this was one of the machine really two things one is\nAh people printing off things and and as technology improves it gets harder and the other thing is there are some folks are washing off like tens\nOr and turning to hire denominations there was a woman that they are they serve the arrest warrant in in jail because she'd been there she was in jail for shoplifting you know and they're saying is is a result of the opioid crisis that people\nIn a guy and sophisticated now that depends can't tell so you can walk in one of these bills and to do the penthouse in there just walk out and you know and if you decide you want to use a printer the librarian helps our library you know it's just amazing\nUh Well Howard I'm In Tampa Bay times military Puerto Rican fall on Twitter at a job and thanks so much for coming in and ... telling us about the flight or their picture\nThere is that you have to pitch you have a ... on TV oh Jack ...

joining us is mayor Tallahassee and democratic candidate for governor Andrew Gillum mayor Gillum how are you\nI'm doing okay doing okay I'm actually you know you said that he did go right now survey some of the damage in my\nCity of but er I'm just thankful I'm thankful to be on this side of the storm now\nAbsolutely will our thoughts are with uh all of your constituents and everybody up there in the panhandle we've been watching it very closely from here in the Tampa Bay area or tell us a little bit about the lead up to landfall today did the quick strengthening of this storm surprise you guys at all\nWell I'll tell you I'm going back to the day we thought we were public dealing with some kind of a tropical system I\nDon't think anybody expected that this thing with the packing or a hundred and fifty mile per hour winds coming ashore literally seven miles of a lower than a category five hurricane yeah um but but the fortunate thing is is that I think certainly in our community\nWe had the fortune of of good planning and we were able to get over a hundred utility a lineman organize our city\nThe storm ever hit with a with about three hundred more\nArriving tomorrow I'm nearly a bringing our total of six times are normal sized security um so I think that will help us to recuperate and and honestly I have to say I get my heart really goes out to those and the coast that you know you saw\nThe images of ... something like a breach this yeah this you know we got to be there for them and and when the quicker we can get up and going the\nQuick and we can be an age our neighbors\nWere talking to mayor of Tallahassee and democratic candidate for governor Andrew Gillum here on PM Tampa Bay what was the big concern in the Tallahassee area was it because you're not along the coast of storm surge isn't really an issue for you was it the wind speeds and the and the fact that you guys have so many trees up there\nYeah we we we we did have an issue with a good they're concerned about flash flooding if the storm had over a come over at a slow fade um history without a the\nWind and rain a ... and the fact that are almost fifty percent of my city has recover and that's pretty significant or urbanized areas like hours long of a if by the way and this is this tour that I'm doing right now\nWe think of countless with the fleas around a little place across you know streets that are now not pass through your life going on down there you're theloop polls literally snapped and a half\nOr so we've got a good deal of work that you are starting tomorrow morning but um we're ready for a proper preparation and now it's time to\nGet to work it's hard to consider yourself lucky when you see some of the destruction that you're seeing right now I'm ... the storm really did seem to avoid Tallahassee at least the worst of it or the way the route that it wound up taking\nA were you guys surprised by that because most of the tracks really had to come and write words you guys\nI'm telling you we reach out a blessing or we really did because while if you're you're right to point out that really uh you know got away it is an odd but yeah that has a whole that had three through it I'm sure they would not agree with my ... sure but\nBut but by and large we got the whole a community level it could've ... who's been a much worse you know my community is now will practice that storm at three and a half years\nOr that we had to deal with are being followed by Irma uh and now obviously Michael I'm On the ... the only the upside to it is that in spite of all the trees that I'm the guy right now it probably could have been\nMuch much worse at we've not had some of these trees shaking a couple of years ago I'm a that being said we're not trying to focus on on are getting activity back to one hundred and then doing everything we can to reach out to our neighbors and ensured that ah ah you know that that that we could get that back as well", "year":
