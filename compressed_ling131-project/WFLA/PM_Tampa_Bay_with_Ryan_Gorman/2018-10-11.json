WFL age [noise] I Do when you went to be clear water\nRadio station [noise] good evening I'm being a mills our top story and six residents and first responders in the panhandle\nSay the devastation from hurricane Michael is even worse than expected Florida Senator Marco Rubio says the news is as bad as feared in Mexico beach where the storm with one hundred and fifty five mile per hour sustained winds made landfall\nAnd the Mexico beach and then into your right to know air force base so getting the drones out there yeah something that you and I were kind of briefly touched on but a couple of years ago a lot of insurance companies were moving to using drones\nFor the damage assessments in order to get a better idea because what you see on the ground really does give you a big no what is going on\nNow and and there's also some helicopter footage that we're seeing today as as you know the helicopters have finally been launched and people can do and survey the area but just looking in Mexico beach right now\nI mean the images are it literally looks like a bomb went off a along that entire community it you know you don't know why some houses which stood hurricane some houses didn't can be how they were built um you know and and some of it I think in certain situations just luck\nOr some sometimes it's just you know what's around the house there's a lot of different variables that can that can play into all of this but for the most part when you look in Mexico beach most of it is destroyed right regardless of of the location of the house or our was built I mean\nAs soon as he was you know 'cause some of that I there was an watching the footage this afternoon and there was some places where you would see three still houses that were looked fairly new yeah and then there was just utter devastation like across the inlet where their boats were just piled up and like smash into the houses right houses or\nYou know wiped away and it's just amazing that you see the power not only the storm surge and the combination of the wind\nYou know suppose we saw him for its which was just your rain event yeah powerful as it was but this is just the worst case scenario there really was the panhandle\nAnd you know you got to have a well built a house that could withstand the winds of hurricane hurricane Michael but if a boat comes barreling into it or a car because of the storm surge then there's not a lot you know they know that\nDepends on the damage ... especially when the storm surge damage I knew how to do doing damage to the actual structure as opposed to you you know a branch coming down or tree coming down in that rushing house oh this is just to see the although slabs of where a matching warehouses work and they're gone\nTo like Hungary Italy destroyed and and what's fascinating about this storm is as the five PM advisory it's still a tropical storm\nIt's now moving towards its any tornadoes interpret genius yeah a newer thirty hours out from one it made landfall yesterday\nAnd and uh if if you look at the far out forecast for this this storm it's going to go back out into the Atlantic ocean and it could actually impact to Europe as a tropical storm I I mean it's just it it's incredible from something that\nUh a couple of days ago we thought might just be a tropical storm or maybe a category one hurricane hitting the pan handle it wound up being one of the most powerful storms\nEver to strike the continental us and I gotta tell ya over the past twenty four hours or so I've been kind of monitoring the coverage and it feels like this storm isn't being taken quite as seriously as other storms Florence got a lot of coverage\nOr you know with the flooding and all that we know Irma got a ton of coverage last year or early got a ton of coverage before it even hit Florida um and and Harvey got a lot of coverage\nOr Maria for a variety of different reasons that a lot of coverage and this one seems like it's going to be an afterthought really quick which is a shame for the pan handle 'em because they're they're being affected by this in a huge way a lot of people's lives are just completely destroyed\nIt ended up rooted in when you look at a news coverage because you think about those stores where we know they're they're coming for a long period of time news crews are in place for a number of days of yelling at not just this one like it started Sunday it made landfall Wednesday so when you're moving around you know these news crews are taking like Lester holder and CNN or whether it's you know people and getting them in place\nAnd then you have where it was a safe place for them to be right with the million dollar question but\nYou know I Hope it's not lost on them to because the recovery effort is going to be so it is dynamic and so extraordinary in terms of just people getting back into their homes that they still have a home in those people who get back to Mexico beach like what are they looking\nFor I I I don't know on the Mexico beach front and even parts of Panama City I I don't even know what they're going to do when they get back it's just it's all completely destroyed so I went through a cable news prime time last night because I wanted to see how this was handled\nAnd and I was I was stunned okay CNN you at Anderson Cooper he did his entire show\nOn hurricane Michael ... again prime time we're talking about starting at eight o'clock so this is you know just after the storm had really hit the pan handle it was still making its way through Georgia and into Carolina so it's it's a big event is still at that point okay\nI'm Cuomo on CNN after Anderson Cooper all but nine minutes a of the shows are so pretty much the entire show was devoted to to hurricane Michael coverage when you get to the other news networks Fox News\nTucker Carlson spent five minutes on five minutes out of his whole show Sean Hannity two minutes out of his whole show\nLaura Ingram zero minutes she never covered hurricane Michael so the entire Fox News prime time from Tucker to Hannity to Ingram seven minutes of coverage for hurricane Michael\nMSNBC Chris Hayes did more than that Matt out seven minutes o'donald ten minutes Brian Williams sixteen minutes so even MSNBC you would think would cover more they really didn't but but that\nThat's insane this is one of the strongest storms ever hit the continental United States you've got towns completely wiped out and you've got shows on Fox News that didn't cover in an all last night and prime time I mean that's that's unacceptable\nTo talk about I looked at what they were talking about Tucker and Hannity and Ingram they're talking about left wing moms you can do that tomorrow give the people in the panhandle give the people of Florida a couple of minutes I mean come on this is a once in a lifetime of men's\n\nFly from Emily arena here's redlin alley [laughter] see I\nLive here at Emily arena we are getting set for lightning and cannot game to for the Tampa Bay lightning and boy does it seem like forever since they last played in fact it was last Saturday against the Florida Panthers a two one shoot out when\nYou're on home ice to pick up two points and now they're ready to go to take on a interesting Vancouver team it's a team that gives up a lot of goals the team scores a lot of goals\nAnd we'll see if Tampa Bay offensively maybe can have their way with them coming up in the next segment we're going to do a round table was described sports books rolling and ... but right now we go to our good friend\nRyan burn the reporter for the Tampa Bay lightning and knows this team very well up and down and\nBirds are great to be with you and they said in the opening\nYou know maybe it wasn't the greatest game Saturday nights against the for the Panthers but\nI don't know I kind of looked at and said they got two points and that's all I cared about\nYeah I mean there are plenty of positive that you could look at it they recovered well after a very up and down first period where it looked like Florida\nThat I had an opportunity to run out of the building the way that gave us though is shaping up it I think you can attribute a lot of that to the play of Andrea visor Laskey yeah ah yeah you're talking about a guy coming off a veteran a trophy nomination last year and he looks like he's picked up right where he left off he looked\nSo comfortable to me at times that gave you gave up that first goal is a really good shot may be surprised by the a little bit uh but after that he looks so smooth comfortable never really looked like he was going to give up another goal the rest of that gave\nA for me that's a good sign I liked the way some of the younger guys played in that game really uh like towel Matthew Joseph and Anthony ... kind of combined uh you know those two it a lot of experience last year in Syracuse and that seems to be you know replicating itself at least through the first game and\nA and through the pre season and we saw those two have combined really well it seemed to have a little bit of chemistry there so that was good to see a and the penalty kill I mean that was a gossip aligned unit last year\nAh we talked to a ... or after the Florida game and he said it's good that you know you get confidence when you go five for five on the ... and that first gay but more than anything\nThe confidence stems from your wiping the slate clean you know last year they started off so poorly on the penalty kill\nA finished so at twenty seven twenty eight in the league but uh even if they were playing well towards the end of that feeds and they really can never improve those numbers because they were just so bad at the beginning of the season so you wipe the slate clean you start over again you go five for five and that first game and it's a good start for them\nAnd the second period they were really good I think the therapy or they just took a lot of penalties and kind of it is kind of got rid\nOf them they can never really get the ... going to put three consecutive penalties and\nFortunately for them they were able to score that short handed marker\nDo you think when ten days off they look\nLittle more often some teams because of the style they play they're trying to make particularly the first line that trying to make a really good play and sometimes the execution just doesn't happen\nI think he noticed that when the uh the passes when the paths and just as the mayor and yeah I think was that was some of the worst thing I've seen some a lightning and quite a while especially in that first period there were\nThere were some ... where you're just kind of scratching your head like where you where was the intended target their\n... uh but that's the thing this team is so predicated on speed and a quick timing and\nPrecision that when one passes off it just throws off the uh the whole attack and when you see one of those half as if they're not especially that first or second half of its not hitting the market just throws everything off and and that's when it looked like he just doesn't have it tonight where it's really just that one first pass was was where needed to be and not to get the whole thing going again that's what it was encouraging\nTo see that third line really come through just had a couple of shots on ... scores the goal ... and I thought was really active sometimes keeping it\nA little simple little simpler I should say uh makes everybody's job a little easier and\nI thought they did it exactly that\nAnd I think that's what you're going to see from the lightning team where it's it's probably going to be a different line each night that stands out and have the uh uh ... is able to kind of carry this team to victory is not always going to be the same coast to draw the line I mean they you look at to drive you didn't have a shot in that game a stem coast passed up a number of shots Miller\nI thought he was trying to be a little bit too much of a play maker rather than just be an either get to the net and and do some of that dirty work and I think that's why you're seeing Andre ... today\nAre so it's not always going to be that top line of stuck in line with pointed it they have the capability the role for lied deep I think each each day and they go out as it might be a different group that they want to get the job done\nNeeds to be a reporter for the Tampa Bay lightning Brian Burns joining us here on lightning power play live and nine Seventy WFL am Greg when if you want to end up on Twitter you can\n... you mentioned the change and I think you know after one game\nSome people might have been surprised because you know Jay Z Miller ... pretty well and that first time last year\nI Know last year is not this year\nWere you surprised they made that change right away\nNot to surprise 'cause you could kind of see this coming with how that line was plain towards the end of the playoffs last year they really didn't seem to have that chemistry especially towards the end of that Washington theories they ah they were kind of dry on the fence or just wasn't there for them\nSo and I think early on and the and the regular season you're going to see these different line permutations of the uh the first few games though and just to the you know where's the chemistry we were the guys that play well together they have so many for the kind of like\nA you can shake it up and a half picking name out and\nUh let's see if these three can work well together I think a lot of what you see what the lightning they like to work and do what do they like to keep a stay at a stamp ... duo together really like what they've seen was really a Joseph you see a lot of these do those with the lightning [noise] ah so I think you'll see stand post ... dropped together and then they'll just try to figure out who's that third piece who's that\nAh that that auxiliary piece that can come in and really compliment what they're able to do\nLots of really interesting because I think he's the guy that\nIs a highly skilled player\nAnd in some ways he comparable to Jaycee Miller I think you can make a case maybe plots more accomplished\nAt this point in his career but\nHas the ability to\nTo work out nicely you have plot maybe go into the corners dig out was ...\nPlay a pretty simple rule north south\nAnd I think that's probably what they're hoping for would you agree\nYeah you know you kind of a meat and potatoes for like the thing you know that the guy that yeah you get the job done and and like you said I think maybe Jake the Miller was playing a little bit to fan the for for what that role or entails on that top line or you know maybe he can come down to the fourth line now from and give that group a little bit of a spark a little bit of often the logo play making ability\nBut I think right now for that top line they just need a guy that can do some of that dirty work they can win some of those battles and then get the talk to the play makers or rather than trying to be a player maker themselves\nAnd one thing they do math on that first line Alice Jake you know are going to the fourth line is another face off guy\nWith a really good Jake you know there was last year in the face off ... percent\nYeah and that was a an issue for them and that Florida game they pass gotta be pretty bad and the and the face all circle and you know that's been a problem with his team for a few seasons now I Know it's something that we parked on and we thought maybe they would make a move last year the trade deadline to try to get somebody uh to to lock that up to shore that that area or\nA yeah JT Miller did a pretty good job last year\nI think it's just one of those things that's going to be an issue with is the really no matter what\nYou want to do with him going down to the fourth line again we don't know how long that's going to last ... last appearance exactly last game hypothetically for the sake of our conversation or goes for a whole game\nDoes that mean the fourth line gets more I ...\nBecause ... is\nIs the top six forward for your team last year did you see all of a sudden now\nThe only eight minutes\nA night now that he's on the fourth line or do you do you sit there and say okay we have to\nBe a little more understanding of where he is and gave him some more time and maybe as a result\nGet a little more time which I don't think the ...\nYeah you would think that line would get a little bit more time but really I just think it's going to play out as far as you know how the other lines are looking at how that\nLine is looking in the first period I think that are really dictate how much time they get tonight\nYeah for sure Brian Byrnes joined us here on lightning power play live\nIn nine Seventy WFL a you know you and I\nWere talking about this uh practiced the other day it's gonna be interesting to see\nWhat game Louis demand get [noise] but I think it was an over and obviously to come back with ... and I played really really well\nIf you got a game on Saturday and then next week he has a couple before you go on your road trip\nI think you probably want to get the main one game right\nI Would have a pretty fair yeah and that you were talking about that Detroit game on Thursday maybe the Carolina game on Tuesday I think ... probably go down to get on Saturday against Columbus a little bit you know on paper a team that are supposed to be one of the contenders\nAre in the eastern conference Carolina up and coming team you know a kind of a dark horse team that could be a playoff team\nOr the choice still kind of an rebuild mode you don't really know what you have with so might be a good chance there to get a Louis demand and I think it'll be really telling you know we've heard from the coaches all summer about\nHow they want to limit dies he starts a little bit how they want to get the million more I think it will be telling it if the main gets in on this uh homes than it is not a situation where it's back to back if not necessarily a spot where he would get a start but if they're really committed to getting him was started getting him more in limiting the ivy a little bit I think you'll see him in one of these five games [noise]\nTeenager back of gold center to\nPlay well in order to take some starts away from your number one but when you take a look some of the injuries starting gold centers\nLiked that such trouble ... what do you make a couple of times you saw a lot of play with ... last year you saw almost\nI I kind of jokingly called it the triple X. two point oh yeah they kind of played really well together and then you get the trade for Miller and make a McDonald's and [noise] you know ... kind of went no doubt [noise]\nBut in their time last season together I thought they looked really good um Miller you know said after the game hey I didn't have my best scan Cooper obviously agreed that bumping him as far down as he did\nBut that could be a good move for Miller I mean he could be the centerpiece of that fourth line and I mean I think it's a really good move to put a lot of the top one got a ton of chemistry with to drop [noise]\nYou know like Brooks said I think it's time to feast\nAnd I think with a lot as well you remember\nPorch had some history being on the same line to see the samples sure you saw it a few years ago we saw it\nEven two years ago before stand cos suffered as she injury he in plot we're pretty well on that top line so there's there's some history was polite and stand cos plane together on the same line obviously you guys are both mentioned\nYou know ... being you know the part of the original triplets so I don't really think that the ... gonna miss much of a veto at least on paper\nI'm also really really curious to see\nHow the second line continues to do what they've done because I thought that they had a pretty decent game one as well you throw Johnson is is it a mix and you know John ... is one of those guys that he could pretty much\nBut in any word of mouth from the first one to the third one [noise] you know you and you have a guy like point you can basically playing with anybody you only can play with anybody I mean the ballots that they just have throughout the for group I think is going to really really service seem rather for them\nThey really do have a lot of guys and go up and down the line of people are on the fourth my child to be interesting to see that the fourth one gets the more I ... I think only start to shift in the third period their language shaky member now who was the top the forward last year I did see that playing out with a fourth one\nI mean I could definitely seems getting getting some more minutes absolutely uh especially with you know we've done a good sign that deal and the off season I mean they're paid him um [noise]\nI don't know if they expected to bump him down all the way the fourth this soon but once again you know didn't have a good game against the Panthers but no I I could\nDefinitely see him Ernie and I'm I'm guessing ... yeah I could see them get would make\nYou know and full of shifts and I definitely more than they got in the first game\nOne's got some no you they have some size with that particular trio you you've got some skill as well Miller and his versatility you've got Ernie who's now healthy and you know you're the stays that way 'cause he's got a free solid skill set as well he's coming in and probably the best shape that you've ever been and and\nKnow there's a chance where they can also produce as well and\nAnd in today's NHL you have to have ...\n... it's not like it was Fifteen Twenty years ago where he asked you scoring lines and then you have a checking line and then a force grinding line do you want to see the skill and ability across the board and you know the right in right now I mean the lightning are very very end he'll enviable position you\nGot about a minute left and you guys do a lot of great work on your website to see from sports than we're we're going to get\nTo your show and and things like that but [noise] any bold predictions\nHis first time we've had you guys on our show this year that you were kind of thinking for this lightning team maybe a specific player and I have a breakout year I'll go with you and then we'll go for what you on the spot to you at the ... well thanks I appreciate\nThat you know even though he played in sixteen games as far as I Know ... still eligible for the colder\nHere um saint Anthony should really for the call directly I like that ...

that's all you want right\n... your packet points any move on I mean it's ah it's kind of what we talked about this week almighty Munch is just to you know you you look\nBack and you learn about you know at this point in the seasons don't you don't take when you get when you're building and learn and to me that with the team is pretty good at and there's been times the last couple of years where
