I totally agree but maybe she just had one beer and maybe she had more but everything I've seen is that she had one beer that was her\nExplanation I haven't seen anything different than that if I have let me know where I could find\nBut under she didn't want their under oh she said that he didn't want to tell her parents that she was at a party drinking with oh\nYeah but but that could I mean let's be honest I anything right but that could mean\nDrinking you know one beer is is technically drink and\nThey said that the general right right I again you're not going to you're not going to get her on mic on her maybe maybe it could be right throughout the entire right but she given specific than anything and that goes right along no her story and that and that\nReally I think for the call Lisa and that really brings me to uh I wanted to mention this real quick um\nToday the outside counsel the Republicans used Christine ah ah to question Christine Blasey Ford um her name was Rachel Mitchell she wrote a memo to the Senate Judiciary committee and she said a he said she said cases incredibly difficult to prove but this cases even weaker than that and if you\nGo into her memo where she points out inconsistencies in Fords recounting it'd be incident\nIt is a memo worth reading now it's also a memo that was put together without a more comprehensive investigation being done including talking to other potential\nUh witnesses so I think you need to keep that in mind when you read the ... like some people are trying to make it like this memo was the end all be all I I don't see it that way but the points that Rachel Mitchell mixed out makes her memo does she lays out\nI thought were noteworthy to say the least and one of the problems that Michel had\nWith Ford's testimony is the Ford doesn't remember how she got home from the party that night for during the hearing said she does not remember how she got home does she no she didn't drive Mitchell wrote\nGiven that all of this took place before cell phones arranging a ride home would not have been easy and that's something that's bothering me as well it's not like she could have ran out of that house and just told someone on a cell phone to come pick her up or or golden retriever and\nShe claims she just ran right out of the house so she didn't make a call before she left the house and the house was far away from where she lives she wasn't walking home to actually get home and maybe she doesn't remember any of that\nIt's possible but that is the ... that is one of the main aspects of her story that has bothered me through all of this\nAnd Mitchell pointed that out in her mental eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number two phone lines are packed will go back to the phones on this we have a whole lot more to get you on the show today to do next on PM Tampa\nVenues traffic and whether in less than a minute on news radio nine Seventy WFL a\nMountain next episode of that Dr Wilbur pod cast with Arianna Huffington vice president of ...

I I look I don't know we're we're into pure speculation here and there are a lot of things that look they they don't necessarily make sense to me um to me the the big question all along I if I were doing the questioning if I were a senator questioning a Ford\nI ... including being a democratic senator where of course they're not going to go as\nTough on her as as the prosecutor did but what I Would have wanted to know is is there anything else that you remember about house like any other little details or do you remember what it looked like when you walked outside or any little thing like that to see if there were any memories that she hadn't revealed yet and we really didn't hear much about that\nThat's what will be interesting to find out if the FBI asked her you know what I mean are they going to try to see if there are more of those details that she hasn't said yet that she does potentially remember\nHow she described them coming down the ... there were bounce girl called yeah and they say that she didn't know who who are in the room right or what what were they so when it went up there so when they went up to ... you didn't hear them bouncing off the wall going oh\nNo yeah maybe but if you're going to start when you're ... you would say they would be ... going up this coming down\nHere I guess I don't know maybe we should just didn't turn or I mean there's there's explanations for that as well or you know law school or not\n[laughter] I mean what would how would they not going to do coming up there because she really make a point about how they were bouncing off the wall\nYeah maybe she did hear them coming up and didn't think anything of it until they push her into a ruin\nYeah I've ever you ever been drug cargo reporter going up and coming down\nMm I don't know if I'm gonna agree with that when you're going down I've seen plenty of people fall down the stairs before a drunk so I'm not going to give you that one\nEspecially on climate is there going [laughter] thanks for the call my ... she had to let me go to a bill on line to a bill how are you\nCould ever so good for the call\nHey hey there may have brought up about the um the goal for me\nYeah so yeah we spend a lot of time on that on friday one of the uh go find me pages is a was put up by\nSomebody who works at Georgetown and we have her name I don't have it in front of me right now um but we do know who that individual is there to go find me pages are connected to Ford\nOne is from the individual works at Georgetown the other one at least a as a friday I haven't spent any time kind of going back and seeing if we know anything more about it but the other one we did not know who created that\nYeah that that's my point so people are getting paid so did you\nDream for oh you mean through the Gulf on me page yeah okay right what what about Kevin ... rose nothing going for him I don't know go start one form nobody's stopping you but anybody ready to go find me page [laughter]\n[noise] that's a lot of money for just what she's going through\nA great but there was it that people are they were raising ridiculous amounts of money for Peter Struck and all these other individuals are stupid what the go find me a ... pound though I ... was a couple of hundred thousand dollars which was insane or so I I don't know a million\nDollars right I people keep donating I like that people are donating we'd I'd investigate\nThat if I was going to be\nHere but is that where the money's coming from but the goal fund me page the ... a lot of the donations are just coming from regular people want to donate to her no it's not come on some of it is I I don't know if every single dollar is necessarily for small donations but a lot of it is yes you can do you see on the thing ... who donates\nIt's got to be big chunks\nMaybe there are a few big chance but but ... even if there are so what does that how does that change anything\nBecause you don't think there was a back door guild done between them\nA backdoor so you're telling me back a couple of months ago before\nHe was nominated Christine foreign made a deal\nThat said her and her family would go through this take the death threats and all of that you would testify\nUnder oath before the Senate Judiciary committee under penalty of perjury and all of that would be done so she can get some money and keep in mind this is somebody with a really good job making a really good living she would get like a a couple of hundred thousand dollars from a ... page the ... that was the deal will\n... ...\n... you talked about perjury but you said nothing both said can you can prove so she had nothing or risk\nWill not necessarily it it's hard to prove but you can certainly perjure yourself\nIt's hard and that the situation of other ways yeah in agree okay but this is a tough situation approve\nRight but you think that still she did this was some deal concocted when back in ...

doesn't matter [noise]\nWell the Tampa Bay I'm your host Ryan Gorman with me my producers Morgan lash and James Byrd lander so\nThe [noise] let me go back to this NBC report here\nA text messages obtained by NBC News um basically showed that Kavanaugh was potentially asking\nAround about Deborah Ramirez the second accuser both for the September twenty third article in the New Yorker dropped which if that were the case potentially mean the Kavanaugh\nLied under oath because he told the Senate Judiciary committee that the first time you heard of\nThe uh Deborah Ramirez allegation\nWas in September twenty third article in the New Yorker so we send a text messages around\nYou know trying to find people to push back against the allegation before the article dropped then could be lying under\nOath so let me uh let me pull up the question\nThat the NBC report uses\nAnd this was in a public testimony\nSo somebody ass Kevin all of this question my last question on this subject since you graduated from college\nBut before the New Yorker article publication on September twenty third have you ever discussed for her and discussion about the incident matching the description given by Mr Mir as to the New Yorker Kavanaugh says no\nBut then\nThere's another question that NBC or ... what's your reaction to that Kavanaugh says they couldn't the New York times couldn't corroborate the story\nAnd found that she was crawling around the classmates trying to see if they remembered it uh and I at least and I myself I heard about that that she was doing that and you know that just strikes me as you know what is going on year\nWhen someone who's calling around trying to refresh other people is that what's going on what's going on with that that doesn't sound that doesn't sound good to me so it it it seems like there might be a bit more to this story that perhaps Kavanaugh\nHad heard ... Ramirez was calling around talking to people and so therefore he called around to find out what she was telling the roundabout\n\nNow his answer here where he says no he's he's in relation to a question about the incident matching the description given by Ramirez to the New Yorker\nKnow he was he was too emotional now he's not fit for a U.S Supreme Court scene on then you know the we went off the rails I mean\nIt's not right and wrong lane now being ... you go sit out there in front\nOf the Senate Judiciary committee on national television with a as many millions of people as there were watching that are watching you and and I'm In you do it perfectly I mean come on let me go to Rick in Sarasota on line three last call on this Rick how're you\nGuys I'm doing fine first I Need to apologize guys oh uh I was listening to NPR today\n[laughter] that's okay you're listening to Tampa Bay so it's all good\nGirl so I didn't notice that they were they were dissecting care for knows festival last week they were a slice and dice and and shopping\nAnd putting every single word and fill up their second look at it which was fine so I thought to myself what are they going to do the same thing for Ford testimony yeah\nWell I mean all you have to do is all you have to do is look at the ah Rachel Mitchell memo and she pretty much did that she slice and dice it and uh I thought it was a very revealing memo now the problem I have with Republicans pushing the memo Rachel Mitchell put forward or was that she kind of made a conclusion and\nI don't know how as a prosecutor you can make a conclusion like that when there really wasn't a thorough investigation done that was my big problem with what Rachel Mitchell did I thought the ...\nWhat's that\nMaybe if no one told her not to make a conclusion or about\nI think Republicans wanted her to making ... to be honest with you but but I I just felt like if you were if you were gonna you know do an honest job with it you would have to leave the conclusion out and say look based on boards testimony alone in the in the back and forth that I had\nWith her and the information that I have in hand right now this is what I determined\nAnd then leave that open ... with a more thorough investigation you know maybe there would be more information that could potentially change you know uh what I have\nHere she didn't do that she made it very conclusive and I thought that was a a step too far from me\nOne last thing in the metro mammal yup it's the talk at all about for its discussion of herself back in the eighties\nFord's discussion of her ... well there were no cell phones back toward\n[laughter] you know we know that now yeah forward allegedly\nIn her chest or they said that she called her mommy using her cell phone\nI don't remember her saying that we don't know we're after check that\nOut yeah I I don't know I definitely don't remember that I'm OK yeah but thanks for the call I recreate it you're right about\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty twos and ... will go we have a couple a lighter Florida stories and we'll get to hear because I'm I'm a I'm done with\nKevin ... protection you deserve a break I Can't do it anymore [laughter]\nYeah ah All right so we'll do some later ... only and Florida stories next year on PM Tampa Bay in and lots of get to an eight o'clock hour as well a stick around more to be\nNine Seventy WFL he wants to help you pay your bills with sixteen chances every weekday two in one thousand dollars am two PM when your share of sixteen thousand dollars just listening for the nation what you were to take some ... instantly\nGet all the contests times now nine Seventy WFL a dot com next chance to win win thousand bucks happens at six past the top of the hour or nine Seventy WFL a\nA great time to bring a new look to your life with certain appropriators they can change the look of your surroundings both inside and out as they've done for us in our home and hear it I heart radio their workers of the highest quality and there's no mess make a big difference in your life and then the value of your home", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PM Tampa Bay with Ryan Gorman", "city": "Tampa", "day": "01"}
