glad the Tampa Bay times did this story [noise]\nYou know when I leave the radio station and nights I go through downtown and merge onto to two Seventy five and every time\nJust about every time I come across this individual who sitting out their names big Mike old ways out there's usually sell in like some\nWater or sometimes eating or is listening to something he's just always very friendly oh without a smile on his face always wave to the\nMotor is just you know it's funny you take the same way home and you get into such a routine and you've seen as individual on the side of the road and it's almost like they become part of your life you just get used to it every time I go that way big Mike is there\nHave you ever talk to them I have I gone yeah a very nice guy and\nThe other night I Can't remember what night it was but I drove home and as I'm coming up to that that section it's a it's it's right there when you murder John when you go through downtown emerge onto two Seventy five and I for a right near the or the bail bonds place\nI come up to that area and I see this big cross and I don't see big Mike I'm thinking to myself oh\nYeah oh and and so I pull up closer ... and sure enough a he had passed away he apparently died of a\nHeart disease at St Joseph's hospital and September twenty second was fifty seven years old his name was Michael gentry and he'd been out there for Twenty years really won the years and you know did a little bit of everything you would sell some newspaper\nNina and selling newspapers right I mean like an iconic figure if you go through that area on a consistent basis and it's again it's one of those things\nWhere you're in your routine and you're just used to seeing\nSomething and then all of a sudden it's gone and the men I pulled up\nAnd I didn't see him sitting out there wasn't decided I didn't see him sitting out there he usually have like a cooler and a chair and even if he wasn't out there would be there you know you knew he was around or whatever\nAnd I pulled up and I didn't see any of that and I saw this cross and flowers and I'm like oh God my just ... it just really did I I didn't know well you're not rolled out my window a couple of times depending on what was going on if if I wasn't on the phone wasn't listen to something important and I would have a good job with them\nYou know he would he would sell waters to to motorists a motorist would just give them a couple of bucks it was just one of those things you\nKnow it becomes a part of your daily routine really does and it really it really just kind of hit me uh let me go to a\nThis is chef Todd we have from the from the Tampa Bay lightning on line one chef Todd how are you\nI'm good man I drive that route every day or going into am only and I\nYou know so you feed him all the time and then all of a sudden he wasn't there and you know what it's heartbreaking because yes they they do become you know just like driving by and see whatever you know land markers right right and and he wasn't a landmark of course you can human being yeah but I talked to\nHim many times very nice guy you know never and and they're just you never beg\nFor money now or never just sitting there habit of good old time ... you know yep very jovial and yeah heartbreaking man but I Love the show\nThat you're in a global Saturday Night do boats thanks so much left out and we appreciate the call and ... and you know\nYou see 'em out there and it's like rain hot weather\nDoesn't matter he was just always there so it was something you know after I drove home and I saw that I meant to to mention it on the show because it stuck with me life happens in all the craziness with the news I it just slipped my mind so I'm so glad the Tampa Bay times\nOr did a story on big Mike we'll post that on the blog I Want I Want to post a big Mike on coming up next from the Tampa Bay times we a military reporter Howard Altman moments way on PMT\nNews traffic and whether in less than a minute on news radio nine Seventy\nWFL a It's Tuesday October second what's new today on the free I her radio as high\nHeart radio free yourself to all the best ... a gas station told him what happened with the rocked up if they play last doctors bought and the radio original vision my only experience [noise]\n\n'em and so that points to you know some issues when they want to talk for a bunch of reasons there's your folks have seen combat but not just folks who have seen combat as you know military training changes you yeah there's a lot of concussions and things even training that affects\nYou those depression is pie TST those the adjustment issue even if you've not been in comedy you come back and and you know you have a hard time sometimes adjusting to society if you've been in\nUniform for periods as a whole bunch of reasons um this weekend coming up interestingly enough there's a I'm a big national a meeting for a suicide\nA sandwich to survive and and it's it's I'm doing it this weekend in in a palm harbor the tragedy assistance program for survivors ... tend to annual national military Suchet survivor seminar this weekend and maybe ... thousand people a little bit about\nYou know the the issues that face them and and the problems they have metal because it's\nComing up on my other show best of the bay which runs out Friday nights at at eight thirty we feature you know some of the best organizations from around the bay area\nTo shows this month we'll focus on this issue one of them towards the end of the month is going to be with the organization stop soldiers suicide so uh this is going to be a big topic conversation on my other show a throughout the month of October because again it it is such a big issue um it's one\nWe're still trying to wrap our heads around and figure out solutions to and you know going off your point that it's not always people who are directly in combat it a lot of times we we've heard people who operate drones are have serious issues PATS D Ito aside issues\nIs even a little guilt for people who haven't been the pleasure of being ... in San ... miles with a buddy of mine and uh\nWe got an elevator it was a guy who didn't have a combat patch who was a high ranking officer in my Buddy Guy smeared at him because he had been to combat yes with this whole\nUh look down on a good bit of news here in Florida but the number of veterans taking their own lives has dropped a there were a five hundred and fifty seven and twenty Fifteen or five hundred and thirty and twenty sixteen so hopefully those trend lines will\nContinue to to go down\nWe know this was a big priority for the VA when I had to be a secretary on not too long ago I asked him about this issue and this was one of the things that they were obviously going to work on it it seems based on your reporting that this is obviously well known among those in the military and uh and Veterans Affairs and this is a\nPretty high priority whose priority now both for the military and for the department of Veterans Affairs are showing up as a reporter to those who seek treatment or a higher risk and it's because those\nAre the ones who have issues and they know about it the ... in Vietnam statistics show that you know ah it's better when you do get obviously when you get treatment but you know one of the issues with people who are getting ... what's an honorable discharge burn eligible\nOr should it be you know the efforts to change that as well be his those people who are high risk quite often I'm Still very high and then those that have one of my uh the people that cover her lost her son to\nSuicide is tuned in on a fish replies\nWe're talking to Tampa Bay times military reporter Howard Altman who you can follow on to our age all men the final story that we want to talk about there's a lot happening in Syria these days and with all of a\nCandidate on news and all the other news that we're dealing with on a day to day basis this is one of those stories the kind of gets buried sometimes but you've got some updates on a choice nobody nationally\nEnough um ... the national security adviser John Bolton has said that the U.S will have troops in Syria\nAs long as Iran has forces there the ... and all that so that's basically we're going to be there wouldn't be the from learning about twenty two hundred troops that are there and um you know the ... when I talked to folks at St common I talk to Joe hotel the commander there in may the focus always\nIs on Islamic state funding Islamic state the fight is in eastern Syria about Iraq border the middle you're freebies river valley a and that\nIs an ongoing fight I Want to reiterate this because I Know there's this narrative out there that we'd straight ISIS then it's all of us forget is not the case so so they're still raging mad I don't have the Calif at there they had before their territory but they're still there in ... in a big numbers in you know the ... the concerns that that that's a shakeout officials had about\nYou're not engaging the the Sunni minority your as the Iraqis are still trying to form their government that that's going to be the continued it continued issue whether they are brought into the Iranians are firing a boat ballistic missiles into Syria\nThey've they fired missiles into Iraq to to take some of the ah anti Iranian forces there ah it's it continues to be a a you know a big mess\nThan we recently saw on the issue that took place between Israel and Russia which shows you how quickly things can escalate absolutely a it is yeah I'm an actor is a lot of players in the ... a lot of\nPlayers the Turks the Russians the Iranians are obviously the Syrian regime of Bashar al Assad Israelis they've had hundreds of rage into Syria\nTo keep the Iranians up their border\nI'm In the U.S is going to be there for a while and it ... you know the the biggest danger always is whether it is something accidental happens\nAnd you know Russian and us planes engage your troops engaged already seen we've talked about this before that time last year hundreds of Russians get trapped Russian mercenaries sketch tracked by a U.S so\nAnd there was a report earlier today I don't know if you saw it but I'm the defense Secretary Mattis said the U.S is going to increase the number of military advisors or in Syria so again you know there was this talk and I know the president originally wanted to get out of there um but clearly that's that's not\nThe pollen that rally now but it sounded as national security by you're talking about and why it's hard to tell you asked them about you know it was difficult to to change the president's mind and you know you should know or he was on board with it so we'll see you never know what's gonna happen with the policy of right over here and but right now ah John ... got a big\nVoice he is a hawk on this issue um\nWell in Iran was front and center at the U.N General assembly and we saw the president's comments about Iran and then really it was it was national security adviser John Bolton speech which was a pretty heated tours around\n... and vigor warnings yeah I mean here they will vote tell said that you know we were ... the U.S ... forces will defend themselves against you know around if something happens ... the term that it's that sent comes used for a long time since I think Mattis was their malign influence\nYes I'm big you know ... one of the biggest troublemakers in the region is ... she was going on in Yemen as well\nAnd then finally we recently saw the Israelis show some evidence about potentially the Iranians doing some nuclear activity that they're not supposed to be doing that as you mentioned\nDispute you know getting remains to be seen um the the the the diminishing of that a nuclear\nDeal um has pros and cons and and the supporters and people in the ...\nThere's a lot going on over there and of course that's why we have Tampa Bay times military reporter Howard alum and on the show to break it all down for us you can follow him on Twitter at age\nAll men how are glad to have you back on ... we will laugh once

promotion of a sales tax hike for roads with some alarming statistics for bay area motorists Brian\n... at the corner of Sheldon wrote in waters avenue in Tampa will is a volunteer with the old for transportation group says that location made it on the group's ten most dangerous intersections list\nYou can see the trend there to tightening race the real clear politics average has Gillum up about three and a half ... percentage points if you throughout the outliers Gillum up around three\nOr new Mason Dixon poll shows Gillum at forty six percent and the Santa ... forty five percent well so obviously within the margin of error\nAt one point race I've been saying all along this is going to be a toss up race it's going to be a close race all the wait till the end that that trend has been pretty solid since a primary day you've had Gillum with a lead anywhere between three four\nPercentage points but the Santa hasn't let any poll and he still hasn't\nI think part of what happened was Gilman said he was really the surprise when on primary night as opposed to stamp to sue the polling suggesting that he was going to pull off\nFor the nomination right so I think ...\nProbably gotta bounce from that area to get a lot of pressure to but after he won the primary\nA Mason Dixon found that Santa is leading among men by Fifteen percentage points Gillum leading among among women by fourteen that sounds about right date each drew forty one percent support among independent voters so a tie\nAmong independents most other polls have had dealing with a big lead\nAmong independents I always thought it was closer I I'm not sure it's tied like the Mason Dixon poll says I'd say Gillum probably as a slight lead\nAmong independents at the moment but some of these polls where you know Gillum ... got a double digit lead with independence I I just wasn't necessarily buying it a dissent this lead among voters Fifteen up Gillum lead among those under fifty\nOne of the polls we talked about yesterday the saint Pete a poll survey had dissent is leading among millennials and Gillum basically tied among older voters\nItem by that I said that yesterday I thought that was nonsense that seems like it's now wire as well I'm right ... ... this sounds this Mason Dixon poll in terms of the the how the ages breakdown sounds more accurate\nOr Gillum neck and neck with dissent this forty six to forty five in Tampa Bay and that matches\nAnother recent poll so Tampa Bay a swing part of the state very close between those two are in our listening area so that's the latest on the race for governor to close race\nI I I wouldn't be surprised if the cabin our situation because I Do think national stories are playing a big role in in state and local races I wouldn't be surprised if Kavanaugh story\nIs kind of given dissent this bit of a boost at the moment um but I also said when we kind of broke down some of the more recent polling interest the race in general yesterday on the show I said that at the moment\nYou've got Gillum out there with a lot of energy and enthusiasm if you take a look at some of the recent events it's much like the twenty sixteen election where Trump had the big crowds\nAnd Hillary Clinton had hardly anything well ... got the big crowds and dissent this doesn't have much so there does seem to be some energy and enthusiasm on the side of Gillum but if you have a big story like the Kavanaugh story energizing Republicans that can certainly help dissent\nIs especially the president's going to be in Florida again coming next week yup then whether or not he's going to once again re aligned themselves with the campus and go up there and make a push for him that kid again re energized the base a little bit more and given that last minute push into the last year the final three weeks before the election it'll\nBe interesting to see how the president handles dissent this at that event if the census is there with him if he mentions him and promotes him throughout a that event because as we know they had a little bit of a recent death\nWhen it came to the hurricane Maria death toll issue so largely been silent on this election I'm always been actively campaigning in every other swing state I'm very tight races he was very much promoting this thing at this early on and he certainly backed away from that recently we'll see if\nUh the president reinvigorate sue support for disadvantage when it comes to town next week so the race the bottom line the race is close I Would say Gillum\nMaybe just a few points ahead overall at the moment but ah it's a toss up as are pretty much all the races you're in the state the Senate race and and all the cabinet races\nAs well All right a lot to update for you on the Capitol nomination any

F. LA legal analyst Felix Vegas\nPhone number is eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two we're talking about this new stand your ground case Tony Daniel who is a infamous here in the Tampa Bay area for his his racist roadside displays\nIs claiming self defense under Florida's Stand your ground law in a case where he's accused of beating two women with an electronic megaphone we have\nA full detailed story for you written by ... it's it's got everything that you need to know about it on the website nine Seventy W. F. L. A. dot com just go to the PM Tampa Bay page and we also have one of the videos\nThat was taken during the confrontation couple of quick points here\nAh won the two women they had no right to physically attack Tony Daniel ... has a First Amendment right to do what he's doing yes I think it's in saying that you would spend forty five years you know being a professional protester\nSpouting the the crazy that he spouts right uh but he has a right to do it and you don't have a right to go strike him no and in\nThe you know the confrontation starts arguably with them and getting out of their car young\nWhen he's our standing on a street corner holding a sign and saying whatever he was saying and just a quick point the tip of city council they didn't make take measures in order to\nGet him to move to other locations that weren't maybe so visible under the city council or rules but in this case he's on a street corner and these women come out and basically get his face and his sons are\nAre patently offensive ... he he's looking for something like this I think there's no question about that right\nBetter our or there was another uh individual did he win the two women approach there was another guy that he was standing there who says that he was Canadian he has to make them written was having a appeared on the conversation about um about even though he was you know arguably offensive offended by the sign as well\nPeople are going to handle the situation like that differently\nRight I Know myself and like I there's very little and say see someone in trouble so I'm not going to stop my car turn around and confront someone over a sign but that's just\nMe yeah I I I wouldn't have either I would've looked at it like that there is nuts and and just got about my day um but but these women didn't like it they get into space\nAnd from everything we know it doesn't sound like are correct me if I'm wrong they were the ones that struck first correct physically so there's no question about that\nRight and you have to in order to and this one of those cases where I always say doesn't stay underground\nA case that you have to look in the entire time line yeah because you can't just pick out one part of it because it's always a series of events that it seems like we're talking about the Michael drink a case in Clearwater it's like what led up to it yeah audited and how did you know what was the end result right and and I would\nThink not a hundred percent certain because sometimes people who call surprise me but I Would think we could all agree that the women were in the wrong for initially striking Tony Daniel right and that's where I just can't have that you don't have a right to do something like that\nBut now we're getting into the broader case because when I find interesting to see him claiming stand your ground right and that's where things get much market\nAnd here's a question that we always people always ask us when we're on air talking about this is everyone always thinks are assumes reason why so that's always for murder cases because we always talk about in terms of murder cases yeah he's only to charge with two misdemeanor battery cases it's still apply right\nAnd then apply to a share promised there's a sun right uh in that case where he stabbed somebody yeah on the face outlay and stabbed him in the back right with with a a during a a a physical confrontation that was happening among a group of individuals in the parking lot so it doesn't just happen in in these high profile murder cases like what we've seen right\nAnd that's what it was written initially and just to clarify he was charged with a felony aggravated battery the weapon being the megaphone\nBecause anything anyway right in this particular case\nUm the state decided to reduce the charges too simple batteries one for the other one for the daughter so that's where we're working on um it's interesting because it also like a lot of times in misdemeanor cases you're not gonna really\nAt any point in time did his wife who was there or do we know if she called the authorities if she contacted them and said hey you know there's this altercation with my husband going on here ... I I I don't remember seeing anything like that and\nThere's there are they did make several quest to preserve all nine one one call so I get that later on but then they even go after her at some point according to the report or according to the ... women go after a his wife\nWho was reportedly not really and she has to take some of the cell phone video from what I've read but in terms of actually being involved in the protests she didn't on involve are so now now now\nNow now if if you stop it at the first part of the altercation where the two women come up and they smack sign them they smack him in the face and and he strikes back with a megaphone at that point to me that you could definitely make the case that stand your ground\nRight and there's also a you know an additional part of this is well involving the wife is that there are allegations in this new motion that a navy a to Z who's the daughter actually attacked Rosanna who's the wife\nAnd that's another part of it because if this is still going on then there was an argument he was defending himself the defending himself against other people who are in defense of others essentially so\nThere's a lot of subtle nuances and this when you break it down time why yeah in terms of what is it just get a look at is going to single out that one moment and allow those charges to go forward or it's you know look at the continuum the entire movie if you will writing it all together and say that you know these people were still coming after him there where he was justified\nBecause he here's one of the issues I'm having ... if if you take part one in part three then to me Tony Daniel has a legitimate case but part two is so crucial because that's when he pursues them right and escalates it as he's hitting them with the megaphone on their way back to their car\nAnd prosecutors gonna have to say they're going to figure out a way to say that he was not justified in doing that yeah and indeed and overcome that\nThreshold where he's saying that it's like well I was afraid of what they were going to do next by getting something out of the car something that we don't know so it's that when people argue that in self defense cases it's very difficult because you're saying oh well that's in your mind but objectively what someone think really is happening are they trying to get away\nCould they be getting away you exactly because they were trading at that point they were going back to the car he follows them and continues to hit them right\nBut it's all in his mind versus what prosecutors can be able to say from the video surveillance and everything else\nFinal question for you so you've got the uh charges against him two counts of misdemeanor battery correct how come there are no charges against the women who struck him initially\nApparently not via was there was a rush to report that was done for her however a cording what the the times said is it ... they decided not to pursue charges against or the state attorney's office so\nThat it was a little odd because like you have this whole fight going back and forth and when you divide it up yeah into the three parts you can see where charge to be flying all over the plate and exactly right unintended\n'em and stuff is we're flying yeah but they chose for whatever reason not to pursue charges against herb and again it could boil down to the fact that when he was acting he went beyond self defense and attacking them and following them so if you're taking just that one part to that we've been talking about\nThe arguably he is the one that should be criminally responsible but you can see where charges could be fired or against the other two as well\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number it's another a really interesting case here in the Tampa Bay area eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two we can get through a few calls on this if you have any questions on it or\nComments are also don't forget the video and Felix this full report on it is online at nine Seventy W. F. L. A. dot com just go to the PM Tampa Bay page will be back with more\nPM Tampa Bay from am that PM your next chance to win a thousand bucks coming up at six staff the top of the hour on nine Seventy WFL a\n[noise] with Brian Gorman who have something to do any of the discussion going on during nine six nine nine resigned to\nSay in a few phone calls here on this new Tampa stand your ground case some your host Ryan Gorman his studio with me nine Seventy WFL a legal analysts Felix Vegas joining us on online one here Doug in Largo Doug how are you [noise] I'm doing great how about you I'm good thanks for the call\nI just wanted to say I don't agree with what the guys but if you're going to hit\nSomebody or somebody or somebody equally her to take the consequences and if that's a lot of um you you put yourself in that situation\nRight yeah and and and it looked to question here is more the stand your ground\nDefense you know because if if you watch the video and you look at some of the footage even some of the pictures and some of the reports of the story that that's really the question we were trying to focus in on here\nAt like we get the fact that they struck first which wasn't right we get the fact that you know people will retaliate when that happens to them then the question becomes can you use stand your ground is self defense if your if as they're retreating you're continuing to go after them in and hit them with a megaphone\nRight what if what if they get to the car and pull out a gun like so many people keep a gun in their car on them just it was\nAll data that aren't yet and that's exactly what we're ... we were just discussing the the problem is what ... what does that mean you're allowed to like beat them to death so they don't make it back to their car in case they have a gun there I I don't know what the endgame\nWould be they're going to that's where they're going to have their argument is is what ... what's your perception of delight objective in the mind of\nThe defendant in this case was Mr a Daniel what was he thinking but then again how far does it go do you think that they were going to do something justify your actions yeah\nFor example and I dug makes a very good point is like if for example you saw a gun in the car or sort of a baseball bat I've had cases like that sure then yeah you have an argument that you could I went was defending myself because I knew that they were going back to the car I saw that in the car so I got in the car so does one is a very fair one\nYeah ... ... as far as what was going on um what will be a real issue because I'm not quite sure\n[laughter] I'm not sure we're going to be brought up by prosecutors as well yeah that that's a great point Doug\nAll right thank you guys very much\nThanks for the call I appreciate it eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two I tell you what all of the stand your ground cases they have so many different intricacies to them that make them very\nComplicated and is there one isn't is cut and dry as you would think I mean when you just watch the video if all you do by as the video that we haven't the website which is part of the confrontation you say to yourself\nThere there's no way that stand your ground but then when you add in the other two parts like you laid out and like you lay out in the story that we have in the ... then it gets a little bit more\nRight and that's what they're you know what a defense attorney is going to do is they're going to find these ... you know lay these things out and these are things that the prosecutors will have to deal with my I've dealt with this myself as prosecutor because other video comes forward or it tells a different story possibly and you have to you\nSweet flush all this stuff out decided we're going to go forward the case or not go for with the case but\nLike you said we were covering Michael drink and we're covering the a pass to a movie theater shooting a recovering you know all these child murders and we're dealing with the all have different\nYou know they're okay we have three child murder case was going on the recovery all three of them are very different young what motivated them and what happened any stand your ground cases yes we say stand your ground and we used to have very loosely in the media but they all are very ... a fact specific going back to the Zimmerman trial when I told her that yup and\nI Would say you know this is another example taking a a broader view of all of this\nYou got to think before you act\nIf there's a way to avoid confrontation these days\nTry and do it because you know deep these two women they look I look I can totally understand you've never seen something like that before you get all riled up\nBut once you strike this Tony Daniel than things can escalate very quickly just like what we saw with the Drake a case right you know be be confrontations they're escalating very quickly and easily getting out of control and people's lives were changed as part of the process\nAnd you know you just have a week it looks like what they're doing is they're focused on the more credible allegations and reading that out as opposed to checking her story out\nThe reason I like for them to check her story out is because the way she acted and what she said on NBC a couple of nights ago was a huge walk back from a sworn affidavit and there can be some serious consequences for her if that's the case right\nAnd ... I saw I did watch that and I just pulled up by notes from\nBecause God Forbid if something's breaking your [laughter] your laptop and write a right Fred Everything down because it's going to come up when you talk on the show\nBut there were significant walk back and I thought that was very interesting and I think if there are just kind of looking at the end or like a okay we got to get to the other two first and then if they're going to deal with her and there I'm sure that they were watching that interview yeah and if they're going to pursue any perjury charges or anything like that\nThat's secondary for them right okay but there was a lot of pen that might be something that they could even do after the one ... I think they get they could do that that they want it to separate it apart because it was a sworn statement not sworn testimony in Congress right it was just one statement under perjury that she gave in order to to go out\nShe did it and they gave it to my ... that have been released it but she's still under that perjury cloud if she did in fact give U.S team and then they find out that she was not being completely truthful about it they might not even bother with India comes background noise\nI ... for me I I'm In a position where look if she a walk back sworn testimony\nAnd you need to follow up ... ladies are very serious allegation they are things that she was saying about deal what stuck out to me it's like you're making the allegation that ah he was at parties where they were spiking the punch and then in the interview with Kate Snow\nShe said well I didn't see I saw him by the punch bowl at that than there were certain things were different right and there are certain things that I picked up on as a prosecutor where I'm like okay that's a little different than you know the ... exact about the statement and then saying well I kind of maybe ... yeah that's not a hundred percent and that's problematic in terms of\nHer credit but I'm not saying that that that stuff didn't happen you know that's for someone\nElse who else but but based on her story in which he swore to it's a much different story now and I'd like to see some consequences for that\nAnd also Chuck Grassley is looking for some potential consequences for one of the individuals who are made an allegation that involved a boat and all of that and then the person goes on social media and they were tried in they apologize well\nI I I just to me you can't just get away with that okay not when the stakes are designed not we're talking about a Supreme Court seat there needs to be consequences for these people\nUm [noise] a couple of other things I Want to get to hear and then yes we will get to the president's comments last night\nSenate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley is asking\nFor Christine forward\nTo turn over notes from her therapy sessions and recordings of the lie detector test she took\nThe there there's a reason that they want the recordings from the lie detector tests and I'll get to that in a moment when it comes to the notes from the therapy session let me ask you this ... is there a way for her\nTo just turned over the notes relevant to this accusation in this case because I could if I'm her\nI'm not turn it over all my therapy notes from my marriage counseling right to Republicans on the Senate Judiciary committee where it might get leaked and wind up in the media that I I mean everybody's got to be a little reasonable here there is some privacy that she's entitled to\nI Would think so and this isn't a unique situation because she was the one that volunteered the note\nThat's why I think those notes yes Russia should turn those over I I I mean\nI don't see even on the Republican side or the Democratic side them demanding that she turned over anything that's not relevant to this particular hearing ya but every time we say that this case dovetails into something else and\nSpeaking of polygraph test yet at new allegations a new letter the surface from her old boyfriend saying that she coached one of her friends are former FBI agent\nTo uh when she was taking a polygraph test that Egypt has come out and say that's absolutely not true and so and she was one of the supporters and signed a letter that was sent to Congress so every twist and turn in the white it's\nEither way you had there was you had you had at the hearing a Ford was asked to have you ever basically helped anybody out when it comes to a polygraph before and threaten us now right\nAnd then you have an ex boyfriend who comes out and says that she had help somebody with a polygraph right and and this is one of her friends who became an agent and\nHad to take a polygraph because of all of that is correct or the friend has come out and said that's not true but then there's the question did she lie under oath which brings us to a bigger point that I Want to spend a moment on and that's this idea of people lying under oath\nAnd I keep making the point that it's not that easy to prove so we've got some testimony\nAh from Brett Kavanaugh when it comes to the terminology and the year above that any reasonable person\nWho's not just completely blind part us in on this one can look at and say\nHis explanation for Ralph thing or a devil's triangle or move is nonsense okay we all know that but it's it's not what we know it's ... you can prove correct and to me he can come up with a couple of very reason\nPart of an era that's what's gonna happen with FBI investigate generally\nMore active in in this particular case but and but I think if they're going to keep on with the transparency you've got to release yeah a summary of the details something and it's got to be comprehensive not as active for one side or the other you know if they found nothing and they didn't they say that about every single witness put it out there that\nThis is too big a of an issue also in a letter to the Senate Senator Chuck Grassley a today eight of ten Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee disputed tweets\nSent by the committee majority the claims that above six background investigations into Brett Kavanaugh since Nineteen Ninety three there's never been a whiff of any issue related to inappropriate sexual behavior alcohol abuse in any way so some Democrats\nAre saying that certain things didn't come out in\nOne of or a couple of we don't know the six background investigations that were already done on cabinet why are we just learning about that from Democrats now you know that's a good question because we don't know [noise]\nI I again ah you know there's a lot of politics and there's a lot of posturing happening here so that there's a couple of things that were monitoring when it comes to the Kavanaugh story when we come back next\nWe'll get into what the ... the president had to say yesterday about Christine for this has been one of the big stories are in the news all throughout the day today since that happened last night and the phone number of course if you want to chime in eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty to
