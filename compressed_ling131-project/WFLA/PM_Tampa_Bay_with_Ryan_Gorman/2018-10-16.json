L. Peter how are you\nI'm great how are you today\nA little exhaust and we've been doing a lot of coverage for heart radio affiliates in\nPanama City so I've been hearing a you know\nA lot of good and a lot of bad people's lives obviously a ruined because of hurricane Michael but also there's a lot of great work being done in the community to help those in need a this is pretty much dominated my life for the past couple of days so I have no idea what's happening in the political world here in Florida [laughter] that's why I'm Glad\nYou're on 'em but let's start with hurricane Michael and what we've seen from our elected officials whether it's mayor Gillum in Tallahassee or Governor Scott a senator Nelson what stood out to you\nI think right now with the question of whether or not\nOr the race is frozen or the election is frozen and you know my job as a political analyst I my heart goes out to\nNorth Florida especially because you know I have a lot of friends I mean it's one of those areas where I have a lot of friends because I have a lot of friends in Tallahassee you know that they and their families are all from there are so I've been to part of a north Florida that had been hit I you know that's where we ... a spring break\nYou know my best friend his family's from competence lake and you know hit a grand dad owns that property has been wiped off the map so you know my my Facebook and Twitter feed is\nIs filled with those you know with those horrible stories right now but from a political standpoint\nYou know the beat goes on were were three weeks out and it's it's a it's a challenge right now I'm just stay focused and so the election have become\nYou know what is Rick Scott you what are the Andrew Gillum do what is wrong and what it felt no right now today that the news is is that Rick Scott is going off the campaign trail and Scott is going to take over I'm the first ladies and take over for Rick Scott at this point is the focus is on restoration\nSo I don't even know what we're going to have a a a debate at this point in that race\nOr injure Gillum was off the campaign trail to the end of this week you know postponing a debate there um and so on on the same time on his aunt is and a Bill Nelson are trying to\nOr trying to ... you know gets or the first of all bill Nelson's trying to do his job ... air force base which was just devastated by the storm but it's hard for him to gain traction when Rick Scott is getting to do a press briefing every three hours\nThen along the saint is you know part of me thinks that the race is frozen out where he's he's uh in bad shape right now is the concern from a political standpoint\nAnd this is this is almost crash but it's out of the people in Panama City beach out of the people in Panama City out of the people in North Florida even cast ballots at this point yeah\nAnd when you look at it it's something like two or three percent of the overall total\nAnd that's through or three percent that you know Rhonda Sanchez was probably counting on and right now is that those people don't even have ... you can't vote they don't even have to they don't even have the holding location now to go vote in three weeks and so um there's any some serious questions over the next couple of days\nYou know what do we do to make sure that the people in in the panhandle gets even cast their ballot um so it you know there's nothing like hurricane\nPolitics when it comes to ... one of its are most of it's almost unique strain of politics is how to react um when something like this happens\nI've been on the air with the great people of Panama City in the panhandle I don't even know how many hours over the past\nWeek or so doing coverage taking their calls and I can tell you one thing and I'm a little sour on there so I kind of had a segment\nA friday when I first came on where I was doing a little bit of yelling and shouting um but but one thing that has bothered me is these individuals like US Senator Nelson dissent this I mean\nYou know they they don't have a lot that they can do at the moment but they could have come and they all received invitations they could have come on and spoken directly to the people of the panhandle in Panama City who had nothing bought their radio to get\nFirearms and this month liberties tape is offering something really exciting in terms of promotion and

why\nOur radio station [noise]\nGood evening I'm Dana Milbank our top story at six the death toll is rising in the panhandle with the discovery of more victims in Bay county officials they're confirming another twelve debts today from hurricane Michael official say as floodwaters recede they're able to search areas that had been inaccessible until now\nAnything like this every things down trees it's just like they're all flattened yeah it's again it's like a bomb went off and everything just got flattened uh we did I\nI've been dealing with my frustration with a leaders and politicians on this show you've heard a lot about it I don't want to go down that road again tonight I Will say this I was pretty aggressive in trying to get some of them on a to talk to the residents of Panama City in the surrounding areas\nAre pretty forceful about that over the past twenty four hours I had\nA couple of officials call him they wanted to come on this show and I said no if you're going to talk to anybody rooms are people in Panama City or not\nTampa I Know how important the votes are here in Hillsborough County ... county and the surrounding counties but now you need to talk to the people in Panama City we did get senator Nelson on earlier today he came on and Panama City we got an update from him or he told us a lot about tunnel air force base\nWe talked about this with Howard Altman from Tampa Bay times yesterday and senator Nelson reiterated today how destroyed that Airforce bases\nThey lost a lot of infrastructure that um but there\nThere's a clear determination to get that base rebuilt\nUm that is something that I think is is without a doubt going to happen a bill rebuild its stronger so if a storm comes through like hurricane Michael again it will be able to withstand a those wins\nAnd we also talked to senator Nelson about the relationship between the federal state and local governments up there how things are running it sounds like for the most part things running\nA smoothly um there is a couple of issues in certain areas with FEMA and tarps and things like that um that I think in some of these circumstances is to be expected\nSo we did gets talked to senator Nelson for quite a while which I was very appreciative of uh also we had congressmen Neal done finally joined us he's a congressman for that area in the panhandle with trying to get them on the show for a while he finally joined us to talk a little bit about what he's seen and the constituents that he's been talking to\nAnd then attorney general Pam Bondi we got her on as well uh she talked about or you know how people can avoid being scammed how they can avoid a fraudulent businesses and where they can report that kinda stuff\nSo we got some officials on today wasn't able to get the governor I didn't hear back from him I Know he's very busy but I Would like at some point for him to come on because again in that area Morgan you hear it first when they call behavior answering the phone they really don't have access to like\nAnything else many people are literally trapped in their home and it's it's honestly it's it's heartbreaking listening to everything all ...\nTile and cell service power still around and a lot of use area so uh the battery powered radio is really how a lot of them are getting their information that's why I've been so adamant about trying to get some of these elected officials on to talk directly to them never heard back from a Rubio's office\nAbout coming on either but slowly but surely we're getting some of those elected officials on to talk to their constituents and update them I just think you know I look I could be wrong here I just think it's important for those people to hear from their electrical\nEngineering at it's reassuring\nThem that they're on the case that they're you know handling everything that they can possibly handle and they're getting them help that's why I felt like it was so important\nUm again if you want to we're going to be on all throughout the day tomorrow up in Panama City ah so that would be after one PM you could just listen to any of the Panama City stations on her radio and you can hear our coverage near first hand from the people who are calling into businesses that are doing great work we have a lot of local businesses up there\nWho are just they're handing out food at this point and water\nUm so a really tremendous stories if you want to help you could still do that as well the easiest way honestly is to donate to the American Red Cross and we have that link for you on the website nine Seventy W. F. L. A. dot\nCom if you want a volunteer there's information on the website for that as well or they can use every little bit up they're\nComing up in the next segment we'll talk to Dr Susan MacManus get her thoughts she's obviously very familiar with the area there we'll find out what she thinks about what she's seen\nA over the course of the past week and we'll talk a little bit about the midterms and how they're affected by all of this so a retired us at political scientist Dr Susan MacManus coming up in a moment then again at six thirty lightning pre game here on PM\nTampa Bay that's all lightning hurricanes tonight at six thirty nine Seventy WFL a the home of lightning hockey [noise]\nDamn Tampa Bay on this Tuesday October sixteen I'm your host Ryan Norman don't forget we have a short show today lightning game coming up for you in just a few minutes we'll kick off at six thirty\nTomorrow we're going to have a full show will be on from six to nine PM and of course you can hear me throughout the day are doing our special coverage for her radio affiliates in Panama City just looked up any of the Panama City stations on your eye heart radio apps and joining me right now on the hotline I have retired us and political scientist Dr Susan MacManus Dr McManus how are you\nI'm doing well thank you\nThank you so much for joining me so you've been in that region or the panhandle region it's been so severely affected by hurricane Michael kinda if he can explain to people who aren't familiar with the area or what what you can find up there in terms of the people businesses things like that\n\nFly from Emily arena years spring Lynn Ellie [noise] on\nSaturday Night the Tampa Bay lightning put on and off fences display the most around the NHL are accustomed to seeing\nIn the team to win over the Columbus blue jackets the lightning scored early and often the power play exploded for four goals is seven different lighting players scored\nIn one of the most score a goal is on most nights it was a reminder of just how explosive this team really is the nights opponent in the Carolina Hurricanes is off to an impressive start as they have nine points in six games they've also scored twenty three goals during that time\nTonight's game promises to be exciting is both teams will be looking to pick up two points the question becomes who comes out on top we're going to find out in about an hour or so but until then we're talking hockey\nGreg literally with you live here from Emily arena as we get you set for lightning in came they Michigan and fill us because they don't have the call\nHere from Jeff ... in the pre game also coming up in the next segment we'll hear from Louis dimming in John Cooper and the reason why we're hearing from Lou dimming he's getting to start tonight for the lighting interesting because it was a topic that we're debated yesterday on letting power play live\nAll the times yesterday was getting off in between games you started asking yourself a question could they go with this homes than not playing their back\nAnd I think it was a legitimate question because keep in mind you've got Saturday and Sunday Coming up back to back scenarios you know you're back of gold center is going to get an opportunity to play in one of those\nBut because of how much time is left them between games for Tampa Bay you could have made a case that Andre ... philosophy theoretically could have played all five during the homestead Sean Cooper and the coaching staff decided to go with the ... tonight\nAnd then of course he'd go vast lucky Thursday night against uh divisional opponent\nIn the Detroit right away and I like to call\nI like to call for a couple of different reasons one it's a lot of faith and Louis dimming\nGoing against the Carolina Hurricanes who's four one on one so far the season he's been really really good since he's been a Tampa Bay lightning last year and then in the pre season but again\nHas a play this year so a lot of faith when it comes to the coaching staff playing tonight against the red hot team but also to something to keep in mind Carolina is a team likes to generate a lot of shots and because of that\nLouis dimming might get a chance to feel a little bit more comfortable early in this came then some other contest and I think that factors in a little bit as well\nAnd then you have to understand the Tampa Bay is coming off a really impressive when Saturday Night against the Columbus blue jackets they put up eight goals on one of the better teams allegedly in the eastern conference there are a lot of people out there that maybe they don't think Columbus is an elite team but a solid team\nA team that should make the playoffs and they at times of play Tampa Bay really tough over the years the Tampa Bay scores a minute end of that game then they score late in that game and they just continue to do it and put pressure on Columbus and they broke\nThey gave us goals no teams are going to have that\nThey may have a few games like this this year the Columbus experience it's going to happen but they really did put to rest some of the questions people about their often and when you look at Tampa Bay top to bottom specifically the first second and third line\nThere is so much debt that it is really hard to envision them going three games and only generating\nTwo goals or law at a minimum you're looking at the steam and saying you know what\nThere is no reason why they shouldn't get four or five now getting sometimes that's not going to happen the other team's gonna play really really well we saw a leak goal tending from the first to go centers this year Florida Panthers in the Vancouver Canucks so you understand that good goal tending can be really good off as we've seen that over the years\nBut I think anytime you can throughout the forward stamp has on a consistent basis you put so much pressure on the other teams fold center to make good saves that eventually you're going to break through\nAnd that's what he did was ...\nSaturday nights here namely arena now look you're not going to be facing a ... a net for Carolina and I think that is the biggest question mark if you're Carolina and it's one of the reasons why for Tampa Bay you're looking at the contest and I didn't say you know what yeah we've got to defend hard\nWe've got our backup school center and there hasn't played any games yet so we want to be some defensively [noise] which\nAll guys and we get an opportunity to park let's do it on Pete I'm Ross ... had an up and down for of course Tampa Bay you know from Detroit\nAnd Ross is one of those guys he can look unbelievable one game\nThen the next game there's some consistency issue [noise]\nBut I think there was a real opportunity for Tampa Bay to build off of that game Saturday against the Carolina team while they are scoring\nI think there's opportunities for Tampa Bay\nTo generate some off and on the counter attack and it generates them off as because the goal tending is a little suspect\nAnd really at the end of the day when you compare these two teams [noise]\n\nTampa Bay has got more death bed early players and really the huge advantage is in that [noise] now having to making their\nMillionaires that gap a little bit [noise]\nBut the way to make played last year and the way he played in pre season\nHe's the guy that you can make a case wasn't playing for Tampa Bay [noise] he could start for a couple of teams and the national hockey [noise] knowing his role understanding his role\nThat's what you have to do as a backup specifically with this type of team\nAnd I think you get that we're going to hear from blue to me\nComing up in the next segment we're also gonna hear from John Cooper [noise]\nDimming as you can imagine very excited tonight and I get the sense from [noise]\nHearing the interview\nThat he knew about this a couple of days ago\nSo opportunity for him\nTo ... at least mentally get ready for this game as they always say take those mental rap and I think he should be okay so [noise]\nSo if you're in the air and you want to reach out you can't hit me up on Twitter at ... expectations tonight for the lightning\nAnd what are you expecting from Louis to me [noise] I'm expecting Tampa Bay to build off of what they did last Saturday against Columbus\nTravis ways then he's like I liked him and getting in tonight\nHe needs to get some action if they ready\nAll things being equal if the guys play well in front of him\nHe should be just fine and that's the thing that's the point I'm making I think with the ... [noise]\nYou know if he's going to play twenty five games this year which it's conceivable [noise]\n\nThat means he's picking up a lot of points for you like you did last year and he's also getting back to last you a break\nAnd I think that's the intention [noise]\nIf you can give vast Alaskan opportunity to rest a little bit more particularly is the season continues and you get into that grind [noise]\nAnd you can get away by playing your backup on a night maybe wouldn't you wouldn't typically plan and you can get a couple of points\nSpecifically on the road [noise] John Cooper's gonna you're gonna hear from John Cooper he's talked about it that's a big deal [noise]\nThat's a really big deal because if you don't get good backup play in the national hockey league [noise] the chances of you making the playoffs decreased [noise] and then the chances\nAre you making a really big run into place if you get there basically playing one both at her\nStrengths considerably [noise] I've made the analogy before I think the goal tender position in today's game is the equivalent\nOf the running back position in football from the standpoint you've seen a lot of injuries already at the goals that are position it's an awkward position to play there's a lot of pressure on the the joints that hit the growing\nIn addition to getting run into constantly plus these guys are carrying on all that equipment by the end of the game sometimes you're down six seven eight pounds [noise]\nAnd then mentally straining [noise] and so I think you want to limit if you can't the amount of stars [noise] your number one goal center has because I think you're looking at it from the big picture point of view [noise]\nAnd the more rest vast left you can get heading into the playoffs the better he's going to be in my opinion and if ... is playing at an elite level come playoff time [noise]\nAnd part of the reason why is because he's arrested more so than other goals that are [noise]\nThen it's lightning team has a really good shots when the Stanley Cup [noise] that's just factual [noise] and I don't think many people would disagree with it [noise]\nWe do map it out now I Can't sit here and say is he playing games Seventy six I Can't say that but um\nAre you do have a road map of the month ahead there's no question it's also laid out a\nLittle bit easier for you when you got a bunch of backed backs coming up and ah\nSo the one big thing for us is role recognition\nWe talked about is what everybody's prepared nothing sneaking up on guys and that's where we've done it already and
