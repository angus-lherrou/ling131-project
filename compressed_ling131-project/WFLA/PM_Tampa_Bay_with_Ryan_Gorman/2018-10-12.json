true these people are listening these ... these people are listening to the radio okay I I mean six hours I did we were getting tons and tons of calls everybody's listening and nobody is coming on an

and I knew that they were going to get forgotten pretty quick\nOr because that's just how the news cycle moves these days and we're in the middle of an election uh and and I just knew that people weren't going to pay as much attention to what happened in the panhandle is maybe people did ah to what happened here\nDuring Irma or Maria or a Florence even but I I got to be honest I was a little

pulpit and you've got an army of veterans here with the drugs boats\nDune buggies we need somebody you know if they're not going to organize it why don't you organize it\nAbsolutely the bully pulpit I'm I'm all about it the more people can do to help in this community and begging for the call Rob the better because they're going to need every bit of help they can get\nSo you know part of my job here I I felt like I had to do jobs when I came on for this hour today I'd love to be on with your longer because I have a lot more to say about this but a lot to hold it until Monday and and I'm sure we'll have more stories to tell you about what I hear tonight I'm my my job I felt like today were two things number one make sure everybody knows how bad it is up there\nWhat I'm hearing first hand from people affected by the storm and I think we've done that I I Hope we've done that you have a clear picture that that there are communities completely destroyed and you're not seeing\nThe extent of the destruction on TV you're you're may be seeing a little bit of Panama City and a little Mexico beach I'm telling you I talked to\nCountless other towns and communities are the foreign ...\nPart of those areas that are gone\nRight\nAnd the other job and I always feel like this is part of my job is to hold people in positions of power accountable\nBut don't feel like they're doing the right thing and to make my case for why they should be doing something different so I I hopefully I was able to do both of those things tonight because that was my intention that was my goal and I think we can do both at the same time\nRaise awareness let people know what's needed and then look if you want to go make a trip up to the panhandle to help go for it\nI mean\nThey're going to need it and not just this week for weeks and months after the amount of destruction again think war zone think bomb went off in my community because that's how they're describing it to me\nListen for yourself you can on your ... what do you watch any of the Panama City stations coming up and just after seven you'll hear me you'll hear the callers and you'll hear\n\nThat's why they feel forgotten\nSo if you want to do something and you're not headed to the panhandle again on our website nine Seventy W. F. L. A. dot com we have a way for you to donate and help\nUh we're also going to do in a\nBig Taliban fund raiser we're partnering up with a news channel eight on Monday so we're going to be doing that all day Monday to help our fellow Floridians in the panhandle and I'm sure there'll be other things that will come up between now and Monday showed that we can let you know of a Monday evening because\nYou know think about it in these terms this is one of the top three strongest storms ever hit the United states and it hit poor communities in the panhandle\nWho already did that much and now they're completely destroyed that that needs to be our focus helping those people moving forward I Will talk to you again on Monday\nThey threw all Seventy seven of those beers well that sixty five pounds of beers that's how much of ways to carry the whole thing sixty five pounds and the Seventy seven pack is a total of Seventy thousand three hundred and Fifteen calories well damn I gotta put on weight yeah but those out\nAnd if you drink it fast enough you'll look in the mirror and\nUh you would have become a rat boy Yeah Yup was worth it though and you're in your wing or be small oh\nThat's ... now the natural light beer I I can deal with I used to drink natural life during the whole body what why do I what I used to have what I was growing up and a naturalized was cheap so natural light that's why people guy but I'm the natural I was about\nMy friend's dad drink Keystone it I thought Keystone\nWho all bad I had a friend in college I loved him some Keystone why he was from Rochester New York he loved playing this Gulf listening to fish smoking weed and drink Keystone what he was he was as token as could be a what I see\nThe stories like this and talk about things like I I Know there's a portion of the audience is like Keystone the best day he sounded like or what's the other one that I write a book or did you hear all that you like ... you\nKnow that's like my college go to the Bush lighter Bush heavy\n...

I was going to go with the loophole where I'm not trick or treating I'm candy or demanding give me can be uh they said he or she usually I'll be guilty of a misdemeanor it shall we punish me iron punished by a fine of not less than twenty five dollars or more than a hundred dollars or by confinement in jail for not more than six months\nFor your whole bag of candy\nIt's this is all his mom and they they I guess they say they're not actively seeking out this but every year they have to face as why not just get rid of this law so you don't have to have a new stories like this\nAnd people ask how old is too old to go trick or treating cities are asked that question for you the same thing with the crack down on some kids on free candy\nOn trick or treating in Chesapeake, Virginia you may want to go dressed as a prisoner 'cause the town or an arrest civil offense to trick or treat or twelve years old so we want it to find out if there were any similar laws in our region for this pocket our past\nYeah there's stuff like this all over the country but not like in Chesapeake where it's at a rest a bowl of found a\nMan you know people could really have fun with this you know that like small period of time earlier this year\nWhere permit people were going crazy ... and that was the viral video you got a call the police on trick or treaters either out of the eight Thirteen year excuse me can I find your ID on nine one one right\nNow I think I got somebody out here is that this would happen and it does happen as he got to write that off the books get rid of it in Chesapeake let the kid's trick or treat I remember when I was about twelve or Thirteen probably right around the time and maybe a little after when I had that killer goes costume that you guys love so much\nThat was really made me look like the scariest goes out there ... arena is that it just just regular Casper I Know that it looked like my mom put address on me\nBut it was more than just a white dress it was\nSupposedly a ghost as well and we went out within a trick or treating and my mom never gotten like all the cool kids I don't know why this was cool but they would get the pillow cases and you feel ... I Want to seem cooler\nBut my parents got me this little tiny plastic pumpkin was so small like Jim in your hand in there you got your risk that's why they get to the pillow case because they go pillow case can hold a whole ton more candy than some of these little pumpkin so when you're dump it in there as well and so we go out we do a trick or treating\nBecause in the middle of this all you're going to see the same every time you're going to see some footage from some storm chasers\nAnd that's always cool to watch your going to see the news reporters who are out there doing their thing and you know obviously they do this for ratings and that's great\nBut you're not going to see what the average house looks like what most of the streets in residences looked like what apartment buildings in downtown areas look like you're not gonna see any of that until everything clears up and in fact until the sun comes up\nThat's when that occurs so good luck to everybody some real damaging winds and rain just hounding\nThrough the panhandle as the day rolls on here I talk about this a while ago I could not working but I'm Glad to have it now\nIt made me think back to a lot of things and made me think back to my first ever drink\nWhich was I think when I was Thirteen or twelve or Thirteen probably twelve and it's the same story that everybody has where you go up to your dad and your dad drinking a beer it was my dad drinking a beer with uh my uncle\nAnd oh God like an old Miller light or something and I go up and I go way why couldn't you drink that I Can't drink it he goes you want some of those that go yeah I took a zip I got a\nGrown man I'm never drink that I don't care how old I get and that turned out not to be true but ah I remember that first time I think I was I think it was Thirteen but I didn't my parents didn't go hey if you want to beer go grab one from or\nThe refrigerator I never had that moment now I Can't say uh we did maybe when I was a little bit older I'd be able to get a glass of wine\nBut just like the bottom of that like with dinner you could drink a glass of wine yeah or like it was a special occasion the family lives in town or his New Years I can add one glass of champagne that have failed and we're going to take out a little bit more at what age would you be out when that was allowed\n... for ... fourteen herself she liked what about you the first time\nAnd and what did you ever have the opportunity like she said that actually sit down to dinner and have a drink\nUm it was like her like glass of wine every once in a while and a special occasion or something there was a a wedding reception like my mom was a little more lenient than my dad about that which is ironic because my dad's on ... and a bunch\nOf but uh there was one wedding rehearsal dinner where they had just had the wine in ... in my private room at the restaurant and my dad didn't realize how much water to drink and they should have to go to the\nBathroom when I had a few wind today you are just getting bounded hammered but but how was\nThis was I was in like high school I don't I I might have already started drinking with friends at the time\nBecause a lot of people are listening to this and go on that that seems way too young but LeBron James was due to press conference in of all the things that they could have talked to about Los Angeles basketball cetera\nAnd they asked him about you know what do you pick up from your teammates as far as pop culture goes and he mentioned do is image look I pick up a lot of things from my kids is that what my kids are mature they even drink like my kids drink\nWine okay and they're all Lebanon fourteen a lesson [laughter] in\nAny I Know he's obviously drug abuse because there'll be driving next week too but this made headlines all over the place areas [noise]\nReally\nOf your driving next week\nThat is obviously joking around and let her on\nA mom and my\nGod so you could barely hear behind all the dribbling there\nBut he said everything they listen to this day\nBy for Daraa these days my fourteen and my eleven year old they watch to I got very mature fourteen eleven year olds my fourteen eleven year old drink wine that's not mature they are there'll be driving next week to\nIs that whatever dads and moms having put it on me though don't put it on mom put it on dad put it on does oh is that like yeah we have a drink at the table I'm sure\nThis doesn't mean that eased allowing who's eleven year old to do keg stands a he's probably just having a sensible glass of wine\nOr in the ... still a legal it is it illegal immigrants get arrested your parents can get arrested for one of the charge or providing alcohol to minor is a contributing to the delinquency every miner or the other civic charged\nFor the uh ... can be both but yeah there's a there's plenty of like pie essays and billboards everywhere you know every once in a while they ah remember parents it's illegal to give your your kids alcohol and ... and we've had stories where I'm\nA a like a party has been busted like one of the neighbors or got upset with one of the the the parents in the neighborhood that had allowed and I'm a person under Twenty one to have a drink and they called the cops and the cops had to come and arrest them I think oh they're in California\nSo let's see what is over there it's illegal in California for a minor to be in possession of outgoing any public place\nOf liquor is not the case in the bronze mansions of their okay\nIn order to prove the elements of this defense they
