every now and then on Monday I'll I'll say a couple of things about sports at the top of the show just because you know now we got football season and us apps playing the bucks a plane and big things are happening I'm speaking of the box\nWhat a disaster yesterday so bad that the correct me if I'm wrong but didn't Dirk ... said it pretty much like everybody should be fired because of that last\nYeah he did it and he said after the after the game he said everybody including myself should be fired it was the worst game that that team is playing a long long time they were absolutely al class and embarrassed and Chicago\nNow I wasn't surprised that the often struggled a bit you're going up against ... and I'm really really solid a Chicago Bears defense but the fact that the bucks defense got destroyed by a trip ... who I mean it's not that he's\nA bad quarterback but he's not a great one yet and he'd lift them up and the bears off and let them up that was what was a little surprising to me\nYeah and and just to go back real quick to the ... a lot of reason why bucks fans are upset and a lot of reason why bucks fans are calling from Mike Smith to be fired is because you knew you were facing a bears defense with ... here's this guy would double digits acts already coming into this game and you did nothing to try to neutralize him\nSo you're often could make plays yeah you let him run crazy on this often so blind so I think that's where some of the frustration comes with bucks fans today especially that they did not have a defensive game plan for right now the guy who beat the odds on MVP guy the way he's going through the forest first four weeks but as far as the office is concerned\nI mean it made it we were a little bit spoiled after three consecutive four hundred yard games and I don't think anybody expected as you mentioned it go up against the bears defense and a half it's Patrick throw for another four hundred yards\nNo nobody also expected to be down by thirty five points in the first half right I think that's\nWhere we all kind of went whoa what's happening here I mean where the where is all the big place that we've had a where's the Sean Jackson where's where's all these places vacant for the first three weeks and I think even though you know as bucks fans and covering the team you knew they were going in and gets a really good defense\nThere was no way I thought they were going to be down thirty eight to three and a half time I thought it would be a close game I didn't know if the bucks could pull it out on the robot I'm with you I don't think anybody saw that common including Dirk on her\nI thought I thought a close low scoring game that's what I was expecting going in what is going on with the bucks deep and how do you get torched by a not a rookie quarterback is the second year quarterback but he he hasn't really stood out over the first couple of games of the season ah how do you get torch like that by by ...\nWell number one box really didn't put much pressure on them and that's the big key that office of line for Chicago did a really good job of kind of neutralize in the box at the point of attack but\nAlso the defensive back say we've had problems in that secondary all year long a lot of it has to do with injuries a lot of it has to do we're playing with were playing young guys like em Jay Stewart\nThere's a lot of young guys back there and that secondary and they're still cutting their chops and the NFL not exactly the way that you want to go into a defensive game plan to have a lot of rookies on there but they do have a lot of young guys who are still trying to figure out what's going on and\nBoy it was like the perfect storm as far as the bears are concerned everything they did every call they made it seem like the bucks didn't have an answer for it or the books that know what was coming\nNo and and and the halftime adjustments weren't there was just top to bottom a just a really really bad game and now we've had too rough games in a row obviously the bucks made that comeback attempt against steel is couldn't make it all the way but they've lost two in a row now after this to a\nBig wins to start the season so before we get to the quarterback situation which team is it is it a team that started the first two games in one and and look like you know they might be a

A. and it's got its own\nTheme song [noise] I like the U.S embassy a [noise] ah we are going to try\nTo get to that at some point this evening to talk about it you have to play this song the entire time ... the entire discussion while I'm doing in depth analysis on the trade deal oh boy this is the theme song for the new trade deal [noise]\nHere here's the short version if you thought NAFTA was the worst deal ever you're going to be disappointed because this is NAFTA with a few modifications and updates some of which came directly from TPP\nIt's a better overall deal but it's more like an already built a house with a new paint job in a few new fixtures rather than a completely new house and that makes sense yeah that's that's kind of the exciting land short a sink version of of what happened with that NAFTA deal\n... the where I Want to start involves the president\nAnd then of course we'll get into all the Florida stuff I have to touch on two things involving President Trump real quick we had we have two stories break\nOr about him today the first one was Wall Street journal report that told us what we already knew\nThat the president lied about his knowledge of the Stormy Daniels nondisclosure deal I Know a lot of people roll their eyes at that and maybe I'm old school but I still prefer when leaders don't lie to the American people and unfortunately seems like that's all we're seeing these days\nThe other big story that broke is from the New York times and this is something I Want to spend just a few moments on before we get into the update on the race for governor here in the state of Florida the New York times reported in pretty great detail\nAbout how\nAnd I'm quoting here Donald Trump participated in questionable tax strategies in the Nineteen nineties that allowed him to recruit millions of dollars in additional wealth from his father's real estate\nEmpire is this surprising\nBut here's why it really ticked me off right now I'm dealing with the IRS last month they contacted me over my twenty sixteen tax return ... question\nIs an education tax credit that you can take you take classes which I did at the University of South Florida it's not a huge tax credits peanuts and the overall scheme of things they want proof that I pay the university for the classes I took\nThe university just billing me for them they want proof I actually\nPaid which of course I did\nBut the process is a nightmare and anybody who's ever dealt with the IRS before it knows this if you have a question and want to talk to someone over the phone be prepared to put at least an hour of your life aside at a minimum and even after that\nI still don't really know what exactly they're looking for so now I have to get someone to help which costs money all this while the wealthiest among us get to take advantage of\nLoophole after loophole after loophole\nAnd that's really what this New York times reporter is all about the wealthiest among us and the big big corporations they helped write the rules and then they cash in meanwhile us middle class mocks pay every last\nDime and barely ever get a break that's why this story you know what I mean today and if you think any of this was really fix with the tax reform package that Republicans passed last year and that the president signed\nUrine fantasy lions couple of weeks ago the wall Street Journal did a report on a tax change the get this helps executives afford pricey your private planes I kid you nuts and that's not the failing New York times that's not fake news NBC that's the wall Street Journal\nNow now why is that I'll tell you why because all of you and me\nWere too busy working our way through the daily grind\nTo pay attention to what's happening in DC I pay attention to it\nMore because it's my job but most people have a nine to five they have kids lot going on meanwhile the wealthy and the well connected they're paying attention and they're making sure the rules\nBenefit them and that's not changing anytime soon the whole thing makes me want to Ralph's\nOr does it make you in a ... no no no we want to Ralph the whole thing that I just had to get that\nOff my chest for a moment because when I saw that story and it's not just President Trump more than Donald Trump or took advantage of all those loopholes many people are still doing it today but I'm just a middle class guy alright I came from Spring Hill\nIf any of you know that area and Hernandez cat in the middle class area\nI got a middle class family I'm not making the big\nBucks doing PM Tampa Bay I can assure you of that not like the rest of the line up here on the station where they're all millionaires\nOkay I'm not\nGetting the big loopholes I'm getting questioned by the IRS on a dopey minute\nEducation tax credit for two years ago it's ridiculous whole thing's ridiculous coming up next a we've got some calls on this we can take your calls also I Want to get to the Florida

I mean it can get a get any crazier and only Eighteen series\nSo I'm I'm In full agreement with senator Cassidy go look into sweat next claims and if she\nGave a sworn a false sworn affidavit she should suffer the consequences that also Senate Judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley sent a letter to attorney general Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray seeking to have\nMaterials materially false statements made to the committee as part of its investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh referred for criminal investigation\nThe specific one that he's talking about\nInvolved Senator Sheldon Whitehouse is a constituent there was an on identified man who made the apparent false statement and reportedly contacted White House staff this was that allegation about boats\nAnd all of that and then this individual recanted and apologize for the allegation via social media well if he can be\nProsecuted for that do it if you can bring charges against this guy for just floating out a false allegation like that do it 'cause that'll slow down\nSome of these crazy accusations that we're seeing left and right Mazie Hirono who I have lost so much respect for I didn't really know much about her before this Kavanaugh\nSituation she's the Democratic senator in Hawaii who I think he's made a complete jerk out of herself through this whole process but she is one of the ones pushing this what matters right now is how cabin on behaved twenties drunk\n\nShe says that she's got concerns because of reports in anecdotal testimony the cabinet was aggressive when he was drunk in high school and college quote\nIt all goes to how he behaves when he's drunk is very aggressive behavior belligerent behavior when he's drunk this is why we need an FBI investigation because there's a lot of allegations in the reports really are about how he behaves when he was drunk\nThere are no reports outside of the allegations made my board and Ramirez forget about sweating act because to me that that one's over after\nWhat she said last night on TV there are no allegations there's no gr operation outside what board and Ramirez of sad that Kevin did anything sexually inappropriate\nWell drunk I've been drunk belligerent I'm In a loud loud now imagine when I'm drunk\n\nI have not done anything sexually inappropriate when drunk and belligerent loud\nIt's ridiculous yes the goal posts have shifted I mean my God\nIt was originally about whether or not Kavanaugh did anything inappropriate at that party we don't know where to place we don't know when it's a place but at that party that Christine for described whether or not he did anything appropriate that\nAnd then it became about when he was in college if he did anything inappropriate at a party at a dorm with Deborah ...\nSo far where we stand today I think we have more questions now after for its testimony than we had before it and we still don't have any corroboration first hand collaboration for either of those stories and maybe the FBI has found some during the course of their investigation\nMy that would be on at the moment probably not but that's\nThe main issue here not how cabinets acted when he was Trump's like Thirty years ago it's whether or not they did anything sexually inappropriate to keep our eye on the ball here\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two I've got his banjo O'Rourke story I Want to get two plus we have a couple of Florida stories we didn't get to in the six o'clock hour all that and more next done PM Tampa Bay\n[noise] New Year's traffic and whether hard radios nine Seventy WFL a [noise]\nHalf the time I Seventy five is still close both north and south I'm between four and Fletcher avenue\nDue to a serious accident nothing I Am I going off the road and onto Fowler avenue salaries also closed between the three in one in the extreme you can use foster avenue as an alternate teen some heavy traffic building up on two Seventy five north family ...

Studio we have\nMy producers Morgan lash engines Berliner of course the phone lines are open an eight hundred nice it's nine Ninety three fifty to seven up just after eight o'clock Tampa Bay times military reporter Howard all men will join us in Studio we haven't had Howard in in a while so looking forward to that\nRight now let's go to the phone lines Scott in Tampa joins us on line one Scott how are you\nI'm well how are you good for the call\nOkay I've got I've got to just say enough is enough with this ah the way everybody's talking about how we act when he was the question Kavanaugh because this guy jumped into this into this set up is what I Would call regardless of the allegations we'll find out if they're true or not yeah\nThey take nothing about the last Thirty years of him and publicize what character as what positive influences he's ban\nEverything is out the window over an allegation that I Believe truth but he was set up for we'll find out if he's going to be guilty the FBI do their investigation yup what everybody wants to focus on this poor guy having to talk to kids about what's going on is white friends neighbors everybody that daring it out now he's got to deal with his college days it's high school days\nAnd at the end of the day some of the stuff you keep from your children you keep from your your wife you you've grown as a man your characters who ... who your work Thirty years ago you grow overtime right dog that does something wrong or the puppy you're not going to shoot him as an adult that grow over time this is a human being who's done a lot of good thing\nIf they can't find ways to focus on what he's done in a good way they have to just wait until the investigation is complete but judging him on his testimony is I don't know what any person in this situation would do because we're not there\nYou know when I got an adult life then I get that\nGave him I gave him a lot of leeway on his testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee and I put it out on Twitter in real time that that his opening statement I was like hey if I had been accused of these things and I was innocent I become an out swinging just like he was but at a certain points\nYou do have to remember that you were a nominee for the Supreme Court's\nSo I felt like when it got into the back and forth\nI I didn't like how he handled himself in certain situations it bothered me the back and forth with Amy club which are bothered me look\nHe apologized for it so clearly he didn't do the right thing there otherwise you wouldn't have come back from a recess and I've had to correct his actions so that that\nConcerned me a bit um but but when it comes to what we're seeing right now look drinking plays a role in this because the allegation is that he was intoxicated both times but but all of these other instances where he was drinking reacted a certain way when he was drunk it doesn't it doesn't directly tie into those two nights\nIt's all about those two nights\nThey all these other instances where he was allegedly drinking or he was belligerent or he was thrown ice after you'd be forty concert there is no sexual assault allegation tied to any of that so to ...\nTake some type of character attachment and trying to yeah character that said yeah Seventeen to twenty seven year old kid are you kidding you said it's not the character right but now the personality today let me ask\nYou this to be fair Scott the the comments that he made the responses that he gave about the yearbook words\nA body you got two daughters did did you get I mean yeah but you're\nNever going to spit out the honest to God truth and we all know what the truth is about\nThat yeah but you're you're all in your under oh you're in a row so there's not there's not like an exemption for hey you have daughters so therefore you cannot tell the truth under oh ... well that is an doesn't exist fact that they would even bring that up\nRight but that it doesn't bother you at all did he did he even on something like Ralph and then he tried to make some nonsense excuse that we all know was BS\nNow you have kids I Know I look again there's no better out or you're there is no exception work there's no kids exception for being on the route of hip exemption\nBut we all know that programs don't ask those questions if you got to ask those questions and you obviously don't notice what does it have to do with anything that he's been accused from by Ford\nRight they were they were ... they were clearly going after his character but still that doesn't excuse him for not telling the truth on the road when you're one\nYears old if you're drunk and belligerent at Seventeen to Twenty one years old and people are going to call you out at that yeah okay All right that that might be the case but at the end of the day\nDon't don't air out that kind of garbage in front of his children that's that's poor taste if low class in this thing should never escalated work that today the Democrats would have handled it properly and said we've got a big problem we need to handle this on a private side\nRight and have certainly could have been handled far better than it was there was a different way to do it absolutely horrible\nWeapon but if it's true then we'll find out and that's how it goes the one thing that's always if it smells and looks like a duck and walks like a duck duck so if he's this type of a predator yeah back of a sexual assault person there should be a track record way greater than this\nThanks for the call Scott appreciate it All right appreciate it it really the only point that I disagree with Scott On there as\nA we've got the ... story that we need to get to you and I also want to talk about somebody\nA name big Mike if
