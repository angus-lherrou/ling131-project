what's going on and Panama City and what we're doing on the radio or do nothing but now we're handing it off\nExactly and it's the listeners calling and feeding us the information to get out to other people listening\nNow yeah and even more than that you know like go five minutes you know somebody needs help yeah right and somebody that doesn't even call in to tell us they're going to get them

polls I Would have I I Would think he would be more of the state of earth than he is here\nWholesome tightened up we're looking at a uh a race within the margins a toss up race at the moment but so he is still close\nI mean we're talking we're we're at ... plus one twenty means if you put a hundred dollars on it you're going to win a hundred and twenty dollars\nOkay and then what if you put money on Gillum what would you get how does that work I think what are you got to put a hundred and what what does the U.S is\nGoing to show how much of a degenerative I Am so I Do my betting that I go by twenty dollars a day I waited and mine is one sixty I can I can do the math without okay mine is one sixty about twenty bucks to go you're going to win about Thirteen Thirteen bucks\nOkay not bad and then who's a very real to general way only like twenty seconds here who's the favorite in the U.S Senate race\nA steady Mina dedicated to pick on\nIts ... okay All right so I figured you'd be the perfect one breakdown baby a Peter shores Florida politics dot com publisher coming up next to break down the latest polling in the big Florida races here on PM Tampa Bay ... dot com [noise]\nMy thing a red wave tonight at six thirty nine Seventy WFL a hold of lightning on\nOn this Thursday October\nEighteenth I'm your host Ryan dormant and with me on the hotline right now we have publisher Florida politics dot com Peter Shore assure you can follow on Twitter at Peter Shore chef el Peter how are you\nGood I notice the or we talk more at this time of year yes [laughter]\nThere's a lot happening and I wanted to have you on a first of all a regulations to St peoples who is now part of the real clear politics I average the polling average that's a huge and I think it's well deserved based on the polling a that was done in the primaries and uh and and really\nBut I wanted to have you on to talk about this latest poll this post Michael poll because it I found it to be very interesting tell us what you found out\n[noise] well I'm not that I can say it on behalf of people but a working with them all the time that is a big deal they have good numbers they're worth following a they've been\nProbably more accurate than others so I'm I'm Glad to see them in the real clear politics aggregation they've gotten your numbers out that we commissioned a you know we were we weren't weary of polling\nUh right now because the Tallahassee and animosity media markets\nAre are impacted by hurricane Michael yup animosity much more than a Tallahassee\nWe went into the field and it looks like I'm the race is deadlocked over to the races Andrew Gillum Enron Santa Rick Scott and built now and I'm In Illinois is at forty seven around us that forty six percent and then build now I mean Rick Scott as a ... point lead\nOn Bill Nelson but that's well within the margin of error it also has to take into account you know part of gas and county which are heavily Democrat but ... county which are heavily Republican or not included in the sample as much as they should be\nWell it's going to be interesting because we think they should be included in the sample obviously but there's also I think a question as to how many people are going to turn out in those areas because they've been affected by the storm\nWell and and we ran the numbers to and\nYou know if you look at it um unfortunately at first glance it doesn't look like it's a big deal because the margin between Republican and Democrat I think it's maybe seven or eight point but in reality\nThe Democrats that are in the panhandle are you know their traditional Dixiecrat your folks that have voted for Donald Trump that is you know a Republican stronghold of there ever was one ... come down to one point to point race\nOr that could be an issue for Santa and Scott that's why we saw today the governor has issued the first I think it's gonna be a couple a ruling or after the uh issue after new rules on voting they've expanded early voting dramatically they've\nUh they've done everything they can do to basically make voting happy and the impact the county that kind of short of extending the election um there's some question of whether or not even do that in a federal rate ah but today the secretary of state\nHas a dramatically expanded the voting opportunities for those in the impact accounting\nAnd that's good luck obviously politics plays into some of these kinds of decisions but I think it's the right thing to do regardless uh you want to make it as easy as possible off of the people up they're affected by the storm to cast their votes\nOr if they want to you also are found in this poll or some information about how people view Governor Scott and Andrew Gillum response to hurricane Michael\nYeah we we asked that we asked Florida vote or what did they how would they measure the approval rating of how Scott Gillum respond to the storm and\nRick Scott has got great number is it something like almost a three to one at sixty percent sixty one percent to twenty two percent favorable unfavorable so all those images of Rick Scott yup\nI'm you know on the back of a helicopter passing out water seeking to have worked for him Andrew Gillum it's a little bit of a mixed bag um it's only about forty something percent to about thirty from ... percent inside of them a margin of error and so and\nYou want to say oh well that's just partisanship leading over but that's not true because Rick Scott is getting great numbers so for whatever reason it does not look like Andrew Gillum is going to get a traumatic hurricane bum are coming out of Michael\nCould that have something to do with the fact that those uh ads running criticizing Gillum ... past handling of ah hurricanes you could that played a role in how people view him handling this hurricane\nBingo or I mean you you hit the nail right on the head you know one minute you're watching a a a news segment with Andrew Gillum but then in between those news segment our you know ad after at criticizing him or his his responses to the previous storm they had in twenty six team\nThat's part of the issue for Gillum right now we you know I remember you and I sit together watching election night and we were surprised Gillum one but you know one of the things we talked about that night during the primary was\nHe had never had a glove laid on him yeah nobody it ruin any negative against him and now he's having it for the first negative ads really run against him and so that's why you see in the fall you know September twenty or twenty six ... cat him up as much as nine point\nFrom Emily arena here's redlin alley [noise] we I live\nIn we are getting you sects for lightning and Red Wings Greg literally with you if you want to get involved in this show you certainly can I advise you to\nOn Twitter that's because we've got all round table it's actually more of a straight table as a grown to notice typically on Saturdays we're live at the one fish grow right section one of ... and is legitimately a round table but we're here in the home booth\nHome radio and it is a straight [noise]\nLook at like a great job Greg's analogy that's running right downsides of novels that is Ryan\nJay rats are six twenty five ... we've got Bryan burns in the middle\nFor those days during the Paris coping Facebook life but the reporter for the Tampa Bay lightning an era girl and then from lightning insider dot com\nLightning lunch you hear that one to two week days on lighting power to force I'm Greg when LA and we're glad\nBoys let's get right into it\nA Tampa Bay coming in having an opportunity to win four or five against opponent Eric [noise]\nThat they've won a Lebanon in a row we were talking about this before\nWe were coming on the air hard to envision\nBeing a team of eleven straight time\nIn an era where there's a ton of ... [noise]\nYeah it it really is an end to take it even further it's eleven straight at home [noise]\nLenny ... by the way yeah and then and then you go back to the start of Thirteen fourteen season which is the first year that John Cooper was sort of Eighteen for\nAgainst this team that doesn't include playoffs we know there's two playoff series of temple in\nUm it it's very hard to do in today's age and it's [noise]\nIt's a complete role reversal with these two franchises because from Ninety two until two thousand and Thirteen Red Wings absolutely own the lightning and and it was worse on the road I think Tampa had two positive results that show Louis arena between Ninety two in\nTwo thousand and Thirteen so [noise] um there there are a unbelievable numbers it's an unbelievable streak you you see this\nPop up every once in a while in pro sports my hum button hockey and I think it's a little harder to do in hockey because especially now as you mentioned there's so much parity in leagues so many good players on so many teams it's usually something small that separates the really good teams from the decent team\nAnd so on to win eleven consecutive games and eleven consecutive home games against one team is very impressive streak\nBirds the cork honaker reassigned to Syracuse identity Marcel on a conditioning in the course that means the Rhine Callahan is joining lined up tonight [noise]\nHow does that change the fourth line and what are you looking for from Kelly inside [noise]\nYeah I mean when you look at that fourth line now and are probably coming in for Adam earning you with the ... the forwards that the the one guy is going to be the odd man out which\nYou know for him he probably had as best game of the season I thought in a gets Carolina I mean he made an impact each time he was on the ice he was a he was noticeable whereas the first couple of games I didn't necessarily a notice them on the game so\nYou look at that that fourth line now you're talking about JT Miller probably flying over to the left wing study a park cat in the middle one Callahan back to his normal spot on my right hand side I mean\nYou're donkey were talks that are rolling for line that's a pretty happy fourth line a day and I were talking about this on our Facebook Live so I mean that's a line to you know a lot of teams might like it was her second or third line yeah ah it's got firepower it's got a lot of grit got tough enough I mean that's a pretty good group\nIn ... it's interesting because they have an opportunity to take\nFour or five on this film than [noise] because from simple is really going yet one combined goal\nIn some ways that's scary for the rest of the Lakers if at some point those guys are going to break out\nYeah I think you can add a McHale search up to that list as well I mean you figure ... three of your stronger offensive players haven't really fired on all cylinders it and you're right man I mean you see the contributions from guys like Tyler Johnson\nAnd bringing point even ... those guys bring it every single night um and just to see that those guys aren't doing their thing yet and they've won three or four really is pretty impressive and I'm with you and you look at\nIf you're on the outside looking in at this team is lightning team and you're thinking if you didn't look at the stats and go they won three or four to drop samples probably have rival or two but that hasn't been the case\nAnd I think looking to that game the other night we were watching it I think before the game the other night and everything on the NHL Network was Carolina Carolina Good young teen good jumping and then the lightning came out and play the best game they play it all year\nThat's what the lightning has done the last couple of years every time a team goes on a little bit of a role they come here to Emily arena and lightning kind of shut down and I think that's kind of a a good marketing [noise] and I think when\nYou look at what has surprised you most with the lightning water early on [noise]\nAnd he talked about the scoring a little bit early on a warm feeling that much but the PTA [noise] yeah I mean are we talking about campus to Charleston one combined both that could be it but did anybody envisioned the ending perfect on the penalty kill when it was really their downfall last year\nAnd and not just perfect they've out scored the other team than Martin ... uh yeah it it I mean there's been moments of of a disjointed and this I think in in a couple of the games I think back to the Columbus game and I think uh\nTo one of the Carolina power plays that you know the goal tending really stood up and did his job to everything for the most part they've been very consistent uh they've done a very good job of clearing talks I think they've been\nPretty aggressive with the high school were in the PKK in and trying to pressure to park and try and force planes you know you you're going to give up ... and the question is how good will look are you going to give up and I think if you can pressure to pop the way that they have\nYou'll force team is in the end and they may be taken an outside chance or you know if you force the park and you closed down across I seen pass you give your goal to enter a better chance to make you say those are the kinds of things that I'm seeing\nVertigo thing it's been solid again Louisa ... without standing in his thirties one eight three in one now when he gets an opportunity to play in that for Tampa Bay [noise] can you make a case [noise] it's the ... do well in all talking about the individual\nYeah I think it is I don't know but you know that's better and I mean you got\n... to abandon the caliber a gold tender a you know where you're going to get out of him every night but but in Louis ... being I mean I think he's really just been a revelation for the team and\nYou're not that Peter Bhutto I was on a bad job I thought he was pretty solid as a as a number to last year for the lightning but once they brought in Louis demeaning I mean he just kind of elevated that are that backup goal tending spot to another level when\nHe's wants to puff game but I think back to that Nashville game in Nashville or last season where he was getting after we peppered in the first period a was lucky to get out that only giving up two goals and gave the light need a chance to win that game as the second half of it back to back then you can also against the choice team in\nDetroit last season or the whitening we're coming off to losses or do they were still in that stretch where they hadn't given up or are they had lost three games in a row and they were trying\nTo keep that streak impacted or Louis demean came in and gave him a wonderful performance I don't really see much drop off it any or when Louis demand comes in for ... some aspect is maybe a little bit better said ... as far as like playing the fog behind them that are getting the pocket of the fence when so they can start\nA rash of the other end or I think that's something that may be bad we could\nJust look to Louis and learn a little bit from and that was actually we're going to point yesterday that [noise] there are few seems that got looted measure started [noise] now I don't know if they'd be slapped teams yeah he was a fun but you're trying to sell me Carolina wouldn't take losing as their number one right now what about the Tea Party is going to say just came right here in Detroit [noise]\nI mean do you mean Howard Bernie editor okay right I mean the mood to make it so I think like twenty six [noise] I think there's he's sending player that has room to grow [noise] but yeah we all know a soul sending a lot of it's so much\nConfidence is heavily feels like they can search you guys out there on a given I can pick up points with your back I guess the hot seems [noise]\nLike Caroline and that is such a huge yeah without a doubt and then you think of a I think one of the justice of the ... how to make when Ben Bishop are lashing out here that's left he was the goal center here was when you have a guy that can play the ... as well as guys like Ben Bishop in you know Mike Smith and guys like Louie dimming your defense\nDoes not come all the way back or injuries and talking to foreigners all the time right and I think when you're a team that troubles is has trouble squaring goals like Detroit that would be who doesn't have a guy that can play the puck a little bit more jumpstart that Russia and have a little more transition game\nEffect and how to hang back\nExtra ... were out there and then use the because if there's one thing you gotta worry about what Detroit as they got some guys that really scared\nOf those guys got got them in motion like that I think that would help them out big time of the lightning it's just that luxury of have that they are back up the whole Senate such a good to gather\nRound table Jay retrofit funny WG a primary fuel for for this after landing thrown from lightning inside or dot com and also like the lunch joining me here on nine Seventy WFL a enlightening

Travis County and coming back that far ahead of schedule kind of worries me less you've actually one hundred percent no need to come back now as you said last year it's real value was in the playoffs and I agree with that I I think obviously you wouldn't be in the wind up tonight if he wasn't a hundred percent\nAnd I think that fourth line it will be very interesting to see how they produce moving forward because I think in today's game [noise]\nYou need [noise] for line that can play the fourth one doesn't have to obviously score time but they have to score a little\nAnd whether that's Ernie ... cat and Miller whether that Callahan\nNow on a wing with Miller and pocket you got to be able to do something off sense of like I'm really looking for that one tonight of course if you're just joining us Callahan will be on the line of Adam ... will be the healthy scratch so we'll see how this plays out and uh as director said he'd like to see a cow and out there I just started this game\nKind of get the nerves out a little bit and see if he goes out and hit somebody right away because he thinks he does that tell me to feel at home\nUh speaking of home the lighting have dominated the Detroit Red Wings just in general they want to let it straight and I thought Arab brought up a good point when you talk about Detroit right now\nIt's just [noise] comparing them to Tampa Bay there on completely two different levels right Tampa Bay is an ascending team I think the trick\nIs trying to figure out where they are\nThey want to rebuild they want to go with some younger players those younger players have struggled so far out of the gate and here's the thing they haven't won a game yet\nAnd you know I don't know what they are playoff aspirations were this year I think secretly they probably so yeah we want to get into the playoffs and that's our goal but\nIn today's parity driven league you know you get up to no foreign to start [noise]\nIt's tough to come back from that and it really is because of the Atlantic division I think very similarly to the the metro [noise] you know basically to the top two maybe even three teams are [noise]\nAnd so if you're it seemed like Detroit is on the the outside looking in [noise]\nYou know you have a scenario where you get off to a slow start early on in the season that could cost you a playoff spot\nLike I don't want to over dramatize things here but for a team like Detroit that's a pretty big deal that's why tonight if anything you're going to see a team that is going to play there because I think they're going to have to\nBecause I think they understand if they don't they're going to lose twelve in a row to this lightning theme and fall further back in the sand it should be interesting [noise] I like lightning the lending a lot that I that lets you will get them to start counting it'll be on the fourth one\nPercent because to drop the big games but because they have done that in their careers do again Detroit maybe how that plays out All right thanks everybody involved in helping the night diversity on location ...\nBacker network studios Jay register hair relatives and Brian burned I'm Greg with only got the pre

appears ahead in so many situations well\nOne thing without pretty complete player can play both ends of the ice she's one of those guys that you know we can slide and in effect of all the power play the totally killed so he's been in all these situations before and\nWhen you know the young guys controlling him a little bit of experience and you could have been there done that [noise] um [noise] and he's a really good complementary player like he'd compliments a lot of different skill sets of guys and I probably white newly played in so many different situations I just I think it helps you guys\nKnow ... and I just came back and find out\nHow we use we come back we're at the Knight or is your um how do you see that kind of impacting obviously has been tightened up what line of assuming where he was last year\nWe're not on I just how could I not have a positive impact Deborah Kelly in back of your lineup\nJust from a leadership aspect to a grid factor um one thing right Cohen does he pulls a team into the fight and a\nVery ... just sell out all over the playoffs last year uh the one thing is just how ... so well you know timing might be an issue but kill 'em they'll go ride you'll find a way\nShe she's played in sleeveless tops six dollars if you had a man who's been playing with\nWho study in ... or either ... kind of adjusted to someone who's been trading some chances in in playing well\nI'll be honest we're for line team I I don't know how to sit here and say who's the number one liner team can you know can you really say that NATO who's number four four lines uh I got a big reason why we\nPulled out back Carolina game yeah we got the goal in the power play but you know we rolled for lights and there wasn't any specific group you're going out more than the other and and I think for us to be effective and\nIt's something we have to do and it's a it's been working\nFor generally do you prefer games that are low penalty game so you get a chance to roll for lunch I Know you like more power place than pettaway kills but generally speaking would you like to see games where you can kind of roll those four well\nOne thing about that [laughter] uh it's less taxing on the players when there's less special teams so there's that balance the guy's a power play love to jump on for the power play\nBut you got to remember now there's a bunch of guys you know ... not getting scab but they're not in the park like it's the same with\nHighly kill so you look the Carolina game\nNow for instance your coaches and getting over the boards as much because he doesn't kill penalties and and so now you're trying to get him more ice time to get his legs going so the more the special teams it's harder probably for coach to try and get everybody on the ice\nWhere no Palys you're just rolling them guys or any ... read them in a group so\nThere's just a balance when all the special teams have\nLooked for when building here for a line that they're going to be\nRespected and you can actually eat it all for\nThe easy answer is we have twelve good players doesn't really matter where you put a with a it's just kind of matching the skill sets a and you know being here they're pretty fortunate or over the years to have a lot of you\nGuys to pick from a late and I think that's the one thing is is finding you're not getting the way when the lights having success and then and then let it go it's just those times when\nYou look in eighty two games teasing lines do get stale and it's just trying to do not break up on line just to help another and and um but as I said we're pretty fortunate what the hell we had to have some [noise]\nBy that was a John Cooper earlier today talking about Ryan ... and a mother things or how deep the scene is no doubt at deciding taking on the red wings ... here to talk about it a little bit more good friend lightning insider dot com and also lightning lunch for it on our plate from one to\nChoose the gate [noise] Eric Burlington he it's [noise] I think a lot of people maybe get a in that locker room an extra kick an extra jumped because ... will be playing tonight on a force I'm Jake ... [noise] yeah\nThere's no doubt that uh you know\nCallahan\nIs being on the ice and being around and and husbands in the locker room on and on the bench and everything he brings the ice and often not excited and a half this guy in your line up I mean you need a lot to the team and I you know I Know he doesn't put up the often some numbers\nAre not going to raise the mark again like you get his first year was but\nFolks love love the one in there [noise] for a\nGuy like that the way he plays you and I talked about this going on out there will be interesting to see the minutes and they try and preserve\n[noise] yeah that that's a tough balance I think you know for\nHe is the type of factor has\nBut I think there are ways to do is [noise] without taking a lot of them\nAnd one of those ways I think of them you have you know you've got math you just tell me how do you have Anthony surrounded here for a whole year do you maintain pillars are ready\nThey're using out ... you have other guys if you don't have to rely on line\nI Know you would not agree with me I Know that you would want to join the conversation but there's there's a way to not only just limited managed\nCat in that fourth why they're doing in limited times a lot of good things\nA lot of great things in and actually I think Cedric but get\nThis year looks quicker to me since last year\nFor sure any stronger on the face he's doing a real good job on the fish I so I'm not flying I I think is going to get in there and they're gonna hit\n... and there's one answer the question about cow and do you think timing is going to be an issue for him not having played the game but why spring it'll it'll be a little bit 'cause he didn't have any pre season games either or anything of course it will be a little bit of an issue but he'll he'll get themselves involved in\nIt got to start somewhere\nOr that he starts tonight and then he goes on there's five game road trip\nAnd games in a nice you know a lot of action is always going to get a lot of actor I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't play all five and eight nights to back to the ... yeah so I I Would think but you know then you'll get himself back into it before we go\nBack to Greg just quickly put a lightning cuckoo in or near the scratches John that Eric the navy the Kaiser injured they always seem to have\nProblems with the injured a ...\nBill up her own it is a scratch Mark Kirk is a scratch and Jacob bill rose they picked up on waivers yesterday he is not yet with the team so what are you going to be looking\nFor tonight especially a theme that campaigns had so much to that are those the games were you a little bit I hardly as a coach right I mean I'm\nAs a player yeah I used to worry about the games I sat up the only because the other ... you have a tendency to us for its underestimate them yeah and\nYou underestimate anyone no matter what you do in life and they're going to get you cannot ... competition anywhere you can't underestimate your opponent and I don't think\nThe leaders in this she\nWill not let that happen with Callahan back in [noise] um I don't I don't think you're Victor Victor headman is one of those guys that was saying All right let's not underestimate these guys you know and I'm probably a Gerard eat who been involved in Egypt for\nEver [noise] um the show as long as you're going out there are some industrial minimum might say to you do your job due to well as you can\nGet on their defense don't underestimate them if they get a goal let's find coupons slogans\nAnd get a lot of shots on that they do have the injured too injured defense room so a lot of kids are playing and they got back to the night I Do have daily back yeah and so you know got to try to take advantage of that\nThe other part of this as well I mean the red wings have had a couple of days the stew on to a game where they\nGave up seven or that they gave him ... goals they've given up ... games and they are going to be very focused I think to make sure that\nThey don't have a little as crooked number as they've had in the last two games ... and I'm\nThe guy that always buddies while against us as to say that you had done the steel or you're going to say ... ... no ... attended seal plays very well against it\nAnd it's just the [noise] it says you can buy a plot\nSo it's going to be seen to see what the match ups are\nYeah what's that 'cause you got your already instrument on the right side [noise] that\nWas back in the dad after Louie dim ain't got to win [noise] and all I didn't last game on Tuesday that
