helping all these great organizations out across the bay area um but give us some background on on you know where you guys came from and what exactly you do\nAbsolutely yeah so it started with Thirteen a gentleman who are back in the nineties were throwing parties\nAnd uh they were doing it they're their own houses and it just became such an overwhelming says so many people were common are they decided to find bigger and better Venus and use the proceeds of of those bonds to start donating charity\nOr which has taken us to the largest uh events bases in Tampa Bay um garnering over a thousand people to each and every event and uh raising over a million dollars to local charities in Tampa Bay and our goal and mission is about a hundred thousand dollars in donations of locally\nPer year and these events are really big deal to the organizations that you help out because sometimes you know this kind of puts them over the top in terms of their uh funding for the year\n... yeah absolutely besides you know just the donation itself ah we are cheerleaders and supporters and really promoters you know so some people have never heard of the the the charities and questions so\nWe like to be the the spokesperson over the course of the time we we typically have for events a year\nUm and we have a great social media and email following so we're able to uh not only discuss our parties that people come to love but also a showcase new uh and and really well worth charities to to bring to\nTo our guest and it's not just ... do well first of all the men are all ugly so I Would but that that's the ... and the guy with a little cough here in the background and granted when you know good looking guys are doing this and Thirteen there's there's far more than Thirteen at this point now be actually a gay man it is\nTo expand it yeah I I Believe are at thirty four maybe just telling into thirty six ah we we we have new members are kind of provide a applications and as we've grown\nOur we're growing younger and newer and fresher concepts in parties a ... is our Halloween has been our staple\nUh this is our twenty first annual Halloween ... and the white party has been one of our biggest events but we've kind of have some new concepts at the derby party has taken office will be coming out of our third year of that uh we've been doing a decade's party so we had a nineties party and then the vinyl parties so\nReally some different mixes where um we're we're able to kind of keep fresh and new and\nChoose even better Venus now that would downtown growing our new spaces\nAnd you guys have even branched out a little bit right I I Know you are previously were trying to get into some new spaces across the bay different areas ah hit some different places to to you know get a different audience to absolutely yeah I mean\nIt is great for us you know we're very flexible and we're just looking for you know Venus and ah restaurants and bars and you know wherever these locations are to to help us uh obviously raised money for charity\nAnd in terms of how charities are chosen for these events tell us a little bit about that process and I know some of the charities that you guys do better ones that you guys uh ... the people who are involved in Thirteen men are passionate about or have\nA you know history with and there's some other ones that are you know you've got an apple you know gotten information on and all of a sudden it's worked out yeah so and you only we have\nA way of applications on line and uh this year we had thirty five requests and we have a committee specific to help vet and communicate with the charities and understand what their needs are what their expenses are what their administrative and support\n'em there's charities that we do not select because they're they're already there they're big and they really don't need our support the ah these are all Tampa driven\nUm and uh where how they get selected as we narrowed them down in our our board of does make that vote now\nI'm would beat and be they actually send an application years ago and they still been in the fold and um it just really spoke\nI'm One of our members are Jordan who was it was leading the committee was really passionate and that suggested we really put a beat envy into the consideration at the time or it was a as or organization and\nUm you know it was something that he would know personal ties so that that's you know I think the difference where yeah sometimes of member dictates how that is because\nThere is something that affected 'em all your person in the ... or they're just some relationship that does help us make that decision but in this case it I don't believe that was it was more about the passion of the charity\nThat spoke more higher than any of the connections relationships right or help to help\n'em and uh that's one of the things that comes true would beat him be is you really when you hear from Kyle you're going to understand exactly why that they're younger men chose this as benefiting charity\nAnd so you have a four events may have been throughout the year there was a Halloween and is there one more usually we've\nBeen the last two years we've grown and ugly sweater yeah already um we have not made that formal decision on it or a different concept but we are certainly looking to just kept the air with the un other special event um and\nBy the Halloween party this one year and a new route has been this has yeah one yeah we've we've had at home\nAt at at district a district three which is now a owned by the Vatican a strategic and that's going to be their new home base um so we were forced to find other spot and then it came to mind the Cuban club which had been the ... wobble wean and they kind of\nA stop doing it and it open door for the Cuban club given club\nIs actually known to be his uh his historic is haunted and you I mean you've heard online and look at these down and there's people who've died there apparently and what's great about the Cuban glove it has the ... of Halloween it has ... spirit and then um it has parking the parking lot\nIs where we actually focus our party on because it allows us to do so much with sound in la\nEnjoy eating this year we're expanding to chew parking lots um so our capacity the capacity to be over four thousand people die of indoor space so if there's any weather concerns we just moved to bar you directly inside\nUm but by you know this is going to be a a sound light and the people who come to our events dress like that yeah\nThey get dressed up by word doing best of the bay I'm your host rank or been with me in Studio we're joined by beat and B. and\nThey're seen ugly men we have ... executive director of beat envy David more president have Thirteen oddly mend the websites for both organizations beat and be dot org and their teen ugly men dot com let me turn to you Kyle so we had you on about what a year ago or so yeah we're in that timeframe\nUm first time that we had ever had your organization on the show you guys are having a big event or back then\nUh and ... was that there was something specific about that event that stood out to me was was it a live band karaoke\nThat was it yeah I I yeah ... that's how much it stuck with me that I when I heard the idea I'm like that is a fantastic idea has never been to a function like that before ... first of all how does that have been go well if it was amazing yeah it's always one of 'em so give us some background on\nThe organization a beat and be what it is that you guys do exactly and how it all came about\nSure are so beat him be as a national organization of five on C. three nonprofit I'm based here in Tampa and what we do a lot in Boston as well um we fund childhood\nCancer research that is that is all we do um specifically what the type of cancer called ... which is a one of the ones that we're losing our kids to um although we focus on some other cancers as well\nUh my wife and I helped to found um the group and in two thousand ten after we lost our first son as Russia too narrow by stomach cancer or at\nThat point we looked around and felt like we had to do something um you know this wasn't good enough there were other kids we knew who who their family was in that same situation that we're just going through\nBecause as you're going through and I'm assuming you're meeting all these other families\nExactly and you kind of get close to these people and and learn their story and uh we realized that wasn't really any research\nUm that was bold enough that was going to move forward from this fifty or sixty percent cure rate us we partnered with an incredible researcher out of the University of Vermont her name is Dr ... shoulder\nAnd long story short um we founded alongside her ... what is now a national research consortium forty six hospitals that are involved in clinical trials\nSpecifically around neural Blackstone or um but again now expanded some of those other childhood cancers\nThat started with with one uh one hospital one clinical trial three kids and has grown to treat over a thousand kids directly am I'm forty six hospitals across the country and across the world now uh we're in the process of opening six and Canada there's a couple and Europe as well so\nIt's something that has been a completely driven by the passion of parents and some really incredible researchers\nStanding up and saying look this this isn't good enough fifty or sixty percent survival rate is not good enough for our kids and we're actually seeing some some real differences and survival rates and new treatments coming about it's it's been incredible over the last eight or so years", "show_name": "PM Tampa Bay
