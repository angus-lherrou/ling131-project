priest who once served in Long Island and then was transferred to the bay area in the early Nineteen eighties\nAnd I'm thinking to myself at the beginning of this call he told me he was lucky but that's how a lot of people up there that's how they're thinking right now it's incredible you know he he's lost everything\nYet he's calling up telling us how lucky and fortunate he is that other people have been worse and then spending his day helping others and making sure that everybody listening knows where they can find assistance\nAnd\nYou know call after call like that it just has such an impact on you it it has consumed me for the past week or the stories that I hear the conversations that we have on the air or it's just incredible what's happening up there in the panhandle neighbors helping neighbors but there's so much need up there uh\nWe took a lot of calls today people don't have close people are in need of clothing they've lost all of it it's gone they've got the shirts on their\nBack so gradually we're finding out a different needs there were some people who called ... wanting to know about a mental health needs to be more traumatized by this people are having a difficult time coming to grips with the fact that they they don't have anything their house has gone\nOn in some cases they're they don't know when they can go back to work because the place they worked that's gone\nIt's it's overwhelming the process of dealing with not that you know FEMA and and some of the other\nA charitable organizations that are there to help them not that they're making it more difficult it's just it's just overwhelming\nHaving to go through that process are dealing with the insurance companies you know trying to figure out what the next step is going to be temporary housing and things like that you're still wondering uh you know\nAre you going to get your next meal in a lot of instances you know will this point of distribution be here tomorrow will there be another place it's just it's it's a lot\nOr for people and their complete their life has been completely up ended\nA over the past week so that that's really been my focus it continues to be my main focus I'll be doing more coverage for our Panama City affiliates tomorrow possibly a friday as well and I encourage you if you want a you know listen and I'll be on from one or two six tomorrow until I Do the half\nHour show here we're gonna have a short show tomorrow because the lightning game a bit from one to sixty just on your on your radio I just look up the Panama City radio stations and I'll be on all of them and\nYou'll hear the calls you'll hear the need up there so if you are a business or an organization who is working to help people in the panhandle you can give me a call at any time on the Tampa Bay tonight anytime eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two\nAgain eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two I'd love to hear from you I'd love to talk about what you're doing for those in need up in the panhandle uh because this\nThe situation you know we were talking to a couple of different people\nToday and this isn't like a transformer has to get fixed\nThere's infrastructure that has to be rebuild there are people who are going to be without power for a long long time and you remember what it was like during Hurricane Irma when you were without power some of you I Know are without it for a week two weeks at a time up there it really could be months and we we even had the national weather service on with us today to give them\nA a look at their forecast for the next few days luckily it's going to cool off over the weekend but some rain could be passing through and when you've got a giant hole in the roof that becomes a problem so getting tarps on that\nAh that's something that they are focused on big time up there\nIt's it's a real mess it's a situation that\nIs almost entirely I'm\nOut of view when it comes to the mainstream media they're really not of the cable news networks they're not spending a lot of time on it any more you knew or the big media across the country was going to move on and start focusing on other things especially now that we're in the middle of the midterm election\nThey they are at that point right now I think the Saudis story's pretty much dominating everything\nSo it it really comes down to us here in Florida and helping fellow Floridians up north um\nThere are a couple of issues I Want to touch on that tie in\nTo hurricane Michael in the recovery but but a little bit different in nature one of them is how the president has handled all of this ah also we'll talk a little bit about some of the big races here in the state of Florida we have some new polling or the first\nPost Michael pole so I'll tell you the results of that poll where the races potentially stand 'em and then we are going to get into some of the other big stories including this this story because showed me a story\nI haven't talked to lie in fact I don't think we've done a segment on ah the Saudi Arabia story just yet will do that today I Want to take phone calls on that as well I have some thoughts on how this is all playing out and what we need to do when it comes to the Saudis are and we'll give you the latest up to date information on that story we choose\nReally graphic in nature some of the reports that we're getting from the wall Street Journal and the New York times are I mean this is graphic graphic stuff so I Will touch on that in the next hour uh eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number\nComing up next I Want to spend a few moments talking about how the president has handled\nThe hurricane Michael recovery and we'll take your calls I'm sure some of you will disagree with me on this its moments away here on PM Tampa Bay lightning Red Wings tomorrow night at six thirty nine Seventy WFL a the home of lightning hockey [noise]\nTrafficking whether in less than Thirteen minutes you are listening to Tampa Bay with mine warming nine Seventy dealing with LA\nAnd San jose on Wednesday after Seventeen um your host line Gorman with me my producer James Berlin under the phone number is eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two let me go to Dan in Brandon on line one Dan how are you\nI'm Talking to these people every day you've heard me on the show the past week very passionate about this this is you know I've I've done more hurricane coverage I think over the past\nYear plus than any other radio personality and the country I did nonstop coverage for ... year in Tampa Bay I did a bunch of coverage for our affiliates in in the Carolinas for Florence and I'm doing it again now for the pan handle\nSo you know ways on you when you constantly hear those stories you just want to do whatever you can help maybe I'm not looking at this writes all open up the phones\nBut is it a problem for any of you that the president hasn't really has tweeted out about Florida and the people in need since he visited\nThat the focus has been on this other stuff some of which I Would consider nonsense like a waste of time in the grand scheme of things eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two that's the number\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two and again I'm not saying every tweet has\nTo be about Florida but when you when you're when you're\nNonstop on Twitter popping off you know some forty tweets in like twenty four hours and not one of them is about the situation that you just came from that I Would have thought would have had a like a massive impact\n\nIt's just a little surprising to me and disappointing to be quite honest with you I've been disappointed by a lot of our leadership throughout this whole thing some people have done a really good job others I've I've had a problem with that I made those problems known on the show\nSo the phone lines are already lit up a we'll get to your phone

DNA\n[laughter] test I'm so glad we weren't doing in depth shows on that in the past couple of days because that's just that whole issue is so ridiculous\nUm whether it's that or Stormy Daniels or whatever they're they're just hasn't been much of a focus on the people that he just visited or those who have lost everything in the Florida Panhandle so I Want to get a sense of whether or not you think that's a big deal let me go to a shell in Tampa on line to Michelle how are you\nGetting very good thank you so much for the call\nI'm listening here because I agree with you know I don't generally like creating start where but I've been really different point invite them laugh I guess twenty four hours on end\nIn spending all this time hurling insulting perpetuating division and hate amongst everybody it could take a minute or two and\nHow it came to the people that are suffering greatly up there and it just breaks my heart to think that he would use that event\nThat this had I known as a propaganda tool as opposed to really taking it to heart and and feeling the suffering and therefore making the effort to bring the attention they needed to\nPut him behind the word I I feel like\nIt's just you know I was there I did my thing I'm gone and moving on shiny object and it's just really disappointing\nBecause of the African couldn't make could have such a tremendous impact and the poor people's lives are completely turned upside down and they have really probably in many cases hears a problem to look forward to and they've already been forgotten\nI ... I I I guess my issue is and why I'm bringing this up is because I I just don't know how it's possible not\nTo uh\nBe even even when you're president look he's got a lot of things he's focused on I get that I'm not expecting them to focus on the panhandle twenty four seven but but just the impact it has had on me\nDoing the coverage I've done and taking these calls I I just I don't know how somebody could see what he saw leave and then not consistently want to keep that story front and center you know so I'm I've had\nDone so right there on the plane in the way back yeah yeah I can to run it\nAnd it just it breaks my heart I watch the news and see the pictures I live in Florida so I obviously live this theory or every season but to see those pictures and to be heartbroken for those people African man it just drives home to me the the perspective that I have\nThat his heart's not where it belongs and it just it's a sad thing because it could be doing them so much good you know\nWell it's actually really bad\nI appreciate the call Michelle ah you know I I don't want to say that his his heart's not in the ... I like I don't know what's going through his head as he's conducting themselves away is conducting himself focused on things like Stormy Daniels instead of the the panhandle\nUm I I I just I\nFind it a little disappointing because this certainly seems like a situation where\nThey're not getting the coverage they deserve\nAnd I said it from the start they weren't going to get the coverage they deserve especially nationally local media has done a fantastic job covering the situation up there but the national media has and uh I mean they did a little bit of coverage before uh obviously during when the storm and sitting because the images are so a fascinating to watch and then afterwards\nThere there was a lot of coverage at all it literally like that night so there wasn't a lot of coverage and just hours after the storm hit on a lot of the big cable news networks and I think part of it has to do with the region the storm hit its ports whites rural and people just don't\nCare that much about it if there were tampering Miami or you know it would be on the new still I I think quite frequently but when it comes to to the president and look the Saudi situation something he has to deal with it he's obviously going to talk about that I get it the economy the terms I get some of that you know\nBut but to me uh eight hours ago I tweeted this out there have been thirty tweets and not one of them was about Florida\nAnd I found that a little problematic let me go to Todd in Tampa on line six Todd how are you\nNow doing outstanding again we disagree Donald Trump came down here and told the governor the greatest governor who ... who asked everybody please leave again we had Irma he begged everybody Rick Scott please leave please leave please go to a shelter and and and you know people still decided this day okay\nOne you want me to orange and some of that to you because I figured the calls so are you interested in finding out like some of them didn't evacuate I\nI I ... I'm going to come to that but let me ask you your first question I Know we'll deal with that okay 'cause I didn't evacuate during armor too by the grace of God I was able to live through it okay so let me say let me say something now Donald Trump lives and far Donald Trump gloves for Donald Trump turned to governor Rick Scott and said hey\nKnow I think you use that for the other message is not that we want to do about this tragedy and and seeing what he did\nBut the other not ethical probably\nMy my only point would be the media doesn't see doing some my only point would be the media doesn't seem to want to talk much about the recovery in the panhandle so he should go out and pushed them to cover it\nYou know what they're about they're about a ... it's almost like a a a show of big brother or a survivor or any other of\nThese uh shows where the media just want the next noticed that they should all topic yeah not something that matters to you and me\nRight right there is certainly a lot of that and in fact for the call bill I appreciate it I've just I've been disturbed on a number of levels I've been very critical\nNot of the local media and I'll say this again the local media whether it's TV even the Tampa Bay times I mean they've all done a great job covering the situation up there in the panhandle\nUh so the local media has done fantastic unusually uh the local media is much better overall than the national media\nBut again you know I came on the air the day after the storm and told you the amount of time the Fox news and MSNBC put into storm coverage\nOf hurricane Michael and and on Fox News it was seven minutes over the course of three hours in prime time on MSNBC I think it was closer to twenty minutes over three hours CNN was the only one to the wall to wall with hurricane coverage so that was the night this storm after the storm it\nAnd and look\nYou see the images out of Mexico beach in Panama City it's ... it's complete destruction don't tell me there aren't a stories that will grab your attention from people who lost everything\nIn that region I'm sure there's some fascinating stories\nBut talking about poor rural\nTowns not heavily populated mix the story less sexy to the national media I mean the end of the day for being honest this is what it is and it's unfortunate and that's why for me I I'd like\nFor the president to keep the focus on it a bit because he's got that bully he can drive that conversation\nEight hundred Ninety nine Ninety three fifty two of them are going to shell in Tampa or Michael in Tampa on line for Michael how are you\nGood evening I'm great uh I got to be redundant but what you were saying about the national media personal Trump do we respond to what's going on in the media and the problem of the Washington Post New York times native David whatever there is no coverage of them are\nWell not not as there there is there is some I mean the New York times really that that house on Mexico beach withstood the storm that that whole phenomenon about that house and I'm sure you've seen the stories by now that started with the New York times\nSeventy two pages there's two paragraphs even the Tampa Bay Hi what was it in there today I didn't\nI recall is about how are they going to handle the voting\nAnd so the other things are taking up the medium that what I think ... I agree probably should say something like hey you know donate or whatever don't forget but looking back on it it's not uncommon for something like this to happen or this kind of coverage to drop what it is a rural area\nYeah with Stanley heavily populated areas or even ... which was more popular in the new Law Order and exactly but I don't I don't blame the credit\nFor that no not blaming the president for and I and my my my criticism of the president was and I was very clear about this and I'll say that again over the course of the past twenty four hours he's put out some forty tweets now and\nAnd a lot of them have been I mean look at if you think the horse race between is important okay I think it's nonsense um but but not one of them has been about Florida\nAnd and that's after he surveyed the damage and saw the situation these people are in ... you would think you would see that\nAnd say my God I got to make sure that everybody knows how bad it is down there and keep this fresh in everybody's mind or so they can get as much help as possible and I haven't seen that that's been my criticism\nAnd I think it's fair criticism I\nThink we might have lost Michael there Michael thank you for the call I appreciate it eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty to the phone lines are packed will go back to them in a moment here on PM Tampa about\nCalm sixteen day from am to hear your next chance to win a thousand bucks hunting up at six pass the top of the hour a nine Seventy WFL a\n[noise] formation and discussion for Tampa Bay nine Seventy ... went belly is live in ... now more with Brian Gorman Sunday um Tampa Bay\nWe're talking about how the president has handled the aftermath of hurricane Michael specifically missed the last twenty four hours where he put out over forty sweets about ... different things none of which has to do with the situation the Florida Panhandle that he saw firsthand the devastation\nThe other day eight hundred Ninety nine Ninety three fifty two is the number let me go to\nA lion in Brandon on line for distorting here Ryan how are you\nA few bad yourself good thanks for the call\nSo I just wanted to call and I agree with you one hundred percent politicians do we do all the way more than they are drawing attention and this has been a couple of weeks out of it is true with an answer to rescue team and you know I was going to go home at the end of it it's still\nHard just to look at to live and yeah and that's where these people are living through every single day and I don't think there was\nNo no just end when the news cycle out\nNo and that's why you want to stretch out to me that's why you want to stretch out that new cycle uh as long as possible now I I met a couple of I I've had a variety of different criticisms on the show over the past week one of the issues I've had with politicians is that look I I don't care if they go\nOn CNN like if Nelson goes on CNN or or or the scientists or or Governor Scott or anybody the problem I had with them going on CNN because I get it you want to you want the nation to pay attention I Want the nation to pay attention to the problem I had\nWas that they wouldn't come on local radio to talk directly to the people affected who don't have CNN or Fox News or MSNBC or any TB because they don't have power number one and because they're TV's aren't good TVs are destroyed number two so that was a separate frustration of mine\nYeah makes you wonder if they even realize that it's not even goes through their minds these people don't have our\nThey don't have TV Now you can reach out to your people if they don't ... I mean yesterday is on the\nYeah yesterday was the look we're the only game in town I can assure you of that and just like during Hurricane Irma we're the only live and local game in town is that storm hit the Tampa Bay area and it took senator Nelson like a week\nTo come on and talk to their constituents I'm like what is it that you're ... you're not even like Governor Scott at least and thanks for the call Ryan I appreciate it Governor Scott at least is running the state operation the response so I give him that even mayor Gillum is dealing with the city response in Tallahassee\nFor senator Nelson like your whole job should be just to raise awareness on every possible outlet but you can including local radio so you could speak directly to the constituents\nWho are listening and I've still got people today who are calling me non stop in Panama City in the surrounding areas were still all they have\nThey have no other way to get the information aside from what's coming through on the radio you got to keep in mind the location that this took place in these are poor rural areas\nAnd in a lot of cases that battery powered radio is all they got right now and so for it to be like pulling teeth to get Nelson bondi ... their own damn congressman Neil done took a week to get them on\nOr please help them out because it's going to be a long road to recovery uh up there in in Panama City Mexico beach by George that that entire uh area eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two let me get a gym in Washington on line three Jim how are you\nAll have Ryan how are you good for the call\nHey I Want her to a comment on this thing that's going on inside of your abs yup\nI feel it's an outrage and I have to wonder what Mr Trump standards for you know what are you can butcher won a hundred or a million Americans as long as she got enough money\nAnd uh I've ... I don't like our military protecting that king gun as very repressive and um I feel that a hundred and ten ... billion dollar deal should be a castle\nYeah they they wouldn't be empowered to wage that our military\nWhy I feel about it well very few day begging for the call Jim I appreciate that I you know we haven't really gotten into the uh to show your story I Do want to touch on that this hour I'll give you a a quick run down here and then I Want to talk about\nGovernor Scott ... when it comes to the situation and Saudi Arabia yeah we didn't brought them up somebody else would would move in the problem is the likely are people who would move in to take over that that king them or would be even worse for us if you can believe it\nUm [noise] I think this is an important moment for our country and for this president it's it's kinda\nLike a a a tipping point here we're either going to continue to stand for certain values and principles\nOr we're really going to move all in on the fact that everything is\nTransactional so this is kind of that red line moments either America stands for something significant\nLike freedom of the press free speech things like that things we hold very dear or we're willing to say you know what\nWhatever you do on your own time overseas doesn't really matter last as long as the money keeps flown this way\nI think that approach that more transactional approach would be problematic I think it would open up a Pandora's box I think you would have a situation where\nAre you allowed that behavior to become okay and it continues to escalate I think the proof of that\nA good example is in our trade system you know you'll hear the president some people talk about how Canada and Mexico and all these countries the Europeans are allies are are ripping us off on trade I I don't see it that way I think certainly there are there areas for us to improve\nTrade deals and I've been in favor of that's\nWhy I thought TPP was actually a good idea a lot of what was in the BP\nHas been implemented in this uh tweaked version of NAFTA NAFTA trade deal is so bad we would have read the whole thing up and started from scratch we didn't do that we just made some tweets do it important tweaks but they were two weeks\nThe big issue we have on trade with China and there's a reason that we have a bigger issue with them than we do with our allies\nBecause they don't hold the same values they don't play by the same rules\nAs us and like minded thinking countries and\nIf you allow a country like Saudi Arabia to act like it appears they've acted in this instance with ... and to me there's really no question in my mind or they did what's being allege it's not surprising it shouldn't surprise anybody this is how they operate\nIf you allow that and say it's okay as long as you've got some good deal with us as long as there is some benefit to us whether it's a hundred billion dollar arms deal or whatever else\nThen you're going to see countries potentially\nShift more of that way ultimate power corrupts that's why it's a problem and you don't want the Russia China Saudi Arabia\nModel to start to spread and become the norm across the globe the Venezuela model I Would argue in a lot of instances this kind of\nCrazy but turkey is in in the middle of this because they've gone\nA this way as well uh but but that's not\nWhat we want to see spread our values are what we want to see and what we should be promoting because our values are what will keep everybody peaceful and prosperous in the long run so that that's kind of I\nI Want to get a little bit more in depth on the show the story coming up in a bit but that's kind of a general over view and and keep in mind I Will say this you know there are some issues where I can go on and on for like an hour or this is one where I had to observe a little bit from afar I'm not\nAs in depth on this or I have had as much time to to think about this and to lay certain things out as I normally wouldn't because I'm doing so much coverage for our affiliates in the panhandle and my focus has really been on hurricane Michael um but but from what I've seen and I've tried to keep up with it as best I can and I do have some new information for you tonight on that's my general view\nA eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two let me go to a Carlin river view on line one Carl how are you\nI'm doing fine thanks for all you're doing about the hurricane situation listen I just have two quick points to make yup uh the first is about Trump now I just got out of the dialysis chair so I didn't get to hear everything that you talked about but in the ... in in regards to Trump in his tweets and whatnot\nThe guy is a master manipulator I mean I followed them for years\nBack when he was doing his TV show and all that stuff and he was very very good at manipulating people and to say things or talking about things oh yeah I wanted to them to talk about that he he wasn't being spoken up so he would post\nControversial subjects so that people will come back and try and prove it wrong and in effect proven correct so he's really good\nAt that he's ... he's a gene or when it comes to the branding and and along the lines of what you're talking about\nAnd then the other thing I Want to say if you make your free speech and I know that free speech is it American value that we all of the year but I think\nOver the past a little while we have seen in the United states much to my dismay\nIf you're going to open up the governor's mansion to state troopers as a kind gesture to them they're working so hard\nTo come take a break at the governor's mansion the people's house come here relax it's all yours if you're going to do that which I think is a very appropriate and proper gesture you don't then turn around and you use it in a campaign ad\nI mean come on\nHello is that it just makes me want to take a shower it's gross\nYou offer up the mansion for state troopers\nAnd now it looks like you did that just to get the footage to use in a campaign ad maybe that\nWasn't his intention when he opened up the mansion to them but it sure looks that way now he shouldn't be using them for political props like that and I think anything look again\nKeep in mind at the beginning of the segment I said I think given the Scots done a good job in handling a hurricane Michael before during and after\nThe put out an ad like this so quick I mean people still still haven't been rescued you got you got you don't even know what the the official body count as yet\nUp there and you're putting out a campaign ad promoting the work that you've done a lot of\nCampaign ads which got put out I don't care if he puts that one about the working during Hurricane Irma\nBut this feels a little soon\nMaybe I'm wrong eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two we'll take your calls on on the new Rick Scott\nAt and whether or not it's too soon for him to be using the work he's done during hurricane Michael for political purposes eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two again eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two back with

the M example bay on your host Ryan Norman with me my producer James for land there on the phone number is eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two we're talking about governor Scott's\nWho waltzing he's taking a break from campaigning focus on the hurricane Michael recovery are released a new Senate and\nThat's really highlights whose work during hurricane Michael the ad is called leading and I'll\nPlay you a clip one more time for those of you who missed it a few minutes ago here it is\nWith the campaign merely over let's take a behind the scenes peek both first Governor Scott he's leading hurricane recovery direct and relief efforts and even housing state troopers his own home\nAnd senator Nelson running falls the tickets mocking Governor Scott service [noise] forty six years in politics and a new low for Nelson mocking governors military [noise] senator Nelson playing dirty policy where Governor Scott is leading I'm Rick Scott and I approve this message\nSo the question is is it too soon to feature a campaign ad highlighting the work that you're doing during a hurricane as you're still technically doing that work in and saying you're suspending your campaign because of it also really ... the one of the big problems I have with the ad is that if you're going to open up the governor's mansion to house state troopers\nThen just do it as a kind gesture highlighting it like that makes it seem very\nPolitical like the whole\nThing was planned to use in an ad\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two let me go to Barbara in seminal on line one Barbara how are you\nIn a good thanks for the call yeah\nI'm I Am not a big fan of this negative I Want to know the positive about any candidate\nAnd I I guess I'm kinda puts a\nBlack a check mark in a that's not cool column for me yeah it's a bad taste in your mouth\nYeah it is yeah we need to focus more on the positive everything is so negative lately [noise]\nThe problem Barbara and I'll be completely honest with you is that consultant after consultant after consultant will tell you that the negative ads work\nWell I happen to be I don't know the one percent [laughter]\nGood\nFor me now they don't work for me when I get all the negative stuff I'm like you know what why you might swinging yeah let's talk about the good stuff let's think about this stuff we're going to do and and move forward well\nI certainly wish there were ... and that's just that's my personal opinion I I Wish there were more voters or like you Barbara I appreciate the call thanks so much thank you Ryan\nHundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two I sit on the show yesterday because again\n\nThe amount of a hat so we're seeing ... we're we're in the you know one of the biggest swing markets in the state so we're getting bombarded here more than some other areas across Florida\nBut but the amount of as we're seeing is just insane and and I'm watching these ads and I said it yesterday if you're making up your mind about who to vote for\n... based on these ads you're an idiot because nine times out of ten most of the stuff they're saying these ads\nIs misleading at best gay then they're not\nAll that honest so a lot of spin so don't take these ads at face value maybe do a little bit of digging and and that that's good for both parties not talking about one party in particular one candidate in particular that's just how this works unfortunately been negative ads\nHave a big impact on voters and that's why you see more of them then you do the positive one\nEight hundred nine
