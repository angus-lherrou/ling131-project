can get confusing for ...\nOr a dozen people didn't address like Donald Trump or at the rally maybe ...\nA lot of asks yeah\nSo\nI think if if you're going to a rally on October thirty first you have to welcome the costumes although that's gonna be you're you're you're right that's gonna be a nightmare for Seattle service and then the other rally is going to be in Pensacola\nOn Saturday So two big rallies and and they're very strategically placed Fort Myers to Trump barrier Pensacola a Trump area he's not going to go\nTo some of the suburbs where you've got moderate congressional candidates for reelection or battling\nPresident Obama is coming as well\nHe's going to be a in Miami on friday\nSenator Nelson and Andrew Gillum are going to join him there\n\nIt'll be interesting to see if Iraq Obama can move the meter in these midterm races because when he was president he couldn't\n\nAh Kamala Harris and Eric Holder they were with Gillum or\n\nWere they were doing today or is that next Monday I'm not sure but but bottom line Kamala Harris and Eric Holder going to be campaigning or with Andrew Gillum\n\nSo you've got some big names coming into the state that just shows how big of a deal or state elections are here in the state of Florida all lives are gonna be on us\nNext Tuesday especially that given the Tories\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two let me go to ah Jay in New Jersey on line to Jay how are you\nI'm good how are you good for the call I I I just\nThink that the social media site that you're talking about that should be horrible and everything and I agree and I happened to be a Jewish also but I think that the good part of keeping it around or the good part about it being up at all or was\nThat it um yeah Cape ... to one base which makes it easier to\nIn the future avoid these things because you know where to look for the government I mean\nWell I you know I don't know how much the government's gonna go monitoring a these sites I mean a lot of what you're seeing with Twitter and Facebook is them monitoring themselves in terms of this website than we are talking about this other social media site\n... they're not monitoring anything uh they're they're just letting everything fly that I I think I think the problem here and this goes back to my opening on the show today\nIs that when you have these kinds of forms that just foment hate\nLike this and that that's what this social media platform is there to do it's to foment eight\nWhen you have that then again in a country where we have a mental health crisis year you're asking\nFor a tragedy to happen I mean you're going to have somebody who's deranged like the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter go on these sites and determine it's\nTime to take things into my own hands\nWhen I get that at all but I mean you you have power cry when he said the thing off social media yeah the voice too so yeah it's got to be out there\nNo I agree that don't look the left and then for the call Jay I appreciated the left has done\nSuch a poor job of pushing back on the anti Semitism on their side because there is anti Semitism on both sides you got the white supremacists and neo Nazis\nOn the right and then on the left you've got the ... of the world and there were there was an awful lot of anti Semitism going around after the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting from the left\nSo look anti Semitism doesn't live on one end of the political spectrum it's on both\nFor what these people did is wrong\nI don't think I I agree\nWith you I don't think you blame them I don't think they're directly responsible but I Do think in a country where we do have a mental health crisis\nA in a country where we are divided where the the tensions are high I Do think are these people have a responsibility to watch what they say and to choose the words they use carefully\nOr because you never know how it's going to be taken it doesn't mean you don't say what you think that it means you make sure that you say it in a less inflammatory way of possible\nShould the president ease up at all with his rhetoric\nNo I don't think so I mean for for you know it's interesting today a and I I'm posting shortly at the American spectator on this I went back and ah somebody sent me a short video of the president's first state of the union\nAddress which was received marvelously as a media amazingly loved it and the American people love it like eighty percent in the polls and all this sort of thing and yet Terry was being attacked\nFor being a divider and all he was doing was unifying the country in the country itself saw it that way my point is is it\nThe way who was it I thought you just send the media received a well who was attacking there's been an immediate\nReceived it I mean see it even CNN and all of that sort of thing but the Democrats on the floor we're not\nSure I mean our active that's how it always works though I mean there are a lot of what I'm suggesting\nTo you is is that when even when he is quote unquote unifying I mean what does that mean when he actually does something that\nThe American people think it's totally unifying he gets attacked for doing it um which is why I say you know that some of this is just cynical\nBut every president gets attacked by the other side even unnecessarily an unfairly sometimes that that comes with the job I you know we're divided country we always have been\nNews who experienced relief or muscle cramps and your legs and feed used their

this Thursday October twenty fifth on your host Ryan Gorman and joining me on the hotline right now we have senior writer at political magazine Michael Grunwald you can follow him on Twitter at Mike Grunwald he wrote a fantastic piece recently\nCalled how to win in Florida Michael how are you\nHey how you doing Ryan\nThank you so much for joining us ill so correct me if I'm wrong but\nThe basic summary of your piece seem to be that there really isn't one specific thing that you can do to win a statewide race in Florida there are many things that you have to do if you want to win\nI think that's a great summary because that's really the uh you know the two of them don't\nRead summary is that it's\nIt's really close it's all Israeli close there it's the last seven presidential election then that the votes cast and twenty thousand votes\nSeparate the two parties I'm Talking about it and put them all\nYou know percentage of a percentage though so really when you hear people say with all this confidence that oh Florida's a place where you really need to turn out that they are what are you really need to get independence or where you have to make sure you're bringing you know what it\nComes down to the ice for a court order to come down to the Hispanic vote and the you know the response to all that is yes [laughter]\nYeah yes all of the things\nThat they do it all of that there's something\nYou don't do you know if you're a Democrat and you've got to bring out your people in South Florida and you've got to manage your margins in North Florida and if you're a Republican or the opposite\nYou know for somebody like me who is an independent in Tampa Bay area right here in the army for court or I feel like my vote is ... is the most important vote of them all but but what you really lay out again especially\nWhen you were talking about the races that are now governor Rick Scott has run in the past ... they were very specific intricacies that really kind of shifted and affected the race and\nIn those instances it didn't have a lot to do with with what we think here especially living here in the Tampa Bay area is the swing is part of the swing state it was actually situations that took place in other areas of the state\nWill riot gear a terrific guy you're very knowledgeable\nWe appreciate your vote but you only got one [laughter] everybody else\nAnd that's really a way it's just a truism you always hear people say like this election is going to come out to come down to turn out and of course that should come down to turned out you have to bring out more of your guys and the other guy um\nBut it's really is a place where there you know sort of every action kind of has a reaction to the example you mentioned is that in a in\nTwenty tend 'em you just saw Alex Sink to really focus on north Florida and trying to reduce Republican margin there and she did an excellent job and she lost by one percent\nAnd then a twenty fourteen Charlie Crist or did he had a much more South Florida focused rate\nUm and he actually improved on Alex thanks margin in South Florida by a hundred thousand votes\nBut it isn't a hundred thousand worse in North Florida um perhaps because you're focused at one place you don't do as well on the other so it really is a tricky situation and you're seeing in in this race\nYou know people when Grapel would have had a different approach to this raised an answer to that\nAnd I don't know what is that a different approach that Rob a bank but it's not say that one approaches right\nWe're talking to a senior writer at political magazine Michael Grunwald who wrote a fantastic piece called how to win in Florida\nI I Want to read part of your piece real quick and get your reaction to it in a little bit more

Peter how are you\nI'm good I'm going to promise now to keep the Halloween references to amend them\n[laughter] so we got a Halloween a tomorrow and then one week from today the big day which you're going to be a part of Peters going to be joining me for our special state wide election night coverage which you can hear on nine Seventy WFL a starting at six PM or election night\nPeter let's start with where the campaigns for governor have gone to focus is basically on race and corruption\nAt this point Gillum throwing some pretty heavy racial accusations at the sand is the president accusing Gillum of being a thief and dissent this hammering Gillum with his a shady dealings with undercover FBI agents what are your thoughts on all of it\nAnd we ... after the debate or I mean it's an ... game on that and it was clear then and it's clear or even more so today these two people don't like each other neither do either of their surrogate or their side\nUm you know in ... and the president in the way that only to do as somehow\nPut rocket fuel on top of the furniture that was already burning by reading you know I I I Know we keep saying this about the president but I Can't remember when\nA um a president of the United states tweeted so harshly about um a a an opponent I'm running down ballot office like it it just it doesn't it doesn't rise to that occasion and\nSo you know he has called he called a Andrew Gillum a cease\nWith no evidence by the way I Do know evidence\nYeah I mean you can you can say you can say a lot of things about Andrew Gillum be very critical about his record about his rise to power about\nSome of as I said it is um is transient a relationship with the ethics that government elected office um but there is zero evidence\nThat he's enriched himself here in fact at least it would probably be a three or four hundred thousand dollar a year a private sector lobbyists or lawyers at this point had not gone into elected office so um it just it it's ridiculous I gotta give 'em Gillum credit she properly punches back\nAgainst Donald Trump as well as anybody that I've seen um he really doesn't have anything to lose he's not in the Senate us and needs to work with them or or is not um\nUh you know looking for an appointment um but the punches back as well as anybody does and it will be very interesting if he is elected next Tuesday to see him and Trump or collide in Florida going into the presidential elections\nHow much do you think you're talking about the big issues are that are making national\nNews how much do you think the package bombers Pittsburgh synagogue shooting the caravan now the issue involving birthright citizenship how are they affecting the Florida races\nThey are all ... you mean ah the rights are and they are agitating left um but again I don't think that that is the margin right now that these these these guys are fighting over in the last week I think they're both at forty five\nForty six percent and they are fighting over that last seven or eight percent of people and I think you know you can drill down even further it is probably a a white woman somewhere around fifty five years old that lives in a suburb outside of Tampa Bay or Orlando West Palm beach\nOr maybe St Augustine that is the target audience right now and it is a question of\nAre they afraid of Gillum because of his the FBI investigation and ends up corruption or are they over the Trump style politics that they see fully in body fight to Santa's I think right now the argument of leaning towards um\n[noise] we're getting you ready for lighting hockey with lightning power play live on lightning power play and ... he tells us valet short [noise]\n\nBuy from family arena here's Lynn alley by the lending and devils are playing\nTheir first of three meetings this season and the first of two at Emily arena tonight's matchup as a rematch of course of last year the eastern conference first round playoff series between the two teams Tampa Bay prevailing in five games Tampa Bay is one for the last five and six of the last eight at home\nOver a New Jersey I'm Greg when I like it is lightning power play live here on nine Seventy WFL a enlightening powerfully or getting except for the game tonight demanded to be calling that game along with Phyllis ... are good friend\nDave Michigan joins us here coming up in segment to Chris Ryan from n J advanced media we're getting a little bit of a scathing report on the devils but a day first off great to be with you welcome back it's good to be back those road trips are are long and growling and I know you did your\nYour right up for lightning dot com and you put it in perspective the different time zones\nFive games in eight days two\nSets of back to back yeah reading it was rolling yeah broadcast I Hope that was the only thing I'm Glad you did well out of ... and that's my point the fat you got seven of ten points was impressive it's a shame that I think\nThey had to deal with that last at the end it kinda damp and a little bit of what they accomplish and you could kinda tell listen to the doctor was like well that was a bad when we we admit it but we did some really good things and we all agree that they did\nWell you'd rather lose one's seven one in three times to one right yeah I mean if you're going to lose\nYou might as well get the doors blown off and I think that it's it's bad that it's at the end of the trip to him you don't want to start a trend now with a game like that now they started the trip with a little bit of a gut punch there in Minnesota and the fact that they were able to rebound and when the next night I think set them on their way and they played a lot of\nGood hockey and they played a lot of hard hockey on that trip and I think when all is said and done at the end of the year we're going to look back and we're going to look in Minnesota yeah as a playoff team I mean I'm not going out on a limb here they've done it regularly right\nThey have I Believe the best home record in the league at this point we're going to look back and look at Colorado season I think Colorado is you think I don't want them while they were last year I don't want to use the word sleeper\nTeam and who knows what's going to have the kind of injuries but that top line really as good as any line in the NHL and if you have the Bruins showed it last year with good players and they have one line doing a lot of the heavy lifting you can go a long way yeah I think there are really good team\nVegas and we talked about this is better than its record to this ...\nAnd I think Arizona is greatly improved so you know the one other team and there was Chicago in Chicago is gone off to a pretty good this year I I think that\nI don't want to say the jury's still out on Chicago but there'll be another ex they've had some they probably played a little worse than their record right like they've they've had some issues in some games they've been able to when they made a lot of games go to overtime and points or points are not going to turn your knows about it and since that ...\nAgainst the lighting they'd won a couple of ... and really took her to Chicago I mean that gay but my point is that the quality of the opposition\nWhich you don't really know in October necessarily I think the quality of the opposition\nWas really really high on this trip so good for the lightning to get seven out of ten\nWhen pressed the the most during this road trip when you talked about lightning over all the way they played\nSo let's look back at the home stamp okay\nI Know they lost the game to Vancouver but the way they came out on that first period against Vancouver you're kinda like okay they're still I mean yeah I Know [laughter] like they look like the late ... when the lightning are rolling and we saw that at different points in the home stand I think that the third period against Detroit kind of\nJumped out at me because they absolutely suffocated the red wings and that was a close game it was you know to want to go after the third but the lightning completely dominated the third period so there were stretches in homes than where they did really good things but I think it was even more pronounced on the road trip\nWhen they were rolling they were really rolling and\nIt happened other than the Arizona game and I looted to this in the column in the four other games bad segments where the opposition just said no answer for him at all and to see them play at that\nI Level I think was really impressive no they weren't able to sustain it and\nYou and I talk about this all the time it's hard to just keep your pedal to the metal ... minutes but it's just unrealistic\nOr they came close in the Chicago game I think Chicago had the right to play in the second half of that first period and then they were extremely dangerous\nAt that time that was one demeaning based like fourteen shots and a half minutes in was fantastic me that's even team had stacked same but I think if you were to ask me the two things that were most impressive when the lady got rolling they looked unstoppable\nAnd when the other team got rolling the lightning for the most part hung in there which I think is really important whether it was goal tending\nWhether it was shot blocking whether it was the the use of the ... line and gets McKinnon line which was a key part\nIn that went against Colorado I think all of those things kind of you throw in a bag and you just said yeah defense because that's what it is it's a team effort but I think that that was a really impressive part of the road trip to particularly given the quality of the opposition like we just talk\nNo doubt about that day Michigan joined us here on lightning power play live and nine Seventy WFL lay\nHad been plot out for the foreseeable future we know what type of players are it was interesting though I thought when I get your thoughts on this\nWith John Cooper said yesterday when he was talking about Viktor hadn't been being out and and the question was you know how do you pick up the slack I think defensively and and what does he mean your team and it's an obvious he's he's an elite player\nBut it sounded like he was more interested to see how his team was going to respond ostensibly with him being out than defensively do you do you feel the same way do you feel like\nThere's a bigger gap\nWith what had been brings the table ostensibly than there is defensively and with him being out that maybe there'll be a bigger drop off than we think sensibly\nWell the obvious places the power yeah 'cause he was the one defense been on that first power play unit and they have ... done it and they've spotted them in basically ... job is right up\nTo the unit would stamp goes from ... dread McDonnell who started the season on the other powerful unit is back with that unit that was what I took the most out of it and apparently has done pretty well yeah your I mean power play converted for a goal in all five games on the trip including the Arizona game\nSo it's not like the power plays been struggling like in the first couple of games a year where it was a little bit of a sore spot right and they they turn that around\nHadn't been you know jumps into the play though I mean you know we saw um score a goal against Columbus year where he was walked right down Broadway I'm not sure a lot of the other lightning advancement typically do that Gerard he comes to mind dives will drift in like ... marks in um\nHis runoff including it overtime hospitalized during the playoffs so you know maybe it's just that the lightning or for the most part defending pretty well as far as the defense men\nBut they don't have as many guys who can do what had been can do in terms of being creative and unpredictable and the ... but I took it primarily\nAs far as how they're going to work the power play\nYeah well that's a good point the foreign ... tip base able to throw out there and I think we were impressed I think the game you does Brian he talked about the fourth line in Colorado and yeah\n... you know it looks a little later this year he's playing with a little more jammed maybe the his game Kelly and we know what he's doing and Miller and we don't know if he's going to be on the fourth line it looks like he's been practicing on on the first time but they it is a little different this year than last year wasn't that fourth one\nWell they had a great game against Colorado and so you're going into that game you're thinking like who's going to play against McCain ... right and if you could even get that match up because you're the routine so all top lines the top top science in the league they're not all created equal you know I think\nThis Jersey top line which has had a great start to the year like that's the whole ... why ... why we saw in the playoffs last year breed and point with Johnson and plot had that assignment\nThe jurors are on march ... probably not quite as fast but really craft yeah you know like an tenacious certainly right um [noise]\nPassing plays a\nFind little scenes you know the point\nWhy have them and you get to the eastern conference vital [noise] the Ovechkin wind is like they're gonna hit you over the head with a hammer where you know it's what they did find that 'cause that was on that line but I mean that was a heavy line it's a heavy team and the line that of the most success\nAgainst that unit in that playoff series was paquette Coontz and how they are a meat and potatoes type of wine so what makes the kittens wind so challenging is like they're heavy but they are super right to you know and crafty\nAnd they go to the net and all the guys like to shoot and they weren't all and they score now all of this was spelled out Russ before the game both coaches talked about it so like are you going to put coins fine against you know there\nAre you going to put more of a physical white against them and try and slow them down with physical flag so ultimately I think it was in the first period that it was just by happenstance hot headlined\nIt a go down a lot during the second I've ... I think twelve goals in the first ten or Fifteen gate out whatever it was but\nA second half the year he kind of slow down for his part but out of the game this year ... been great he talked about how he really had a first\nFor summer for the first time in a while not having a kid not having to deal with cancer which you didn't know we had like you're not having a deep well run we're going into the beginning of June and I think that really kind of re energized the mid ... a pretty effective and then you find a little bit of what we now know there's\nBeen a sentimental I got like but I think that's a kind of helping him kinda managed by it and bring a little more energy when he's got versatility that\nWhat he can do we also we could play on the back and every once in a while in a pinch how is that you know they show up next the scoring I think a lot of people want to know is there back at better is the playoffs all of\nI think it's a little bit better that they didn't ask anybody other than drive who signed as a kind of a seven CIA agent uh but I I think they're just relying on guys younger guys they're kind of developing the better Dempsey resented he's only twenty fours going for about four or five years now but\nHe's starting to find more much more well rounded game after only being really often a will butcher I find that it's actually show you're getting a little more responsibility and Mark I'm your it's a big role in that top during which\nA Guided them wind up every night last year and who's done a good job of showing that Boyd and giving him a bottom a top parents can match up with a lot of good\nYeah and you know gotten\nHealth wise they want to make sure he's okay and what your TV Guide lash are basically and I'm sure they want him to round out to be a little bit more of a a complete departure\nOf course are you still find in the third varying but I I think they're not hesitant to throw him out at five five and they're not going to let\nYou go expectations on the seventh game road trip as you said first some of the room\nAnd it's a diabetic quicker as Taylor halted a field trip to Philly for one um but other than that I'll do that and that and their Europe trip or they've been at home for on October so they didn't really want to see him road trip last year which ended a\nDocument to her they went to one of my yeah uh so I say I don't think you'll have that much\nExcept that I think they can if they can come out of this with maybe four wins I think you're more than happy to take your job\nOr if I actually didn't go you ain't got no I did not come on [laughter] you know I Know I got a little ten Britain tend to get home we'll thank God it right but I'll take it up for the entire arguments if you'll like\nHe'll take that for sure well he's Chris Ryan from Jay mass media doesn't up any job covering the devils mature you give them a follow on Twitter what your children it must be our first run number ... hard as you want the other side the nights I make sure you check that out Crist is always great to be with you will do to get to what was I I had a script right joining\nUs here on lightning power play live and not that many WFL they still got a couple of minutes here before we wrap things up and\nI Want to let you know to to night a vessel up you'll be in that king cable beef or the devils be good match up uh in that for both teams by philosophy of course we know has been playing a\nVery well and that really the last couple of years can Cade getting an opportunity to start a this year and has done very well one of the reasons maybe the main reason why New Jersey is off the dark or they're off to and uh that's good to see from their standpoint also too we talked about with Victor had been Roger plot being out tonight\nHow will they be able to adjust meaning of a lightning\nIt seemed like the the devils you've got to figure early on especially the first game of seven get road trip they are gonna want to come out and establish a rapport check and play maybe the best game of this Russia because let's face it we just got done like a a five game road trip that was pretty grilling by the end of that road trip you're done you're exhausted\nWant to get off to start the way you do that is that first game can they take advantage of had been a lot being out look for on Donna to pick up some more\nMinutes with had been being out he's done very well so far to start the season I don't think a lot of people were surprised by that based off of\nThe fact that he's healthy and now he has a full year in Tampa Bay system so I think that it's encouraging but something to keep an eye on tonight for sure with both these teams and how they attack one another also to how Tampa Bay you heard a Christ talking about the first line for New Jersey they're very\nDynamic they've got a lot of speed how will Tampa Bay slow them down if they slow them down or the chances of winning the game I'm greatly increased tonight I think most people would say yes but you have to contain them and we'll see how that plays out\nTonight I that's going to wrap it up here on the show Jason ... thank you back at our nine

could say fifty percent or more car insurance\nWas rich rather than being out tonight on Thursday for sure other defense are gonna have to pick up there playing his absence one of those but that's what we'll be damned you're already a standing by with our day Michigan I'm lightning radio\nThen it's one of those old hockey outages the first home game back after a long road trip can be tricky do you believe that has that been your experience in your time in the NHL and how to combat it\nAh so it doesn't become a factor in a you know sometimes you know on the road different some different time zone junior body goes a little different coming back but um you know we had a you know\nA little bit in limbo five o'clock on Sunday and you'll have a good practice yesterday so I think we should uh and then you know a good day at home and then I noticed you know what you've just come\nTo you guys are pretty familiar with this devils team having seen them in the playoffs last year that top line is right up there with some of the other top lines and the league and you just saw a really good one in Colorado I generally speaking what do you need to do that to limit a really dangerous lines affecting this as you did to the McCain in line in Colorado\nUm I think if we give a lines like that time and space are going to make some good players they have to you\nGuys you choose to park on that line and I think uh\nKnowing who's on the ice with you um you know we had the puck me with a chance to make a play and it's not a hundred percent you know maybe just get a deep and make them come to hundred feet they're all five guys and uh you know make this far plays out there\nI Know the road trip and did not the way you guys would have wanted but it was a good road trip three one on one what are you like about how the guys played in competed\nOn you know ah I think for the most part it will go go go six you mean the game's good effort you know ... or where ever again but we found ways to when I'm obviously last game and we want it to the way we want to do but like I said seven seven out of ten 'em long long time they wrote you can't complain about that and thanks good luck that you're\nRight that was the Michigan with ... earlier today joining us right\nNow are a good friend from lightning insider dot com also lightning\nLunch which you can or weekday from one to a lightning power play\nI recommend you listen to that show the how are you buddy I'm good especially tomorrow because I have a very special to his name was Greg when all\nMan I'm definitely gonna have to have that you're ... you're breaking it down but\nThey also have Nigel car when by the way it will be good that'd be good at that and yeah I'm not sure\nYou've covered this team a long\nLong time when you go on those long road trips that first gave back [noise]\nAlways always difficult right it early on [noise]\nYeah it it's a weird adage you know it's a last game of the road trip and the first game back there after the roads at all just seem to be difficult and I don't know if that's a jet lag\nYou know whatever especially for a a Tampa Bay team that\nYou know they they log a lot of mild not as much as the Vancouver\nOr Denver you know the avalanche do but you know they want a lot of miles to the maximum\nPacific time zone\nAs they did come in late Sunday afternoon after the fact it it can be a grind but I'll tell you what I don't know the numbers but I I just know just kind of off the top of my head\nIn the last few years they've been really good [noise] sort of breaking that habit now in in terms of that first be coming back uh so I expect that you know that tonight they're going to be they're gonna be okay they're going to get the right\nKind of effort I just I just had that sense with this team and you know Steven closest wing guaranteed that they come out with a better effort certainly didn't they didn't know\nFound it doesn't hurt that you're going against the devil for the team that you're familiar with last year put up a little bit of rivalry yeah you do that in the playoffs and [noise]\nWhat they are going on a seven game roaches starting ... if there's going to be a game or their crush on this road trip going to be first of all\nIt is and and then don't discount the chip on the shoulders\nFactor for the animals too because you know in a cause I spoke names right at the time this morning as well and I also sparked spoke to a man or talking\nThey both said that you know this is New Jersey team that hey you know we knock him out of the playoffs\nLast week went golfing because of odd jobs so they have a little something to prove that aspect they also want to food to people around the league that last year was not look\nFor New Jersey devils to make the playoffs because there are\nNorth to cater to say if there's one scene in the eastern conference is going to fall out of the playoffs this year it's the New Jersey devils so it got a lot of that you almost one they'd gotten off a really good start\nHaving started the season in Europe on top of that so uh this is a team that you know you you wouldn't you better make sure that you are up for them because they have more than just a hop want to do some other players that can burn your\nBigger locks wouldn't hadn't been being out defensively\nAre often it was interesting hearing Cooper talked about it they are as you said to her I got to that he was a little concern what is the what do you wonder starting that tradition game\nNot having it'd be part of that\nDoes that make you as a coach hesitant to see her little concern what your team to do with him out\nWhether the whole the whole dynamic of the changing because you take a guy out who plays for minutes nice everything that he can do from the way to Houston Carrie the puck up the ice the way that he can join the rush the way that he can lead to rush so certainly there are concerns\nOstensibly that you don't have that big horseback they're kind of lead the charge or be part of the charge will start to make that push a biased but defensively if you just watch the weight as some people looked at Munch is I mean he can cover so much around\nWith the way that he can stay in his yeah size six six [noise] you know he covers so much ice is such a short period of time and he has his players off guard on a fact checker with Shaq and whatever else happens to be coming out and he can just gobble up I still passes disruptive rush come and the other way\nThat to me that's my biggest concern how are they going to be able to combat that and do the things are Victor having to do defensively then maybe some of the other players on the back in ... the climate\nNo they start with that and it said oh you started this road trip is that no no no this is the start of the road or they minutes we all know this is the first gay dancers or the Panthers ...\n... which I don't understand that and let's go over there for one\nGame though that's to Finland is two games a jet and Panthers\nGuideline egg and bart uh [noise] you know they had finished guys I didn't understand the one game in Sweden necessarily look on his leading up to that at all talking about the data Oilers only played one game\nWhat a minute are just a day playing two games in fact about seeing gets a home I said okay that's what I was wondering if that makes sense to go over there right but you know ... what was your player I said wait a minute or two games\nFor what complicates things for the Panthers is like they had a light scheduled to start a year now going over there they're planning to gain some like eleven days yeah so they're going to get crushed yeah with a debt schedule I Try later it's kind of what I'm getting ready to\nAre they still doing that are\nSort of ... yeah and then there's that too [noise]\nAll the bad guy yeah I Know\nThey're getting socked as we get back in the day I\nKnow that just maybe we'll be playing in August for the lightning we I think all\nThe weeks are really close to each other and they kind of overlap all the all star break out or they kind of bought up to the all star\nBreak so I\nI mean it's worked in the ...\nSo yeah I Do it but the the price you pay then if you do is easy to get\nThe other way\nAnd you know\nPeople you've got to hear that folks get forty two home game you've got to give like about Seventy five already gates [noise]\nOkay at least that's the way it used to be and I'm sure it's the same way and then they picked that so you try to do it Early Show that\nOn those days that were free you can have a concert and do something with the building and that is a tough jumped to to do\nAs far as your New York when I was at the rangers Madison Square
