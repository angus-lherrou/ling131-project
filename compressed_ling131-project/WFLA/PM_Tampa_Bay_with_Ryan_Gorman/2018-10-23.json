thirty minutes away from your next news update on nine Seventy WFL a this is he in Tampa Bay and with Brian Gorman\nHopefully uh does pass through segments help some people\nYou know knowledge on this this transportation referendum that everybody in Hillsborough County is going to be\nVoting on in this mid term election [noise]\nIt's typical we dug ourselves such a hole\nIn this region that that you know getting out of it it's I think it's going to take a little bit of pain and that that pain or could potentially come in the form of a one percent sales tax increase uh I I think number one the situation as his is untenable especially if this community wants to keep growing\nAnd and bring in newer and better jobs you're not going to be able to continue to do that you're not going to attract the best and brightest and the biggest businesses with uh our transportation infrastructure as it is right now right they're not going to happen\nNow and he brought up a good point is ... ... forest people trying to commute to work and if they don't have a writer or they don't have your rival transportation like that's a huge thing for people try and just to earn a living wage and it limits\nTheir options now if there were any other way to do this without a sales tax increase I Would certainly be open to hearing those options\nAre based on the funds that we currently have now you're not going to a massively improve the transportation infrastructure here and you're not going to be able to start planning ahead for things like autonomous vehicles which are coming that I mean that's a big thing for me\nIt to me you know ran with this point isn't even the direction to look at ... unless you're talking about a high speed rail that connects Miami to Orlando to Tampa you know and and really connects the states\nWhen it comes to here in the Tampa Bay area the autonomous vehicle planning is probably the better way to go because that fits the region more\nRight maybe that's not such a good idea if you're in downtown Chicago or Manhattan where you have\nBuses and you have subways and things like that we don't have any of that here ah and we don't have a great bus system and and we don't have subways or rail so planning for autonomous vehicles that could be what separates us from everybody else leading the way in something like that or could potentially be very beneficial for Tampa Bay and part of that\nUh would I'm part part of the money going towards that kind of planning would be included in the forty five percent of the uh of the money going to public transit based on this referendum I still think you need\nLong term I don't think that they should possibly a band in some sort of rail system\nThroughout Hillsborough County because it's just sort of braille tracks or they're you know as a matter of figure out what system can work with them and if you put it in high speed rail there's the you know you have a tremendous point but in point\nYou know say it's downtown Tampa or wherever it is but then people have got to get to other locations and people are coming from Orlando bringing in tourism right they've got to get out you know say Pinellas are clear water or whatever the case may be and moving them across one\nYou know linear way yeah it needs to be kind of address as well and I also think people\nHave to keep in mind with the rise of rubber and lift and those kinds of services you have a lot of cars on the road now extra cars murder cars because people are driving around doing that and it's great I I like and it's great service to have in the area\nBut it also asked to congestion you know I so I I don't like the fact that the the education a referendum and the transportation referendum or both on the ballot the same time I think it I think it could potentially damage both of them are but when it comes to transportation were just so far behind in the city and in this\nArea where we got to make a decision and do something here coming up next the American spectator contributing editor Jeffrey Lord on PM Tampa\nMore news traffic and whether nags\nNews radio nine Seventy\nOctober twenty second what's new today on the ...

bipartisan fashion and do something\nThat the house vote was three hundred Ninety six to fourteen so at that with the Ninety eight to one in ... again it comes back to you why didn't the president

would ally himself with Joseph Stalin after all of the\n... you know unbelievably evil things I mean killing mass murder and millions of people in the Soviet Union and all is why he would ally himself with with Joseph Stalin in World War two and he said something to the effect that he would he would you know ally themselves with the devil if it meant defeating Adel Hitler\nWhat we've gone out here

the greater threat and the greater threat is a nuclear arise Iran\nRight that's a big deal but we\nDo we do have enough leverage to I mean we are the big dog on the block and we have enough yeah leverage to uh both you know keep Saudi Arabia in our corner when it comes to uh pushing back on Iran but also sending the message that this is unacceptable and you're not going to mean\nThere's some sort of message needs to be sent you there is no question about this none let me in the very fact that American presidents of both parties I mean let's just recalled criticism from Republicans\nHave blocked Obama was the deep bowed to the king of ...\nRight but in Saudi Arabia didn't like him because he was working with a run on the nuclear deal so there you go you know I mean\nThis is difficult

Peter how are you\nI'm great looking at two weeks so excited for the final uh fourteen Fifteen days of his amazing election\nThe stretch Renee's underway and there's a whole lot to get you let's start with your thoughts on last night's debate between Gillum and dissent is\nI think it was basically a draw although I Would probably give the sand is a slight victory for being the aggressor a\nBoat if you were an undecided voter going into it you probably came out of it in an undecided voter but if you were based voter your dissent this voter you liked what the answers that say you were Gillum supporter you life would Gillum had to say they both through the punches they needed to um they needed to land\nA it was clear to me that neither candidate really like the other person\nIt was clear they really didn't even respect the other perks and um it was mentioned at the top of the hour that it was the first time they'd actually physically met a and there were little things that went along with that\nA notice wanted to see this kept calling Andrew Gillum Andrew instead of mayor uh I notice that Andrew Gillum um he wouldn't take any direct questions from the Santa which sometimes people do during a debate there was a couple of times he would say no you use your time as you want to use that I use mine\nHow I Want to use it and so there was a lot of acrimony coming up uh I mean up from them but last night\nI really didn't like the uh calling Gillum Andrew instead of mayor to me that's just a kind of attacking move it's a little classless I I I don't like when when politicians go that route just you know call him\nBy his title and be respectful um but you know that's how this campaign has gone um I I thought this answers came off like a roller\nA which which is good for him that that's really a his lane and I thought Gillum came off smooth and polished which\nYou would expect from him I I I think going in maybe the expectations were a little higher for Gillum because again he is a little bit smoother and more polished but all it all there were no knockout punch is was lively and and if you're an independent voter I think uh\nYou know it's it's still a bit of a tough call for do you think the Gillum um spend more time on his agenda worst ... was more in attack mode I I think it just depends on the voter as to whether or not a you know one of those styles is a preference over the other\nWell I mean this and it came out of the gay I mean it was barely done introducing himself and thinking this white or he attacked Gillum yeah um I took yelling with maybe a little bit of on field a couple of times a\nJapanese corruption lead off he was picked on rocks and stuff\nThink questions you know just last night it was who would've ever thought that there'd be a question about the the play\nHamilton [laughter] I'm not that way but\nThere was an Gillum didn't have a really good answer no and um\nYou know I'm looking at it right now and they're the dream defender thing um the pledge on that it looks like there was an inconsistency\nFrom Gillum about he said he didn't sign that pledge\nUh we went back and we think we have him saying he did sign a pledge that the story we're working on right now or that will probably come up over the next couple of hours um you know I I Will give Gillum ... a little bit I liked his I like his home in the sense that um\nHe ... he was trying to make it about everybody in there the um the ... the closing and the ending which\nPlugs name was ... a lot was excellent where he said you know I just want to I just want\nTo have with my mom said uh we all deserve or something like that and that's just a chance um and I think he closed really strong but I Would give it I I got to give it to the census maybe by a hair or going into it are coming out of it last night\nI did think the Gillum gotten a better dissent is uh on the is Trump a good role model exchange obviously that was there was a it was a weird\nDodge for dissenters you align yourself with the president so much and then when you're asked to see a role model and not you you start talking about Israel I didn't think that was a great look and I thought the follow up a from that there were a couple of exchanges after that I thought were good moments for Gillum but\nUh I thought I thought the Santa did really good on the environment which is rare for Republicans so he did\nHe did he uh you know he on that first ten minutes yeah the conversation was on the environment which you know going back to your first point about the Trump part\nI'm surprised to see this hasn't or his team hasn't come up with some of the answer to that you know a respect the office if not the man or you know he's the president United States and I don't know I mean\nHe how did how did they how did that defeat trap a team not have that question yeah you are ready to go um because you knew was coming you know but you know something like that on preventing Trump was telling me\nWe're talking a publisher Florida politics dot com Peter sure she's the agriculture commissioner debate was a yesterday morning between ... Nikki free did you watch any of that\nImmigration laws the first step if you want to ever come to America\nIs to respect the laws of this land and respect America sovereignty and respect our borders and that if you're not willing to do that basic most fundamental up things and then at that point there are other people that would would be willing to accept that\nAnd doing the right way and they should have precedence over those that are lawless and don't respect our laws\nSo it's really really simple\nAnd you know I feel listening to the world America had the money you know we do so much already ... the tunes are billions and trillions of dollars were spent over the years to help other people in other lands\nAt some point we've got to take care of America First we've got to take Americans out of poverty first we've got Americans that need help in this country that that don't yet have not fully gotten on board we need every American successful and those that can't take care of themselves they will be taking care of\nNo America's never lack for compassion just the opposite there's never been a country that has accumulated more power and used it for the advancement of human good around the world more than the U.S including paying the price and shutting the blood for the cause of liberty and freedom for many people around the world\nUm but it is that we cannot take on the world's problems either we don't have the money we don't have the ability to do that anyway eight hundred nine four one showing you want to be a part of the program dawn as in Iowa Don Hi how are you glad you called\nHi Sean thank you for taking my call I appreciate it a I'm a marine veteran\nYes sir separate ... glad you called\n... but there are I called actually echo what you had earlier

again I don't know who's organizing it who's funding it I Know that you know I get the distinct feeling that there are you know the the less silence on this is very suspicious to me you know why don't they speak out about protecting our borders\nYou know if we had the wall built you understand we wouldn't have to worry\nIf they ever got to the border that there would be some type of confrontation because he couldn't take it ... it would be good for people on both sides\nIt'll encourage people to follow our laws of respect our country and our borders and our sovereignty and at that point people go through the process legally and I'm not saying that we don't let people in from other countries I don't really care where you come from you know you got to show you were able to take care of yourself\nThat you believe in our values and you want to contribute and you're not a threat to your neighbor that's it it's pretty simple and if you want to come to America I don't blame you we can't take in the world's population if we could everybody would come here anyway appreciate the call\nRight so I didn't think my friends my pillow would ever be able to outdo themselves or they've created

the hotline of right now we have a host of empty the deli and moderator of meet the press\nChuck Todd if you can follow on Twitter at ... he was live from whiskey Joe's off the Courtney Campbell earlier today first off what brings you to the Tampa Bay area Chuck it sounds like you heard this is kind of an important region in a pretty important midterm state\nYou got to go to the swing state in the country that's Florida\nWhere it is the swing you get part of the ... state right\nPretty much at the border of an hour from those for a county so yeah I think that there's got to be where I met\nThe exactly it's it's a great region to be in a at a time like this so let me ask you what Florida race interests you know most\nOf the governor's race and it's not even a close second I think the governor's race is the most impactful raised in the country\nBecause of the impact is going to happen not just\nUm win or lose and what it means in Florida but politically the message it's going to send to our national political debate it it it is a referendum on sort of the direction of American politics are going to multiple people that want to run for president on the Democratic side of the I have it today\nAs Andrew Gillum goes so goes their chances for president manning\nThat Andrew Gillum can win in the swing a swing state in the country\nWith as progressive liberal of a of a an agenda that he's pushing I mean I I grew up in Florida um I I never thought somebody where the logical profile of Andrew Gillum could be as close to winning the governor's race as he is now\nAnd you know all my adult life it was all about the ... center even if you're ever public an ad on the fatter and this idea now that and frankly both nominees and that pain in the ... in some ways they're playing the bases\nBut if this works in Florida I promise you on the on the Democratic I\nThere you're going to feel more candidates say you know what I can run as a more open to address it I don't have to run as a Gwen Graham centrist for instance it to bring it back to Florida here I can run as somebody a little more than a liberal a little more progressive because you know what if I can win it Andrew Gillum get one in a state of Florida and why can't\nYou all of a sudden you would have Elizabeth Warren Cory Booker tunnel Harris thinking that hey I've got a pretty good shot and twenty twenty where Joe Biden might be thinking ... is there a place for me\nRight it's funny you put you find that I'm not going to name one presidential candidate said to me\n... for president is Jill I'm losing I won't be able to raise money because every donor I talked to said that I'm going with Biden because Gillum losing meanings oh boy Democrats got to go find the most electable yup Gillum winning it changes the equation and I think that you're absolutely right nobody nobody\nLoses more ... nobody's political stand it goes down more on the Democratic side of the aisle if you only when the Joe Biden because of what all of this dynamic\nWe're talking to host of MTV daily and moderator of meet the press Chuck Todd here on PM Tampa Bay so you did an interview with Andrew Gillum on your show just a little while ago obviously the big story\nOr just release of records by former lobbyist Adam Corey which appears to refute what would Gillum in his campaign to set about this trip to New York involving Hamilton tickets or tell us a little bit about what Gillum had to say\nWell look at the answer was simply that he didn't he he seemed to dodge the specific again as he did similarly before which is not addressed it's pretty clear you never pay for these animals and picket yeah but he's trying to imply\nThat he didn't know who paid for or you didn't quite know where it came from um or the it doesn't have knowledge of where they came from and that to me appears to be the whole store\nDo you think can be corruption narrative is already baked in with Gillum and basically been boaters if they think he's corrupt they already believe that or do you think\nAre you keeping a close eye on is it the ... race down in South Florida is that the big one\nActually I don't know there's different ways to look at it I look at a couple of races and different way there for that that race I think that it's become oddly local law yeah I ...\nIn so I I don't think like it's possible result won't have any meaning I actually look at the people doing combat congressman that I think will be more telling about the direction if there is a waiver not Mario Diaz Balart who has one of the districts\nThat touches that ... district that we're talking about his district is slightly more Republican the callers ... down there if that flips that's a way I'm not going to be one in this area the burned but you can see right\nThat's one that on paper you can and should win but you throw into the red tide issue you know there's sort of the the the discomfort you also represents the closest thing to sort of a a a a place where a lot of Republicans but college educated Republicans who have been a little anti Trump\nIf he somehow in trouble well that tells you something about the national environment so look the more competitive races right now no doubt about that open Shalala the uh you know the round to say it's a seat open but if you're looking for ... tells about the direction\nYou can and see the Mario Diaz Balart seat of the ones I'm watching for that as\nWell it's going to be a fascinating couple of weeks another fascinating aspect that I hate to do this to your chocolate USF is undefeated and uh they have I think overtaking the hurricanes as one of the premier here [laughter]\n[laughter] what what do you got that look\nDon't you know the rules [laughter]\nYou have a direction in your school and they they're not allowed to be compared to Miami, Florida forty six\nI ended up the road if it's a problem for us I I honestly believe [laughter] I I\nI Love it it's true I Love actually the rise at USF and UCF let's get you into some real cop\nYeah I Know down to the ... that's ... no doubt about that hurt [laughter]\nThat is what matters let's get you out of those crazy off its\nHost of MTV Delia moderator meet the press Chuck Todd you can follow him on Twitter at Chuck Todd a Chuck thank you so much for the time really appreciate it hoped to have you back on

political stories I Want to get you in the next segment including one about Hillary Clinton uh and we have one about a robocall\nThey don't want to get to sell will do that plus any phone calls moments away on PM Tampa\nPolitical building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options considered find you a loan them the right for\nCall a civilian liquor stores\nDay from am to hear your next chance to win a thousand bucks hunting up at six pass the top of the hour a nine Seventy WFL\nTraffic and whether in less than Thirteen minutes you are listening to be in Tampa Bay with Brian Gorman on nine Seventy WFL a\nWelcome Tampa Bay I Am Ryan Gorman with me in Studio my producers morning lash and James Berlin or the phone number is eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two so there were a few other stories that I wanted to touch on\nRegarding Florida politics and then we'll move on to some other things we have national source including the or the caravan\nTo get to on the show tonight first off Hillary Clinton was in Palm Beach county today and disappearing into dinner for Andrew Gillum forward Florida pack\nThis is according to the Palm Beach post so she's in South Florida for Andrew Gillum\nAgain when when it first broke had been a couple of weeks ago that Hillary Clinton was going to do things for the Gillum campaign we didn't know the specifics yet but we knew that she was going to come here for Andrew Gillum I sit on the show what in the world\nAre they thinking why wouldn't you want to be associated with Hillary Clinton in any way shape or form right now\nShe might be the most toxic\nPolitical figure in the country possibly even more so than Donald Trump depending on what pulls you look at and and all you're doing even if you're not appearing with her\nThe connection itself is going to offer up the dissenters campaign\nTons of bats\nWhat if you're the dissenters campaign or if you're Republicans why wouldn't you run an ad\nRight now linking Gillum to Hillary Clinton especially if you're trying to win some of the more moderate independent votes the votes that are likely going to decide\nThis race because I tell you right now moderates and independents not fans Hillary Clinton so you you take an ad that ties him to hell\nThe Clinton and you take an ad about the Hamilton ticket issue and you've got a pretty good\nPretty good thing to do and for the final couple of weeks and of course Republicans pounds all over because the parents this was a statement from the Republican National committee\nFloridians rejected the failed policies of Hillary Clinton Democrats in twenty sixteen Clinton Sutton re emergence and fundraising tour will do far more to hurt Andrew Gillum cause then help it democratic candidates who take money raised by Clinton are aligning themselves with the losing team tainted by decades of controversy and failed policies\nLook Republicans are wrong the rights as stupid move by the given campaign there's no need for them to bring in Hillary Clinton he he's doing fine and he's in the race possibly a little bit ahead if not died that's is right in the\nMix the other big story last one I Want to get\nYou a racist robo called the targets Andrew Gillum used dialing up Florida voters are supporting to NBC News\nListened to I don't have the the audio here but but I'm going to read you what the robocall says and I'm not this was not\nNot making this up this is verbatim well hello there I used the negro Andrew Gillum and I'll be asking\nYou to make me governor of this year state of Florida this is a man and person anything Gillum my state opponent who don't call me monkey is doing a lot of hollering about how Spencer my plans for health care be\n... I mean\nWhat the hell are people thinking\nThey were trying to get to the bottom of of who specifically\nIs putting out this robocall NBC News reported it hadn't been able to determine who paid\nFor the call a spokesperson for Guillain campaign uh called the the robocall disgusting\nAnd tried to link it to the ... campaign adding that represents a continuation of the ugliest most of his campaign in Florida history we don't know that has anything to do with with Ron dissenters in fact if it does have anything to do with the defense his campaign he needs to get new campaign team because there will be a dumb\nMove\nOr to synthesis campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding the robocall from NBC News I Would hope they would put something out and just say that's\nThat's ridiculous we we completely condemn a robocall like that it's always something\nAlways something eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number are coming up I I Want to touch on the migrant caravan we haven't spent really any time talking about that over the past couple of days\nI think you're right if you're if you forget one me about and former guard list if you're against Gillum you're you're voting against him regardless for the middle and and that's where this race is going to come down to\nI Do think if the saying goes heavy on this issue the corruption issue and and now this report and goes heavy on Hillary Clinton coming to Florida for Gillum ... you can have some independence who who could potentially swing dissent just because of that\nWell if the thing is is that if there are those people that would go to the scientists there already leaning read because the thing is is that the person that um is the current occupant of the White House\nHe has all kinds of conflicts he has all kinds of ethical issues and you have defected to the candidate for the Republicans who are lots of self and he and I remember during the debate when they were asking him about do you would you say that the president is\nRole model a botched lodge in like a pretzel so\nThe thing is is that the fake outrage if if the Republicans were genuine then we can have a we can have a real discussion about it but it's it's just team sports\nIs a is all tribal and the thing is is that I Believe that Gillum looked like a governor and the census didn't and when you have to resort to these type of fact accent talking by Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton is not in office\nNow but I mean come on out of it is there's no reason for it politically speaking there's no reason for Gillum to be aligning himself with her it just isn't on forced error I mean is there anybody\nThere could rile up the Republican base and potentially turn off independent voters more than Hillary Clinton right now\nWell the thing is that they already don't like Hillary Clinton but they could use that as a reason why they didn't vote or say that they wouldn't vote for Gil but the thing is is that ... I mean Democrats up for\nThe longest time I've tried to go this route of trying to\nBe the moral of going chicken the high road and the thing is that Republicans have been you know as I heard someone say you know what we would be bringing a butter knife to a gun fight and the thing is is that we are not going to do that anymore we're not going to be playing by those type of rules and not going to be accepting those type of like\nA standards as far as coming for a party that doesn't uphold the principles that they once that they talked about deficits they talked about you know about morality that was their principles and since they have the current occupant in the oval office\nAll of that is going out the window so it's a bunch of hypocrisy on their part so we're not falling for that\nYeah I Want to go there were all going to go there\nI I Will say this that and just kind of wrap things up here if the if the Democrats go low and the Republicans continue to go low and both parties just it's a race to the bottom up for me\nI I I think it's going to be a huge problem for the country number one but the the only silver lining might be the you could potentially get a third party out of it because people like me I'm not going to go for any of that kind of stuff\nAnd there are enough people out there who don't like that those kinds of tactics and they may just have to say enough is enough we got to do something different here in this country finally so may open up something for a third party in adding if if you go that route\nBut but right let me just say this one last thing\nThing is is that we see the leadership of someone like the fact that he's had two or three issues that made reference to racial\nHave you seen his ... his campaign come out strongly against the there are a lot there put the going by the book of the ... current occupant of the oval office\nMight have I have to apologize and you just let me write\nLinger out there and when you're forced you only you're only say something as a cursory when you're absolutely forced to have to say something about it because he could he could strongly say that you know what any one that comes out with those type of\nAdam is that those type of things will cut the robocalls yeah I Know there's not associate myself with them in a very strong started men\nAnd and that's what and that's what he should do and thank you for the call out of my always appreciate when he called the show that that's absolutely what the descendants of campaign should do but there's a flipside to that the ... campaign clearly in their statement or about though those racist robocalls are trying to link the dissent this campaign to them\nWithout any evidence so they're playing the game to both sides are playing the game here planes at the base and and I'm not a fan of it but it is what it is and that's how the political game is played these days\nEspecially in twenty Eighteen eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two we'll get to the migrant caravan story coming up next some\nTape I'm lightning avalanche Wednesday night had died on nine Seventy telling us LA the home of lightning hockey\nInformation and discussions ... nine Seventy WFL a is alive and logo on now more with Brian Gorman on the same way and\nIf you miss my interview with uh meet the press moderator Chuck Todd we saw a lot about the midterm races in the last hour we're going to have that up for you I'm not on the gas in the website nine Seventy W. F. L. A. dot com just go to the PM Tampa Bay page [laughter]\nSo I wanted to spend a segment here talking about the migrant caravan that's making its way towards\nThe United states [noise] thousands of Central American migrants are continuing towards the U.S border the caravans numbers have continued to grow the United nations estimate ended and currently comprises of some Seventy two hundred\nPeople many of whom intend to continue the march north now they're still over a thousand miles away so I I part of this segment is to put this whole thing into perspective a bit because there I'm seeing a bit of a freak out going on right now over this this migrant caravan\nTwenty Eighteen\nDesperate people are gonna take desperate measures now does that mean that you have to admit however many people from the Caribbean and make it to the border no\n\nIf they come through legal port of entry\nAnd ask for asylum\nYou can deny them we know what all the time they're going to members right here\nEl Salvador Seventy nine percent denial rate Honduras\nSeventy percent denial right Guatemala Seventy four percent denial right\nThis is from two thousand twelve the two thousand Seventeen we deny people asylum all the time there was a process that they will have to go through you can't just when they show up at the border you can't just say no no no turn around and go back a little bit more to it than that we can handle it you know sometimes we we focus on these issues\nAnd it becomes this massive freak out emergency it's like\nWe are the greatest country on earth still right we can still do some things and handle some things I think we can handle a couple of thousand people at a caravan come into our border I think we can process them and return them to their home country\nAnd if we can't we got bigger problems\nNow when it comes to the military on the border I keep hearing this fine you you want to send more national guard's troops to the border go for it the Pentagon said we haven't been asked\nTo move troops to the border so we keep hearing about this and nothing's actually been done yet and even if something is done it's not like the military is going to be handling this during an advisory capacity on the border not going to have National Guard troops in the military actively dealing with the caravan\nNot outwards\nRight now we've already got\nTwenty one hundred guardsman currently serving in the border we need more I'm okay with\nThat if you need more to advise and assist fine but that's all they're gonna do okay and yourself\n\nIn this idea that there's middle Easterners among the caravan group if that's the case show us the truth I'm tired of these these accusations that just gets floated out there but it's the Democrats who are paying for this when I think actually the issue benefits President Trump in the Republicans more than the Democrats right now\n\nIs going to make an accusation like that\nBack it up showing me some proof\nSo last\nEight

sitting behind her how attached bee accidental from ... it's not like he was in the middle seat and it was a tight squeeze like you never know what I mean it was stretching and that's like how would you accidentally touched someone in the row in front of him you know than ah\nThe man allegedly began touching the woman inappropriately after she goes off on the flight so may\nAs she does up maybe she thought okay well maybe somebody walk by and kind of did a brush by I mean\nThey shouldn't windows eat\nI don't know uh when she was touched the second time court documents they she rose from her seat turned around and told the passenger behind her that she didn't know why he thought it was okay and he needed to stop\nThe woman was later reportedly\nOf NOAA and the money from God Vic fingers
