the coverage\nWhere we're doing this Saudi issue out which I guess it's not like it's not a big story but we're doing this at like five times that clip that we're doing aftermath of hurricane Michael coverage so so this Saturday story is is all anybody can talk about that and Elizabeth Warren\nAnd her uh you know Native American ancestral DNA test right and in Hillary Clinton is a big topic\nYet what's happening in the panhandle with these people struggling the forgotten people that is you know hardly anywhere to be found that's infuriating to me I mean we clearly don't have our priorities straight I watched all the Sunday shows and\nMaybe I I think meet the press had the most coverage of the situation in the panhandle and that was maybe five minutes at the most with an interview with Senator Rubio and that's also in part because Chuck Todd\nIs from Florida and he lived through Andrew so he kinda knows what it's like\nA George Stephanopoulos on ABC literally never talked about the hurricane at all\nOr what people in the panhandle of going through there would probably be zero national media coverage of this story today if it weren't for the president coming to the panhandle to view the situation and tomorrow once he's gone it'll probably go to literally zero so\nI've been saying that all along this was going to be Floridians helping Floridians up there and they are in need of help\nSo I Do want to take some phone calls if you're organizing anything if you're a business doing anything if you're looking to assist those in the panhandle I Want to hear from you or because I Want people to be aware of what you're doing and\nAnd I also want to get other people involved I did get some emails after my giant rants on friday some people didn't realize the extent of the situation up there and they decided to help out I'm very appreciative\nTo everybody who did that and who reached out to me saying they were going to do that\nOr we're doing it tell us on with our our friends over at news channel eight right now it's going on for about another Eighteen minutes and it's a telephone to raise money for the American Red Cross or the phone number for that if you would like it if you'd like to donate any little bit helps I can assure you of that\nIt's eight hundred five to eight zero eight zero eight again eight hundred five to eight zero eight zero eight that as the hurricane Michael relief tell us on happening with our partners uh news channel aid and the American Red Cross but what I Would have liked to have seen today that I didn't see\nAnd these are the times that we live in and I think it's really unfortunate I think we're we're a in large part to blame\nHow nice would it have been if you had\nPresident Trump governor Scott's\nMayor Gillum run dissent is senator Nelson all together in the panhandle helping out surveying the damage together in a bipartisan fashion\nYet there was zero chance that would ever happen\nAnd there's no one side it's the blame both part a boy and a lot of it goes back to when Chris Christie ... ... then President Obama\nAfter Hurricane Sandy and got all kinds of crap for it I mean the fact that we can't put politics aside for five minutes in the face of a catastrophic hurricane is such a shame it's so disheartening\nYou're telling me that ...\nSomething like that couldn't take place where the president says you know what and and and Governor Scott and center now since they know what let's put it all aside for a couple of minutes we've got to show United frontier so the people who have nothing now\nAnd are struggling and needs some hope can see those images can hear about it and didn't feel like you know what\nEverybody is in it together they're all trying to help me\nGet that message wasn't sense and that's because everything is so political because if if President Trump reached out to senator Nelson or Scott read something else in\nThe right would be losing it if Nelson reached across the aisle and said hey I Want to be a part of this the left wouldn't be losing it and it's ridiculous you would think a natural disaster a storm of this magnitude one of the worst ever hit the United states\nWould cause everybody to say OK mid term election or not\nWe gotta put politics aside for a little bit even if it's just two weeks come together be photographed together work together\nAnd some of that's happening behind closed doors but that's not what this country needs right now and that's not what the state needs and it's certainly not what the people in the panhandle need\nThey could've used but United front and they didn't get it\nAnd it's because we politicize everything the extremes on both sides dominate our politics and it makes any kind of bipartisan action impossible these days\nI hurt media dot com Ryan Gorman at heart media dot com R. Y. A. N. G. O. R. M. A. N. at I hearts media dot com or feel free to send me an email Chris and if anybody else wants to send me emails or\nGo for it have at it now you my email address um I'll say this though the storm develop fast\nAnd it hit kind of all of a sudden ... at a level that nobody really expected but\nThat still no excuse not to be down there you know most of the coverage is focused on Mexico beach in Panama City I'm telling you I've talked to I Am at Morgan how many different towns do we get calls from\nCallaway Lynn hey ... I mean at time after time after time it would be small ... pounds even ever heard I now that have nothing in and people can barely get in or out there they're stuck there in need of supplies it's it's just a mess\nAnd you would think you would think these media organizations would send some reporters down there or go to the outskirts and talk to them we're going to have a highly Gregory from bay news nine at seven thirty five she is actually been all around up in the panhandle has seen it all so we'll see what she has to say but the\nNational media there have been a couple of decent articles about a few things\nIn some of the big papers but for the most part they haven't seemed to all that interested in what's happening up there\nAnd and again this is American soil this is you know our own fellow citizens who got wiped out\nYeah it really is so sad because these people need so much health down there and they really are lucky that they have such strong community spirit and the neighbors are helping each other out because if it if it wasn't for the community and the neighbors they would be really out of luck right now\nAre you are fielding the phone call I was on the air before just like on this show when you when you call us ... answer the phones and gets all set up Morgan was doing that\nFor our special coverage earlier today offer Panama City and and I mean you

was looking for and\nIt was just calling for the call hey work on find this or you know hey we've got it here come here or which was fantastic\nI mean there was a lot of good being done up there I I'm just trying to let you know more has got to be done it's that bad and it's going to be that bad for a long time I mean the infrastructure has gone up there it it is a lot like what happened in Puerto Rico where everything just got wiped out except that happened here in our pan handle\nYeah there's so many people that are literally stranded have nowhere to go ... can you don't have cell service

potentially be having those thoughts so\nWant it to throw that out there because again it was a story that impact and a lot of people in this building and that I Know personally or over the weekend let's go back to the phones now we're talking about the situation up in the pan handle the aftermath of hurricane Michael Alex in Clearwater joins the show on line five Alex how are you\nHey I'm doing

they got twenty two open\nCollar Christian got the answer no it is a group of people a well oiled machine that are going to get to thank God\nI agree um but but I think the caller just said to be Harris man the politicians need to be held accountable I mean this is their job how how if they're not doing their job\nThat's like the president of our radio being responsible for what you do well they are up on the phone right now and take care of it in a minute\nNo I'm Sorry you're you're you're telling me that senator Nelson that Senator Rubio that Gillum that does that this is in an office right now so he gets a little bit of a pass on that front but Scott that the congressmen up there who never got back to what you're telling me they have no responsibility whatsoever I mean ... what is that what\nThey've done their job they've done their job over the years of making sure the evacuation routes or start having a thousand trucks ready to roll with water and food and caught\nSo talented talking to their ... that's not their job that's not that's that's nothing not they don't have to be bothered with\nTheir which you rather than on the on the phone making it happen or would you rather than on the phone talking to you\nWhat a senator Nelson making habit and and you it and\nWhat what is the editor noted makes\nAn ap our phone no they're listening ... hours down yeah they're losing our our they're listening or the ... it's about hearing for an hour later she'll get through its about hearing around our leaders you ever been to one of these before Ryan you never ever been on the

of our eye or radio affiliates I Know how this works and let me tell you something these leaders that can take five seconds out of their day to talk to their constituents these are the\nPeople that I like to know them what do you mean it's not their job it's not their business to call or to talk to them not sense is that yeah we want\nPrivate organizations and charitable organizations helping that's why we're doing it tell us on right now with the red cross but to make it like Senator Nelson or Rubio or the local congressman didn't like date\n[noise] hands off no big deal to sit in the background what insanity is that\nWhat are we doing these people for if it's not to come to our aid during a catastrophe\n\nIf it's not important and why is Governor Scott running on its why is that

connection will put Gilbert on hold see if we can get 'em on how to find out what he had to say I think he was going to talk about uh the insurance situation up there are and and one of the issues that they're having up in the panhandle right now is is cell service especially in some of the hardest hit areas or cell service is still down for a lot of people um so they have really\nNo way\nTo get in contact with friends family loved ones or to find out a certain pieces of information a lot of those people we found are listening to the battery powered radios and thank God they have those so they could stay informed uh throughout the storm and and the following days after it\nUm but but it's a real problem and it's become such a big problem especially ... and you've got\nA Governor Scott and the CFO Jimmy patrolling the sewer are really going after rising for not getting the job done quickly enough in terms of restoring cell service in certain areas so that there's something to keep an eye on up there I Know a lot of the people who live in Panama City and\nThe surrounding areas Mexico beach ah Marianna some of those places are they're very very frustrated with that\nParticular issue or if you want to help I told you about this this hurricane Michael relief tell us on that we partnered up with news channel eight on and the American Red Cross it was from six to six thirty today but\nUh that doesn't mean just because the Taliban has wrapped up that there is in a way for you to help if you go to our website\nAt nine Seventy W. F. L. A. dot com or and you go to that tell us on page there is a link for you to make a donation to the American Red Cross and really at this point the monetary donation help a lot because they can go to the specific needs\nA that that there might be in certain communities um but also because it is such a big undertaking a sometimes a group like the American Red Cross can really offer\nA significant help so if you want to do that you can make a donation the website nine Seventy W. F. L. A. dot\nCom just look for the a hurricane Michael relief page and you can do it there there was an interesting a story a fascinating story really\nOut of the panhandle of Florida couple used a tumble trees\nTo spell out help after being trapped by hurricane Michael so so they took the trees they organize them in a way to spell out help and they were rescued after they're nice saw their plea on an aerial map\nThere's been this tool that the into AA has provided and really one of the things that we were promoting on our special broadcast is that if you go to this particular website that the into a set up\nYou instead of going back to whether it's Mexico beach Panama City or wherever your home is located instead of going there to see the condition of your home look on the map for\nBecause your your neighborhood and might be destroyed to a level where you can't get back in so you're you're kind of wasting time leaving wherever you are\nAnd driving and then you just have to turn around because you can't get to your house ... so we were sending people to this this link and this website so they can kind of look at an aerial view and apparently that's what this couple's nice did\nShe went on there she looked at the aerial view to see how her family was doing and saw that on their property that helped spelled out uh using trees\nThat was really smart and then genius I don't I Wonder how heavy the trees are and how hard it was to do that I'm sure that take them seriously yeah\nAnd they must have been in real bad shape you know\nTo to need a bat and the bay county emergency services\nSaid they were contacted by the knees and dispatched help so that's how that couple was able to get help they spelled out help with trees nice sees it on the website ... Ariel shot\nContacts uh bay county emergency services and they get out to them that's how dire the situation is in certain places right now\nHere's the like on a desert island it if you would love to do and that was apparently they're only way of contacting any lines\nAre rescue team cut through down trees to reach the house about two am local time Sunday rescuing the couple and a family friend\nOr there have been a lot of incredible rescues a you know up there in the panhandle and I'm afraid right now the death toll stands at Nineteen you know the latest number but I'm afraid that's going to go up quite a bit because uh I mean if you take a look at some of the neighborhoods and some of the areas in towns up there\nThey're just been decimated and the stories we're hearing from people who live up there it's not good um so so I think that number unfortunately is going to go up and and some people are still in need of rescuing\nUh so it's it's again you know we've heard the stories all day today uh it's really had an impact on me and the entire team here\nUh eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number again eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two\nComing up at seven thirty five or ... nine reporter Holly Gregory is going to join us she's been up in the panhandle surveying some of the damage and some of the hardest hit areas so we'll get her thoughts on what she's seen\nAnd what people need up they're never going to have our weekly military segment with Tampa Bay times military reporter Howard all men he'll join us to talk about ten they'll air force base which was obliterated\nA and I know some people from a dealer heading up there to assist with that\nAnd at eight thirty five ... Florida politics publisher Peter Shore Sean to talk about some of the politics are resulting from hurricane Michael I Will say this our local media coverage has been really really excellent when it comes to what's needed up in the panhandle and how things are up there back with more Pam Tampa Bay in a moment on nine Seventy WFL a\nJust to make sure I have a ride six fifty for ... for us three forty forty five nine hundred Ninety nine million dollars that was that\nGoing ah fifty five miles\nPer hour runs through Seventy five I never drive over the limit and had to think about that for a

the\nPanhandle Disney donated a there are there going to donate a million bucks or two people in need up in the panhandle so we're seeing a lot of companies across state of Florida donate a lot of

one way you can help again this is the Florida Baptist disaster relief crew\nUh the phone number I'll give it out to time so you have time to read the data punch it into your phone\nNine zero four three nine six two three five one again this is for the Florida Baptists disaster relief crew or they're sending some people up there to help out nine zero four three nine six two three five one\nAt the beginning of the show I told you that senator Nelson's opposite all of a sudden reached out to me and they wanted to ah come on the show and I'm assuming chat about\nUh all things aftermath of hurricane Michael I'm going to decline to have them on this show\nA I'm going to instead tell them that if they would like to chat then they can do so on our Panama City affiliates because those people need to hear from Senator Nelson not us we're in the Tampa Bay area were good or people in the panhandle who are really in a bad spot that could use\nA few minutes with their senator so that will be my reply are made by decision you will not be appearing on this show who wants to chat you'll have to do it on the Panama City stations um\nHeads up on some great work being done by our SPCA\nTampa Bay and the humane society of Pinellas they went up and they uh went to the Franklin County humane society and\nGot forty nine pets out of their facility because that facility currently has no water or electricity so they brought those animals back with them which is which is just great\nAnd if you go to SPCA Tampa Bay or you can you can help them out because obviously now that they have all the additional animals they're in need of some supplies and some support and ah they're going to be doing it let me see here they're gonna be doing a a a drive to get these animals adopted a\n... second heroin and try and find it's a they're going to be doing it I think this weekend\nSo when I find that information I'll pass it along to you but they're trying to get those animals adopted a Fifteen Dogs thirty five cats there were at the Franklin County humane society again the SPCA Tampa Bay and uh the Pinellas um\nHumane society of Pinellas all helped to bring those animals back there there's a lot of ah pets in\nReally some of these families who have nothing now don't have a home any more um I Know that's one of their concerns we were getting a lot of phone calls today we really didn't get a lot of phone calls about dogs or anything like that last week to day\nThe couple and places that have dog and cat food ... that they're donating you can combined pick up the cars that stuff 'cause I noticed a lot of right you don't think about that like pet food when you're preparing for her ... not the top of your life\nAnd I think what happened is\nAs we get further and further away from hurricane Michael and and people are stuck where they are they're not able to get more dog food or pet food or perhaps even at this point they can't afford it anymore because so much else to deal with 'em so you're seeing that need start to build up in the panhandle for a pet supplies pet food\nAnd all of that eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two is the number we have a some other stories that I Do want to touch on throughout the show this evening couple lighter stories couple of big national\nStories we are following what's happening with this ah with the Saudi journalist to it it appears was killed in a set of constantly in Turkey are the Saudis it looks like are going to admit that it's\nA it was an interrogation gone horribly wrong and that's how the journalist wound up dead which is interesting because earlier um it sounded like the president got word from Saudi officials that they had nothing to do with it so\nThis is a a fluid situation the details continue to come in well the latest on that on the show this evening and then in about thirty a little like maybe twenty minutes from now we'll talk to ... reporter Holly Gregory she's going to call in and give us an update on what she's seeing and hearing in the Florida Panhandle\nWe'll get to all of that and more next year I'm PM tenants all lightning arcades Tuesday night at six thirty

back into town Ryan we're in the panhandle from last Monday so for a week we were there two days before the storm hit and we just got back a few hours ago and as great as it is to be home\nI I just my heart is heavy for the people that we were up there in the panhandle I have never seen anything like that Ryan\nYeah and and people they're just law lost everything\nWhile I wanted to have you on because your Twitter feed has been a must follow in terms of the images and stories coming out of the panhandle we've been doing a a lot of special coverage for her radio affiliates in both Tallahassee\nAnd now really we're focused on Panama City uh mostly and and uh the stories that we're hearing from people calling in who have just lost everything and don't know where to turn for help it's again it's heartbreaking hum tell us a little bit about your experience was go back to the beginning you got there a couple of days before the storm roll through\nYeah we got there on Monday in order to do you know the prep stories people getting ready you know um we were staying in Port saint Joe which is a very close to Mexico beach where this came in Port saint Joe also torn up um we were staying there and a cat five rated hotel\nA thorough Clinton was initially where will stay there won't be able to stick it out\nAs we began to get closer Archie meteorologists are news director they call they're like you're getting out of there yeah and we didn't argue\nSo that they would know best especially the meteorologist as it continues to grow and grow and grow and get stronger and stronger\nAbsolutely and he called and he said it's going to be right in there and Mexico beach and and that's exactly what it was so we um the morning of the storm we did a few lives shot the\nLocal authorities there said you're going to evacuate you need to be on the road by nine thirty we left at nine Fifteen and our goal was to move just a little bit ahead of the storm you know stop\nDo some live shots with the outer bans talk to some folks and then keep moving um north and west eventually we ended up uh in Mariana\nWhile unexpected there they ended up getting\nBut we got there just in time to find a safe position\nFound two buildings we could get between new construction work building solid being used as a shelter for folks do if we needed to we could get in\nOr we found a location where we could show I'm thirty forty miles inland we are now the I wall that came through and when it came through even forty miles inland um it was still at cat three strikes\nAnd it as you know if you've seen is it tore up Mary on it as well but it was just incredible even that far inland the power of the storm um the airport they're measured wind at a hundred and two miles an hour but that was a little outside of town a the Jackson County emergency management had a hundred and thirty mile per hour winds\nAnd the downtown is just knocked down all those old historic buildings trees everywhere\nUm it was really something to to see that cat three come through and then we got right in the eye of the storm\nAnd had blue sky I had not\nIsn't that incredible yes even carry sunshine yeah it it's very eerie I from what I hear I've never\nBeen in the middle of an eye wall a in the middle of an eye of hurricane before or or or really an eye wall because when Irma came through here in Tampa Bay it'd it'd weaken quite a bit by the time it rolled through\nA or area so that wasn't really anything like what you guys experienced up there with hurricane Michael but but really a lot of the focus has been on Mexico beach in Panama City\nUm but you're talking about Marianna where you were and we took a ton of calls from residents there today some of those towns on the outskirts of where the national media is focused they've been very hard hit and\nThey're having some serious problems those residents are are in need of a real assistance\nOh absolutely Marianna Shipley\nVernon these little communities that sure there are going to get some whether they didn't even come close to thinking about needing to evacuate um they just got punched yup and in fact we after we had our report from Marianna\nAh Mexico beach and we finally got some sense of who didn't he didn't Mexico beach um roughly Fifteen hundred people a population and according to the police chief\nThree hundred people including ten children stayed\nAnd a lot of those folks were elderly and and they were not\nGoing to leave and and people stayed with them but we talk with a family who are they stayed in a mobile home there oh can you imagine hiking and it\nTo fly basically they knew they had to get out they got into their truck couldn't see when they're", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PM Tampa Bay with
