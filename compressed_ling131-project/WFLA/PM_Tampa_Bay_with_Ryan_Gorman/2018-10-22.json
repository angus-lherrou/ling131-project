at\nSome point I I thought it was a lively debate there were no knockout punch is a dissent this came off like a broiler Gillum\nCame off smoothing polished exactly kind of what you would expect from each of them I thought the Santas was more an attack mode and Gillum spent more time and his agenda which pretty much is how those campaigns have operated up to this point\nA Trump played a big role in it or give them got the better the Santa Sunday is Trump a good role model exchange somehow to Santa is not only avoided answering that particular question but they start talking about Israel as part of his answer I which are made no sense\nUm descent is got the better of Gillum on the corruption exchanges I thought the Sanders landed some punches a on all the corruption a stuffed surrounding Gillum I thought the Santa was strong when he challenged Gillum directly when he was directly asking\nHim questions Gillum wouldn't answer any of his questions the only responded to to you know Jake Tapper Gillum had a fantastic closing statement that his closing statement was excellent uh there were tons of misrepresentation to the facts\nTons of spin lots of failures to answer questions it's always so maddening in these debates are again a lot of spin a not a bad guy for either campaign overall I thought\nI got to tell you that it was kind of a toss up between the two I mean if you're going band you like what you saw your spending like what you saw if you're an independent maybe a given was just a tiny bit better on points if if you're looking at it from the ... perspective but

F. L. A. legal analysts Felix Vega the phone number is eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two again eight hundred nine six nine Ninety\nThree fifty two we're talking about the Lakeland commissioner charged with second degree murder and the shooting of a suspected shoplift or the story broke friday or we just broke down the latest for you in the previous segment we have a few more details that we want to touch on also\nI have a few questions I Want to ask ... based on a call I got on friday show if you've seen the video and you want to ask Felix a question about this case or you want to chime in again eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two so what else did you find in reading the affidavit that we didn't touch on a few minutes ago\nWell we're talking about the whole stand your ground thing that goes to the mind of the defendant the person accused and was always interesting to me and this is the stand your ground cases or any self defense case\nWhat did the defendant have to say and nine times out of ten they always make a statement to the police if they are going to assert stand your ground and it's all it's like kind of like a reflex it seems to me so in this particular case they were a he was interviewed after being given his Miranda warnings you have the right to remain silent\nAnd all that and he did admit to a shooting a Mr Lopez he's stealing a hatch it he says that he was in fear on the detective presses him on that he says uh why\nWould you dump what what would have would have happened to be let go if you let him go and what we were saying yeah you were asking if you if you didn't take any action and you let him walk right out the door with that ... what would happen right and so his ... his response to that question was might be fair to say that if I just step back and let somebody come in and take what they want that there would be no issue\nWell here's the thing called the cops or let them go right right I mean just call the cops call nine one one said this individual it sounds like Michael Dunn could have given a fantastic description of him you've got 'em on surveillance video you could as he leaves the store\nFollow him at a safe distance behind and see what color he gets into there's a million things you could do without shooting the individual uh to death\nAnd one of the other issues that probably will come up eventually is the fact that he was standing there at the doorway and confronted him and then you see him go over the counter to pay for it if there is no one at the counter why would he not go over there and I hate to say on themselves\nExactly are they this this case uh stinks to me and I certainly don't think it stand your ground now we had a caller on friday who asked a couple a good question let me let me a toss them to you first of all\nThe release the video the caller felt like a these types of videos we obviously saw the surveillance video in the dry case now we have the surveillance video and this\nThis done case that the video shouldn't be released it has to be\nReally eventually it's going to come out and there's there's different ways that it comes out one is\nA media outlet like nine Seventy we can make a public records requests for the for the video which happens often a nod and a lot of times with agencies do they anticipate these things\nAnd so they will automatically go ahead and release them after the review them possibly edited it down in order so it's not you don't see certain things or or you don't want some things going out over the air right that's one way that we get these news releases all the time in the newsroom\nAnd videos available on our website and they you know they release it\nThe second way is that once the case gets going to say the videos not released initially by law enforcement then once it gets turned over to the defense is automatically becomes public record for ... so there are exceptions down with the under the Earnhardt law where a videotape of a a shooting\nA you know they don't like to release them especially when show an execution or something like that\nSo the videos out there but it's going to get turned over coming out in art in discovery the judges have some they have dial back on that um what can be released or redacted version\nUm we watch the video you'll last week that shows the actual shooting some stations maids decides to you know free dog but ... yeah the actual show Adolf whether or not as can be released in shown to the public versus now you're going up on a new social media and websites and whatnot\nInformation and discussion boards Tampa Bay nine Seventy WFL a is alive and local now more with Brian Gorman among the ...\nComing out that seven seven scene and we'll kick off a couple of segments worth of information on the Hillsborough transportation referendum that sales tax referendum on the ballot will talk to for the politics reporter Janelle or went about it a seven Seventeen and Tyler Hudson\nThe share of all for transportation is going to be in Studio or to discuss it further so if you're wondering about that referendum on the ballot we will cover it in depth on the show this evening time for some Florida politics again the governor's debate on CNN last night between Gillum in the sand is\nIt ... it was interesting no knockout punch is I don't think it it should change as the race in any substantial way moving forward we have\nA ton of new ...\nAll numbers um let me start with the CNN poll that came out over the weekend right before the debate actually ah it has Nelson leading Scott fifty to forty five among likely voters and Gillum leading the sand is fifty four to ... to\nThe ... that was a you talk to you and I talked about this yesterday we were watching the debate I thought that was a pretty widespread ... yeah it's an outlier a basically the real clear politics average has had Gillum\nUp by around three ... percentage points and Nelson leading Scott by maybe one percentage point sell for Scott or for Nelson to be up on Scott by five percent and kill him to be up on the census by twelve percent I I'm not buying it\nI'm ... and for those of you are going to go on social media or call us up and say these polls are fake news just save yourself at the time\nBecause if you go back and look at the real clear politics average uh in Florida for the twenty sixteen presidential race it had Trump wanting the state okay and if you look at the average for the country as a whole\n... it was in one percentage point of being right with Clinton winning the popular vote now there were a couple of states where they were way off and I get that but Florida wasn't one of them so save your breath when it comes to these polls are if if it's an outlier like that'll tell you it's an ally and the CNN falls and outlier\nUh there there's another poll there are a couple of other ones let me get to this one this is a a new St Pete polls survey which has Scott and Nelson at forty percent of peace\nScott if you break it down into tense\nScott's at forty eight point six Nelson's at forty eight point three but both are within the margin of error or so it's a toss up race there are in this pulled the saint Pete polls Gillum has a one point lead over dissent is now both those were taken before\nA at least a the the Gillum at Santa's part was taken before the debate last night so this is not a a post debate poll but again I don't think the debates gonna move the numbers that much I think\nIt might move Warner it might move Gillum a little bit I'm just like you said about independent voters but I think\nThey're they're going to be tight races yeah they're going to be telling us all the way through and we saw on during the primary night we saw you know early rate the races were called surprisingly early because the margins were so big not going to I don't think it's going to be like that on ... now I'm\nThe one interesting part of the St people's survey with the Nelson had a strong early advantage a leading among those interviewed who said they had already voted by a fifty two to forty seven margin Scott leads among those who say they still intend\nTo boats a and Nelson has a pretty strongly among independent voters and that's a key block to keep an eye out for you to leave that group fifty five to forty um bought Scott as a Fifteen point lead among those eight Seventy and older and\nYou know those older voters are very reliable when it comes to the midterms so that's another group to keep an eye\nAnd one of the other things to point out as we near we're talking about hurricane Michael and they're having all these issues was the voting I saw a report ah earlier on CNN that they've reported that none of the voting equipment has been damage but they're having the issue of getting polling places open at rice in all the storm damaged areas and a lot of that the panhandle with Trump country it is it\nCould make an impact and look when you're in a state like Florida where races are decided by one two percentage points that can be a big difference uh that could be a real a player and all of this the new Quinnipiac poll\nOr on the Senate race taken after hurricane Michael shows Nelson holding a six point lead over Scott fifty two to forty six uh the last poll they put out had Nelson had by seven so not much of a change there\nBut again these Quinnipiac poll numbers have been outliers compared to pretty much everything else that we've seen\nSo I mean you could potentially save that there's a little bit of momentum at Nelson's back but I again I be a little surprised because I got so much coverage\nOr during hurricane Michael or Ron dissent this as an internal poll take the internal polls with a huge grain of salt\nUm bought an internal poll shows him holding a to point edge over Gillum the internal dissent as Paul has a dissenters forty seven Gillum at forty five seven percent on shore there's a democratic pollster uh who did a telephone survey\nAnd they've got Scott leading Nelson forty seven forty five but given leading dissent is forty eight forty two\nSo a democratic pollster actually Scott in the lead in that race but then Gillum leading dissent this by six percent margin or for the race for governor they also have a a Ashley Moody\nLeading Sean shah forty three thirty seven in the race for attorney general so even though it's a democratic pollster showing the republic ... big races two of them are leading on the Republican side and the favorable unfavorable ratings from this Paul have trumpet forty seven forty five forty seven approved forty five disapprove\nThat's that's about it in line usually he's pretty even in the approval rating numbers here in the state of Florida\nOn there is a Rick Scott internal poll are released by his campaign that has them ahead by five percentage points not sure I'm I'm buying that one um but again that's a a Scott internal poll\nAnd the final thing I Want to touch on real quick when it comes to the Florida political issues there was a debate that took place over the weekend nobody washed it because there was on at eight AM um but it was a debate between agriculture commissioner candidates a Mac Caldwell\nAnd Nikki free Mac called well being the Republican Nikki free being the Democrat and guess what one of the issues was that came up more than\nWhat is the one of the biggest issues that I constantly harp about on the show the no politician paying much attention to your shopping habits\nAnd yeah and I think they'll never attack on yeah I I Do think that should be regulated though the number of tax on pants or no\nRobocalls and ... and Caldwell said that he wants people to be able to text or the agriculture commission department to report robocalls in the state I think that's a good idea and Nikki free and wants more staff answering the phones are for complaints that's a good idea they should combined those ideas\nI gotta do it All right and and why neither one of these candidates is making that their top campaign issue I don't get if I were running for agriculture commissioner where you have some say and the robocall a deal that would be that would be my leaning issue\nBillboards all across I'm going to hire down in Florida there are calls\nI'm going to stop them even if I have no real plan to stop them I'm saying I'm going to stop the robo calls no more you're not going to get called two three times a day from numbers you don't know asking you to buy things you don't want I'm going to stop the robocalls nearly half\nOf all cell phone calls will be scams by twenty Nineteen the problem's not going away and why these\nPoliticians aren't running more on that issue is beyond me right and I can't even we've all talked about as you can't even to answer a local number anymore without being a scale it's always a scam that would be my front and center issue all the other stuff I mean the other stuff is kind of important red tide you know toxic algae and all that kind of\nStuff but they're all tall short growing so rare that those things but the robocalls\nWould be front and center if I were running for agriculture commissioner and tags on your clothes and tax on the clothes being regulated absolutely that's a no brainer\nA eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty Tuesday number if you have any thoughts on the debate last night between Gillum and dissent is or where the races stand\nUh give us a call at eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two we can get through a few calls next plus we have a bunch of other things to get to on this a very busy PM Tampa Bay [noise]\nNews traffic and whether in less than a minute on news radio nine Seventy WFL a\nI tell her twenty second was here today on them free I her radio at high risk out I was on her radio resentment\nInside the city out during a brand new episode with a legendary served all the gardening now I'm intrigued to nominate sound when Joe leaving the talking about his new album ... and then of course some discussion about a little band called the feed off we were fees when we were playing music I heart radio present inside the city yeah check it out\nNews radio Seventy ... going to be clear water\nIssue it's all a that's a Ninety nine to ... there's there's maybe one percent of the population who enjoys getting scanned polls Ninety nine percent don't that's bipartisan easy issue to run on\nA I Want to talk a little bit about politicians getting confronted in public because this continues to be an issue Senate majority\nLeader Mitch McConnell was confronted by a small group of diners at a restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky on friday night and footage obtained by TMZ at least one diner at the Havana Roomba restaurants\nThey made us a little surprised that Mitch McConnell's at the Havana Roomba\nSound like it's normal they may want to switch it up like a golden corral kind of guy or something they weren't Kentucky weren't insult [laughter]\nBut he ... the ...\nThis this diners berating him at this restaurant at the beginning of the clip the diner or can be seen yelling at McConnell an argument with his wife who of course it's the transportation secretary\nAnd McConnell played it off he wasn't real bothered by it he took a step was drink other people the restaurant we're trying to get the diner or to leave the senator alone but the guy kept going off and and the woman who recorded the incidental TMZ or the person who was berating Mitch McConnell also slammed his fist on the couples table and\nThroughout his food that would make me\nThat I mean I don't care on a sitting senator or not he brought my food and Julie Neal the physical altercation fire you don't mess with the ...\nAnd TMZ said the McConnell was confronted by four men in total during the incident you also had a group of hecklers a confronts house minority leader Nancy Pelosi during the campaign stop this wasn't at a restaurant but it certainly was something that I think would qualify as a mob scene outside of a campaign stop\nOr the video shows a small group of protesters cursing and an see below sea and calling her communist in English and Spanish\nAs she entered an event or the other day and coral Gables to campaign for Democrat Donna Shalala are closely walked by the protesters in pretty calm manner entered the building and then people started banging on the door a\nPolice officers had locked the building for safety reasons and some of the people who were there a part of this group called the Proud Boys which are this this far right extremist group that's been involved in other kind of attacks including one recently in in Oregon and New York\nUm so you've got you've got two incidents here where are the rhetoric and\nThe the individuals who were who were shouting at or elected officials are completely unhinged\nAnd it's on both sides of it is on the side and the ... I think the mob mentality is on both sides for sure um and and it leaves me to watch former congressman David Jolly had to say and everybody listens to the show knows that that I'm pretty close to David Jolly I consider him a friend of mine\nUm I don't always agree with everything he says but\nWhat he said over the weekend was something that certainly disagree with\nAnd I'll Try to get 'em on I I Know he's out west right now but eventually I tried to get them on to to talk a little bit more about this\nUm he called on people to publicly confront elected officials saying it is who we are as Americans this is what he put it on Twitter just going to say it I don't think there's anything wrong with confronting elected officials in public nothing zero we should do more of it it is true we are as Americans\nA channel throat do it no politician was conscripted to serve they asked for the opportunity\n[noise] couple of points here first of all the situations these confrontations out in public they're escalating okay it's going to become violence at some point I mean if you see the McConnell situation\nUm and you see the closest situation it's escalating it's getting worse and worse\nWho's going to want to run for office if this becomes the norm you could hardly get good people to run as it is right now who in their right mind is going to want to put their family and themselves through this if they know every time they go out in public just to a restaurant and movie whatever to go to go shopping for pants or ... and like I ended up with a ... who is going to want to\nTo run for office and being elected official if you're gonna get battered in public twenty four seven nobody ... this is not a good path\nTo go down and I don't think that is American or the American way going after public officials during you know private time uh when they're at a restaurant or or escalating things to the level that we saw with Nancy Pelosi in South Florida with\nCloser you was I watched that video and it was kind of frightening because not just because it's closely but it was just the way that they cornered her you know like that ... it was a mob scene when they open the door they couldn't she couldn't even get around at one point so it was unsafe and and for law enforcement it's really unsafe right\nAnd to me the American thing to do is to organize a protest

referendum that's the group backing the Hillsborough County transportation referendum that's on the ballots uh you can find them on line at all for transportation dot com Tyler Hudson with us Tyler how are you\nLet's get as a mark on there\nThey were getting sonics let's try that again how ya doing dial up\nYou know well it's first the first day early voting of ever get out and find the bottom of their ballots more of it for a candidate for a number two\nSo how did you get involved in this referendum a innocent ... let's start there and then we'll go into the details of what you guys are trying to do sure\nSo I'm kind of a boomerang get I grew up here in Tampa actually got two miles from from where we are talking right now I Lived in DC for about seven years\nGot used to having public transportation options I took the bus to work I'd ride my bike to work and then I got back to to Tampa after going to law school I realized you know what a what a long way we had to go in some ways damaging so much in ten years and it hadn't to transcribe it was getting worse it was it was family to catch up with all of our new growth\nI Lived in Chicago and you know it's a whole different ball game when you're in a city that has all those kinds of different option\nIt is I mean car ownership is not a requirement like lightning here like a luxury for some of those later this\nYear more spread out than than a place like Chicago or you know if you're in the middle of a big metropolitan city like New York says different challenges but still\nStill out there it's like real lack a transit options and now you know I'm not alone in that and and so a lot of other like minded folks of a I had talked for a while about well you know what what are we going to do to fix it you know I um I I didn't want my my kids to be with us you know twenty Thirty years down the road when wouldn't hopefully they moved back to ... or or stay in Tampa and Hillsborough County and so\nA group of us saw that the county commission didn't appear to be doing anything different than what they didn't twenty sixteen which was not put this on the ballot not let the voters of Hillsborough County have a choice and their transportation future\nSo we said well can we do about it when in what we can do is that people uh can amend they can fish in their government to amend their own county charter to invest in transportation for a thirty year period with what you know the real investment we need to get out of the whole that we dug herself and\nSo it's going to be a one percent if it passes a one percent sales tax increase on everybody in Hillsborough County um tell us about the proposal itself because you know I think people here the tax increase and they're like okay well what exactly are we going to get for that\nMoney yeah that's a great question in everyone in the ... people should have to get make sure that they're getting their values or if we're going to make this investment and so what's different between this plan or rehab in twenty ten for example\nIs the problem has gotten a lot worse in the plan got a lot better twenty tenuous I I think a hundred thousand or so people are go it's gotten a lot worse everyone knows that\nThis plan is much more equitable um what what it does is divided up to a million dollars in the first year but that's the estimate for what it will collect ... thirty year period that Thirty years is required to that we can get federal matching dollars you know we send money to Washington DC in federal income taxes we never got that back this is the way to get it back\nThe split fifty four percent for roads\nForty five percent for transit public transportation and then one percent a year to NPR for for planning to make sure that we we don't just feed more sprawl yeah like that and and what we did was key is you know given politicians a blank check is never a good idea in and you can find bad examples that in every single state does that fifty four percent for roads\nThat forty five percent for transit that's further broken down into required expenditures was there for example of that fifty four percent go on a road twelve percent about has to go to pedestrian bike pedestrian safety\nYou know we're reminded on a a daily basis at least a weekly basis of the tragic consequences of not investing in you know sidewalks crosswalk their schools in this county where kids are walking along the meaning of a road to get there we can fix that with this money twenty percent goes to maintenance filling potholes and the average\nResurfacing interval for roads in this county is about Seventy five years so\nYou got to take a lot of sense for them to make sure you live long enough to your roads repaid twice yeah this gets down to you because of the twenty twenty five years\nEffective is going to be in terms of putting so much money into that particular basket\nI I think it's critical to do that it I think we need to make sure that people have transportation options were we're not going to change overnight\nUm the ... ... car car culture you can call it that we have here and that that's fine if you drive by car that this is going to make your life easier because your roads are gonna be paid better um maybe you don't take the bus or maybe your colleague does you know maybe a couple of your neighbors do eventually depending on where you live where your work that takes cars off the road\nYou Hillsborough County ranks uh Ninety seven out of a hundred in terms of the top hundred metro areas terms of job access so that means is that there are too few jobs that are available by transit within certain ranges and so that that needs to change or any company looks to move here\nOr any existing company looks to expand they look at how does my workforce get to work and the folks have unreliable commutes\nTransit public transit can can help change that in a really big way and that's what the facts
