how are you I'm good thank you so much uh you can find out more and Dave more insurance dot com or first of all we appreciate you coming in to chat with us for a few minutes and I you know\nYour story is fascinating I I've never gotten the chance to sit down and talked to a former NFL player and really dive into that transition\nOr because you always wonder once players stop playing football what happens after that so so tell us a little bit about that transition from the NFL to what you're doing now including your business more resources insurance\nWell you know most guys uh because of the NFL in a way it is now you don't have the opportunity in the offseason to work on something else ... years ago I got into the NFL before there was free agency so most guys would own other businesses or do other things and the off season\nYou build that up in the town that you were living most most guys would go back or wherever they want\nIt to reside where they were sending okay and uh but I always you know even through college and you know my dad was a big\nProponent of having a plan B yeah you know what I mean we were so when I was in college he was like okay if you don't get drafted\nI was a fifty fifty shot of getting drafted and wound up play Fifteen Years which the average guys three point seven writer in that entire time I was always working on other things you know and uh\nBut insurance was not part of that at all of a friend of mine owns ... what they called ... which is\nUh basically simplest terms into payroll company that has a master workers' comp policy okay so construction guys have a very difficult time getting workers' comp insurance\nEspecially if they're smaller because carriers say we don't want the risk versus you know fashion or if you're climbing trees and you have two guys one fall we're going to be upside down for the next hundred years life makes sense so they basically put the program together to help those guys and you know every blue collar guy rounds of football fan and uh\nSo I started referring people to him and then when I was able to help them save money on their workers' comp and\nAh they wanted me to do their auto in general liability so I wound up when I finished playing got licensed to right sure it's the same guy that owns the ...\nOwns an insurance agency so I Would write the insurance downstairs and I would send the piano workers' comp of payroll upstairs so it's not that I just kind of fell into doing yeah I enjoyed it because I was helping people solve a problem or to you know we had a lot of good conversations because everybody likes to talk about football and you know the best\nCourse later [laughter] and we'll get somebody that even if the plane and you know so the conversation is there and you know from there\nIt was after Katrina and all of that um\nThe state farm said that they were backing away from the water for homeowners sermon that knew that I was writing insurance wanted you know made her rights or homeowners and stuff so I got up to the point I was busy enough that I actually opened agency I didn't buy one of which which happens more often\nI actually started from scratch or just about ten years ago so we've grown we have a you know fourteen employees and we have a commercial division which rights you know the commercial property casualty type business\nUh now we have a personal lines which does home auto life jewelry yeah all that kinda stuff the only thing we really don't do is a medical insurance so much information it changes all the time\nAnd then um but we work with people that can provide that as well so what are the biggest things for me is you know playing football uh we'll give you an opportunity to meet with people but then when you get there you know obviously a good bird business person has got to realize if I don't know what I'm Talking about it was nice to meet you schooled me\nDave I'm a U.S so I went and actually\nGot a designation called uh see I see what you're certified insurance counselor\nSo that basically ah you learn the ins and outs yes and obviously I'm you know if you're going to do anything you know and you kind of learn that from the football background is you can't do it\nHalf hearted who got out you know so I learned as much as I possibly could and continue to do that because the markets change carriers change was one of the things about us as we are independent insurance agency so it's unlike a State Farm and our state or what a difference\nA all state State Farm and guy or what's it called captive so they the agents you go to like your State Farm ... Kelly right which State Farm got it for homeowners decorate with citizens which is a state pool but that's it so we're independent so we have twenty five different homeowners carriers we have access to really through\nA managing general agents you know on a limited number carriers have you have a lot of options sealed right so if I write you with one carrier like a traveler's or somebody in that a rate increases\nUm I have other options for you so we remark manually it's it's more work\nJust because for State Farm guy believe it or this is all I can do right but at the same time it provides better service core value or to the customers we do get\nWe're doing our CEO spotlight here on PM Tampa Bay it's sponsored by more resources insurance in with us in Studio\n... more for more resources insurance you can find them on line ... more insurance dot com so this was not something that you studied in school and and now is your plan B this is a plan B the kind of came about organically out of nowhere\nWhat about some of the other players or you play with the with everybody kind of as prepared as you work for the options after football more\nLike a well one of the hardest things is you know I mentioned earlier you don't know how long you're going to play so you know a lot of guys from the time to twelve Thirteen fourteen Fifteen or you know they're they're sold mindset is to to get to the NFL now when you get there\nUh you're doing everything it can to survive and stay there so you don't really know when it's going to be over so it's hard to play if I was lucky enough to play and actually retire rather than get let go as your bounce around for a couple of years before I figured out what I was going to do\nSeems that seems to be the way most players\nRun a Kennedy executive director of voices for children the website you can go to to find out more about what we're talking about on the show is children across borders\nDot org thank you so much for coming in and you let me start with you share a meal or tell us about children across borders before we get into how all three organizations are are connected or tell us or how children across borders got started in in the work that you guys do\nShow 'em so up the way it got started with uh some years ago my husband and I were considering me going back to walk and um [noise]\nI Want you to do something more meaningful and some to give back and so\nWe decided as a entity to start to run across borders which was I'm a dual idea of getting back to\nA local community or the country but I'm a in a way where we live and the country about India and um and so uh that's why the name children across the borders because um\nThe idea was to help children that will disadvantaged under privileged um ... uh education health shots when bonus\nAnd a two part you know like with like minded organizations like the one voice and voices for children\nI'm and I'm to bring in a funds to help these children grew and um and done so education because many many different uh put programs in education um health we do can sew and wellness\nUm with um housing we have shelter programs and then when the programs or you know king drinking water for example a but basically so we started this program we saw the organization really for me to uh go back to work for\nUm letting them a meaningful way yeah and um and it has grown since we started in two thousand nine we got an international court from the IRS\nAh in two thousand nine and it'll be ten years next year prefer um it has grown tremendously we had we started off with full organizations are now we have Fifteen ... while ah Fifteen programs to countries and over two million raised\nSo um so that's the gist of the organization so our mission really is um [noise] boats to support financial and non financial um uh programs within ... nations\nAre in these forever it's education health and wellness or children focus um get helping out community first nationally our country and then getting back to India where we're from\nOkay great so let me ask you this you started in two thousand nine more than two dozen Eighteen now um how is the need grown or lessen during that time frame\nA you know that's a tough question um I think it's growing nephew off me and of course India is very different from the United states as you know the need in India is probably ten next times more\nUm but the accountability is or is a tough so it's it's it's a tough it's a tough job but the in the United states um it depends education any\nI think we've come forward to a long ways but we also have a lot more you know to give 'em in our local community community the amount of philosophy the ... that gets done is so tremendous that there's always a need to give\n'em health as you know has grown tremendously when right issues from cancer to anything you can think of his that didn't exist you know\nAs an epidemic now didn't exist centuries ago is a big deal now of course it's grown I'm shelter again it just depends like foster homes like you know one voice or I'm studying right now has issues with kids in the street but\nParents in jail or you know so that so it depends on the issue really but I Would say it's grown\nHow do you kind of break that up uh kinda clarify that for us in terms of the local community ah ... the country here in the United states and then Hindi or how do you break up a were your resources go and how your programs help people\nSo it's very simple actually um it was give back to your um your community to get back to your country to get back to the world\nAnd so we're a global ... a drug location and took it back to your community is Tampa so we've got nine programs I'm actually eight in Tampa one in New York they cracked that the United states\nAnd then get back to you or to the world is India at this point it may grow to other countries but India at this point and if it's six programs so the way it comes in is I actually it's only word of mouth\nNothing comes in from the cold um somebody knows somebody that says this person or this organization is doing tremendous\nTremendous job go check it out\nSo that's how I meet them area and you know on me to run out\nAnd we sit down and we talk and we took but you know what they open that station does and what it needs help life and because we do books announcement on financial it truly is that partnership so they tell me what you know what the need is we sit down with our budget based on how much fundraising we've done that you know how many\nFunds we've we've gone to do with the the couple of years and then we try and fit into a ... program that makes sense everything to flee saying it's all program funded\nAnd specifically so because we want to make it a accountable from start to finish your to your right I Want to make sure it's tangible so that the the funds you know given to the children and so that way you know the impacts made boats committee wise and to the child\nAnd we want to sustain those programs so uh and the organization so if the program is doing why wouldn't the organization we sustain that and if the nation is doing well itself we sustain the organizations it's a it's an amazing partnership\nAnd how do you determine whether or not an organization or program used doing well is there a criteria but\nYes so we definitely have criteria and there was an accountability former report that the organization has to fill in on a hill basis and that tells me based on that budget based on how many children are impacted how many children you know when the program\nUm there was that all of these ... allow for that to be accountable\nAnd if there was an issue which sometimes that can be there you know I made myself very well known that that there is an issue that the ... the money or the funds and not utilize it appropriately right then we talk about it a little bit and make sure that they know that that is only full\nOf those four areas and for the children not forbidding expenses are administrative expenses because I'm not in for that I'm I'm raising money isn't getting donors to give me all of this um this money and I want to make sure it's for the child itself\nIt makes perfect sense we're doing our best to debate show here and we're joined by children across borders one voice foundation and voices for children in Studio with me you were just listening to ...\nCofounder of children across borders we also Marianne was so we'll executive director of one voice foundation Enron Kennedy executive director of voices for children the website is children across borders dot org I'm Mary I'm going to go to you next tell us about one voice foundation or the organization itself\nAnd how it came about sure the one place foundation is celebrating its tenth anniversary this month as a matter of fact I'm I Am a pediatric cancer\nSocial worker for about twenty five years and one voice foundation came to be from families themselves who have been personally affected I lost a nine year old son to cancer three years into my career\nAnd realized what it's like to sit on the side of the desk and realize what it's like to be and the parent lounge versus\nThe Seth lounge at the hospitals so from my own personal experience and um professional experience I'm the one voice foundation was created and we have four major focus is\nThe first of course our families we have twenty five programs and services that we offer to pediatric cancer families here in the Tampa Bay area we service um families that all children's John hopkins I'll children's\nTampa general St shows and the adolescent program over at the Moffitt Cancer Center they also have um an affiliation with Ronald McDonald houses so we bring in dinner\nAnd supplies for parents who are here\nMaybe from out of state or out of the country\nBecause their child is being treated right so our programs consist of our little ones which is our pots program together oncology toddlers are our youngest patience because you don't typically have your child in a daycare center when they don't have an immune system so these young moms and dads oftentimes they're single parents so they don't have a lot of support so\nThey do through our touch program we have a ... program which has specifically for siblings it strengthened brothers and sisters siblings take an incredible hit during this whole process and I think they're kind of sometimes the unsung hero and feel that the sibling that's six getting all the attention we have an eighty percent divorce rate families fall apart\nAnd the siblings are kind of floating there so having the opportunity\nTo be around other siblings to share that journey is a very powerful program so it's very special we have Seventeen um amazing therapy horses with our um a contract with quantum leap farm it up in Odessa onto a vast vast Johnny Cash our favorite horse\nUm the children um call quantum leap in actually schedule everything through the farm and we pay for it so after school they do physical therapy they do occupational therapy speech therapy um it's also for the siblings all of our programs are offered to both the page on ... uh we never leave a sibling out at all whatsoever [noise]\nUm and we also do our family fun days or holiday parties everything is done with ms ET up at the farm and it's a very powerful program we've seen some pretty incredible things\nOr we have a bereavement program statistically they say that a pediatric cancer has an eighty percent survival rate and we have a wonderful survivor program but we want to make sure we take care of the other twenty percent as well um you know you go into this and we'll tell you your child has a Seventy percent chance of survival ... what are you here as a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PM Tampa Bay with Ryan Gorman", "city": "Tampa", "day": "20"}
