about uh three weeks three weeks in a day or two if the Democrats take the Senate one consequence of that will be\nThere would not be any federal judge has confirmed by the U.S Senate over the next two years and won't happen and then if Trump is reelected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely\nAnd the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty and then when I come from any federal judges for the next two years or for the next two years after that so we're looking at possibly\nA six year timeframe that the Democrats take the Senate when there are no federal judges confirmed by the United States Senate under Chuck Schumer\nThink about that and the impact that would have on your life in my life because CNN\nAnd the Democratic party and NBC ABC and CBS\nListening Leslie stall and sixty minutes\nFew hours to go there and a complete meltdown over the possibility that Trump could be reelected they're doing polling already encouraging Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders to run and I can then and twenty sixteen the only Democrat that Trump could have beaten was Hillary Clinton every other one probably would have beaten the president\nAnd America would not be right now

president is on the precipice\nAnd twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty of doing some great stuff and I do not believe I Do not believe that Democrats are necessarily going to take the house I Do not believe that the polling was so wrong and twenty sixteen it was a joke\nAnd so if the house and the Senate stay in Republican hands good stuff this is just the beginning on the other hand a wise man told me in Washington\nThat the first two years of the Trump presidency will be peaceful compared to the next two years if the Democrats take the house and or the Senate that's what we're going through the past two years to fight coal and scream to move this country forward\nWill stop completely and there'll be investigation upon investigation and no legislation it'll be sink Trump at all

and my new uh we were talking about the inventory still in the dreams DOMA right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward and in the dream still up a ... for ...\nCan you know without a eventually going in there\nThe pay per that my new published last week is\nOn his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show like on my news website over a coast to coast am on the street there there are a list of papers on the right hand side the current neighbor is the one that is on the town now\nWith your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical but the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant\nWhich is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view you start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and\nUm ah the review are or who was it was very well known or ... or drop your who don't we reviewed my paper\nOr he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by fitness petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get hidden or bought\nEvery once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker course\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then\nBefore each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks have around fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so he found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses\nAnd that was it uh it was not for the interpreted what does it mean a it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total in in the forty two story Great Pyramid how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and ten a originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have to have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed\nThere was a they say there was there was a virtual top so it was actually flat at the top and the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the most prominent researcher who was proposed this is Robert ... bother jump off of all\nThe papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths or academia a page and it's also in cosmic womb ah his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains this theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek\nA and now of course other people say it was and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating\nOf the sticker layers\n[noise] um ...\nDoes it every ten step says it every ... there's some kind of ... you\nI that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nUm because you know you would you just you know simple minded Lee I thought each step they were just a applied the ah the pyramid angle you know in Egyptian the Egyptians design pyramids with ah something called they called the set that which is the pyramid angle\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's how they conceptualize a pyramid and go so I thought you know\nOf course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know just steps gets much thicker\nAnd chew question again there's no regularity even to the thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course no I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with bases inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen that earth decker\nYeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it's still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors well that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in the shape to block interview I think I said that uh the ... to ... I'm sure a shock to ... and ... published at al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't an arcade into big tipper it was a star Iraq\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation ... it was so important to chip shows that\nThe authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big tipper and why the pyramid ended up in the in the northeast off a orientation\nI gotta jump in right there the ... coast to coast and we've got to take a break my knew this was ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise] gets\nDaily Show updates right to your inbox for free was a cool so newsletter sign up to the coast to coast am dot com [noise]\n\n\nOn\nAnd on the guy\nThe effects of the administration of carnival on clinical signs in cats\nAt the peak challenge with feline herpes virus won the vet spearheading this study we're laying a contrary Stevie em\nAnd Michael lap and TV M.

talking about his paper that was published last week\nAnd again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is a Chiapas pyramid dot com the links are at coast to coast am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of publish papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you touched by three hundred ... a a skirt on the page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers ... with a cut away showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up\nA which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty four of these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this but these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing that you're right I'm I'm I'm a listing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a worst civically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a race shows that were round number fractious of twenty fifth so you know six twenty five twenty\nAnd a and those are also listed and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractious to run over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have\nThere seems to be a coronation uh thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen\nA chamber and based on this ... this observation that there seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty you know courses that have a surface area that is around ... number fraction of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces and\nBut where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same\nUp there and I'm saying at least six if not ten\nNow we're going to get to that are exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right but then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking at one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example course number Twenty one which is a it it that does which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth or Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... ones that are that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also it has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nUh then the other courses don't you don't have round fracture the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight or we have eight twenty fifth\nOr and that goes across the feeling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and then twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers in fact the the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked any or um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's four wheel\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be role eighty four\nNo role eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are but it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the book the big boys\nI got a ... yes yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly but we just it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give a rough guy\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egyptian use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion at go back ... taffy and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and it's a relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shark we are um we're trying but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates and weak constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course\nUh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic event the end of the ice age the construction of go Beckley tabby the erosion on the banks all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten

Thomas Say Hi to Manu\nJeremy thank you for taking my call Manu ... search you know my question as we have the subplot tomorrow and the pyramids the banks have there been any intention to\nRick construct the original pouring off key subplot to do and I know that sounds radical but for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that you could bring\nIn park attacks archaeologist perhaps what special theme sub remote viewing him to an intuition and actually reconstruct the temples repair the temples have spent a scarf St\n... yes and as such a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the minister of I think what he's trying to partially restored a monument so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern\nConstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do affection\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched so that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard uh it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is the direction of Peter\nMy new alien um they are basically recreating he's a a a ... in the in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to uh descend into a virtual world and it will be exactly like the way it looked or the the way we think it looked and you'll be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel you know uh the real thing and I they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid where did you come up with the number six or eight\nWhite so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you\nKnow just a simple rule that the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for so for every single course that has around ... about twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to let's go out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're up next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the\nUh he'll watch uh I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids in for research and just general public access\nAnd I heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned what is your access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better\nAccess for research in the general public and I'll take my answer off the air\nGreat question Daniel my new what's it like there now that I saw you\nRegarding talked about so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study of Robert Robert shock and I are um and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so on the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that they uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they want research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and stuff and you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you see that the the ... one research would be ongoing like it is if ... was she was still the director there\n... I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors that reviews the data so he is involved or at least not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he's involved they asking for is at by a is input\nUm you know I think they're sort of a mixed bag you know there is the public's eye of us who you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then probably there's the the scientists the archaeologist who loves what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of saw it all out but\nI think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research done and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects that ah you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being said some political right now and I understand that might do it and I respect that yeah but there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that's why are they gonna have to wing open right now are they going to have to back pedal yeah\nSo it to the to the listeners question I think I forgot and goes down you I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you you said two thousand eleven so I think that has something has changed or this sort of a\nYou know people are even Egypt causes that talked to some of some of the scholars they have the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know a say or they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood let me jump

Kush language which is of course required by two by four to five years ago or ... or ... or ... the you know we're talking about a quite of three ... for ... years ago\nIt's been ... older than any

coach which do you think like\nWho does this has been a little late it was a little people along the pilot or\nThey should be able you know heighten or somewhere in the ... or the wall\nI I'm going to I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thanks for the phone call a minute the origins of the word pharaoh and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't buy some thanks for interpret I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so Egypt colleges are saying that are in the old kingdom or that term was not use so the term pharaoh it's technically speaking\nApply to the kings of the old king them I think the first ah I'm I and I can't remember if it's middle kingdom or new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appears\nAnd that's all I Know about it offhand I sweat I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here uh when we were when we're going back to a man as a um and in the\nFirst and now I'm going to say the word they were referred to as kings yeah\nRight right like ... and men is uh the first ah kings of Egypt could be some are saying that the the same a menace unarm are may be the same\nOr they could be two different teams they weren't called pharaohs back then right\nAnd now there's another ah\nI have research that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egyptians and that the Egyptians that are there now I'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people yeah\nUm yeah I Can't really comment on it because I don't know enough about it um I I it regarding what the king was called I can tell you that uh by the fifth dynasty the king had five different titles\nAnd in the very beginning um you know the kings were called horse came so it was horse in the armor\nAnd horse or a ... so uh so that that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after a ... you know the designation a nest when vets which is basically referring to offer and go in Egypt\nAnd then came to to lady's name a you know and then came to cartoonish name later um but uh the as you just set yourself so Farrow came later I I just looked it up it sounds like twelve hundred BC is the first time it was used\nThere you go let's go east of the Rockies or just go to Jay out here in Los Angeles in jail you're up next on coast\n[noise] [noise] hello hello J. lo J.\nHow you guys doing hello how high is

the things and it's been a basically locked up there's a there's a little hatch\nAnd I'm I'm I think Roberts a bow vow I was telling me about this I think or you can there's you can't stand in there it's maybe six foot deep\nI'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind pouch but um but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that um\nI can tell you that the uh you know the most ... um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charter under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial\nAnd she has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another line pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves are into this things they're looking for chambers\nChairman of course who it's it's as high spaces inside research is in the sixties went to Congress pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these bases inside

been amazing you ready to a\nUh numerically that is not not in writing but in in the language of mathematics um and it's not complicated math it's actually some of the features that Jimmy and I have talked about and some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid\nYou can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know\nAnd you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think that's the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website and one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino\nAnd do you know says are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTraits meaning that's just what it says in the winter we don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things I Do know is referencing near one would be size in orientation or to true north and maybe a something astrological ah with an alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched this documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain that\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWe'll let me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras\n'em and believes at the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is and what do not not the top top but could there be a chamber or something at the at the upper levels\nYeah as well I think so I think that could be that there could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a drop off ... vow has provoked pose that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a\nIt would've been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that's here is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory or in others have proposed similar things there's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a stitch Jeannie in a night in uh Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great fear of it's not if you're a media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise pool but I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in a and one is clearly defined ad row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so how big would it be way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by a in a high I'm saying right you know maybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on a on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh\nYeah the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the ... scan your show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that a lot of gun shy and bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber of that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates ensure that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that ah who Don and buyer investigated it up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the northeast corner right in the\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up to a place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers that made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform
