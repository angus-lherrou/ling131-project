A. dot com\nWake up for just say Alexis set my alarm complain nine salmon telling us LA every day at six AM\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your phone calls next ours we talk about the high technology artificial intelligence Byron Reese with us his book the fourth age\nIf I were on the lawn mosques delete Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was what we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a supposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine and your mind as a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand than two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley\nI'm On my part cost about a I I I find that the one person in twenty ... doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys on my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country\nIt may turn on as a\n... that may be more that that may do is a lot more harm than than than good if it's ... it's very little suggest\nThe machine would do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because a single one was a transposed with a ... opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you\nKnow if you had a um you could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nThank thank God you got the co pilot right there you go but if you have a um if you have a computer fly a network computer fly all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack look that\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems may be much much more brittle much one that they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the growth in the ... and just really the incredible growth on this kind of technology\nYou know he he's at the humane\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was coined in Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that were very interesting reason which was\nNewt and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people got excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody\nNeither a winter it kept going well now for the first time in space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it it can it if you out of business that can make probably any department in your business ten ten percent past ten percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some really cool things if there were no more advances and I ah we probably had twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is uh they they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle [laughter]\nThat's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is a kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary very rudimentary or air if somebody came out with a landmine\nJust hypothetically that uh there was a camera and it can make ... ... it's somebody wearing a ... or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then you would say well that that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniff for gun powder\nAnd you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right\nAnd you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make a columnist killing systems I think it's disingenuous the debaters I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budget sitter spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave the shoot\n'em and it now requires a person to approve it firing but originally a daily but that it because people requested it and show or it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a weapon\nSystems it's good to have it\nWell for for three very easy reasons you could argue that\nThe better the more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage wherever they are you argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ... a ... and ... and whatever country you are and and\nA third you know they won't they won't work to be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost of going to war which is there's not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nUh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapons systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if if there's no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean do you see the day though by run that now we're coming up to the top of the hour or so we'll we'll finishes up when we come back next hour but you know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial cars with driverless cars do you see the day that the you know

houses\nYou know I I had a I have a feeling that\nAny job at a machine can do we really walk machines to do it I mean 'cause if if the machine can do a job to make it you're going to do that job there's a word for that that's called B\nHumanizing mhm 'cause if if you just\nUse a person for stand in\nFor a machine that you're saying nothing about you that makes us human I'll be interested in reality in the machine that there'll be a better a is delivering the mail\nA or building packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine washers windows I can imagine your machine that automatically most my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nI Know but but if you take a step back these technologies\nThis country for two hundred and fifty years just as high unemployment between five and ten percent\nAll the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ... percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years off of the jobs vanish and so you have to say how have we had full employment\nKnew ... years right and we had rising wages and because so why are we able to\nDo it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out of everybody sees it and says I'm going to use is to increase by on productivity so what ever if you get self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city\nIf you are I mean it\nIt's hard it's hard necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if you want back twenty five years and said somebody hey in the future\nYou know this is what\nPeople are gonna use it what do you think it was going to do the jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were going to bed and she would say well that's going to be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers [noise]\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that God created us there ... you wouldn't have said at the ... be ... a Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so\nThat these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see a better job that's created\nAnd what happens is every body Everytime technology makes a great job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip it\nI'm not I don't\nI hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do\nA what a way to do you know they use spell a drink\nYou know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nDo you have a special order you want you want to send your flew back there was something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills then thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone and an adult yeah so well the correct correct but\nIt's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nA people aren't gonna you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movements you're not going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an age and ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm not like you said that you know yet I'm\nIn that sense and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer can\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people who spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm you got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer just pick a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible\nSo there are so many we're we're so spectacularly amazing\nAh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\nSo you call your book before the age because you believe we've had three ages we already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we're able to do\nAnd and we've used it to overcome scarcity because for law human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed the victory of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and not actually wasn't the big deal\nBecause agriculture give us the city and the density gave us the division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened or you invented a nation state and that's why five dollars and years ago you can kind of set your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge ... Mesopotamia missile America and just go all over the world and so I Do think that um\nThat artificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we are the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter [noise] I I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called them robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with the mass production I mean they they did things faster than humans can I'm coming from St Louis\nI've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or\nYou're ... you're right that dog official intelligent you it is to be frightening if if you saw if you were a skilled across the person and you saw\nUnskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are simply not bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it\nNo delays and ... are moving to Plant City into Lakeland all the way through to the Orlando area\nHave been right on the Seventy five and ...

why do I say that because\nThey don't have to be that there are there are lots of problems that aren't technical like there's hatred and bigotry and all of that but there are certain things we just haven't figured out how old are you in disease how do you slow down aging how do you do all these things and so\nThey're suffering people around the world that just are waiting for technology to come

carry ... balanced on this you know pale blue dot\nGonna Ritchie in West Virginia now Ritchie taken away go ahead sir\nThe morning and thanks for having me on the shows and things interesting topic I just wanted to ask your guest there if you think that the way technologies progress thing that we may get to that and you're good at the age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings just\nWorking alongside with technology\nI Love that question you know you don't Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time\nGDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people only worked Fifteen hours and so you have to ask like well what happened because GDP did go up to ... just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nNo air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education vacation grow your own food make your own clothes you worked Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty are the people decided they wanted more and so there is no limit to human wants it turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor because I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home but not hauling water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always worked forty hours\nA week if if if our productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always pocket the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now by this technology\nUm I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who to machine a\nFix my road probably go to machine teach kindergarten probably not or would we want it to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\nPlease ... ... style than than being there for more than now we have ten ...\nAnd ... ... ... ... ... and ... ... ... ... and ... it gets half an hour reading and math than\nTalking about automatic guns\nWell okay I Know you're you're in the guests bart is entirely right\nAre we are using a condom as weapons would that make killed decisions of course we've done that\nSince landmines we drop drop dumb bombs or I mean the nature of warfare is we build machines that they kill 'em so I didn't mean to say that uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we build machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nYou know make more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decide that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth\nA it's a subtle distinctions but bart I agree with you\nBefore the age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Myron wherever\nFind books are sold I think ah is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just visit by Ron ... dot com and there'll be a lot of links\nTo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's going to out jumped\nTo very simple things one uh individual worldwide average income per capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from\nSay the birth of Christ Seventeen fifty nothing happened plot if you look starting Seventeen fifty\nShot up like a rocket um why because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we made the scientific method and there's no limit to where that line is going to go so vast amounts of wealth created\nA eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical problems like disease and hunger you will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming all kinds of people said it would be possible but um you know this country the United states already Throws Away enough food to eat all the hungry\nPeople in the world no of course you know that the world strains to feed them\nOr we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that would be dramatic more to come on coast to coast as we talk about the ghost photographer next you\nKnow you can get show updates and connect with other coast fans when you joined that goes to ... million

writing a story about the ... would talk for\n[noise] you know this it's it's a great question I\nI think because what I Do day in day out is rooted and data\nAnd and I'm and I'm now and you know within the organization that thing in a very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories\nAnd they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you would make this up you know you're the you're the nerd we wouldn't be stuff\nAnd you know and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people um have kind of gone with me on the journey um I I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent\nUm you know they they just they can't make their way over right to our mind um but\nI'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't\nWant to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated it's just to tell their they'll talk about their experiences because as so many people have had him\nAnd I also wanted them to you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into this and like you said not a lot of ... minutes but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners and because I Am a nerd they've on if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go ahead because I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything that goes for ... a little bit of that medium ship just you know some of the things a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe and go\nSit we're almost the majority attorneys were barely a minority and that's grown I bet and\nAnd you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent I I Would\nThink so and the second that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and\nEvery two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is going to work with\nThat are saying yes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you who is is listening um\nBut they can also now use them statistics that tell their friends hey either way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide and you have nothing to hide ...\nStarted for you because of a personal situation\nYes almost dead dead you know if\nThis started from me I'm I'm I mean the book really is\nA journey and develop

painful disease for everyone on and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghosts and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd opened a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about it and forget exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes well hold her guys what am I done 'em\nAnd and then I started the aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand photographs of if\nYou have been doing several things\nWhat kind of camera [laughter] and I found\nI use and what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through\nA bunch of pictures of ghost [noise] um\nIt was an iPhone I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sam son Kamron on the phone but like a regular camera and it was interesting because all I captured on that um or or it's not that ... you know are unimportant and special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else\nIt's interesting now\nWhen this was going on for the entire journey looks looks good into your mother's situation I don't ... how did that really gets you going\n[noise]\nHow did you I'm Sorry so you mean get me going through\nThe journal and how did I start to heal from that you started to the strange thing\nYeah I um you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know help help me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the streets of Sherman Oaks screaming you know how do kids had your wife we got ghost in the neighborhood\nAnd um so ... so I had some guides\nI ... you know that that we're helping me understand it and an album investigated and um I I started ... after I saw the first coast and the photograph I um\nYou know I kind of panic the it was intrigued because I I got to be honest with you George I was a little bit of a skeptic before a skeptic as and it's not true\nSkeptics that you want to know\nRight right I ... it was an atheist can't possibly be true kind of person

space I'm sure many people have talked to you about the actual planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think that's a little space before it lands properly and you are aligned on is when this can happen\nAgain is just a theory it's pretty good it's not terrible\nSo I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have at our bad because you know what\nThe light doesn't need more light or the dark does it need more dark but dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way\nAnd and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I I Hope people will read the book um uh of what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to do to duplicate that experience yeah I can handle it now you one real yeah I could which you could\nUm it was um oh let me just tell them judges tell your audience what happened\nWhat I'll do it if you want me to George or I don't tell them\nAll right we have a couple of minutes yeah\nOh is it something about the blackout oh I'm Sorry I mean is when you say you're going to tell us\nOh yes Oh yes so I have I but I just tell everybody instead of is the thing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called in one night and said I\nSaw that man again and\nAnd he said to me and what he said to me was how her my name is Ron\nAnd I went he he said what\nHe said how her my name is wrong because I noticed that\nThe message for you and I said yeah that's the name of I accept that\nIt was not very nice jeeze and I said and he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him I don't think it was like that but I think it was that man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of\nPeople fair to say um but I think that you know\nAnybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare you they're going to find that thing that triggers you write that find that deep dark thing they're going to find it was the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that and and he brought that up\nAnd Alex didn't didn't even know about my accepted didn't even know his name\nWhen all this was happening to you [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you under control which is now I mean do you feel as if you're in control of what's happening\nI I Am I Am I Am I Am now because I now understand that I Am in charge I completely understand\nIs I Am also I've become fear with\nIs the photography ... facet of that it's almost like that's the hobby will you do the ...\nYou know that goes with graffiti and um and ah and storytelling it would be considered\nUm the inciting event it it's that event is what triggered all this other stuff to happen and photography with you know a little scary at first because I\nIt's weird it's it's it's weird there's got to\nDo you know who the subject matter is for you or these random ghosts\nUm [noise] I Do have a picture of my mother has a um I didn't include it in the book because it felt a little too sacred to include that in the ... or ... um\nBut other than that I don't recognize a single one I've had a couple that have come back twice\nSome of them look like they're in Eighteen hundred garb\nThey do they do yeah no I I don't know if all of them are there some of them um you know I feel like I've gotten a few that looked like they had a rough time the last time they and their bodies\nLike a guy looks like he's been beat up a woman who looks like she's very sad maybe that's how he died it could very well be could very well do they talk to you you know I'm after a while and after I got past the\nI Can't believe this is happening to me face um\nI Would be able to see them I Would I Would start to ask\n'em I I was better weirdly by communication is better when I talked to people what one fifth fast

like the story you know for four or five and I think is so profound about that is\nAll the coordination collaboration that had happened on the other side in order for me to do\nBe alive\nYou know my spirit guide you know talking to me and and I had to listen and believe\nToo not just Pam my friend who I who I Believe is actually her sister who was holding her down where she could not answer the phone or the other four people I called that you know their guys or their spirits are there fast somebody was distracting them not to pick up the phone\nAll\nWith the you know chance that I Would hear in less than that is pretty incredible when you think about it from the flip side\nDramatic yeah it is and as I I Believe that's happening every day all day all the time to millions and millions of people don't choose to listen\nDon't you think it's pretty stark if you did not believe in the other side that that's all there is\nYeah I think it makes the world really small and I think it and I
