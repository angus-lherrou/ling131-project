I Want to tell people it's affecting anyone who's born around November second or third\nOf any year so those people are going to get an extra dose of Venus over the next several weeks which is focused on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sure that it does feel\nThat way um well you know part of it\nMight be as well one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know how the media is always there they're they're amazed because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information\nAnd so from the political realm it when people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports and need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they're being reported like liquor these split hour after hour\nAnd I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like this whole thing about social networking we're you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there\nAnd so it's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere and I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nCan you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me back in July and you're always popping in on New Year's day with us right can you chat to chart the rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\nYeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one\nAnd you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you could take a look at the whole month of November by looking at midnight in in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nAll be on the air with everybody\nWell yeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always rising and the sun is a Capricorn at the bottom of the chart because it's midnight and so there you have to feed and all the other planets like for instance midnight New Year's\nComing up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home side of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional planet of war will go into its own sign actually laid on December thirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars\nAnd um exercise and engineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but sunlit Saturn at the beginning of year is often you know too many frustrations lotta blocks coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand nine team for the world why does it work\nMark why does astrology war okay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets are throwing down raise this was what the old idea exactly what and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words\nIf everything depends on something being born at a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb\nIf the village of course still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that history they taking in the first breath like the declaration of independence is usually used to leave America's Choice because it was a first\nBreath were were thing gets wedding when we're independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that choice but most of them do\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon and the various plan if it's not that they're making things happen from outer space\nIt's that whatever is born a person\nA president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time uh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what is that saying about the potential\nOf my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers website the new one great bear enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com when we come back in the moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month day in your birth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time make it more accurate or you\nWell look I could if\nSomebody said to me I Know when I'm bored ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month staying here I could do anything for that person not as exactly\n... do it because timing allows us all kinds of things the sunrise birth is is it your noon is at sunset is it\nA midnight we're or the planets falling at that point because in twenty four hours most the pilots are gonna be in the ... they're going to be in the same time but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go half of the time\nAnd so the moon has a lot to do with our instinct or mood even reincarnation and looking back who we may have been or the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has what to do with personality the sun is more of the character and kind of a life force\nAnd a connection and a little bit more just spirituality but the so polarizing find which was sunrise in the east\nThat is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nIn and tell me this march since you've been doing this we have about thirty seconds before the break your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done\nEver yeah isn't this field well unfortunately I well there's two things I'm studying the chart for when President Kennedy died okay because I learned so much about astrology and I was there well I wasn't Thirteen I was there

WFL a\n\nGeorgian already back with you here Mark Warner the astrologer with us mark how long would it take somewhat to study astrology if they wanted to become an astrologer\nWill I okay it took me one year it was kind of like my graduate school where I was twenty two I was\nStudying metaphysics people like Rudolph Steiner George grungy of a a ... ... the Alice Bailey teachings and so on\n'em and I found my mentor Dane Rhodes who are who is one of the great astrologers of twenty century and he had studied not just the strategy but philosophy psychology and metaphysics of so on so I read all of his books and kind of memorized everything and the reason which if their students out there\nOf the planet mercury which rules mind thinking communication at the time of his birth and Pisces was exactly the same spot where mine was and I knew what his chart was and when I started reading this book that you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and off and underrated was in the same spot but anyways I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City\nAnd but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got a study much more than just an astrology charts they because they have to learn what's called transits of progression where the planets keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince since you've been doing this and what was it that got you interested in it and then something happened\nUm I started going medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have studied medicine in college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into\nAh all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of the psychic we're thing that you asked me about so it's the first date or the first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home\nAnd just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned to before astrology the space age science\nAnd it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people had studied\nA more of astronomy telescopes ballet or and so on they were all astrologers but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault\nThe world went to the phony thing of astrology because the the biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand why why was the greatest scientists before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nYou know how could that possibly be what what's wrong with the guy\n... what they didn't realize is who was a science was taught in the University of Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt Rome ... you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's birth the December twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay more than one forty two in the afternoon\nIn Jersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were more\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know I'm a what I'm doing is just for people out there are not putting on my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of get that information pretty quick\nIn and you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean ah if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can tell them and we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob you're\nWelcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah I did that you hope to grade you you're on with mark learner and given mark your birth date you know your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say\nAh of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon and tourists rising and he's born very close to a first quarter moon I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour\nPeople don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an areas moon coming from other lives and like instinctively this individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive\nPersonality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed and other allies particularly in the last life and now with the sun and Capricorn kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn\nIs in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so it's an extra kind of a this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and\nHe should be make sure he's strengthens his immune system and stays healthy that um he doesn't\nBecome pessimistic about things um but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\n... do you have a question to uh yeah\nWhat what if I'm not healthy now well if you're not held on now again you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on another people didn't good on um go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and\nGet into something like that philosophy metaphysics astrology the\nPower of numbers in neurology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you accept inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I've studied that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess uh how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people in mother Theresa [noise] you know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there was a whole field of esoteric astrology\nThere's a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the no ... trains and Edgar Casey\nThere's a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity\nBeing part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically but spiritually when we're asleep\nPsychic lead people who ... who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kind of thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else so that's all part of things and definitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and our incarnations like in the chart\nWe're looking at that like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of water a game plan of higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun moon the planets in the configuration that we have\nWe're under a marine reincarnation I asked her laundry glee speaking you were the born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that will were they born during the same time period\nNo no no ... ... ... there's a whole question about that kind of thing\nYou know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought people would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I ever had my life\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light work are kind of work at this stage and twenty first century\nMight come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from from a man and a woman that really being able to come into the world of north ... time to take advantage of astrological vibrations they're to me absolutely\nIn other words the sold the spirit comes in and chooses parents and family based on family karma Dharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing when to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nExcellent let's go on to Cleveland Donna's with us

I've been saying a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are definitely in that camp because then you're going to have a once in a lifetime Pluto\nA movement towards your son and the next like year or two and Saturn which rules Capricorn is heading is already in that sign them Saturn will then contact your son and then between two thousand Nineteen two thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force kind of a link to hire spirits what the universe is saying is\nDo some big time study psychology philosophy authors or ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be hard it could be music anything a hobby a craft an activity though that is deep in significant\nSo that you don't get down on yourself are worried we're stressed out and so on that you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo in an alignment called the trying which is flowing to your son so being an organizer this is what you've you've done in the past\nEfficiency organization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes where you've been nurse or doctor were were a student or you know a ... libraries or things like that learning languages from the past so there are some skill sets that you have that are very strong from other allies but the big things next couple of years\nSome kind of deep seated study\nPenetrating into some kind of mysteries or involvements that like you stay really focused than that\nLearn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good luck to your car loan next one may fourth Nineteen sixty nine may fourth Nineteen sixty nine were going out to California so who is with us welcome to the program for good\nYeah I think you are my question is about Korea money and should I moved to a different state I'm a toy I was born in a quick quick\nNo where are you okay ... what's the city how do you spell it

no problem okay you said money\nAnd where what state to live in which they deliver you Jim Kelly right now\nOkay well first of all there is an even on my website it's called global hotspots ... where\nI Do part of mundane astrology but it's also individuals [noise]\nWe've there's been a science for forty plus years in astrology\nIt was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis who many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can move around\nFrom like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere in the planet's understand what's good and what isn't a California is\nAnd this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology every state of the union as a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as a sometime Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a tourist and find tourists\nThat's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where you're fine and California's earth fine\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you have mercury with Vesta which is one of the four main asteroids that says a lot to do with investment so\nIt's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to do something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that and you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have\nA a moon\nTrying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationery in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lyman to NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously okay in in the near future um and because you're ... and it's home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection\nBut you want to learn more about mercury its retrograde the power Venus which is your son find ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there is a planet X out there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nYeah in fact uh the I have a whole thing about here is which has a five hundred sixty six year cycle which is on said no when President Trump took office it's an article on earth Aquarius news\nIt was very strong at his inauguration it has a whole lot to do with what's been happening over the last year and a half and therefore outer planets even beyond Pluto have are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids and little plants like higher on\nThe truck it's overpopulated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously and not

I walked out into the there was a long half mile here out of them from the uh belong to the Chesapeake biological laboratory where the protection and meets the Chesapeake Bay\nAnd I was sitting there late at night when I saw a large light heading toward me that was coming from the mouth of the Chesapeake\nThen I noticed the outline of a large just shaped object which suddenly dove into the water then rose back into the sky and headed straight for me\nAs it flew over me I saw a bottom panel open and New York post spray me with what I called in the book but tux and shower many rows straight up and disappeared and frankly the things scare the hell out of me\nAnd then the second citing occurred on April second Nineteen fifty eight I was returning home from Baltimore because I was a student at the Peabody Conservatory of music\nWhen I saw a large white light hovering over a barn and a few minutes later began blinking on and off and following my car for most of the remaining malls Solomon's oh and\nThen it stopped and whole Harvard over another barn than a minute or so later started to perform some fantastic maneuvers in an instant it appeared on one end of the sky than a split second later it would appear at the other hand\nIt does it did this for about half a dozen or so times then\nStop and then suddenly I saw brilliant large red light that came out of the sky and merged with
