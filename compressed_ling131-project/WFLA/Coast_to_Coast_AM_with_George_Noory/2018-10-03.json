global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box told me about the title first of all\nSure well that's a ... this is a book that tells you what your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for a general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over his think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxer sustainable development there they're forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\n[noise] what we've had a gentle warming again we've had a degree in the last hundred and Thirty years and so there's a little bit of ... at the north pole and I'd Greenland but the amazing thing is the ah the south pole ISIS getting thicker I Love the show a picture of the Amundson Scott station\nIn in my presentations should I say this is the or the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations and occasionally somebody to come up with a right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nUp and they knew\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is on the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south\nPole but on that we've lost a little bit\nUm if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice and falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about cities that want renewable energy [noise] plus or minus you\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind\nOr you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system so if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries so this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure\nOr some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the a cost of their wholesale electricity and that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top\nSo this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good\nUh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nWhich talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution\nOut there actually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about in my book you know I talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess\nYes or no they uh\nAll modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another vermin or out of the way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the the Great Lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe at the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming matches yeah it\nIs kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State in Michigan\nOn the twenty fifth of October in a little thing but\nIt's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to a climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and do you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible a man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect\nBut over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so so a natural factors dominate\nUm and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles this the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of it just cycles which are of\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that a scientist believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when it was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they\nThought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather and our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example than the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycle so the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign up now for ... or ... ... email newsletter get it

miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the uh deep underneath goes down to the south Atlantic Indian and the Pacific\nThe the theory basically was that are warming would cause a\nCause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the courage so um there was there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream\nMuslim slowing down and really not happening\nWas a good movie though [noise] [noise] yeah okay this external thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll eggs and they'll make you\nStill do in the ... thing whoa okay go ahead John\n... my dad who ah\nWho quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking\nAbout wind fails ... when I when I was living in Oregon\nOkay and I used to drive by the wind whales that hack and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat\nAnd it was up by twenty four blue flame you know they were were burning off a methane\nGas well we're asking now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know electricity now come back and they said no no no it's going to cost ... anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that\nAnd they're all going to be born in ... methane gas now I Want to go why hasn't been anything done about that\nWell I think there are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having Steve von Loor bumped into spoken to him several times I heard him on many shows\nAnd he has a breath of fresh air in inside and\nAccuracy or there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends she\nNot to make the same mistake that these climate gay hopes are are are using a bag lady I Believe you\nThey had a one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct yeah I think it's about\nIt's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion Peebles it's quite a few of those are those are United Nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nWell I was using one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day or we would have\nJust been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double their two dollars a day just four hours a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject may end or a robbery or a young child than a\nHere's the point if you've already said they're more willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo watch frosty has told us is that just sat in thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people's daily\nA dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massive really improve their lives they're doing All right it was out is just lost the war which a lot of them are are counting illegally into

the days when most of the world was uninhabited we had all forests and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\n[noise] so sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to to NASA uh their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age\nNo scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years or any politician hotels you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nThat obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about um uh there are some some um indications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well\nUm those are about five miles from the coast but the ... it used to be a big court or a big port\nOn in in a northwest Italy an\nExcuse to be a port as well so there were some times when the oceans were higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise so matter what they what they think in California\nBruce in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I I I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like to mention I perhaps for a lot of listeners that aren't aware is a global elites that run this country are\nPastors at keeping us completely oblivious and done what's really going on the word climate change the narrative we hear all the time the weather stations a news article scientists that is not the proper word the word is abrupt climate collapse\nWe never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over Seventy years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky they no doubt this a lot of\n... stand what harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this time himself I can tell you how to do it first of all\nAny time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite map that we used to the many years ago we're seeing animated cartoon but there is a fight a it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood\nThat this guy is obviously a former meteorologist she keeps anonymous name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storms low pressure zone coming directly in the California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power\nAnd can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricanes they can start hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure is on and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex which have our with our weather ... when I hear about it and the new\nLet's can Steve's reaction to the Bruce IQ\nBruce uh some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some cloud seeding attempt spoke to the\nRest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he did go ahead [laughter]\nOh well let's go higher than men just said is exactly right I Want to these conservative it happens to believe that the way to add on is being gay or engineered the Kim trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently a gentleman on his show\nTalking about Kim drill team put out a video called Franken's guide and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the earth blotting out son well people are so much heck shoot word hick\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the Kim trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's it's to the point now you can go to Wall Street and bet on the stock market on the weather if they want hurricanes that they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid of heart\nAnd now on top of that then you got the geoengineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they ... you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything\nNow I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea that may never come up with a man is not smart enough to harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing\nWith Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham meant that what they were doing a stripping the wealth of industrial nations away\nDistributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China said so they're with their sky completely online with pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America but it could have played out old guy out now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody

seventies\nAnd um I've had other encounters in my life but not with the ah the hairy men and after I saw that\nI said to myself oh my God this type of thing is roaming around North America and a unlike other people who thought it was a hoax and still do to this day\nI was a I was sold on it from the beginning I just said to myself this thing is real it's out there and are these fellows or have seen it and and God and on film\nYou I'm convinced people William or seeing something very strange and unusual they're not making up these stories some things out there and there's some kind of creature\nI have no doubt about it George and are based on um the encounters into testimonies\nIf you think about it what would make a husband and wife sell the home that day love if they hadn't had something that scared them off the land exact uh what makes a hunter\nSelling his gun collection and vowed that he'll never enter into the woods again after having encountered or something in the forest\nUh to me is everybody or lying is everybody out of their mind I don't think so I think these people are having real\nUh encounters a in most cases they've been frightened half out of their way and a ... as far as everybody else is concerned everything's a hoax right from the get go\nWell will come up with a number of different theories on what we all think big foot might be we'll take calls next hour I'm going to ask you this because I was raised Catholic what is a Catholic blogger where do you do\nWell basically I uh talk about the things that I Believe a troubling mankind and uh try to

a little story later that out of hand picked for the coast audience\nA and I have a couple of them are that do involve a UFO phenomena and my take on that is that there may be some mimicking going on

William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when a\nOr didn't do anything to him but it caught him on a where's and on this particular day he was standing there in the noise or the falls and on the opposite bank of the creek which was rewarded with toll kind of pointing spruce has inspired a pines\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee so he's watching this thing going up and down and thinking to themselves\nWhat on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here\nNow he couldn't cross the river and when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it a little in other words there were like low boroughs ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it\nAnd when to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention but he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up\nSits there and won't position and staring at him so now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later he sees some ruffling in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy coming along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with the kids in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from

from the Himalayas is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting uh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor\nWho was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of this vast knowledge of things but time Nicole\nAnd they form this unlikely friendship and turn that into a hiking partnership\nThey had run across a couple of big for its messing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor said that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with no this is a Russian speaking immigrant\nSaying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with\nShow when you talk about the the Eddie in ah the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea\nAnd did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman or speak about this on dialect to other people have said they've heard\nA voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing and Minnesota and they talked on a pulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought the look clear and they could sit there and rush for a little while and they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there\nOr they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ...\nAnd they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant and they're shouting orders back and forth to each other so it's very very odd but as far as the uh the uh uh yesterday and the abominable\nSnowman I have no idea uh I have a Sanders since book the bomb Rose Bowl a snowman come\nTo life and uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature a and yet getting back to what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the\nGlobe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about Bigfoot or a hoax\nThe film is a hoax all with the uh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taken everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of ... what the majority of the people out there I think about it and that's one of the things I Love about coast\nYou know uh uh we all\nTune in because we're hearing things that we can get\nIn Oklahoma ... nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos and big could encounters where's the ...\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the ... falls incident but one night I'll share with you uh what is named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys got we're all working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that\nAnd and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being have so they were spending their time in an open area spelling out the words help and SOS\nUh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green vows\nAnd that night they decided to go on a night hike\nTo see what it was like a navigating around in the dark\n... are now during the day they had\nClimbed up the sides of the mountains to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area where at night for the ICC\nBut when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose your own monarch you'll or\nOr that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail one or the kid says hey what's that and they noticed in the distance a light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a you know battery operated lantern but then they realized that this thing started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAnd they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around and the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they were trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it\nFinally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming aiding the trees around it so that that passing
