then the thing with the pencils I I don't know your ... believe me there there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up\nOn coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell ah you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... and I don't know kind of caught between Iraq and\n[laughter] I understand that that's right yeah ... uh\nUh later on a ... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the elite group\nOf science reporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way um I we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a lot to really tell me and\nYou know she's a she's a frequent guest you're in but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked to she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen if she did just love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very um [noise] a very\nNon scholastic approach it the science is there but anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students should be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I have you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or ... for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate in\nThe few huh [laughter] well\nFirst of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in the sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth and so it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a supercomputer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robots\nMan I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAgo and I was reading some of those sections in I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut you do you how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload\nAnd so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA with the dream of becoming the scientists since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be an export into the wisdom and Buddhism and a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism\nAnd finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it is so I became a man of faith\nFaith I'm a Christian and I take my ... my face very very seriously and so when I\nSay we need to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics\nMorality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist phase them there are some innovations in this book that I think um we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\nThen that's where we go

[noise]\n\n\n\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as author and the new book is uh is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should and ought to do which might be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics\nAnd and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAnd they were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryers and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of\nTrying to get their hands on from DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church so um\nThe question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are I Do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're going to trade in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were defined the natural order of things and you got to believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the marshals\nBert margarine I it was very Meyer and\nIt was for a merger and right\nYeah I mean we all know margarine is not so\nGreat for us right but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature\nWe had to pay a price and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know\nA ... billion according to science you know billions of years of\nEvolution right where we didn't do that if we take it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a juicy or a peach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so forth and so on but\nHe recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into\nWhat the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on it it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots powered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we\nThat they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because they know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side\nBecause he did that this technology we're\nCreating will run amok and\nYou know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go\n... you write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or\nYou know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become ... they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\n'em but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once posts about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button it up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for the day when all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah I think the interesting these are that you is\nIt ... the equation is which you use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right to go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine so\n... are like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a\nYeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how ... easy with that the right now I fully believe that completely and I do and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour because I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like

I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a but where are you with that one\n[noise] no I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's it there's actually\nA movement are called the trans human movement where as you say the uh the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I ... this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he'd lost both arms to the vet them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but the these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms\nYou know that we are mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you know these are these are arms that\nHe can move with his thought so they're they're wired to his\nMind and I I mean isn't fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I I agree with you and even even and um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that\nYou know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just ... you know so so for a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off of their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robo cop more times than you have I mean I think that I mean and I do I'm not I'm not\nBeing facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can if we can come up with the technology\nUm that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about\nMaybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then inevitably it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right and then I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and uh you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we spare\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know\nAnd and now and and the ... group you know I called them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff soon or using their own that is just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nQuestion then becomes\nDo you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nRight yeah ... it in some ways you know ... that I often I often think to myself you know all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we had our just still the\nSame you know all our fault in our foibles and our weaknesses and\nAre downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism and so\nYou know I mean that's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending ... Terminator but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nOr at his weaknesses but but positive person 'cause whenever you mentioned Russian scientist I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that wants to put a a a a new had an old head on a new body\nRight yeah yeah okay or had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's put that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween he kind of moments right there were like All right now that\nThis is this is one of those ... nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I could understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then\nWhere does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit [noise]\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached to it\nUh just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nThat kind of a ... your ... your dishwasher everything that's going to\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now I'm more than a billion\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't mess and the [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed a one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a the deceased woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd that was I remember that yeah\nYeah yeah they won't have soles God didn't make them they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it was like do they work [laughter] so I mean I think some of it as an education piece and and I think that's where a great science writing and science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time so bad since you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into I D I F when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the your schedule right are you going to be on the topic the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be\nYeah I Will yeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] they're I think you can you were talking\nAbout the mortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a finance high and\nIt says that they were afraid that they would die and they were not able to and they have for the ... mountains in the stones to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this period that you're talking where we've achieved get more\nOut of this is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse I'm you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\n[noise] well it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you\nKnow obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jive with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating er and and so I I'd I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is\nYou know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of um of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot of it we don't we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but gets so complex\nAnd so the non\n... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\n[laughter] you know it's like the sky net running it's like running on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the ... thing or from the crush souls or the people in stumps on on you know getting ... getting itself coffee yeah I get that I think that happens\nWith some of our technology now right happy I haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and plug it and it still goes on you know [laughter]\n... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher ... so ... that actor is exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say it's really interesting about the Bible\nIn this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject\nOf immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona and coast to coast am David\nGoing hey my question for I'm ... and the ethical and moral conflict created by June ... artificial intelligence\nUm one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing me because it sounds like a really good question [laughter]\nYeah and then or if they really just leave them and we\nJust love [laughter] oh no Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him while we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh enjoy your\nSo but um I've been I kicking machine going on forty five years yesterday here in our backyard argue generation I'd like\nYou know from your guest or where do you feel that the shoe will\nBe overcome through CRISPR or a a a journey either by pigs I'll take my answer off the air\nAnd hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nHe on he's on dialysis is on kidney machines and ...\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now uh with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman who had the operation and you know even though her\nFight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out fate and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but\nWe're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are is already working on a second generation\nA that will help actually restore\nSight and people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these primarily a there's a lot of great research and I've reported on off for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell\nOr ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left ended with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and uh through your joy pills\nI'm very I'm Betty I'm looking forward to carry on a you're an extra ... all of that coming up you know\nGo to critical

video of the Oregon pot shops and the moving jar it'd be didn't here's the story on coast to coast am wrote down\nDowntown Oregon City there are fears of at least that's the theory behind paranormal activity\nWitness that find the real treat a can of his dispensary what's going to happen now\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy ... next to it\nI thought it was happening and I felt like somebody was standing there like somebody was like right here\nSuddenly the jar falls off the level surface that does happen then Andy remembered the surveillance camera with others are\nNot long after that this happened watch the Penn ... it's completely skill and no one's around when suddenly depends begin to move\nAnd if you think the videos been dumped her as a candidate shop that would be against the law ... GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with\nYou as a form of ... to ... so so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there's no real explanation for why there are going there but that video\n... especially ... and the fact that we were really got me was because it's a candidate shop law mandates they can't touch the video so what was it I don't know but when you go and look at it you want to jump in an open lines of ... let me go to a Mike in Charlotte North Carolina on coast to coast to get started Mike\nGood morning hours [laughter] we're good thank you\nYeah Halloween all out of the night the hills run with the children\n[noise] yes well anyway and right now right now not enough runs in the Los Angeles because it's now going into the are going to be in the Eighteenth inning for this World Series the question of being whether this show ends before that game and but where do you want to take\nA about your last guest oh sure\nWell everything was fine and the trailer talked about a clothing that is not the circuit bitter or forever blah blah blah and one problem\nDownload memory download it download mannerism can download actions match by robots now but it all\nGang because you can't show [laughter] and the feelings and the personality of the uh I I'm with you fear it I mean we're the ... in\nThe Bible says that there are where nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but [laughter] it's impossible because we are not God that's all I have to say\nOh it's bad enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say that and it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were\nWhy wouldn't it have a soul if other people out there have you know uh other meant\nIf there are other people who have uh the problems with\nTheir mental capacity due to injury or disease you know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human than they have less of a soul I'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology young soul\nBut I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about just two babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that\nUh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi I'm I or world power guys first of all for not let in for five years I don't want to get too much into it but\nI'm ... and I I have a couple of things to say on this whole and mark how are the black sea her saying I'm a revival manner awarded a habit of the things he ... that were to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and I said environment now and furthermore it our current situation right now we have\nThere are a lot of people story not first survival situations and there are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are highly compiling surprise for\nThree years to come for for ...\nCents is families with multiple wives with multiple shelter with multiple multiple and um and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not these are usable and we don't know even with\nTraining we don't know if the supplies which says ... somebody in a cave or in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt it on your way to I'm following scare myself\nNot to a consuming somebody's supplies but just chew on myself and my child\nEven I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer a myself to give her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies they just see somebody could even\nHis fans and the south\nAnd interesting you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know who's going to survive that could be a child it could be a twelve year old kid\nWho hasn't had any training on how to use the supplies that are stored up and use codes are or wherever I'm\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I ... I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are\nA latter day saints and so I just would be a clear for people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do\nBut to her point I was watching on Netflix or there's a series called like the men with three wives zero three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade a Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife\nAnd then the following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab and um and that they they've already talked about saving up

missing something what is your opinion on that\nWell it's an interesting claim that the the the marches on purpose or coordinated toward us I mean I\nI think that you'll always see migrations in the long history just bring up the Bible again\nThis is that we're all immigrants read the Bible says that we we all move 'em and that would be you know all of the stories you a lot of the stories we're both from people just trying to get food just trying to move to get food and begging people to allow them to live in in space it has food\nSo I kind of see that as a perpetual thing not something new but you know I\nI ... is or is there if it that's the smoke screen than what's behind it I guess we're supposed to wonder about or are you suggesting that something is going to come from the north um while we're so busy looking south and east is that was that part of your implication\nThat kind of my question I mean all this was happening at one show or something else going to happen that we're missing and all a media concentrated in one direction and I just uh I I\nWell I think that's something I I Can't answer but I'd love to let that just flowed out there like All right so I write down what you just said and we'll see maybe a couple of weeks with or something comes with that um because I think that's that's an interesting thought that maybe ... ... what what are we in general taking

to you\nFor so long I I started out listening to art bell and I've tried to call in a couple of hundred times this first time I've gotten three\nIs such a great privilege it if I can and I would like to share something a ... about the Bible a and there's a great truth that we need to realize in any discipline a\nIf any discipline that you study whether it be science or whether it be ah the Bible for instance uh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a big drink\nAnd the and the Bible as something to be studied and pondered over all three of the model the aesthetic religions from the middle east began their roots with the Bible and and polluting the ... the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\n... and the Newton is in the new ... the the ...\nYeah I mean the the story the story of the prophet Jesus and the Koran is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and even the story of the floods the story of Jesus in the car and all of that validates not counting the historical values a historical cruise you know that that line up\nWith a so many of the stories in the Bible a mini that many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because\nOf the historical value of the book of Daniel is so accurate\nAnd ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for\nDaniel to know as much of the future as you as he did but\nThat that Cruz when you look at the troops there and you look at the big picture the heart the grace of the the Old Testament and the New Testament this has done so much for humanity\nYou know the ocean I agree I agree we yeah we we stray\nAway from that and people and people like to take two or three versus an\nEdge a whole right that's terrible whole book or you know and they'll a skilled in\nAnd you know it's called proved texting and it's yeah it's there's a there's an old saying I've I've said it before I go to ... but as soon as the first in St learned in seminary was\nThat some people um some people rely on a on scripture I'm like a drunk leans on a lamp post not so much for illumination but for support and I think it's\nThe elimination part that I always go for another support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just sounds like you're a learned guy but I did a um I I was writing I wrote an article about\nUm about the true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told [noise] and I was interested in how many troops um how many murder stories there are in the Bible\nAnd that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that\nIt starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what these murders stories still do what\nI found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran\nThey actually use the word murder with regard to Jesus they where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the ... of the Bible and the New Testament the Greek word says kill\nBut actually the word that's often used uh the Arabic word is the Jesus who was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it that he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot when we think about it\nIn a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out yet I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did the ...\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity has a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to build\nA legacies ... do you think that that has hurt us and gotten a so why are from the central message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime there's always been the big difference of shooting a bullet in the name of God or taking a bullet in the name of God\nAnd I'm I'm In the taking the bullet camp [laughter]\nI'll take the bullet in protecting somebody else I'm a ... you know people go way far onto their way to create these\nStructures were there shooting people killing other people in the name of God and I uh that's where I draw the line you can join the conversation the written you've got a great town I'll let you get back to work too but um last time I was in a Bowling Green actually they were doing work I was on my way to the airport in Nashville and I came across it\nWe get to a Charles in Portland, Oregon coast to coast Charles\nAnd good morning how are you today\nGood it's open lines you take us anywhere\nWell let me first start by saying uh I've also been a listener just like read from the coast because to have ... days and uh you are my absolute favorite or\nA ... second\n... bench warmer I'm okay with that [laughter] I mean nobody can replace man but you know I get the body to wind up on it\nOr do drugs is a great job I'm having a good time uh where do you want to take it as\nA just what you said a minute ago difference being murdering show that's fascinating that could be off that live with me for a week in the\nIsn't it isn't it just ... and the fact that it's Islam where they say murder the Jesus was murdered yeah that I made it really is I don't know I'm ... go ahead\nWell I yeah I wanted to take us back to the Bible um I was telling the screener I'm a I'm for lack of a better term hardcore atheist\nAnd everything but ah I Believe in in you know seeing wisdom where you find it I\nI heard a whole lot of wisdom in the Bible and\nIf you read it at the five ... uh I I don't be much value but if you look at it is how people were thinking two thousand four thousand years ago\nUm it's fascinating I mean you read genesis and if you actually go back and look for you know the Gardner heat and you're going to be disappointed but if you look at it is you know what separates humans from the animal knowledge of good and evil how to spell for blacks and\nYeah and how how people we're dealing with that that fundamental truth back then and um you know they were putting their own poetry behind it but they were saying this is what separates humans from animals and how you know how do
