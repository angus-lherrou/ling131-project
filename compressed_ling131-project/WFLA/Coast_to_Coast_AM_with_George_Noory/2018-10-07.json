did come away with two points and that's all you care about really at the end of the debt right\nYeah you know I mean how much of have this team talked in the early part about you know bank of points it's about banking points early in the season in finding a way to uh pick them up because you know they're at a premium or as the season starts to go along and just as we saw last year when I get off that terrific start\nYou know a carry them all the way through the end of the regular season so at this point in the year you don't always asked how are you you get the points and then and then worry about the process as you go\nFor let you go a couple of young guys really uh came up big for Tampa Bay tonight I thought in play well and we talked about that during the free game and on letting power play live starting at five thirty if you could ask them young guys have some moments this season while your top guns aren't clicking\nThat just goes to show you how versatile they are up Matthew Joseph in ... and Anthony ... should say really played well\nYeah I thought Joseph in particular you know he he looked a little nervous was you certainly expect for a player making his NHL debut in the first period but what he really pick up his game and the second or third and I thought the surly\nOr Joseph corn line was fantastic especially in the second period and you know it's probably not a mistake that it ended up being surrounded it ends up scoring the tying goal that gets us gained over time were you know the one you're able to pick up that second point so you don't you need that production eat you want your young players that feel good about themselves as as they go along and certainly those two guys in particular should feel really good about themselves\nYou can check 'em

two I talked to Ben what grew during the ah the pre season and he said\nHe kind of raises eyebrows and he went the thing about him is he has the speed he said he has NHL speed but he knows how to change the speed and he has a little bit of an extra gear when he really needs to have you worked on that or is that just\nKind of come naturally you know what I think ah when I was sixteen years old I think that's when it's kind of started when I was Fifteen Years old\nUm I didn't make and then make them the best team I I got sent down and uh you know I was little frame and ah you know I wasn't big really enough to play and uh you know I came back after that you're a little ... of the fact that I I couldn't make the team Fifteen Years old you know all my buddies were there and I couldn't make the team\nAnd uh all year I after school I was a you know I had a busy\nBusy busy days after school and uh I was going back home and I worked out for four or five times a week or during the season which uh I don't think a lot of guys were doing and uh you know I think that really help from my speeds and said that year I found out when I was Fifteen and uh you know what maybe use them\nFive guy but I think this is just a ... game in general I think there's a lot of fast guy out there and uh if you don't know if you don't keep your keep moving or you're going to be behind\nAbsolutely especially in the NHL these days and it's one game but as you said it it's a step in the process but hopefully it's one of many many many at this level congratulations again on your

as the lightning come back\nFor eight to one shootout victory and they win the shootout to nothing to start the\nSeason with a victory and by the way it is the fifth consecutive home opener\nThat the lightning has picked up a W so it's always a good way to get the season's going up reining Matt Salmon here and a cast of thousands thanks again for everybody hung around with us tonight Matthew Joseph still here\nIf there was any doubt whether people came to see you and I\nDon't really nasty as\nThousands are now over there about anyway there was there was no doubt and that's that's how you\nKnow that you've got the NHL rookie because he'll sign anything and take pictures and and the crowd here are smart\nAnd God you're in a regular as they were there for his time that's great\nFor the regular house\nSeats but anyway a great to see Matthew Joseph and this is another one of those guys where um I remember when he was drafted back twenty Fifteen dropped in sunrise the home of the Panthers fourth rounded and when you get to the fourth round ... especially you know seven round draft once you start getting into the fourth and fifth round\nThere's a lot of players that get selected you don't really know who they are a ... and I'm Talking from a broadcaster standpoint obviously the hockey operations does its work but you don't really know who they are I don't know how they're going to fit in you don't know what exactly they bring to the table here\nAnd uh you know a lot of names and the fourth fifth sixth seventh round they just kind of fall by the wayside over the years\nBut I think it's pretty clear you know he's had two very good camps here with the lightning\nMakes the roster out of camp they'll guarantee is going to be here all season but he certainly pressing the staff enough to be in the opening night lineup [noise]\nAnd I don't think there'll be any doubt Bryan that uh you know the questions for four years ago of where does he fit in what does he bring to the table I think they're being answered here definitely\nAs ... the head of the amateur scouting for the lightning would say he's the bowl he he definitely fits the profile of your stereotypical Tampa Bay lightning forward here with speed with still\nA little under size but certainly a lot of determination and [noise] you know you saw the inside\nPerformance to you know you look at the total lifetime it's nothing that stands out if you had just over Thirteen minutes ah Thirteen fifty and facts but even strengths however play short handed opportunities are quite a few shots on net or shot attempts as well\nSaving for the first game jitters he certainly looked like he he fit in well with this team and and then the NHL well and he\nTook advantage of of ah the opportunity he was given the first period yeah he was he had the shakes I I watched him the first couple of chefs he he was smart he went in for a check and just hit somebody and his first shift the best way to settle yourself down although it didn't work all the way\nBecause I saw him come back in his own and the news coverage and his own and he was kind of drifting around out there and\nBanged into the boards and in almost fell down\nUm ... you could tell he was just really uptight but then he did he just\nMust of mentally you know concentrate and went okay I get over this let's go\nAnd uh he he accorded himself very well and you know you have to credit John Cooper too that\nI've seen it a lot of times in the past were rookie comes out\nAnd you know they're they're nervous and you can see it and the dropping the puck into pieces and\nAnd uh things aren't going very well and they go All right we'll send them for a while and then we'll try again next game and whatever so you end up sitting a really long time\nIn your first game and and uh John Cooper didn't do that he sat a little bit but then he also had some key stretches where he got some things go on and then he earned his next shift and he was out there you know and the three on three because he has those great wheels\nAnd you have to be able to cover a lot of ground very quickly up and back in those three on three situation so [noise]\nAnd that's a big feathering this cap which was well earned and it'll give them a lot of confidence that he was out there I'm In the three on three and again it goes back to ... he is a really good skater and he's smart he knows where he's supposed to be so we've got put to the test and he did pretty good pretty darn well\nYeah and he does have sixteen years of experience so let's [laughter]\nWe we all feel old ways well I was too I'm Roberta long ago was just a start in his career and yeah you know other ... ... ... and he pointed out I mean the team had pretty terrible\nFrisbee or yeah I was just gonna say if you if he had a jitters uh fortunately the the rest of the playing field was kind of at the same level here for the lighting fortunately it was just a one nothing deficit for much of this game guy eighty a pretty good\nYeah what's his name has left me I'm near forty save forty three shots\nI Know a lot of their shots coming over time but\nBoy isn't ten dollars tonight and I don't know uh you know what was the issue with getting the teen going here and things just start turning around and the second period but\nUh it's a good thing live as he was certainly on his game tonight but I you know as as much as we will critique the lightning and they're starting it was kind of a sluggish go up until a power play early in the second period\nAnd have the team's going to be working on some things over the next few days you may be known that the schedule oh you got to wait till Thursday until the next game well now the coaches are going great we have until Thursday or for the next game because they're going to work some things out of practice but let's give the lighting some credit\nThanks for calling possible storage how can we help we just

a shoot out over the Panthers and they'll get ready for Thursday's game against the Vancouver Canucks but first to put a bow on tonight when let's hear from head coach John Cooper's posting comments are presented by W. M. you call the law school the Tampa campus give them a call at eight one three\nFor one nine fifty one hundred here is junk Cooper\nWas speaking of Joseph first you could tell the nerves right I'm a little bit in the first period I'm completely understandable I think his mom and dad were in the crowd and um you just go round\nEvery opening night game somebody's some teams have multiple guys playing their first game um but it's always fun to watch that came up and and then here you know it's the biggest homicide and ... and um\nBut you know speeds his game and when he got his legs on her and my I thought it was created and the line\nAs a whole was outstanding um you know certainly might have been one of the best players on the ice for us and I worked at heart and there's so many things right factually gotta get the chance he did and\nAnd obviously a huge hole for better for secretary of this so officer\n[laughter]\nSo many answers to that [noise] that I'd say\nYou know off when Microsoft but we um clearly are game we weren't skating in the ... for whatever reasons where um they were much better they were beating us the parks um when you look at the statistics inside the sixteen for ... for like\nFive for five three so we weren't\nOverly concerned I thought we had a really good second period we took the plate of them\nIs going chances were probably three to one for us couldn't I couldn't find the back that but I really liked we're playing um you know the Achilles heel tonight was you just can't take three families in third period just sucked the life of ourselves and every time we are trying to get it back um\nYou know they want another probably and it just went back to you know kind of fell back into the trap and not skating an attorney parks over and that's what happens in so something we're obviously going up to dress now I'm but I'm saying that you know the much maligned ... from last year for\nFor tonight kept him off the board and got the goal that pushes the overtime so a lot of positive take from that\nHe'll be well I\nWell I didn't look a couple of ways you know the shot describes in the game but the twelfth horribly shots um so the you know you need to go to make some safe but I didn't think he had to make terribly difficult saves until the Hoffman shot\nIronically I was right before we scored he make say ten bell save on Hoffman and then we go down a score so [noise] uh ultimately we kept on the outside we didn't give him big chance as we cleared the rebounds but when you have that many power plays some point to always got to have to make a big one and he made a big one\nIs a tough time has been the last minute regulation Schiff show you got to get that trust is\nProbably all the same stuff you shorten the pre season so it was a reason she played the amount of gays and preseason and and and got the play in the regular season they got to play down the stretch have earned\nGuys that are going to play\nOn words you don't mind for me\n[laughter]\nHard to say I all I Know is we won tonight we took this a really tough they'd go in and take the points that way we can get um do we have stuff to clean up I think I'd listen to every single culturally press conference say did pretty well but we got a lot if there were a lot of ways to go so I'll just say everything that they've been saying\nI'm by\nWake up tomorrow we've got two more points we had today and that's what it's about this later they're not all going to be pretty\nUm but I'll take it will move on and you know have another training camp during a crappy\nJob trooper comments presented by WMU totally law school in the camp camp some lawyer like responses to some of the questions\nEven even he doesn't want\nJust much practice amazing no although on Tuesdays they'll hack hoops hatched this fishing tournament a so that'll help break up a little bit of the downtime\nBut uh you know with that said and and we joked about it but the things that they need to clean up you'll have at least a twofold practices before Thursday's game\nAnd Brian to looking at Thursday it's the rare very early match up between the lightning and the ... we normally don't see them until November December at the earliest but here they are getting to\nThe ... bit of a mystery they've already got one went under their belt or they're in a pretty competitive game with Calgary right now\nI don't know what to make up the ... but I think this is one of those games where you've got to a young rebuilding team that is going to try to\nKnock down the lightning of pay you know this is one of the best teams in the league but I think this is another one of those games you talk to is really the lightning just kinda cleaning things up worry worry more about what they need to do right as opposed to you know ... ... and those were the other team\nAs far as Hoover goes uh they are in a rebuilding boat they got a lot of young guys\nUm I saw snippet of their game against Calgary the other day all of a couple of you know a couple of days to watch a game or so and tried to get a feel for them a little more this year because they have so many new faces um so uh you know they're\nThey're big star young player last year was brought Vassar and and he had a a heck of a year he was right in the running their for rookie of the year for a long time you get hurt right at the end of the year\nAnd this'll be the first time since about Nineteen sixty three that they haven't played but I'll have to set a dance right\nSo you know it's it's a different look and feel it's the changing of the guard all the way around so having said that yeah the you know the leading always say in pretty well every team does you know we don't yeah you know the opposition blah blah blah but it's about how we play and they do build their game I and I think you saw it last year in the year before and even the year before that\nA John Cooper and the staff or have been good about\nCoaching that way here's what we have to do to get better it's really hard to score and and if you if you when you listen to John Cooper talked day after day\nYou realize the message that he's getting across is obvious but sometimes you don't even here so I always said is really tough to score on this late what it is it's really tough so if you can't score you can't win\nHe knows he's got a lot of weapons but you have to have a system and you have to work at it and you have to get better and you have to have all that puck management so they work on that an awful lot and it is a progression so they get a little better here and then they give away something else sometimes I think that\nAnd I've been here in and sat out their games go my God they gave up so much defensively and they did tonight they gave up way too many shots they know that\nThey're trying to get their game going which is the speed and the puck possession et cetera et cetera so in that process you're going to give something up on the other side we're going to see that\nTo varying degrees over the course of the season then when you get down to the last three or four weeks then you have to you know start getting ready for the play offs and you have to really hunker down defensively and you become a bit of a different team in the play offs out of necessity\nThe Washington Capitals are case in point they did it they changed and they won\nSo we'll watch that one Russian\nBut you're going to see that officer progression what they do a fence of Leon build their game along the way and that puck possession drives their defense because they're you know a hundred and fifty feet away from their own ...\nAnd fans who are attending the game Thursday night also a\nContinuation of the bike game home standard got Columbus a week from tonight you've got Carolina and Detroit and just want to let you know that you still have a chance to save some money on tickets to those games who got a four pack deal\nWouldn't want to pay for all the craziness going on in there I feel like you are who you are asked style of actual journalism where you are and there's nothing else or what\nWe're going to be going through some incredible time [noise] but not all going to be good to just rocky is a machine we're going to get to what you need\nYou are listening to our bill somewhere inside tonight ... goes to goes wrong march twenty Nineteen Ninety seven [noise]\n... got when you went ballet [noise]\nAll right bye now a to my guest and I will ask for the sake of the radio audience once again that they all identify themselves by

before we leave the subject of aliens or dimensional beings or whatever it is that you all sins and agree\nOr would be out there\nA one obvious target in this area uh would've been the Roswell episode and I've got a a person vaccine me from Los Angeles saying uh somebody must have tackled that one has anybody looked at Roswell in it so what have you determined\nUh I can I can respond to that first I guess this is Joe okay Joe I'm I I had a private client who actually targeted me against Roswell and uh at the time I of course was totally blind to the actual target\nAnd uh what I produced was essentially a very accurate description of the location that was being targeted Roswell which is the believe crash site\nUh there were some indications that there probably was an incident there but it did not involve an alien craft it involves a\nA possible ... collusion between uh uh some earth earth bound traffic and probably involved a some materials that were sensitive [noise]\nEnhance a then of course the story about the weather balloon\nYes I ... the data I had to not specifically match a weather balloon but uh it it did a indicate that there was probably any that but it was probably not a ... a alien associated\nSorry fought Joe I'm ... you from Orange County aren't in reading ... book mind track which by the way I thought was a great book he talks about a stage in which he sees creatures or goals for spirits\nAnd uh the person wants to know does everybody who remote views eventually get there\n[noise] uh in in regard to what what their referencing are uh some chapters in near where I was discussing or my interaction with the what you might call entities that uh took this took place essentially as an experience outside of remote doing All right I Want to make that very clear\nAll while these these may have been a personal experience on but I think is balance [noise] ah they they were not the separation was not obtained a severe um appealing [noise] um\nI I Believe it's my personal belief um based on Nineteen years of participation in the project and in the remote during that I've done\nIt's my personal belief that um that we are by nature a central existing in two worlds a one foot physical and one foot in the spiritual and to ignore the experiences from a spiritual side would be taught him out to cutting off the left leg so to speak [noise]\nAll right oh I hear well then here's another good question other than the remote viewing of Christ um Kent any of\nYou or do any of you aside from your personal religious beliefs are in in in the context of remote viewing ... or is it possible to confirm the fact that there is life beyond the physical\nI I I Will answer that uh this is Joe again I'm In my opinion yes oh\nBut it's not life as we know the physical and it's it's obviously something else right and uh I I Believe that uh we do have frequent interactions with uh what might be termed as as entities or spiritual beans\nAnd that uh they have profound impact on us as a spiritual\nSpiritual beings ourselves in that those types of experiences or have the because of the profound impact of them have exactly the same effect as if you were run over by a Mack truck in the world so they should be paid attention to 'em and that's up to each individual as to what they do it at\nAll right this is for all three of you are in the process of learning or are in the process of remote viewing is there any danger to the remote viewer\n[noise] this is Paul I'm\nI don't think so I'm In my entire time with the program I never experienced myself or heard of anyone else experiencing anything that would be considered dangerous I Know there are claims out there to the contrary but ah um you know I I just don't know where that's coming from\nA well a dangerous to the psyche of the remote viewer in other words that you might see things for example that ah ah would drive a person over the edge\n[noise] uh this is land could I jump in here for a second\nYes um [noise]\nFor each person when you establish a sort of contact between your conscious and subconscious mind sometimes there are things that your subconscious unconscious have been waiting for Twenty years to say to each other and there's a period of time generally when a person gets very sensitive very a\nA reactive to things uh fly off the handle easily and so forth uh but that gets over with\nA any real danger that comes to a person I think is basically\nCaused by the fact that the subconscious is harboring a danger that is then let loose um\nI have never had any or even actually known any person who has had a a a remote you in session where the session itself or the target itself\nA had a had a danger to the viewer\nSo I think what you carry into the learning process for remote viewing may be a danger to you but that\nDangerous been there all along anyway I I'd like to add something to that when I I this is Joe I I agree with what when and a follow both said I've never had a bad experience and remote doing\nBut I Would like to uh underscores the fact that uh this is a very interesting um experience remote going or being psychic and there are a lot of people that\nAre that are on the edge to start with and when they're exposed to the changes their rather radical changes in their their beliefs or their construct\nOr it can be very undermining or damaging to the psyche\nAnd uh there is evidence that a lot of people do sort of step off the edge and lose touch with reality in other words they become a pretty much in in a involved there\nBut

by side with the dinosaurs\nOr I don't remember specifically getting that I have always felt that are a form of a man was yes uh-huh but uh that I didn't get that from remote viewing I got that from other studies that have done okay a simple archaeological findings\nAnd then you know good PS here a PS why can't remote viewers win lotteries and I'm a before you answer that I Would have answered a

on numbers which is a very hard thing to do in remote viewing a there is another type of remote viewing called alternate I mean I'm\nI'm about a A R B a alternate remote viewing uh which uh substitutes\nRemote viewing targets for the numbers oh and a allows you to a remote view for instance the pick three now the way that it's normally done is if you are doing to pick three\nYou have a four people working a three viewers\nEach of which will remote view one of the numbers and one\nPerson who collect the data looks on the chart to see what the results Maine and goes and places Tibet

we're really bogged down until we can get more votes years working on these so uh oh I Hope people won't be offended if um\nYou know if they call and uh have their police department call as well and uh nothing is done that day\nAh we have a we have tremendous backlog here\nCompletely understandable uh west of the Rockies you're on the air with Lynn Buchanan good morning\nI yes good morning on my credit for you know and I try to follow the law is a cover up a fake story that\nAll right I'm old that that is an awfully good question in other words could for example another group of remote viewers somehow trick you and cause you to see something that would be utterly inaccurate\nAre absolutely in fact one of the biggest problems in remote you and is that you tend to do that to yourself to begin with oh and there is a thing that a recall basically the neighbor's cat\nOh if or someone else whom you respect very much\nA does a session on a target and they're wrong it out of your respect for them you will tend to find the wrong thing is well this is one reason why I never\nUm a\nTask the same exact question to two different viewers who know each other\nWell this brings me back to it deems a tapes which generally the group earlier including you seem to agree might be or hopefully will be a good idea if it works\nIf it works then I'm all for it\nBut then on the other hand we all of those people out there remote viewing maybe even influencing\nThey're going to be a lot of mistakes made\nA lot of mistakes will be paid and couldn't there'll be assertive virtual anarchy that would develop\nMy fear I Do believe very strongly in the show direct effect and I know that the more people who learned to remote view correctly the easier it is to learn to remote view correctly\nThe more who learn to remote view incorrectly the easier it will be to learn incorrect excuse me incorrectly and\nThis is my big fear with many of the\nQuickie courses that are out there oh I'm afraid that they're going to through the shoulder to just uh you know the hundred lucky if you're a just a almost destroy any progress that's been made simply because it'll be easier to do it wrong\nYeah well what what was your initial reaction when you heard the videotapes were going to be released it a very or relatively comparatively inexpensive price\nOh well it was just that I really hope it works or if there's a way that we can uh get people doing this oh and doing it well then I'm all for it and if there's a way that we can make it available to more people I think that's great\nWell listen we're coming to the end of our actually the entire program uh\nYou've really been a trooper sticking it out through the whole program it's got to be a one of the sudden has to be back there

[noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis ... talking with Ben Radford been so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween\nIt really does have a um an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around the time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nGuy I think it was in a in Cleveland or Boston or something about two years ago and he went to the the um the police saying that that ... that he had found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\n... and ... when the police busted\nAnd he said well I was trying to make sure the kids do not just trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you\nThat actually I was\nJust such an offensive of like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and every year they X ray candies\nAnd it's I mean whatever if if it makes me I wanted for but\nI wanted to ask you that are still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray or candy I mean\nReally do you do people really go to\nThe emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist off\nAn X ray the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nIn for something like you know it's it's a piece of can't if you have any any doubt throw it out you know [laughter] yeah [laughter] I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it in a way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure it's okay but he did it just so they can feel the stuff that he wanted\n[laughter] where where are the ethics here was you know we need to go back to the days when people were coming for soles of of of you know predatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restriction of the British Isles\nAh and then it came over with the with the first and second wave of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact the you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the the trials be Haiti and they were they were dead set against Callaway and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years\nI'm a court before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy though have you you'd actually\nHave families coming together to make a kid's costume ...\nAnd what you find is that the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in about the Eighteen seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid in your plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it's it's big it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this was when you start getting adults who were you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or a drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you have Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know it's something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much can you really continue to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] [noise] well ah an estimate your question you know I think that um you know ... ...\nHalloween I mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we're with each interact with each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like arson and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on\nUm but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that that there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum ... who does like address how we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kids left just eighty year old kid like dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or you could you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual I'd go you know where you\nGot like holographic oh you've got to that you you got to fix that he was like this giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door and that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to ask them about the the panic part of it when we come back stay with\nUs you are listening because because I Am I'm tiny Willis and this is ... tonight\nNever missed a detail on a short just sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com\nAnd clear water mix and match classical and pops concerts like Beethoven symphony number five and Disney and concerts tale as old as time joined the Florida organ strip of the perfect season they just for you all I compose your own dot com\nOr selling what's new today on the free I our radio\nFor decorating the house or just sitting here in our mind you play ... with labor in mind when you know after your name\nIn swing break out all our great Delia ... whether you're at home or the stadium the new news\nRadio nine Seventy W.

origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um\nGoes goes hunting stuff so let's I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of\nGhost tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as\nI like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Dracula kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of Halloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness in St panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one little thing for I mean there's always going to be certain certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted house that you know reached out and grabbed her grow somebody or whatever I mean it's there are some of that but\nBut you know that's if for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean a a mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause a candidate because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nYou know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if if he if during the summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the idea what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nUm and and again you know the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course I mean you look at Texas is coming to a team\nYou know thou shalt not separate which to live um and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this is why a ... and it is of course not just Halloween that's that's one of the more uh obviously comes up\nEvery every year coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in or does it go investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to see James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking into ghosts and and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it it said a word you're bored or strictly prohibited anyone using a ... board will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so\nConcerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know do you want to ... or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rule if you will find this don't use it and so you\nKnow typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween it wasn't\nIt wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kids that were the concern came from and so it was ... and that a kid the dresses up as a witch or goal\nWill become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why or times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party\nSo the the the the the make a case to distinguish it from the dollar when the harvest party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was it was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in that like I said again you know black lights in the\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations that ... W H cable\nI was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and\nIt got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was a wacky haunted house\nThere was nothing nothing scary or it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy\nWhen it came to ... just the way it was right down the marathon\nBars on either right away I Am doing those\n[laughter] you'd freeze those have you ever had um frozen\n... they were great oh I'm taking you back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written or something yeah\nAnd the ruler on the back\nOh man I I mean anything Googled after we're done here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was lost USC McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way Yeah Yup yup yup\nNever on all the producers were were watching that cell or hey you guys are going on there now\nSo well\nKnowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say ten of part and all that good stuff\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets ... push by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of set the investigating and you know get the get the cameras on we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that\nThat in almost all cases they don't\nThey don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see a ghost undergoing location because team of them and do you know they'll take readings for three hours or sick or wherever else they'll go home and analyze them\nThe problem is that not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal abnormal you need to know what's normal\nAnd you know whatever reading as you get\nYour walking around with him after sector magnetometer whatever it is really as you get over that six hours that there can be normal variation that you want to do this you know only happens once a week or something [noise]\nThis is Benjamin Radford that we're talking to and we're

wean is what's going on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator and mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating dose\nThen that means that by definition their their material because you know\nSound is Adia waves and and you know hitting the eardrum and stuff and so you can pressing Adia waves and so\nSo that's that means that they they can be recorded\nUm on on you know audio tape and and and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used to detect ghost for the most part they are one of the the replicate what we can experience right we have what we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghosts because people do report seeing them people record you know if they're recording them [noise]\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... field detectors and the problem is that there's no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation\nBut but no one has ever proved that you know the location with high EMS\nUm correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person or a who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it\nUh and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science\nAnd goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think ... awesome [laughter] if they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want a you know we can talk about this forever but just for time saying I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but why why why what is it\nWell you know um I I don't know it goes or I mean that's that's you know of course that's that's the million dollar question right I mean you've even even among the the grossed hundreds unbelievers\nAcross the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their residual events that are you know the stone tape theory that there is something that's going on and\nThen there was some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone in treating the the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beings other people say that they're you know the spirit that that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions is\nProblematic for ghost research right because\nGoes can't be both inner dimensional spirits\nAnd you know a an emotional recording into a tree or house of murder and you know here's the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomena of it has such a widely disparate range of explanations that the problem so I I don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that\nThat my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore Rick explanation that would be there some sort of spears of the day that we\nWere we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nItself\nFor windows for Willis we thank you for getting the information you had in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can get a cute but are coming up we're going to be talking they wear will in London so you'll want to stick around in

C. or as I say this middle stone age just after the ice age people settled there and these people were just home together as they actually settled on flicks them stock or\nA it is now the lake he's gone now we've got is ... tend to be honest we have heard of cows run across stock or you can in certain places you can feel the ground reverberate because he's so ... ... ... to\nThe people I mean this is the evidence of ... the first house or home ever built by these early settlers in the U. K. and what was interesting in the research it turns out that the archeologists also found a red the skull caps in like a head dress\nWith holes in ... and and leather straps to all the mumble they believe that these early people or shame on on the practice to share my practice\nUh now I'm not saying that is the reason we have the stories of the flexed and well we'll put it is interesting that when you sort of cast your mind to was the transformation into other animals and other base the as they started combing through\nFrom these early people I mean I think we have to consider these things as I say I don't particularly think as a person running rounding ... palms howling the moon bought I bought one hundred percent believe that the people who've come forward and told me the stories of ...\nAre telling the truth I mean\nIf you like a refuge was built county in the ... century I took place called ... calling a inflicts than\nIt was built by a king all this can be research listeners you know it's not just things that poll is made up a and the king was stunned and he ... he gave a night the job of building the refuge\nAnd the night it's a fabulous name what's called a song so he built this refuge to protect tropical travelers from an infestation of Savage based\nInteresting\nYeah it's fabulous some spots where the name spittle hospital comes from which was built to that's why they call it splits O'Connor\nOr at least they be devoured I I was lucky enough to contact the people in our own with what is now the ... in ... after they've been stopped cease to be in a refugee hundreds of years ago because they supposed to nine\nFifty seven so this refuge was built so we're going back a long way obviously not far back as the early settlers of stock or\nA bill ... but he was due to protect travelers from an infestation of Savage beast\nLeast they be devoured it said now I look to that dates and the ... some of the days of them ... and that's what it says under is documentation on the line that you'll find that says this\nWe we must also not forget Coney that you know during this time we will divide wolves prevalent\nIn the u._k. and bad so you know ... we're not necessarily to an entirely talking about two ... foot this these stories that are quite incredible because when you look at the line and you can you go into the research you discovered the flakes

make it like like maybe be seen safer\nOr something or they didn't want people to think of the old miss maybe or you know why would someone changed the name I mean that was like ooh there's a reason why it was a name that\nYeah well there's a reason and we'd go connotations to the world for you know in any case it is true with proper research this that that can be sort of back to pre if anyone else wanted to look into it\nSure you know there's a there's a small village just a few miles away called home to ... and if you break down the name\nAnd then go back in history and look we'll do some

I mean it's an interesting story\nHe said it was with a friend said need noted for the past week or two weeks that something was ripping the proud to be snazzy what might it might snow to catch the ... and the has and the other game small game\nAn ... ice is profit so to Britain ... born and bred and he's with what he what rocky and I'm Out too much snow as\nYou said but we couldn't swallow he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing a sudden there was still a bit of snow on the ground you could see such a rose or they ... as you look you know if it was a very open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us it's friend who was doing but poaching\nIn the daytime from the lodge hedge hole forms and things about he said he probably eight to ten foot tall\nAnd he ... he took to turn around to speak to his friend and caught this thing and is peripheral vision and then looked and saw it on the left over the head ... he said he thought he was a young hopes it meant horse so ... H older bless you should have thought he want to go off at first\nI couldn't believe what I was looking out so what we're saying is this thing was as big as a small town it or you know your horse\nHe said and the interesting thing was he left over the edge and just landed he said wait I expect to host a London move forward because the momentum this thing just one that I'm stuck like a magnet\nSudden something not to be made to look at that\nHe said he was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he said he led them before they run away he said what he was on all fours\nAnd he said if it to the store to open to the being over seven Fulton looked like a body builder I said you know it's a tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of about ...\n... ... ... words and he said he ... people don't know sort of Britain drilling cola you know like a box that dog all the stuff that you both areas\nAnd not what he ... he says well he said I went to him to the edge booked him to try and get fence stave it's just to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covert crossing the field and into the world\nOr what quite incredible um you know ... miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast Coney but if you if you go further down the coast to watch a whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was a beast of bumps and drain that were featured in the u._k. papers quite often\nAnd it was such a supposed to be aware of that was sort of going the bombs to train runs into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we'd go this way will type creature reported but moving along the coast and if you go further up the coast you got\nOld folklore and old legend old legends of dogs with glowing red eyes the ... bay and raven Scott ... they took them ...\nAnd you know these stories have to have that they've come down to being hunted down in time ... there's just I think there's grains of truth in the stories so that was the site thing in the Nineteen seventies and he lived in Britain do all his life and he's never seen it since\nNever seen it before that and he'd never seen it after that which is quite incredible if this thing I Believe his story but if this thing was native to that savvy you would think that they'd be more evidence of it so why are we only seeing small glimpses of it caught me\nIn a mate yeah and that's what you're saying that they pop in and they pop out along the way kind of like when I talked to people before uh we had um a friend\nOf mine Laurie Williams she's a remote viewer in I Would have heard target big flood and and she targeted she mentioned how they they are actually didn't know what it was you know she used to looking at this esoteric target that I gave her and she's talking about how they had these portals\nAnd they were in time warps and and they would just go through one time warp and then another and you just see them when they pop into that particular one you know we're we're a human would see him\nUm I find I find it also interesting\nAh when you were saying that Ari yeah is there the world's oldest the operational read our base is right there and all this area where all this crazy stuff happens and I think I remember seeing a funny\nThat might be my phone about a coats out people just it does it's cutting in and out\nNo well is showing no ... it's all now I'm a I'm Sorry about this listener has to do you want me to hang up and you touch me back because of the\nPiano will well you're flying right now for sure and will do that at the break for sure but yeah but I can hear you but again I think it\nI think it's very strange it is operational radar base the oldest one is in the midst of all of these happenings that you're talking about\nThat is correct Tony ... and Joe ... briefly jumping to them to the animal mutilation is taking place\nBut then there's a radar based there which was eleven miles from Stockton world as the crow flies and that one's closed that one closed about seven pick to officially said sixty eight but he was still operational up ... to Seventy two [noise]\nAnd that's on the edge of the north sea audio ... and\nAll the ... the ...\nOkay now he's gone [laughter] so we'll definitely contacting back on one of his other phones and he has there isn't that crazy brand new song a brand new batteries and it goes out\n... strange isn't it when we talk about some of these things that\nI don't know I don't know\n... and the story [laughter] Willis weaned\nContinues here on coast to coast am I'm Connie Willis and we've got ...
