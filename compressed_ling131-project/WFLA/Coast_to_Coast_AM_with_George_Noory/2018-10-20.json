colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analysts\nGroup and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us\nNational security adviser John Bolton is reportedly are pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nOf course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I enough treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that a wave tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria now of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty two new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow ... concern to solve it you know that is cutting back dramatically\nA nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a port strategic warheads in about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviet from the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to a joint we had a commission on military technology um that is of course being shared a\nSignificantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the ...\nEighteen exercises you indicate I had three hundred thousand\nSoldiers thirty six thousand a armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia straight at the United states now\nPracticing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the north\nKorean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War when President Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated\nSome might suggest that the United states was poking the bear and given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation um coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest as perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's a after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back\nAgainst the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes ah\nThat's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\nYeah this past march you know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that who is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\n[noise] you're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political corporation a predatory economics strategic extortion\nInformation warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and\nThere was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently and their parents ministers just met you know for taking time over the

space or satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just\nThe military it's economic it's diplomatic ah it's\nAll these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world and you ... on the distribution of dissemination of information or appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and is helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population\nAnd of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things on the use of the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and not become a pawn in\nThe hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're doing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of a the success of that\nA country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so now they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar under ...\nWith the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because uh the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states or to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course they could show the um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm [noise] and how that might\nMean there is there are dominoes at play here obviously I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his little Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that their cars so sugary situation is is tragic\nBut if you've been watching Muhammad then psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nThe so called Davos and the the desert which uh he was expecting all these uh donors and investors to come over and had him on the back and giving more money so they can develop a a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course now they could go to the Chinese are Russians but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nOn it and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with and of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians in Chinese or a lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm there were ... they they've got a you have a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west where not all excited about uh but the reality is that um\nYou know a friend of my you know my friend you know what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is my friend or something like that that the idea being that\nWe we have to

Decatur\nA destroyer a in the grave and reefs in the south China Sea the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos that flew over um you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these pilots uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and defense weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers with the practice from\nThat these are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nThe Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air is indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we kill a couple of hundred and\nIt's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we call them and said\nAre these your troops and they said no and so we've killed them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians white their hands of that even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any time scenario or is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into says ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the the ... bag a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president of turkey is really a seeks to be the leaf and\nTo establish a Calif out and his statements have been\nVery very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but you know the release of the American pastor Brunson here recently was after great pressure we put on him a air do on a to cooperate with us but yet\nWe find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places Kern cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing his state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA and he consistently has had over the years of very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so\nThese are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nUh and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a lot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the pitcher to gather\nYou see the Iranians certainly the Turks are sort of our allies\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country wants a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou making her to one and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know that's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her want her to one didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait\nUm air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the F for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the med from the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to Iran\nAnd on the coastline there then you can begin to make a plutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants to\nAlternately ... it's just too rich so the the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO a sensibly used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that you know because we will not connect our patriots and other fat to a Russian as four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nEither are reports of closure due to an
