Parkinson's disease\nOr the ... and of course in parking disease MS Lou Gehrig's disease hunting is these are all kinds of the same diseases different parts of the brain are randomly or more severely deficient in things and you get different symptoms based on the different part of the brain is more severely affected\nAnd so what I like to do for people with essential tremors were those diagnosed with Parkinson's easily essential tremors an matter billionaires come from all over the world for me to treat them for those need to get rid of all the bad stuff no fried foods and processed meats no

Seventy that when you add ballet one oh two point nine south Tampa [noise]\n\n\nThan walking back to coast to coast limbic Tiger Woods Lin is one of the central voices in the new consciousness movement she's the author of several great books including the field and the intention experiment in her latest the power of eight\nLynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I did an intention a bit when several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas uh the topic could hit as a category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down in the you hit a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens it work sending\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep fit uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now we've run about thick piece intentioned experiments trying to lower violence um last September we ran a six day experiment\nTo lower violence in the violent place in America which is believe it or not at a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri yes\nAnd we calculated the results Georgia and it was amazing um we looked at and I had a professor of statistics look at it from the University of California\nAnd she saw that crime went up in St Louis is a whole property crime went up in St Louis has a home property crime went out went up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent for before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so it's going on\nHere what do you think this is what people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the field but what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy\nAnd our thoughts are another kind of energy when there are worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I run thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make it grow faster\nTo purify water to healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and\nYou know of the thirty three twenty nine shown measurable positive significant effect\nDecided to walk into a trend that the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug has a good record is that in terms of studies so\nAs I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seem to be created that has great power to change things\nNow maybe he'll think the experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\n[noise] yeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries\nI was working with a guy who's like the Deepak of the middle east and also a very prominent is rarely a documentary producer so we had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know it's the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know I'm just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know ... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was\nAmazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic and it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does added to play ... in the if you're a beach in positive move that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we did an intention once for a kid cold Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide he threw himself off of\nForty foot structure after his he broke up with this for a serious\nGirlfriend and he'd broken everything he had brain damage he had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents believe and the power of intention was pretty stupid\nSo it worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of of Arizona noted psychologist and a Jessica us who is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable and then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up\nAnd with some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seat experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientists didn't know which ones who were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that\nThey really helped me set up because they're the scientists and then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or own Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results and the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's gone on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nNow loom the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group the test why ... why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] will the town of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of\nNo delays north bound or southbound on Seventy five but a nice round and I board you're traveling to Plant City but like when all the way through to be early and do area now still getting a fortune high winds on the sunshine skyway bridge you some extra caution is you're making your way from knowledge through the managing\nNo reported problems on the court to gamble God's way my major's rare news radio nine Seventy WFL like\n[noise] Soviet degrees are\nForecast lows doing pretty good breathe some do some gusts overnight\nAnd a brief passing shower eighty nine degrees were high on Thursday plenty of clouds around about a forty percent chance of rain overall\nOr friday dryer with more sunshine ten percent chance of a shower eighty eight degrees so I'm very dry air for Saturday morning we're talking about lower humidity alone sixty eight degrees or Saturday eighty seven for a high more some beautiful day\nWest Wing Fifteen Nazis four to six moderate choppy waters I'm just generally cheap and religious the derby for news radio nine Seventy WFL a\nFox News I'm Harmon Roberts frightening tales of survival during hurricane Michael\nThe roof ripped off um it was sold out of there and when the when I was like pulling out of that little room\nMadman and an elderly neighbor took shelter in a bathroom shower and Michael hit the Florida Panhandle yesterday with one hundred and fifty five mile an hour winds downed trees killed at least two people ... near Tallahassee and an eleven year old girl and Seminole county Ga near the floors align\nThe sharp sell off in Wall Street and the Dow plunging aged thirty one point spreads to Asia Stockton China plunged ... percent today in Japan they fell down nearly four percent Stockton Europe already down one cent yesterday's downturn was broad base there\nNow is Dr ...

marks\nAnd she's down through last two hundred dollars and she suddenly here from Lloyd's of London ... she had been a former employee to say that she could get a special amount of money because she had been part of this again out of the blue\nSo this happens so often that it has convinced me it's not just luck is not just happenstance\nAnd you know universities are studying the power they what are they doing\nWell we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same it all brain state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and granddaughter\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its identical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this hot largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nearest scientists and we're planning a study or with their biology department to looking at the immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this\nI'm the one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with ... with the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's\nThe longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's and it has a\nEffect on\nUm things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we we actually get healthier\nBut the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like a ... so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be ... that would be an interesting experiment\nWill you know we're doing one this that this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in\nThe mail is county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence\nBut we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards\nYou talked about a mirror of what is that\nWell the mere fact to me was the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing affects among the receivers of stuff and the receivers of the big intentioned experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened\nThe participants in these intentioned experiments so when\nWe started doing these these experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and were they able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly I asked them how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like this\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek remember these are people who are participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners they were getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with so that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect\nAnd when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful so in a way that's\nProbably the most the most\nPowerful part of the intention experiment if not the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation in what happens to those people it changes their lives being part of that\nWhen we're gonna come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for you as we talk about the power of aid but we'll

I've had young people I've had older people and it it works for them I think it's all about\nUsing the techniques\nThat I teach you know in becoming a master in tender essentially knowing how to really focus your mind knowing how to what kinds of things do you intend for and how to do it but\nAlso being part of that group and Jeff meeting regularly and I think it's that meeting regularly that does the trick I mean there's a guy called Michel Dean I write about my book who is a clinical psychologist\nBut suffered from depression which such so bad that it was often suicidal that's not a good calling card for a psychologist\nSo he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression and he couldn't and so being part of the group they intended for that\nAnd what they intended for was that he would find the source of these in these depression and soon after that he got a brain wave to go to a Chinese herbal is\nWho worked out that one of his liver filtration systems wasn't working and he went and got tests and they confirmed that he that he was right and as soon as that was treated his depression completely lifted\nBut the really interesting part of Michel story is what happened over the year not only did that happen but he ended up going back to his fighting weight loss wait he got back to his you know his is wait that he was as a young man\nHe um he is chi gung practice he was practicing chi gung that Gump better he got a writer's block and was able to start writing again um he also developed something to help other people with I think it's with depression is special\nI'm a special kind of technique\nAnd everything in his life with getting better and even his training you know his his um his trainer at the gym and said to him\nWhat are you doing man you're exercising less and you're more fit what's going on with you and it was like everything in his life was starting to improve but he he was one of the people who met religiously\nAnd in fact one of the guys in his group Robert became a really really close with him even though they'd never actually physically met\nAnd there were times when Mitchell would say you know\nI had insomnia last night and couldn't sleep and Robert said don't worry man I had you covered and he was intending for him to have a you know to to sleep better and so knowing you've got that constant support is really strengthening in every way\nOver the year when when you do these intention not experiments but when you do these intentions to do something what do they do actually I mean you sit there and think I mean what what do they do\n[noise] okay well there's a lot of little techniques that make you a good in tender I mean you know the popular view is that you just have to think about it and believe it ... as long as your eyes or whatever you do\nYeah um but it's you know one thing to really keep in mind Georgia's that were intending all the time [laughter] you know and we sabotage most of our intentions we we think that we're just having\nYou know we we have a meditation in the morning we do a little power thought and that the power thought is the thing that's our intention and that's the only thing the universe is going to hear but\nUm as I wrote about my book the field\nYou know we are and knitting energy all the time we're meeting a tiny current of light all the time and our thoughts are another part of that kind of mission and we're we're kind of leaky buckets we're we're broadcasting twenty four seven\nAnd so if we have this one little power thought saying I'd like to have this\nUm but the rest of the time we're thinking no it can't possibly come to pass or on such a loser or I don't like my hair or whatever you know were sabotaging it and so one of the things you have to do is get used to really having a focused mind a sense of positivity\nBut probably the most important thing of all that no one ever thinks about it being specific um\nYou really have to direct yourself to a ... don't you\nYeah I mean most people think about you know we'll all do something and general in the universe fulfilling the gap and that's a big mistake because
