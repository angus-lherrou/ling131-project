my alarm weekdays at six AM to play ninth Saturday WFL a\nAnd when you see these videotape episode you see how completely different they looked than the rest is still black and white but they do not have that film work field to them that he filmed episodes do and so if you take that up a notch and make it color than to get done you're completely in another universe and you're not for me you're not in the twilight zone anymore\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out and color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately what was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called my gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even hitched it he's the one who probably pitched it to the network will I bring all the\n... after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say oh you know rod would have done this or\nYou know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow can we never wrote a book\nWell he never wrote a novel he did write your collections of short stories ... sure but I mean the closest the ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually the stories that made up tonight\nMovie uh they originally were in the valley as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary\nI'm ... but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells me I he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away a for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be a ... to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out\nOr is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for it where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise]\nYou know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows the to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are they can be reenter reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't a rod surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was in a lot of people still still are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for it on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling [noise] ah so he did get coal credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of\nYou know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I I clarify in the book\nSome of his is shows whether it was not gallery or twilight zone had in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a heat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also a very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nOr documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess minus commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said they're so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to\nThrow a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype all you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know really this youth and go back to a easier less stressful\nLife was that the Willoughby or it's just like well yeah it's kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to its well distance\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that was a big theme to Serling was this idea of going back to his innocent youth and bring him to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was the classic a\nMan is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know they that's\nEver [laughter] and then it just so many good the what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and starve to ever Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine thinks is taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah\nFor the next day with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next

watching television what what do you say about the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nThat seems like it was very escapist\nWell then maybe someone stay back in the sexes so I'm just speculating if you had a job and he came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really light that my second question would be about the mysterious endings which\nHe really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for free for people or people at the college or or local businesses and I mean as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and and you know going through his\nCorrespondence erupt showing kept everything he ever ever sent ... every

about every two months\nYou know every one of these shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of his experiences at a combat soldier during World War two and which I you know it was all about uh the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd the everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes it's hard to say which is my favorite but I think it had to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber coming home from Italy crashes in the desert\nThe capital of that airplane didn't go on that mission for whatever reason which was Robert Cummings Bob comings I'm Sorry and Bob coming it's just happened to be walking by and seen this newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert\nAnd he went back in time or you went back to the desert in his mind\nAnd we lived experience even though he didn't fly that mission you know and or any I ended up in a hospital room\nAnd haven't psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him they had a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock\nOf seeing an airplane on the newspaper just recently you know and when they when the show ended close to the ending of it the nurse bodies clothing out there and she said well there's sand in his shoes\nAnd so somehow or another he really transport himself back in time to be twenty five ... crashed you know struggle with those shows that ... day and\nThey had a time machine you know one of 'em this guy a you know way back in time three different times and he thought he would try to alter events that took place one of them was just thinking of the Titanic\nThe guy went back tried to tried to change that well he failed\nYou know at one time you went back and tried to stop the uh Japanese from being annihilated in Hiroshima trying to warn them that didn't do any good he got thrown in jail for his efforts on that so I went back and he ended up in Nazi Germany that already thought he could alter that event\nCourse but a man I don't know we it they'd be August say which me my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story the guy that played art Carney\nPlayed the ah Santa Claus in a department store and the call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all\nTimes the guy was all a shrine [laughter]\nWhen he got a break from the department store he went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was to grow up man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down he went in the back out and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bag just all of a sudden became full of gifts instead of a you know and pecans\nMan he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story you know and the guy who ran the department store\nThey found car well given these gifts out at this a place like a John ... mission type place you know policeman comes and goes where did you get all these gifts if you've got a receipt for all these gifts blah blah blah and he goes no I just\nI found the bag and the give strength and I'm just giving them out thinking that the police station and the department store owner came in there and so yeah there it is there is the merchandise call well you're the ... by you know\nAnd ah the guy's name was Mr done a department store owner right and uh and they need to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but empty cans in Iraq\nAnd so they had to let him go of course the store owner sitting here scratching your head the policemen scratches it couldn't figure out where all those gift recover from it they were coming out that bag\nSo just before they released a coal oil Santa Claus he raced in the bag and grab a bottle of wine Nineteen thirty three and handed it to Mr gundy\n[noise] you know said merry Christmas and\nBoth of them got pre pre toasted on the wine and they walked outside and they seemed Santa Claus flying overhead and a slave with reindeer\nLaw and ... and that right there just catches my heart Everytime\nI live in you as you mentioned something about cans and remember kick the can Nicholas\nOh sure sure yeah kick the can and that was actually re made in this well its own feature film as well about a a old old folks home where a ... one of the old one of the people there and wants to get the get the residents to kick the can to feel young again and of course they do become young again my point kick the

oh yeah oh\nI had al ... mental saying Willie Mays I haven't had 'em all\nTo myself I used to put those cards and my bicycle spokes\n[laughter] I had to duplicate so we did it with the duplicates remember\nYeah with the duplicates in generally your head like I had Fifteen Pete Rose rookie card to his\nI ran into the rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles and the ... what would those cards you've been worse if you'd given them the him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help devalue very much probably it would hurt the value you don't want to do that with you know you're better off having them sign a napkin\nYeah exactly now old football cards and stuff are they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do little things a little different than the average\nThe guy you'll make a little extra money right where everybody's\nOn the baseball cards that nobody's buying football cards which means you should be\nEyeing football kind of interesting to write\nBasketball cards I once saw a guy who had a complete [noise] he had Michael Jordan rookie cards that before they cut the cards it's called the big
