did [noise]\nBut you see what I'm saying so so this scientific argument against going to Mars is absurd and ... and and this idea that we'll know more about Mars by not going is just crazy uh because I mean what planet do we know the most about\nWhatever happened to the plan's your plans to tour for Mars and to try to develop an atmosphere\n[noise] well uh terra forming Mars is something that is is going to have to be done in the future it it it's not something that a frankly our generation is going to do it\nAnd it could take what are you are a hundred years to complete\nNo it will take longer than that although I'm basically here's how it goes first we're in our time we can send human explores tomorrow we can set up the first basis on Mars and I'm hoping to be alive when the first child was born on Mars okay\nThat's what I'd like to see the first\nOh what a birth certificate that would be\nYeah there you go right okay so the first child born on Mars that\nIs when we're really they're okay but after that we're going to have to grow a you know settlements towns cities on Mars create industry is on Mars once that it's done which might be\nA hundred years from now [noise] um once you have a strong industrial civilization on Mars they can actually address the question of trying to change the climate of Mars and change the environment because first thing you got to do with Mars is you want to warm it up\nAnd we know how to warn planted some proven that right now on earth and if we wanted to do it on purpose we could do it a lot more effectively\nAnd uh the way to do it is to produce greenhouse gases um that is that tramp the sun's heat a they're a seal too of course is a greenhouse gas but we know how to make gases that are much more powerful greenhouse gases and C. O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carping gases or we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um\nThe the uh but we didn't put them in such machines and said we just released them to the atmosphere and we were producing with the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh\nAnd if you warmed to Mars that much that warming\nItself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the soil because it's been ... and it would outcast and it would thicken the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt ... and this was much glee freshwater in those glaciers is there is in North\nAmerica oceans fall I bet\nWell planet why\nThere is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise]\nUm and the the um [noise] but yes the waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Marshall struck to flow the lakes and seas which Dr phil up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick C. O. two atmosphere liquid water rain and then you could start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to breathe the all\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be terrified and within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do a thorough what country\nBut the Martians are\nThey're going to do with themselves no when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watches those are you assess and they bring us back\nA while most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple of cosmonauts an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing\nI'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people [noise] um I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my guess Chinese though because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy\nUm but Russia\nThe issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nAnd because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country and uh the the uh and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing [noise] um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour

get to calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\n[noise] well [noise] I'd say China right now I'm\nIs about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven [noise]\nUm I mean in terms of manned space flight you know they've been to earth orbit they\nI mean there are a bit beyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they didn't want a small space station which we could not having them\nAnd do they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon mhm um\nThey can have it pretty soon I mean but the thing is this okay\nOnce again um there's a new paradigm now and then these are ... space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can do in one third the time at one tenth the cost and if\nUh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with understanding that they're going to need to have a rule of law there they cannot have a government at simply steals\nWhole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh solely once Russia to remain a I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first\nClass power of choice or you have to be first class in space um\nRussia is going to have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a a reason is a ... in a certain I mean ... ... the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy west and the twentieth century you illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to launch a weapon or something like that\nWell I'm a I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or\nThe um [noise] you know\nI'm all us where you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well the states that one weapons okay I mean 'cause what after all is a state but it is\nA a military force that exists well ah the presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh you\nKnow if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just be the rich that get to go to Mars well um [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um\nAnd also I think that um you know if they open the path\nTo the moon and Mars\nIt will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiffs walk to go\nAnd um you know once upon a time you really had to to to be in\nThe high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into [laughter] and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're we're going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now that there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing proposed and that can operate at those speeds\nA bake launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not the feel if you can get the oxygen from the air with only a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a\n... you know the next new kid on the block who may uh you know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion to orbit\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because\nYou know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in

ahead Rob a okay\nAll right ah well here's the thing\nUm [noise]\nThere there isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a going off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and you can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this\nAnd and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe\nThat while we get destroy some things that were worthwhile we created much more and I would not undo the settlement of America\nBut on Mars there are no Indians there are no buys\nIn hurts there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there but nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks or nobody be picketing Columbus Day parade today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things

coast to coast George ... with you and our guest Brandon ... with us Brandon is a clinical therapist author purer psychologist residing in the northeastern section of Ohio\nHe has a graduate degree in clinical counseling from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on EMS environmental sensitivity in ghostly encounters\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the ghost studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy guy shot in a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a go for the parasite college even before I was actually a clinical therapist\nUh-huh yeah so it it actually I actually got a day job and then I study the psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way it's not very well [laughter]\nThat's good well let's see they they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when apple was for a year in ... at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nSo tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies book but to give us an overview of what you've been doing Brandon\n[noise] well um\nKnow I uh I have a degree in Paris psychology or when I was at University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically if the environmental sensitivity and goats encounter um and then when I got back here to this day I got back into the clinical part a thing\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in and writing a book and that's when I came out with a ghost studies\nAnd you know I'm sure listeners to your show no it's um no mystery that scientists sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes by encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as aloof nation interpretations are overactive imagination which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounter kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just go stories\nTales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes the encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights and the cause that he's throwing encounters\nUm it the book comes up with concise and competing theory and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years and if and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there are several firsthand accounts of goes the encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting first hand account of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes all the conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities\nAnd that's what I came up with somebody maybe theories\nAre and that's where I came out with a book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews I witnessed the cow and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories of five and I also review the right the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters well\nThen you bring a dose of real science to the picture your brand and then I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think\nSo too I mean the great thing is is out there you just got to look a little bit harder\nUm the journal article a pair of psychological journal articles and even some great you know I'm narrow psychology a fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and I'm In tangle man and non locality\nOut electricity affects us and I'm ... and what it does outside the body so\nThere's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article it kind of like a boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWould have you concluded today branded about what this ghostly experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nThink um ... majority of it goes the encountered that that are out there I Believe are there is some paranormal phenomenon happening um\nYou know I think that when it comes to ghostly encounters it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on um but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine\nAnd um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever\nBut I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them one of the\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take them more by side based view on goes so that's um inside is basically\nTelepathy extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of ghostly counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em are coming in being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on\nMy main theories in the book go over um what I call a a tele Patrick distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's telepathy a is a real or it was a real important part of it goes way and count\nHow important is the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um it's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters\nBut I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghostly encounters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death or life threatening events or some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters\nA so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it's sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happened after that and one of those things is um\nYou know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress trauma life threatening or going to have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these by energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers\nSort of our innate ability to send\nA distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and the great classic example of this is that the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these\nThis is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an operation of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying\nYou know my aunt passed\nAway right on time that I've had that and I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying I somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distressing they'll saying to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are are vying mentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\n\n[noise] New Year's primary whether by hard

this is a common one that I'm hearing more and more about and it's the idea of\nWormholes portal pensions um and and that sort of under special conditions I'll call them goes enter into our universe I'm so\nIn this example the witness in a sense was able to access the previous time dimension universe and she was able to look back and see what's happening that location and maybe the child and the mom saw this woman dressed and futuristic ... futuristic clothing and got\nTerrified and ran away so it's almost like a glimpse into something else and a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nDo you ever when you're doing these ah these studies have you ever encountered something where you'd even scared to death\nI'm personally no I haven't been scared that legit I had an experience I'm\nA I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio and\nI'm a\nOne morning a me and my wife was out of town and I'm One morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon\nAnd I said why is why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching they get outside\nSo I'm like yeah you know my scientific brains going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it\nYou know and I'm like you know what I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this\nSo I open the door the dog and me went outside in the backyard and she's sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I thought something like in the pond floating\nAnd I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and somehow um you know drowned in\nThere by you know I dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter] but I find myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but something drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing\nI never got that feeling of that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept that asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd with there's some sort of like distress signal sent to me with the cat and distress and they've kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kinda like this so many cool things happen there it's really amazing experience\nHow many paranormal experiences occur Brandon because the person who\nDied who comes back\nNever had some unfinished business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI you know I don't know a percentage on that um\nI I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there\nOf ghost encounters have to do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like a staff of a father or something right\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these motions happening um so you know the body sort of the the electricity\nOr the emotion signify a psychological injury and that's sort of sets in motion a plan to sort of ... this psychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means you know and if if collective unconscious or collective consciousness exist and memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere\nUm you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be fat I'm at a better place you know and\nAnd I think the things I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty\nPercent of the huge no yeah\nYeah and and perhaps these bereavement operations er visits from the deceased shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way the\nProcess of emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased couldn't help us move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards resolution and ... ... and when I talk to this these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one death after the evaporation\nAnd I think on TV usually ghost or negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive I'm can come out of it goes the encounter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is\nSomething to look forward to it's just not all negative and demons and things like\nA friend and what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these guys reparations encounters the others what's so special about that\n[noise] that is a that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think you know something narrow biologically is different about them\nYou know when they put 'em there's there's some tests out there specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nThat like human magnets or something\nYeah yeah exactly you know I ... the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing if this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's\nSome some really unique experimental designs that um you know where they're actually doing ... FM our eyes any jeeze and what they're finding is their their\nBrain is actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity at very low levels so there's some\nSort of objective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can't\nYou know so and this is true for which we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that throughout all rise as well so you you you know I might get\nPoked with a pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really that\nDoesn't hurt at all say with those brand and we're going to talk more when we come back we'll also take phone calls get another couple of stories of some of your studies when we come back\n... two nights just log on to ... dot com [noise]\nEleven\nPark in St Petersburg featuring sign are you Kansas\n\nBare naked ladies man in so many\nBut a couple of months and she when I talked about you getting your hair back with something brand new\nTampa hearing D. dot com my good friend Dr bashing and crew it ... your call eight five five two three four here now why would you want to make that code number one you want to get your number two\nYou want to find out about the new non surgical stem cell hair restoration sorry you think the region and the power of your own stem cells to grow areas\nIt's amazing and it's cutting edge along with Neil ... which is the procedure I had there is no linear garlic the old days back to work the next day free artist the robotic system [noise]\nNews radio seventies WFL lazy [noise] and you know when you went to the Clearwater [noise]\nDigging into the deaths of ...

ballet one oh two point nine cell Tampa\n\n\nAnd we'll come back to ... with us we'll get your goals as well as we talk about his worst the scientific work the ghost studies what are your colleagues say about your work and if anything\nI'm you know most people actually when they find out that you wrote a book about ghosts and are interested in plug for the inside most people will tell me a story [laughter] and\nThey will not one don't think they do and I was really shocked that\nYou know 'cause you're kind of sit back and kind of weight when you put yourself out there publicly but it's really been positive\nYou know there's a there's still some colleagues who come up to a man go you know I don't tell me a story but then they you know follow it up with but you can't tell anyone or anything like that\nBut the response has been pretty positive I'm you know if it's something that's really fascinating and it's I mean it's a mystery and it's been intriguing for human since you know the dawn of time you know does\nThis go stuff sure I'm so ... you\nKnow it's not that bizarre or out of context of anything and listen I mean parents psychology is a subset of psychology it's a legitimate discipline just like social psychology and neuro psychology\nAn academic field you know the University of Edinburgh or I studied as a top twenty five university they are the ones that clone sheep and the nineties Charles Darwin went there and they have a whole department dedicated to studying pair of psychology or paranormal phenomenon which is for\nThose of us in the field it's you know that's a great thing it's taken seriously for a lotta people\nWhat's up to that has baffled you show for brand and you don't have the answers you wish you did\nA while I'll be honest with you I think or any type of um\nHold your guys activity are recurrent spontaneous psycho ... says where objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on in those types of cases\nYou know if they do humans have the ability to move objects if they're um in distress um you know to me it's hard to fathom you have the ability of like where the poultry guys I'm\nA you know we'll call it a ghost moving objects when they can physically touch them and things like that I really don't know the answers to that um so you know it's it's something I always read about and I go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nWhy new rules seem to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMr Bush or something else to give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours I could not fall asleep when I could not understand why I was very anxious and felt as if something was not right\nWithout warning a soft glowing light appeared next to my bed the light gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband he did not say anything and appear to be just staring at me\nWhat was bizarre was that I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious the next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child standing my accent died the night before unexpectedly his death occurred around the same time I saw the image in my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time\nSo this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked\nAbout earlier so\nWe've all heard of these but it it illustrates the role of a lot but the or a sigh phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing a tense emotional shift related to the process of dying in a in a way sent a\nHello Patrick distress message to his ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witnessed I'm the typical soft glowing light operation or those types of things um and what's really fascinating is since his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or pull up to the er ... phenomenon by suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of a in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment\nA message hello path ugly if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the wife may know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well but this is a great example of a crisis aberration sigh phenomenon but also begs the question you know was this\nDid this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment because obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do with this is well\nOh yeah yeah I it's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal and um or goes way encounters electricity and it seems to be\nYou know the most prevalent things but the the idea is I mean listen we're we all thanks electricity comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but\nYou know electricity electrical fields comes from humans as\nWell an animal sure does you know any involvement of humans also includes the involvement of electricity because like your city is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nI've heard of people who walked by street lights and the lights go out and then as they get on a on a range the lights go back on again\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone is walking around in a way\nUm so it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only constant it all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being presidents to sort of experience that operation a portrait guy so an eerie feeling a temperature change an uneasiness or whatever\nSo for humans always present electricity electrical fields magnetic field they're always president as well just since the first go counter ever\nUm you know ... and that's an important thing to think about it you know we're always immersed in electromagnetic fields we can avoid them you know as as part of earth that's what it is\nYou know any amount of always been linked now there's some research saying that you know abnormal or fluctuating am apps can actually cause a ghostly encounters um you know sort of trick the brain into thinking you're having a ghost encounter on the other side of that\nThere was this idea that you know electromagnetic fields have to do with with ghosts and goes encounters of you know every TV show and paranormal investigator team uses a EMS meter and that's an important part of for them indicating that a ghost is president\nYou know for the EMS as moving haphazardly through the house like a person walking the belief is obviously that that that goes a whereas if you have a fluctuating\nOf ten percent chance at a shower that otherwise hype
