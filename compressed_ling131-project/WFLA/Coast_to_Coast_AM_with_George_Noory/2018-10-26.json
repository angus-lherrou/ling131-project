H. D. professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nHere and now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nProtests around simply calls the planet nine because he's the astronomer they got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades\nIt was twenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called Eris out in the ... rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that put our should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to a dwarf planet in the hyper belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery\nIt's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the hacking Subaru observatories in Hawaii to find planet nine invisible light and or infrared professor brown says that it is quote till like chasing I'd go\nAfter more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet can be only seven times more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this lose save planet nine or planted act that he uh is it still trying\nTo mine and he told me that he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to eventually get to this big ... serious math because they've been working on computer refinement\nAnd for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun\nSo that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than ... June ... good way out there but they have narrowed down the focus so he has deliberately going on November first started another surge because the new calculations\nPredict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California is astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system perturbations and even just in the plane of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly ... direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized it'd be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new plan of nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive this is what we mean when we say a planet and the other part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might just have come from why use this massive object all the way out to the edge of the type rebel going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or that it was inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition of\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with so many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like not to we think it's a ... tune like planets just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clones it's probably too cold have any close up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be sings about it that we never even thought about that are completely pros and\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter like ... it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we know don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where the border we thought was ... because we don't know what is beyond the planet and we don't quite know how the planet is affecting what this border is\nAt the carving one thing that we\nCan get me talking about a Trump planet but in the can of worms and letting guy\nTo hold on right there in

LA every day at six AM\n\nAnd it showed that Miami for example the extra days of temperatures above Ninety degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century for Miami Seventy eight more days he's Miami isn't already underwater so\nWhat was something like a one and a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so these really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future and you can have devastating consequences\nRight now what her computer models showing to do is have you worked on the DCCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nCould be substantially worse than even those the stuffed with\nWhat the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact\nIt seems that some of the larger nation the United states included my adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nPrevalent unfortunately you put your finger on\nMy guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be a band that votes on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants but\nIt's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where there are likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level Roger I'm forced to migrate as their\nCities become habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you go ... such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally wants to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low law to choose\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war in ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to\nA lot of the crises\nSuggesting that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from post\nBut this has been something that has been identified by loss of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist\nBut this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as recently as ... years ago\nOr so global climate change and increasing more definitely bring more wars\nYes go\n... well it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control and one of the big headline the summer of twenty Eighteen\nMillion for at home may see sea level rise flooding over the next to the rest

broadcasts and since then on most Wednesday evening's beginning at seven thirty PM mountain and another time zones around the country in the world I've been in my\nOffice where I'm Talking to you tonight in front of this computer to share news with the general audience that is growing around the world for my work and they like uh my YouTube channel\nWell just a three weeks ago and October third I was doing updates on three categories\nThe first had to do with the very distressing subject of half cats be headed cats\nAround the world bloodless\nWeird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was Fox is in a car wreck kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspots solar observatory shut down I had a received a whistle blower email saying that are actually uh the child pornography was just funny deflection\nThat he actually involve the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Holland an air force base\nA that's down below this solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then the third update\nHad evolved from my asking my earth ... YouTube channel audience\nOn September twelfth if anyone had young childhood memories of flooding out of body\nSpecifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately and I had received a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was talking about\nWhen the next morning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream\n[noise] so I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird or I sent the puzzle to a photo shop at video analysts I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a ... report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see the little videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the front of shop analyst was that he thinks this is truly anonymous\nAnd then I asked that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office\nAnd believe it or not a second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder\nOn October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me\nEmails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like ... I Do not know this is the stream only a translucent\nAnd uh when I started reading the letters I began to see how heart felt\nThat there were people who were telling me they hadn't never mention any of this parrot to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use mine\nA man that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight\nThinking about all of this is provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard\nOr talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida home\nThis was in the spring of two thousand and age and I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn for the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility\nThings of that nature so at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the covers of them myself and just lay there and look outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with a few stars that I can see\nAnd then suddenly I just\nI was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I opened them again\nAnd through the window I can see the misty gray bomb drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that in this dark bedroom it was luminous\nAnd I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looks like it's coming right for my head\nAnd I was just frozen fascination of I didn't know what to think then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind off by three dimensional lighted hire a glass passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was a feeling of euphoria and won this with this living thing that was surrounding made\nAnd then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time I was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers was coming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously\nI don't know why this was happening I was just going with it I don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\nCan you describe the shape of a ... that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of what kind of information was coming to you I'm was it like a word voice in your head tell a possibly\nKnow there were no word there was no sound the hiring glitz we're almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I can see ... these hiring glass but they had the same texture of the fall and good would shadow in life\nBut they were living minutes at the same time and they would just blow by me but kind of ...\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a download information\nThat was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was this super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's\nReally difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall misinformation because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDid you have do any sub text in your mind or your soul about who would be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it may be cousin my past experience with ever since I was a child I've had psychic\nDreams dreams of having relationships with an entity that was giving the instructions I can describe the entity to as a very thin\nSo this has been causing
