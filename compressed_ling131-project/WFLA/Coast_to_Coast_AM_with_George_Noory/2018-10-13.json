would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there is there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there and they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back\nEverybody how did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while usually these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative\nEmotional energy drugs or something I practice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes\nBecause people have lived in there that generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel about them and it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies\nAnd sold to minors spirit's just play on that and they come into the our environments and generate huge amounts of energy that is negative\nAnd the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy\nAnd so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and it doesn't feel right I don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening\nAnd so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed\nBy somebody like me from the atmosphere of the home\nThat makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say\nThat I'm an independent trees say Sean and freeze exercises I don't belong to any particular religion\nBecause where I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared and these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work\nFor the Internet ever came about\nUm I wasn't touching anything anyways personal earnings I wasn't touching anybody any ways really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we moved into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years ending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be dealt with you know sometimes they're already\nIn the homes from time to come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and\nThey're ripe for attack and so it's it's ... maybe a professional to have it where it all at once and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nAnd also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having your carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion I'm not the only one\nA qualified extra assistance just about every religion\nBut the but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well like I called you know a local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong in the religion but I remember doing this kind of work and past lives\nUm I have deep contacts with higher spirits are also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are\nThis universe I said before on on one of my appearances universes teeming with life you asked me that question you have\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that no\nBut when I'm working with Christians which haunt me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know if they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for more at the ah

that or could be seeing\nThings from the other side sometimes you know and and sometimes not and and negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population\nAnd so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems\n[noise] a depression anger issues unhappiness or overconfidence\nAll sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen\nAnd and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits are experts at reaching across that dividing line and being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people\nWhen the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of an immediate death but actually working on them for a long time\nAnd they can cause physical injuries it's even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office\nMy girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work out doing what I Do here and all of a sudden demonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and tried to the hospital and you know have looked at in a you know get some light medication for it because it ... the demonic spirit had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself\nSo all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet\nAre very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be a physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe haven't the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm was that are negative very negative what we might call help\nAnd and especially that is very connected to the physical realm\nOf the physical realm as something like the trust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to Jim in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\nWell home on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know to\nTrip pant turtle like I go to the other side gets off drugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen Ninety is asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens in teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said when I say now I Am not a spirit psychologist uh it's\nKind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to see they're still your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for the spirits out\nThere that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are hopeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that any more than a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch\nIs good that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time I have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's not everybody's possessed or anything they just have negative energy issues\nAnd also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack\nBut not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment condo condo or Republican pub whatever and getting them out of their fast and making it work so the family or the individual is safe this is my main concern\nNot are dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold to actually do things in one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because we're not ... reported that the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm\nA mom so that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all those kinds of stuff at first it was real scary but actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past lives helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so drained\nAnd I really appreciate you while they\nLove it you know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is them feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is Jeffrey ... would you please\n... you can find everything you want
