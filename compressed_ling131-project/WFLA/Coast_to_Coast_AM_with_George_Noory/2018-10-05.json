rotting popper friday I was a fantastic I mean they just throw in the\nSun glasses I'm gonna make you eat that garbage can\nYeah yeah\nYeah you know what I really wanted to ask you about Mr ... was um there's another director of intelligent horror and that's Canadian director David ...\nAnd Tom scanners I'm One of my favorites was video Jerome with James what's he's done other movies naked launch exist stance\nA high and it's our video drama is a good example of a movie that's\nYet I'll virtual reality gone hey wire type of thing and hallucinated Jenike but I'm Conan Bert creeps up on me you know as you watch a movie by him and I was wondering if you want to comment on me and it just seems like all of them you know\nAll of his you know I've heard the term body horror uh associated with his films and a lot of them all kind of have to do there's a physicality everything where\nWhere it's getting inside of us are part of sorts in our body and I think that there there there is I think that's the ultimate intrusion you know I think that's the ultimate ah a violation you know and I think that he really uses that even in the fly I mean he's just falling apart and the fly\nOr the Jeff Goldblum fly from the ADA I'm also from eighty or like a like they live but um you know I mean it's it's a really um you know he and he and his attention to detail as amazing as always great makeup of sex\nAnd uh you know David ... is one of a I I I Would agree with you one of the most intelligent directors where uh you almost have to John Rocker himself his his movies are kind of all go together and and they have the same theme coming back again and again\nLet's go to Frank and Hollywood, Maryland welcome to the program Hey Frank how are you\nHow do you have to be back with you know you're

Tingler probably right after a writer right around the world you ... you have the same color on the [laughter] let me see you're not going to sign another William Castle and I think that was maybe right out here [laughter]\nAm I wrong about that the anger I don't know ... and I would put the finger\nIn there and then he did a lot of these are ... films with Roger Corman ah with the the Edgar Allan Poe films um and you know he did a mascot I read that and uh he's hitting the handle a lot of ground post ... films for Roger Corman\nFrom the train traffic center of our ... where we continue

Washington spoke show remain in your arms get\nLoose so we were so that we we just try to get there this year since it was sixty eighth anniversary the blob that we would actually have a spoof show in the theater and so we had a you know I I we basically have swam me bringing Bela Lugosi back to life and then we had a\nUh the people dressed as goes flying through the audience that touching people and and uh\nUh we had a a you know all kinds of gimmicks nurses in attendance then uh you know prize giveaways than a lot of ... a lot of corny stuff\nUh but those shows used for a while they would travel and it pretty much was the birth of the midnight movie because you know the the theaters didn't want to give up their eight o'clock movie or their ten o'clock movie\nAnd so um you know the the the people who are four walling they would they would buy the theater out you know they would they would show up in town with a film under their arm a scary movie and they they they would rent the theater out\nA after hours and they would show these uh shows mainly for teenagers are usually teenagers who wanted an ac a and sometimes rowdy ah rowdy teenagers too\nAnd sometimes they didn't ask matinees for kids to\n'em but then they would they have these amazing blackouts where they turn the lights out maybe have ... and ghost made out of a mumps that were ... phosphorus and\nAnd they would they would uh you know they would have these changes that would be wrapped through the bleachers and they would ... them back and forth but it would make all the chairs vibrate\nAnd they'd all these great uh you know that they were ... they they were put weird stream and ice water and throw them out in the audience and they go down to the back of people's shirts and people will be feeling it's cold noodle going down the back of their shirt\nYou know um there was so many fun kind of carnival type gimmicks that these guys did and they would go from town to town town and sometimes they do three movies back to back\nUm with all these great gimmicks there'd be a magician sideshow act you know people putting nail through their nose and all that stuff\nWhat's the appeal of the Rocky Horror picture show remember without\nA job so lovely absolutely I think that that did have an audience participation aspect to it you know when when they have the toast everyone throws a piece of toast at the screen\nOf people have call and response where they're yelling things up at the screen a you know there's rice prone during the wedding and I think it's an immersive experience but I also because of the sexuality of the film you know people who are sixteen Seventeen years old and are kind of emerging into their adult life\nIt's kind of a nod he saying that they can go into with their friends and you know they might uh\nAccidentally see a little scanner so [laughter] so I think that all that factored in and and you have a you know people who who met met each other a sixteen year old a Rocky Horror and ended up getting married as adults and I've heard\nAs I've I've seen that I've seen the shadow cast in the states for a a performance that goes along with the movie performing very you're very different markets all over the country\nAnd over and over again I flew people who were mad at that show and gotten married so I don't know what it is about that but you definitely find your people if you if you really are into that\nHouston, Texas we go Robert's with us on the coast to coast hey Robert go ahead sir\nGood morning George and Mr ... either like you would call and I'm sure enjoy the show thank you I'm\nI'm fifty one years old and I haven't been to a theater so it's about three years ago when I went to see a rush the ... the Canadian band they're dom\nOkay

Sutherland\nThey I think they were both on the key you know it was good stuff but Mr Lobos were on a time but we got to get your back again my friend Jeff Bridges was in that movie the man is just a little more with us up next we're going to be talking about deaths makes life possible\nAlways on your phone then you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized for mobile users just point your iPhone or Android ... to ... dot com and enjoy [noise]\n\n\nWhen you're not going to you as\nSoon as they bomb bomb bomb or\nWhatever the project in the new pain or getting the entire kitchen as many\nW kitchens delivering quality and value for over ... years with amazing design team thinking about an outdoor kitchen to make your home perfect day case in the summer in double digits takes care of everything you need to make up paradise in your backyard grills\n\nAnd welcome back to goes to goes Dr Merrill Lynch looks back with those PHD social anthropologist writers speaker\nHas been a leader in the field of consciousness studies for more than three decades Dr ... says the president a mirror to send a senior fellow at the Institute of no wedding sciences that's the lead and groom rituals foundation\nAnd her latest work at dusk makes life possible revolutionary insights on living dying and the continuation\nOf consciousness and Marilyn welcome back good to have you again\nThank you George it's great to be here and how are you what's new\nI'm going to it's been a wild ride I think that we're living in an extraordinary time saying well you know and that just trying to keep balance and stay on the cutting edge\nHow did you end up doing what you're doing\nHow does that happen [noise] well it\nStarted when I was a rebellious kid in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world but had no way to do that and I had a couple of experiences started with uh being somewhere I shouldn't have been with somebody I shouldn't have been with\nA closing time and the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit by a drunk driver\nThrough my body\nOff the motorcycle and\nUm I had a real physical tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and I think there was something in that moment that suggested any way that consciousness is more than just our physical ...\nAnd then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and I laid there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware of the tangles up my leg\n... you know now I have to study legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience new experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house in my ... Japanese and being a good NPR assist which means you investigate everything\nWould you have those little feet pajamas I think so I don't really remember them on on it\nBut I've heard tales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on a\nKitchen table and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense\nDrinking\nI drank it and it causes massive pneumonia and I almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand consciousness\nSomebody once you were wrong\nI guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raised there and left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember until now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then uh my first places I was in Taylor, Michigan Farmington Hills\nAnd then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven and then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to a Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis a Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot in style Jeff for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nFamily still there I have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my motive motorcycle accident\nUh-huh you're born I really yeah well if you told me where cars you must remember the the the street oh I don't I don't know who was ... was it a busy street yeah it was a busy street but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over are we going to I'm going to I'm going to close my eyes in yes\nYou'll remote feeling now that you were on telegraph road\nThat sounds that sounds about right\nNear Michigan viewing skill near Michigan avenue yeah that sounds about right\nI Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf its roots in your back year my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach she'll\nDo this all ... really steer you in the direction where you are no I mean you've got a PHD and social anthropology you've just been elected vice president of the Psychological Association will get into that but is this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think it really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and what timers the Detroit a good one oh really so that is right downtown yeah um well\nI discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Kuhn book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolution and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view I kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality\nSo that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen astronaut regard and I didn't apply for the\nJob at no attic sciences but it was about ... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon you're at ... university no\nThat's right we're looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological and\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in Georgia it's all that\nKind of notion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... bill just like the beer\nRight it is any\nRelationship family well\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory of reincarnation of on the little child that was born with three ... marks and we'll talk about that it's an amazing story so many more Dr Merrill Lynch slips with us her website is her name and we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com that makes it really easy\nFree zone email newsletters out six days a week and it was a great way to keep up on all things coast we detailed program recaps the fascinating today in strange and this was the upcoming info and weekly free audio clips\nIt must have caused them for free sign up on the coast ... dot com ...\n\n\n\nAir traffic whether by heart radio ... job and your Web LA\nFrom the border central credit union fried chicken traffic central heavy\nTraffic on our board this morning and the ... direction and you're traveling with the Macintosh wrote in mango road which I could do what does that work in an accident blocking the two left lanes definitely want to give yourself a couple of extra money to that area and use some extra costs will do that part of my work and no delays on two Seventy five coming up the bridges you're making your way through downtown Tampa still see a nice flow of traffic in both directions\nOr Seventy five no delays on the veterans as you're moving through two Seventy five major Springer news radio Nineteen Seventy WFL like\nThere has been a\nBit drier little less humid so as a result it feels a little cooler on friday reach for anything after a hot summer\nNinety two for high in the afternoon warm afternoon plenty of sunshine rain chances pop about twenty percent afternoon evening hours they fall to ... percent chance later in the day on Saturday with loads of sun Ninety three or four high\nSeventy four degrees to start the day on Sunday Ninety two for a high with a twenty percent chance of late rain each Wednesday nuts sees one or two a light job bay waters\nNews generally cheapen relatives Steve derby for news radio nine Seventy WFL a\nFox News I'm Carmen Robert\nPresident Trump expressing confidence the Senate will confirm his nominee to the Supreme Court yet as the Senate prepares devote Saturday Republicans and Democrats are far apart is process has been ruled by fear\nAn odor headed gamesmanship for too long\nGone boss to stand up to a discussion about hijacking\nAn angry Republican\nSenator Mitch McConnell and democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and just a few hours the Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the highly rusty just and sometimes controversial peace prize among the nominees this year the Syrian aid group White Helmets\nAnd Edward Snowden's this is Fox News\nNews radio nine Seventy WFL a\nYou go on the eye heart radio at downloaded now lightning\nPanthers Saturday Night at six thirty or nine Seventy WFL a whole month lightning is in\nYour backyard grills weatherproof cabbage and even ice makers on line to death and W. dot com that's s n double your kitchen ...

know he'll gr Mitchell before you can also\nYeah very well regarded worked\nWith him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with him for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because\nHe was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find\n'em but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving inclined toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that's you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nWe're descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death [noise] if you are like quarter law and

judge in a jury and you have people representing different\nPoints of view on controversial topic so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWith witnesses that come and go\nExactly giving their own personal testimony based on their experiences we ... put it right there and then you get into this question of what went shipped people's mind about\nThat question and is it that data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting you\nKnow I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to the closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think so too Dr Merrill Lynch splits with us we're going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please and its role but it plays with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness and also\nOur lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas Kunz book on paradigm shifts we live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about ... is is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that shapes their experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt shaped our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie out side of our expectation\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them\nAnd I think that that is a remarkable aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of the functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what shape are aware now where are we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness lives outside of the brain\nAnd I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting it is reflective\nAnd so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in the forest because\nEvery nothing cranny is filled with light and with that intention to manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain I don't think it's an ... found that out of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you\nKnow the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it\nDoesn't mean you've destroyed the consciousness\nOr the signal or the signal exact\nIt keeps coming ... exactly will will science ever meet\nThe spiritual side of all of this\nI think so I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time with the the uh the Android she's a robot\nNear Hartford both her yeah she'd be great for you to interview 'em and see if they
