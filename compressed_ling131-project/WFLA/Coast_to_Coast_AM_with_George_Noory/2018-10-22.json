conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last seven eight years and focused on missing people but\nWhen you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on the first pages of new news articles and such and\nI started to come across these are stories about\nUm something that looked like they were when you read the article but when you read the title like Ninety percent of the time it was the wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but [noise] you know\nEight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented in and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nIt we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man the giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago\nWhen your first year he recap the project how you got started on that what you learned and how what kind of got its hooks into you know all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big fund encounter in the mountains of the ...\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter and they said you know Dave\nWe you have Twenty years of police officer or you have years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace me no year for kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said it's your own pace you can do it\nSo I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down the area to Hooper which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the police that a police background I approached them and they said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness that comes forward they're\nGoing to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury and I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nAnd there was no there was no way that the the samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this but you and I work together to introduce Melba too of very\nBrilliant scientist who has written white papers before

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and studied year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the ape gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about is never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have how I'd while or giant human bones found\nAnd that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions and the articles are are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new\nThem era there explaining it must have been old Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat chocolate with

shows that I didn't leave his farm going to live in that type of environment\nAt and grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nBut said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary and third level things that were written about what Daniel called I think it was a ...\nYeah\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what maybe some exporters wrote about that they hurt in which he encountered so\nBut again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an ex or from the ... church\nWas coming across country on a horse\nAnd he wrote in his explore note\nThat this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and look I'm I actually spoke to him large hairy by a he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or ... and it came from the archives with Watergate church butter de saint church and it's in there so\nTo say that these things haven't happened ... with\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from\nSeptember Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wild white mass landed in a field releasing a huge hair covered being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive a big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on or about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm all over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of it\nAnd a book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on

project that it's still all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nThese look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's the general consensus or a\nCertain matches what other tribes dated all across the U.S and ah\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to find a group or an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson gambling film and it's you know people can argue about all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but that that's being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up in this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nOne I did get one film and wanting Harvey has the ability yet\nIf let's say somebody goes into a bank Rob the bank has a beard on a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving Harvey has the ability the here are the face\nCan see the face looks like so you can identify the suspect so apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad it's\nIn tribal Dick right and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your account the news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentations at conferences I sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members\nOf people from northern Ukraine of people from China\nAnd I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different humans look if they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows what what was what we understand about our own people\nYeah fewer ... game here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ... you know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from a 'cause we we buried so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with here and there were just plan to playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter they knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on a ridge line they came in and he saw this\nAnd the er it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods obscene these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen in a lake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be a young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks\nBig rocks that humans disorder chased him off a and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for\nA of a big ... that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and since the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd every time I follow it up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut that's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up so when you hear these stories are these campers were killed by something really mysterious\nIf it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... of just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big what the kidnapping people\nAnd I I Would have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there's never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody is writing about it than say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where and in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to human\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him or apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over load on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill one it's not going to happen\nThere are some uh reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and they invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nAnd our way up in the tree and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast to coast they\nKnew we\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com\n[noise] New Year's traffic and whether by heart radio ...

I Want everyone to think about what was the percentage of people in the wilderness in Nineteen sixty seven that had the ability to take a film\nOf anything while they were in the wilderness it was minute now think about today\nNobody has ever come close to taking video or film of a ... foot in the wilderness for a minute and a half like they got on that PG film yet today there's\nProbably close to a hundred percent of everybody in the wilderness carrying a smartphone which has the ability to catch that so I Want everyone to understand that I Do believe that Paterson film is real\nWhy haven't we caught despite that on film\nAnd that quality of a location and segment like they did in sixty seven\nThere was something phenomenal about that event that caused that female big foot to stay there because every other time they immediately run they won't look at the camera like this when did they won't hang around and linger knowing that people are watching them something unusual happened\nWell again not to take everything back to the skin Walker day but it did the comparison is a pretty clear is that ... there was a loose if there were cameras all over the place\nAnd if you uh had activity in one area and set a camera up it would move somewhere else and it goes back to sort of the question that one of the callers asked about drones say you had a drone that had heat seeking technology it

world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching the story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that had been cited before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program a I Am blown away by your book grey tabby here\n\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on this story at age Thirteen or most teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nOr actually with a documentary that I Am I watching it with my dad it was about the core and they reduced the story of a ship to a single line which was the ship that carry the bomb in stock and\nAdded no more about it you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library imagine that you know they're looking to what with the veil\nThe library I still really couldn't find anything so I thought oh someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I you know I saw it out what I could but thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it\nAnd you know flash forward graduated from college and said well no one told the story and you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to meet them the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey exceeded all expectations and they took me in kind of became like family so you know they of couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes they asked me to be their story teller and that's kind of the cliff notes version of it\nAnd when for you how did you uh hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story incorrect\nWide and greet misperceptions and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project for me the way I got involved was I had actually been praying I'm I Do pray about my work\nAnd I had been praying to have an opportunity to work on an iconic for over two stories and all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this email from this young filmmaker named Sarah Vladeck well what's there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis was that\nI'm In being Indianapolis a storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay\nAnd she actually did that she wrote a an eight part miniseries than she fits that two major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we've seen since the ... brothers but we only face mini series on foot\nSo you're going to need to write a book like she's on a screen writer I don't know how to write stuff so very family and friends she reached out and and make contact with me and um she didn't know number one that I'm a navy veteran she didn't know that I had been\nPraying for an opportunity to do a story like this one um\n[noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting was advice and I wanted to help and write the book [laughter] [laughter] so uh my joke\nIs is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or into letting helper but uh eventually over the course of several months\nWe finally met and then uh\nWe agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we said it took a project ... and a half years\nTo Syria where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the the story had been wrong that a lot of the people who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I ... I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprints commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaigns that he participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nUs acting president ever left the country on and so there was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sunk [noise]\nI'll tell you grab me ... my father was at ... landing craft from the ship's took us troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that did you guys are uncovered\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis\nAs Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flagship and I'm a small part that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of us now where your father drove the\nLanding craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent around this fateful journey\nHad that not happened she might have gone down in history as the Victoria slack shifts of the world war two specific theaters I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battle but\nNo delays on the interstate throughout but no one's county but we still have high wind warnings on the sunshine skyway bridge I'm a Jew Springer news radio nine Seventy WFL I\nFinally\nStarting to feel more like fall in the Tampa Bay area by the time you wake up Monday morning temperatures will have fallen into the mid fifties to mid sixties across the Tampa Bay area and throughout the day on Monday temperatures will he backed up into the mid eighties with plenty of sunshine and no chance of rain\nGay also looks nice mostly sunny a slim ten percent rain chance in a high near eighty six\nI'm news channel eight meteorologist Julie Phillips a news radio nine Seventy W SLA\nFox News on ...

you know and and I both heard\nYeah tend to stories of just men and you know having their buddy right next to them taken you know and they they didn't know who the sharks were going to attack there was not a real rhyme or reason to it and so they were always in fear\nAnd one of those harrowing stories was where there were\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and then we're spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked\nThere was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of\nThe rescuers that counts because by the time that they're a rescuer arrived the men were really in ... they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark and to attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks realize things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shark\nAttack increased and you know this is I Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think saying one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so thick they could walk on their backs you know from shark the shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they could\nHave there's stand on them there's one account you have the sailor who you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking down things drugs thinking oh there's food all just reached out and grab some boot right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young EMT and by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off and thinking he was going to wiggle his toes as bait to learn the sharks and and catch one and then if you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized\nOh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship\nAh everyone knows it's almost the\nEnd of the war and they're having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines see 'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but as Sarah mentioned there were only a\nSixteen rap between there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case there were four groups of four raft\nBut then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so so there were so any water that was available with only available\nOn the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were than men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the those are and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason that\nSome of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into this into his mouth and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't\nAnd then others would you know take mall heard is that the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happens with this is a condition called ... and\nBlood vessels for blood cells ...\nFrom the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess in immediately that it'd sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere as pilots who ends up testifying at the court marshal waiter\nOr an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention uh we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight and they see this you know kind of explosions coming from below and\nThere's no reports coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but you know he I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it and he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd you know the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he still went to you know he asked a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know this gentleman richer live Francis have passed away but his son carries on a story and you know there he\nActually had diary entries of the time and coordinate the one he saw this and it did line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when word was released about it that he would\nWe're talking with Linda incidents are a lot about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but there were survivors into what came next is equally amazing we'll be right back\nTo ... just log on to goose the stadium dot com\n\n\nDo we take for granted\nDignity means bringing the paycheck home being able to put food on the table to provide for your family\nFor Thirty years off ... bring them back to those who lost his after an accident\nAnd because we believe in it is also the horn of our charitable contributions and our flight powerless\nAs well we donated to a million dollars to pass solution of medical marijuana more\nSo than most people live and die with\nLynn ... families for your family\nAnd your\nCalls for recalls\nA R and I'm the owner or a dot com oh whoa\nOne eight six six six eight seven three pie that's one eight six six six eight seven three five\nDays you board to just say okay Google set my alarm weekdays at six AM to play nine Seventy WFL a\n\nWind Vincent I Wonder if you could discuss for me in a broad sort of strokes are the sequence of improbable events that seemingly combined conspired to make things worse is if things just sort of dropped through the cracks or that made their survival even more improbable\nWell as Sarah mentioned there with the the um\nDeparture message that didn't go through from ... to the Philippines there was a tenant on the Philippines side who had received a message saying that if\nA ... it's a combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well he wasn't the brightest guy in the world and as a matter of fact had received a fitness report saying as much but he thought well\nIf I don't have to report arrivals combatant ships I guess that means I don't have to report non arrivals either\nAnd then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the impending invasion and the Japanese home islands so all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combined to make it says it Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until I pd one venture a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors responded in the water\nThere was a very poignant story you tell in the books or a about these pilots that they dropped all the supplies and trying to uh give these uh guys in the water or something you hang onto and they're they can't do any more they're out of supplies they have to hit back and there was one guy who's swimming way out\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I I don't know where he was swimming too or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being so terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left an airplane to help this little loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to a leaves men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives like they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they you know\nWho do we take for you know our ship for CBP the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't fit one more man and he's still alive and you know that was a burden they carry till the end of their lives\nYou know it's war time as we said the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and um there's a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but uh [noise] is it an accident that the story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day a well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the times did not believe it was an accident so the rescue occurred beginning on August second\nI'm Nineteen forty five\nAnd the war ended on August fourteenth between the time zones fourteenth and fifteens Nineteen forty five and they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk the\nNewspapers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it until the jade de until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headline on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five and Seventy two point headlines\nYou know Japan quit the war is over and then maybe below the fold in a very small article USS Indianapolis cruiser sunk\nAnd reporters that time believed that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that was\nYou know resulted in lots of almost nine hundred men on the very brink at the end of the war\nSooner or talk to me about the captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and then was the court marshal inevitable couldn't let him slide given that the war just ended or did they have to pursue this\nWill really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is a tremendous loss for the navy and you know\nSo many people and it was a very public you know\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan\nWas announced to the world and people are out celebrating this in the streets but their family is now grieving that their son or their brother uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so you know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who is involved in who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to the thinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one knew they were missing and that they were left out there to die you know\nSomeone needed to be to blame\nAnd a lot of people got blamed right\nThere were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there was a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that\nThese are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented the situation and so really you know at the time these names the you know admiral ... limits and all these these men who were\nEssentially the rock stars of that area you know we won the war and\nAnd the American public no holds these men on this high platform and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom\nAnd have them testify in tarnish their name like I don't think that the navy wanted to take that route and essentially the captain is responsible for the vessel so the moment that he was brought\nTo court martial there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA little let's talk about the court marshal or mentioned earlier uh the unusual step of bringing the the Japanese commander in to testify that had never happened before and then uh I guess the main thrust of the argument against the captain I mean is that he failed to zigzag that is the exact thing could have prevented the Japanese from sinking ship\nThat was one of the charges on and not only was it unprecedented to bring in commend her how she might have to testify but it was unprecedented that a captain with the court martialed at all for having his shit sunk\nWorld War two there were hundreds of that for fun and captain Charles McVeigh was the only happened here was court martialed excuse me and I'm
