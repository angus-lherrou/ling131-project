you\nGrammar realized I was a little over two when I could see and talk to earth tone spirits the problem is most babies and children can which she didn't realize that when I was four she started taking me to funerals so that I could talk to the relative\nThat died and Italian ... everybody's related somehow and\nSo you know I was Graham a special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gasket but\nHe was fun and he was talking to me and uh you know there was no question but would ask the question\nOr the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day\nThey had way ... and these\nYoung lady did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOh and carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared the ... to me it wasn't the dead person alive person 'cause I never understood I thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong\nWith that [laughter] did you perfect your skills as you progress or did did you always have um like\n[noise] no I think that the older I got the easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is and then in ... even though I've done this for so long I still learn stuff all the time\nAnd by ... so it it improves every time I I really believe that it does it takes me about three seconds now to open\nA white light make a big enough for somebody to walk through I can keep it open fairly long if I'm doing a place like a hospital or\nAn airport or restaurant where there are ten Fifteen twenty goes waiting to cross over the county morgue um gosh there was all kinds and there and I just have I learned how to keep it open long enough\nAnd it was it was a learning thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter ... can do this and but she doesn't do it my way\nBecause she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them\nSo everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop it and how you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that is\n[noise] I ... this past year has been unusual in\nAnd um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five\nThirty years ago that happened a goat actually flipped a red handled in front of my face to face and\nAnd I wonder how is if I thought I go to kill me I Am certainly not stupid but\nI remember I was in the garage and that acts hit the concrete floor in Libya into fiberglass garage door he had no idea how loud that was when the yet\nAnd it was a three step into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here and then it dawned on me and knock it off because of all I'm going to do is get them more energy I Can't walk into how and be afraid\nBecause that's when they don't eat they don't think they need human energy I'm not going to feed them\nAnd I ... and the bottom line in your getting on the line I got a step over you buy it and you know I Can't Grande and throw you into the white it's still free will but you're gonna leave this health one way or the other\nAnd now that I'm older you know and I was fourteen Twenty one twenty five telling a fifty five five Seventy five year old man does it look at me and go ... Gurley\nNot so much anymore now and I tell them to do something they usually listen and then usually older then all of\nThem have you ever have you ever come across Marion the double\nI think that I seen him maybe three times or one that we're so evil that they had come from the black cool yeah and\nI if I ever run across that situation now I really try to protect the family the best that I can and I actually get hold of a religious person somebody that has more training in that field than me\nTo try to get rid of the devil or the demon or whatever it might be\nThat clay that's exactly right and there are people when I Would just stick it can take care of that more power to him\nYou don't perform exercises and things like that\nI Do not I people have had um possessions where I had done that and I actually stopped doing that because every time I Would do a possession I Would end up leading somewhere I really get scratched or\nOr looked like GE or something and it's like oh no no no

occurred from somebody's life teen years later you\nMaybe it depends on how powerful the individual is\nOkay and then um as far as uh uh uh I don't know what it on the idea of energy shopping or something I've noticed that are in myself when I feel kinda awkward and the ... uncomfortable or around people if I think of myself as sort of a White House generating not visible light\nBut infrared warm you know and you're not supposed to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes other people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this guy either way either the ... direction I mean he was on or off when he was on\nA lot of people love to be around him when he was off a lot of people wanting to be away from the was amazing how that kind of energy works both ways positive negative next up we're going to rolling in Springfield, Ohio we used to the Rockies hey Ronan thanks for calling\nMorning our way to day\nWe are fine thank you hope you are to\nA yes or I\nHad a weird experience that a local\nLike I'm not far from where I live probably within an hour has friends come over the person I worked with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I had just\nHad a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I just\nSpoke hated it I thought well no he goes well you might as well get up and\nMove around on a ... as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and hung out with people for a little while and uh they all want to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe another thirty miles from where we were there\nAnd uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got up there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar or they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar we're focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck about\nLike a bar full of vampires something yeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or at the swatter bright and sign up on a rope or something yeah\nAnd and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not very long ago I Need to go so they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean\nThis was an old dad gummed CD bar yeah and I went in there\nWith them and to this place and that was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that are in the air and I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I've worked with him um and ah yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in a car and\nThey finally decided well come on let's go well we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a war off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward roads there's like six or seven of us in the car\nAnd they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum so they decided they were going to walk up to the house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was\nI was I was stuck no matter what or there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sent thing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I've started getting nervous around these people and\nAnd so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name\nLeaders are doing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer\nAnd it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this dude and I went up there with she looked at me and I was an eye out during a word she says are you pray him\nAnd I says yeah and she goes even better\nShe knew what was going up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and\nSays any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car started up\nAnd pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we are that's hard pulled out of the bomb while we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that I thought it was the lord and Cheetos in my heart\nBut you have these strange Myers about nothing\nIs going to be stronger than the the like in may\nWhat do you think that ... role in what do you think there are game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they were somebody an do um\nWhere they're going to kill you I don't think so no I I don't I don't\nThink so but I think they may have been trying to um when me over somehow or another 'em\nLike they wanted your soul\nYeah it was weird I I had talked to this only to my therapist one other time but I definitely felt an odd present I'm\nI'm very uh intuitive anyway and uh it it just something that struck me as odd\nI Hope you didn't hang
