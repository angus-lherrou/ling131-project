like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell them this book about something called the wind man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand

something you go that's called that squash and you share that with a\nWell yeah the the the ... is he's a really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up he's not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who like want to know was back\nAnd then he's never seen again but this particular case is an interesting one I'm cutting I pull Nineteen sixty four in Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my room there\nOn the witness a minute I'm young man named Brian Khan failed um he sold the strange creatures while he was driving along the road and it was sort of humanoid with this

body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he caught it looks a bit like ... ...\nAnd I'm I'm from loyal in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I'm Talking about that before a that might be spooky here than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of the place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nA very human government type operatives who are ill or operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you Joe ... I mean up to five books now on on this phenomena foreign demanding black and one of the women in black and I have to say the vast majority of older report so I get don't send anything like you know they step head of the Pentagon or the CIA or the FBI and I say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies I typically are described as looking ... you know go on and the skin is why why why\nUm [noise] um people talk about I've actually and have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd there are cases when the men in black and the women in black and turned up in homes right after pay for using wage of boats which puts another angle to it\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a [noise]\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe ... but many black mistreat it Bobby on you know just guys in black suits walk\nAnd I guess I'm you know\nAsking it into contact sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters are that some of 'em are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction files but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\nWell yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about with the cat will be a ... you know you've got a really weird and actually a couple of events which ah Asia apps to explain there is a parallel with demanding black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think\nThe government agencies are responsible for the paper I think it's a very small ... great voices they the January unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the over the years agencies may actually have employed the legend of the men in black as a means to cover their tracks in other words\nIt may be paid for with the government to do that many black hole to radio but I don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them from using the legend them out hey\nResumes to to ... and quiet people who [noise] who they

old joke about paranoia paranoia ... but something along the lines of just because you're paranoid that doesn't mean someone isn't really following you around and sort of the the the inspiration for this new book of yours top secret alien abduction miles\nYou're talking about uh the world in which we live we're mass surveillance is sort of a given now right\n[noise] well unfortunately yeah and of course you know a subsequent generations that will do grow into a world where I've never known any different you know I'm In favor of a certain age you know before the Internet age will remember that\nUm that was not that sort of um worldwide surveillance that we have now and um you know I think that's one of the unfortunate things for future generations it's gonna be a tell the normal thing for them and and probably accepted as well\nYou know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea of the fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to talk us into getting a computer chip stuck under our skin and then they can follow us and it'll be for all the good reasons you know for our health and wellbeing and\nAll kinds of ways been in effect they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance devices like that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would what time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things and that's the word\nAlien abductions would monitor intimidate or alien abductees whether or not the government understands what he lived Elaine abductions are all about that that idea would seem ... too many but you make the case in this book that\nIt's real and ongoing right\nYes I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually the official publication diabetes the first to November the people can already got it [noise]\nBut um the the reason I wrote top secret I mean abduction falls is because over the years I collected a number of official documents on abductions which again the classified through the fate moved from ... in the ... um the u._s. and finally I was in a position where\nI could actually sort of put the book together and you know provide the rate that we've yes it's another book on Eileen abductions but instead of going just overall ground you know\nWhy not present papal with a guy to showing how falls would be put together now I'll start the book actually with the contract a movement\nOf the Nineteen fifties which preceded they abduction phenomenon by just over about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would go so to speak\nBut um government agencies do are put together falls on paper planes have had I mean ... for example just about all of the contact Hayes of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George finds hassle\nTrue and bathroom ...\nAll of them had FBI falls out putting on the one of the main reasons pain was because they claimed when I'm able to you by the FBI but yes like ... there and say Israel eons\nBut they told the FBI that they may have had a government or government is very different two hours and bordering on communism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file\n'em is extremely extensively about an inch thick\nUm Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm ... was about ... and so on so you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape April now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty won a with a bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess he was the defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but it was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full around his book on the case they interrupted journey now\nIn the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail rights they you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft where they can be strange creatures\nAnd they subject to um strange and intrusive\nExperiments now what's particularly striking\nIs that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning about to I Am an essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cost and time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the the vaguely interference phenomenon where they knew follow Jake what's intriguing\nIs that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report it to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised them security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond if you like of the of the royal air force I sort of get involved in espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how they ... they promised them security services interviewed Ronald Wildman of ... to with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him and the most telling an intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police and this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time on goal of abduction law in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refers to he was saying that\nYes he sold his UFO coming down lights went out of his vehicle and then he kind of fell to bitch strange checked his watch and there was something that ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think\nYou know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject than thinking\nSort of amusement well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um\nBut the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski then you realize that these guys telling these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally\nBut when you realize that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nIt makes me think of like the Roberts and panel where the the CIA scientists study the UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers along they published the early fifties that\nSold him huge figures of gigantic numbers of books with salt um and I have a ... went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type\nOf governments that communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file on a damn skate um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ... bucks\nThe FBI was more

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] it gives me um [noise]\nIt's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right on people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nPeak experiences whatever whatever you want to call them so\nYeah it is kind of a privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kinda follow my interests and that's really ... how this book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality but as you know this one movement in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it's the sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about near death experiences and and the Syrian says and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how of belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or even increased that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they ... him pretty high numbers in America\nUm believe in and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation in traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about this how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very robust\nSense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and\nTry to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd in ... in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi ... thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with a sense of odd mystery and I wonder\nI think about those concepts are sort of\nUh the the bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists would die hard times too late normally George it's\nToo late [laughter] yeah a pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other reality um you know times lips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out how to look for a way to maybe make a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time\nAs if it's a given day or a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is um I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the in the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of well what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can\nJust say worried about that for them for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going to\nAnother demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and not linked with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions if there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension um send Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world an on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of a one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be a you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else\nAnd that there's something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive [noise]\nUm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations with cleaner they seem simpler more elegant um um and so on\nWhich\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] your traffic and whether by heart radio was dying Seventy WFL a [noise]\nFrom the train

worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific views came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story yeah\nYeah yeah yeah he his wife is quite a story um you're right they're they're ... and the many others in the struggle with the\nUm you know sort of like out of it being raised religious and scientific arm and feeling that they can no longer or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual\nFor sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and excuse me I Am\nAnd with wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality hits it into an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right and the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a and he kinda hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him\nThat um that our our regular everyday consciousness doesn't have any and he uses a lot of\nScientific ideas that we can talk about if you want to how he does it but he has a has a set of scientific ideas that he that he uses to think about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see\nSee I'm into the future and you write these ideas have been a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know like sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I've had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that than ... than a than happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job who were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back to this one side of the audio what how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well so in that chapter sex um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on cs Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the the famous writer of wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made a vat of that book but she talks about time slips and time travel um and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my presence could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing and we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that of the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of\nLimitations of our own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future and and all of our defendants future's all of those moments are already laid out\nThe block at least according to the the laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions Scott defending wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this\nKind of block universe so I'm\nDone and all of his own laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies talk all the time\nYeah you're right you're right it laid it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how freer to make choices um and so on hum so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did\nAs they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that you know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say ... world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension the dreaming salty said can lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moments\nAnd Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space philosophers there I'm that's what he believed was happening and somehow the dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and you could we could talk about that as a as additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that is now maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he he thought everybody\nEverybody's sleeping self had this degree of freedom and he he also believe that everyone if they haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and and they followed he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that if everyone did it they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and past events I'm sort of mixed up together\nWell I guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it a that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences want to talk about to say on a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for visible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray sail away six listen to the break you\nKnow

ballet one oh two point nine south Tampa\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nA crisp white so tell me this in the example of flat land where this uh summer hire dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to de world pulled them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached out and grab us and pull it up so we can understand or the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how do you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as being that calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that and and the un Abbott's bucket flat land so\nYeah people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher realms or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional um and as I was kind of the higher dimensional objects than ... entire world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal leaps good coexist with a scientific yeah ... is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have you know people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experience like an ... um and I have them talking about their experience and then I also\nHave scientists in the book as well and from a skeptic so I have different voices in the book um\nYou know talking about what the meaning of these events are ... and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret what's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is\nAre these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences moments of and fighter and tuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences um and so on\nAnd and that they are you using scientific concept to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like like all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set up this courses that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think\nI think that's what they're doing I think you know just like jaded up you've done right you have these dreams seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he didn't actually go to the Bible that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went to\n... he went to sort of like popular science book um and I think that you know that's one point I tried to making the books I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concept [noise] um [noise]\nUh well I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example of reaching out to some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know\nRemote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to to reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right I'm ... reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity um and we talked about dreams earlier I think\nUh your dreams and you know in the sixties and at other times you know Americans used psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into another round and\nAnd other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing a chance to to reach a transcendent prayer meditation absolutely are all different all different different methods\nAh so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people projector consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get the does that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\n[noise] your traffic and whether
