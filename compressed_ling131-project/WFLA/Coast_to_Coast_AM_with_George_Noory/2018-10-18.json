what do you think happened\nYeah go go go with him going to get into the technical details on this the the outage or actually last that I I guess around an hour and a half and that apparently it was a global outage which is pretty that's weird\nWell it's interesting because um as we know that the the actual video streams to people from YouTube from different locations around the world that that's about all coming from one place\nBut there are centralized system of course so the fact that this was a global outage suggests that there was some kind of access related problem centrally the causes

they've gotten worse I bet\n[laughter] well yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we're probably at it and\nI think I was about a year ago we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the job which is now sitting officially it about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still with a lot of loans to the don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm gonna walk away and look for something else\nA power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you

for ten months typically none of those\nPayments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that ... this rehabilitation\nAt the end of the process they wind up signing for much a new are much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars well these agents again is sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nCheese and the ... these agents are collection companies\nWell yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well on these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own guarantor so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than uh than alone the remaining ... good said I could probably say here George to all the people listening out there do not rehabilitate you're alone it's a horrible idea a according\nTo Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate they default again three to four times and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan defaults again\nAnd that happened something like eighty percent of the time then the whole process starts again\nShe stay with us

I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter]\nThere are also fared ... practice laws\nFederal um a fruit than lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this genesis of\nThis really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway ... ball of bankers a which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes\nServed on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nUh like many of the state run guaranteed horse in the country um like USA Funds these people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for a parent who use child has a ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give up this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices truth in lending a state you three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank guinea private line of credit\nAnd do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened in the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course\nIf the grass are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding cetera\nCan keep up with their budget [noise] um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year\nWell I can guarantee you now you're per year that's tuition room board books um for a four year course for a four\nYear college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad is now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the ... they can't because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing to pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raised their prices\nBut also really string students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane storied where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt there was a story just recently were\nLindsey a guy walked out of dental school with a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental or the belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and it really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know were seen comments from people like Jamie diamond a gp Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem is really affecting the broader economy\nI mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off that's Ninety million dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses killing entrepreneurship uh it's

I had a um I had student loans I um I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for a short amount of time uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into\nA is a lineage system that actually want you to fall so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is\nAh what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties an interest and [noise]\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with Leslie stall yeah a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government ... used to be interviewed I might add a and so it was sort of snowball from there I unfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project\nTo get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to be a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy is it out one that people who have a rough credit\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed to be the ones that kept the short end of the stick and by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory or that or gear mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans\nAnd ... and one of the worst icy are these um secondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll financed them\nWith just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Won five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed\nAnd they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more and with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that\nThat's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you bite on line and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you\nYou should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know uh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income\nPeople um you know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know\nDisadvantaged uh under privileged people ... yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and\nThey're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education's just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the ... system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq greasy once once the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way\nUm but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three or four\nYears I should have pushed my kids' sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart yeah that's right well\nYou know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollar she's crazy\nSo this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid fine\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge high on a good thank you\nI got good news for you too man a throw rally over there and a lot of the other day yeah there was a big signs they drop support sealed their he looked right at the hold that thought oh [laughter]\nI Love it\nBut uh anyway uh I I I wanted to drive a little bit of a trade school to\nA ... a former company I used to work or I got trained on equality and when a company went under the under the conflict in a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but uh we pretty much went on during the late everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people do so I helped her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone and fast or if I was I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too\nWell and I think also for a couple of years you know\nYou probably in more and more experience than most people\nThere and I looked at the local school there and they were voting for thousands of dollars just to go it for oh I think it was a two month course just don't take well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going unless ... ... dollars on a grade school are learning to drive semi trucks\nAnd then I felt like I got shafted on that I found out that I could have done it for about half the price out if it's not\nA let's get your reaction to the cell and where do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go

list or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen are these scammers\nYes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to read junior year loans and so we consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger loan or and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas the first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nHi George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of upgrade Allan Poe's tell tell\nA job thank you and I hope we hear more of it before Halloween point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a ... in the fall for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off my credit report and lo and behold this same week this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nI Hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information as a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the uh the costs but I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I try to negotiate directly with the the oh he do try to negotiate with these people every there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a few\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight and first of all I Would I Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for a chart twenty three sixty six and getting our bankruptcy rates back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of your loan is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent of the get alone he'll take it a fall dude you know that's something you you can do but certainly dealing with a third party closure company like like what you describe\nIt and they get the information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying so I\nRecommend I'm getting to the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the new rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nA friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are zombie loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and ...\nWhen you leaders down the line least expect it\nThat's right yeah they all they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave [noise]\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent particularly for older loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original sign\nPromise not at all at once again thank you for the

did\nA that was right around that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job there thank you great job indeed aliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's a essentially it is my new documentary that I put out to tell the story all all sit in the Pentagon's\nUFO credit Graham a tip but she can take July is that story and and really to to try in one don't humane tree to tell as as best as I can the entire story of the U.S government for ... relationship with this\nPhenomenon or watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single revelation inane the UFO community for I I think decades I the only story that I think comes\nClose and I would say this wouldn't I is that the classification and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that\nOff to decades have to know the U.S government did have a UFO program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm an Asian feel that the day and and like you say for years they said no no since project ... closed down we haven't been doing this the snow in traffic or no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focused on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on tango the numerous threat to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment both the all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this that Robert Bigelow a Senator Harry Reid charmed along I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff neck it 'cause it's coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with the story in one sense for years\nPeople have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's\nGoing on with the aid kit story with with these revelations we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about a case for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mass if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on the sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to a than a than a third one\nBut now the public have been absolutely bombarded thinking yeah well there's the videos and then the this rock stone guy and then this is a millionaire businessman\nAnd and they struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I Try to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this\nFrom my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nTold me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot into it of course tonight it leans at the Pentagon but tell us specifically about your rule\nWell I took a long on on on that one and it was quite a a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seat and then you've done this of course civilian time his self you know you sit in the ... said a direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also questions when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I've got edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd\nPut that but in and I wish they'd take it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon or did they fight teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so I script hit the entire movie I ... the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio ... you know you had it often headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did it parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a director who's done a brilliant job of putting it all a together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving seat having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one ... well I Can't say gosh this is somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it\nFrom from start to finish and that's a departure\nFrom a day it's a completely new role to me I there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like ... just made a\nA a great movie but um you know I I was a departure from me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with\nFirstly I as I say really to try to talk through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field has is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand we go on to the platforms\nThat the young people the watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so that the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but to young people and and another thing is\nYou know it's been a year since termed along ... had his press conference where he\nGot together with the to the stars of people\nUm and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I Do ... ah you know in some ways the story I think has fall down a little bit so they tend to get on to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization do nowadays like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you said the organization um he right yes um well\nThat's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of that\nThe U.S government has said they'd always says in these sorts of\nSituations only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't\nFrankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project I I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and\nScientific manner and we come up again skepticism and you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect\nUm but that skepticism is the sort of\nNicole or intellectual\nA human and skepticism that I think most people\nI associate with that concept it's actually it's a deep probably trying to believe driven skepticism itself I mean it to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the end picking 'em\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things at the mall and well it's just in one sense it's swapping one on your plea fringe belief for another\nReally these by these people and skeptics told they would believe that they would you believe us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back and chat more right here on the coast to

wars technology going some people thought it was to protect us from some kind of a daily in the intervention\nYes and he certainly made of course those remarks\nAre very famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I occasionally saying how quickly we we would set aside a difference is down here on earth if if we face some alien threat and and of course people read\nAn awful lot into those remarks and then they saw the star wars program and they read by the law into that to my own personal view is that that was much more about just trying to win the Cold War and find crop the Soviet Union which to be fair is exactly the way it pretty much\nPlayed out I'll Try ... there's been nice to talk of disclosure are you you know I I'm arguing Steven bass and all the time I don't think there's going to be the kind of disclosure he expects\nDo you think that the things that are happening now governmental ways trying to soften us up for governmental disclosure or do you think it's never going to happen as I\nYeah I I I agree with you I don't think the kind of Steve pass it um disclosure with the big the my fellow Americans people at the world we are not alone I don't think that\nIn in here they are bringing them yeah\nUm and and we've discussed this before one of the big problems of course this is not saying that there extraterrestrial spot if it turns out that we've known about this was Seventy years they can be awful lot of questions to answer about that no I think it's more like clay\nAnd I don't believe either this is a kind of softening up in a climate ... program but I Do think that through\nThrough the revelations about how you tip them through the classification and release of the British Government files we are seeing government say effectively will look here is\nAlligator or as much of it as we can really you know without compromising\nCertain classified information I'm ... and and the ultimate irony of all this might be ... genuinely governments don't really know what they're dealing with either I'm which takes me back to the mountain we acquired warning\nIf we all dealing with something above and beyond comprehension that it would be an allergist to explaining quantum mechanics which you say\nYou never know you you you never know you know when you look at Leonardo da Vinci's works or he depicted things that we have today I'm not sure he knew what the what what he was drawing though what do you think\nWell he was really a fishing or a genius [laughter] I'd have been a time travel [laughter]\nWell I'm not sure about that but I guess there are there are a handful of physicists working on that Ronald Merrill it comes to mind yep\nBut I think there are some some others you know I had a job in the ministry where I was I think the unsinkable so I I don't really things out\nDid you get involved and remote viewing or anything like that psychic work with the ministry you did\nYeah I mean we had you can't run a UFO program without finding yourself the the focal point for anything\nThat any any one kind of comes to to government about and of course we had we had people who said that they were like ... and they wanted to volunteer there to the intelligence community to help out well you know locate\nSoviet ballistic missile submarines a mosque by some trade has that sort of thing so we looked at this as a classic low probability high impact probably when ... but if it does the payoff is so big wind on\nSo we actually did have a program the U.S government had three over the years that we know about ... some street can dog ate the ministry to go to the briefly in about two thousand and one\nAnd do the study which which was classified I think ... it's now classified\nAnd only ministry defense website actually or on the national archives website I'm not sure where but it's that it it wasn't a very good study I have to say it didn't last some of the U. S.\nPrograms and and because it was an intelligence program the age old problem they they were so much in silos but they didn't go out and talk to the people that they probably should have talked to some of the people involved in Stargate and fame and from tree\nWhat do you what do you think of rumors about the congressional hearing on your photos to sell the peace\nAnd hats and actually this this is a big breaking news story literally just this week it it turns out it's more than rumors I'm calling from\nReliable sources that the Senate Armed Services Committee has already started looking at the two thousand for the ... incident which was the focus of of some of these\nThese the classified videos that we've been talking about they've interviewed at least to the pilot and I think one of the radar off right just\nSo so we have the Senate Armed Services Committee involved we also in parallel half the house armed services committee involved and if you look at the congressional record\nFor the house armed services committee dated\nA pope knowing you will see a paragraph tucked away in ... I think it's run up to about forty three forty four pages but All right there on the second page paragraph or three I Won\nIt says that the the or a ... supply the committee with a briefing\n[noise] basically what I did\nNick when we come back we'll talk more about these rumors of congressional hearings and then we'll take phone calls spinal our just ahead with Nicole bunk coast to coast they um find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n... they'll let you have to LA question do you feel run down I mean I of course we get older we don't feel the way we used to feel what is it something that just not quite right going on inside your body you know something's off with your daily routine your energy's not there maybe it's hurting you in the bedroom as well well now you can change that you can prove\nYour light improve your energy in your mental focus new mail medical center Aaron Jacobs in here and that's what my friend here at heart media told me about they told me about new mail medical center they had\nThat train medical stats they're going to make sure they find the right approach for you that's important they are going to guide you through this you're going to go to their location right here in Tampa name a lemon nationwide but they have one right here in Tampa they're going to take your blood work that day they're going to have a solution for you before you walk out of the door it's that\nIn your area I think everybody should have a minor in fact I tell everybody jeeze how might aren't\nHome advisors they total solution to any type of work you would ever want to do around your house\nAnd best of all it's completely free go to home advisor dot com or download a free app\nWake up for him to just say Alexa set my alarm to play nine Seventy ... LA every day at six AM\n\nBand back with Nick Pope your questions this hour as well Nick let's get back into these talks of congressional hearings what'd you think could happen in could happen when\nI Know it will be because of course we we get the bruising judge Kavanaugh ... coming up to the mid term but hey well you know I'm\nI'm committee have been looking at what I've been doing and I think that in a way it into the white ... question you ate pays\nMore generally we actually know that they represent if Amy\nI think it was I had some discussions with the technology in committee and the committee that could actually be a little bit of talk about that I mean that's another point\nIf this congressional interest which we know Israel\nEvolve into formal congressional hearings the question arises well where should those hearings be as I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the the space sub committee or the the science technology in space main committee I think\nI think he will be difficult to get it away from the middle of tree frankly you know it was a a military and intelligence\nProgram and I just can't see how you would get it out of of the armed Services Committee and indeed one of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks in its terms of reference about unconventional threats well if ever there was like a forum to to discuss the UAE pay a mystery it's it slide\nSo so you you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact\nThat there is congressional in traffic we know that there is lobbying going on for formal hearings I've actually I Can't say too much about this but I supplied some briefing myself and I sit and they said that I'd be happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this for the British Government\nWould be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things which I think is is\nBizarre and fascinating is I think so far they haven't really been for\nA national daily newspaper reports that have actually going into the fight but yes there is this congressional interest in UFOs and you know what all four of those articles or in British newspapers\nAmong us not one us no not yet no no\nThank God we do what we do and we have so many good podcaster who's doing what they do to get the word on their\n... but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunate play only got the chance one one of the things is I Know do some work as a freelance journalist myself\nA it it's kind of like like we said with aliens penned again you know if you don't like the way that you you off portrayed on TV sometimes when you're writing documentary well I I take the same view with newspaper articles and this this week I had an article published\nIn the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily nearing\nAgreed on line or two\nYeah I absolutely as they all have to be these days and and my my article in the guardian basically um I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee in the house armed services\nCommittee interest and I I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it's it's it's staggering but have before articles I've seen about this all four of them a British not one US\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line uh I'd love to see a survey of twenty five to thirty in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety percent on line\nI'm sure you're right I mean I'm of course of off the age where I like a hard copy newspaper in my hand and we'd only write things you know I I used to get disappointed like when somebody said oh it's it's on the online version but now I guess my my reaction should be well great like\nGets the exact thing that gets the attention absolutely\nAll right let's go to the phones Brian in Indianapolis east of the Rockies hey Brian\nHey George morning hey good to talk to you again\nHey hey ah first of all you had that you'll put up a show about a special report about working last in being\nAt home with you I got I got I've co signed for student loans you know kind of stuff so I I got to work [laughter] but anyway make great\nProgram may great crew time of your top notch guy but a net what an honor it is to talk to you my my friend or not my friend but third grade on her thank you Brian\nHey listen I my wife and I are eight namely why a lot pretty religiously and in operation a project Blue Book they had a special report I think it was like number fourteen or something like that to come out in the fifties\nThey they they sign they said they scientifically proved to UFOs didn't exist now you said earlier that the some of the believers in your new book or or movie\nUh we're ... we're we're the people that they ran into the labor were people from project we book\nAnd I take my answer off the air George you do a great job keep up you\nWere saying spring will talk to you too I'm trying to get time to do a live show in Indianapolis perhaps the next year if we can pull that off I think he was also talking about ... the con didn't report\nYes um that that was um of course widely regarded now as a bit of a ... job and I think quite rightly the U.S air force made it quite clear\nThat they wanted just to get out of the UFO business or at least they want it to the public out and that's another point that we make in in the documentary aliens Pentagon really the one thing of project Blue Book\nUm which was kind of just like the program went dark\nAnd of course this is the famous uh Poland a\nMemo which which says the UFO reports which could affect national security are all made a in accordance with I think it's a chain up one for ... sake\nAnd on ... part of the blue book system so so in other words the clue with there all along that the ... reports that had national security implications we're never going to be in the public program of Blue Book anyway\nNo that's a good point Nick since you've been doing this and you've been doing this for how long\nHow many years well\nMy goodness ah I guess I was appointed to the British government's usa project in Nineteen Ninety One so uh yeah that's more years ago my cat dimension of although

whether it was one that I actually came in I mean we go we go to a three hundred reports each year I think it was it was actually going through the old filing cabinets pulling out the old files\nYou know dating literally back to the the actually the second World War but I'm I suspect it was pulling out the ... forest file\nYou know of course I'd been told that the party line on this that we had to push with everyone was UFOs or if no defense significance and then I'm reading I pull out the ... and I think I did a kind of wait a minute [laughter] what do you mean no defense\nSignificant did
