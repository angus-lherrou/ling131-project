Michigan [noise]\nSo I put a snowman on the board they beat the blue jacket date you too but\nThis was far from a laugh or in the second period a period in which the lightning got out shot sixteen to five and saw what was the\nThree nothing lead cut to three to two but the lightning get the goal from point in the final minute of the second\nAnd then their power play really fueled then and the third\nFour goals and the third but three of them are on the power and that helped the\nBoy yeah definitely well we talked about it I think uh the Columbus power play in the first when a strongman made the block was pretty much an empty net and then the lending were able to go and score and not not long after that\nThat was a momentum changer there and then like you said ... that goal the end of the second part but at the beginning of a third of that was another shift [noise]\nJust do it so quick to map year which I Will finish [laughter] let's get to your three stars by the by spectrum\nYeah my three stars a you know I I have a third star I about last year I think uh you know especially in that second period he kept them in the game\nOn on the penalty killer here's their top how like killer and that's where you need from your goal and\nUh the second story I have great point with the with the tools that we talked about uh\nYou know the one that was the lucky bounce I Would have gone on a stick but uh I I mean I think not only that but there was other place where he was you know we talked about before you know winning those bottles and he was able to get the pot and get it out when he needed to and first start for me is a JC Miller he just uh\nYou know had what I what I saw was a dominating game he was he was getting ... dirty areas uh was\nAble to get that goal with my two seconds it was real yeah good to see him get rewarded yeah yeah it really was and uh you know you just have to solve the game and they you know he's a guy who probably is private school her he feels\nLike you know you just got off the top line and you know quote unquote down to the fourth line but uh you know he's still in the power play in the end he made some good players and then played well for [noise]\nSo do the math I was doing just figuring out third period shots and shot attempts so third period shot the lightning at fourteen Columbus seven for the game\nColumbus that shoots lightning but only thirty two to thirty one and a lot of shots of a power play for both teams blending in Lebanon power play shots in Columbus had\nTen power play shot so both teams generated a lot of pressure on their power plays the lightning scored the for power goals in Columbus went off for five and then shot attempts remember shot at times and the second we're twenty nine to eat Columbus\nProbably reflected in part because they had a huge power play opportunity advantage in the third\nThat was almost completely reverse twenty six to eleven lightning shot attempts and the third again the lighting had a lot more powerfully chances in Columbus did\nYeah and you know special teams where the big difference you know for both teams tonight and then the the lightning continuing to\nDo well on on the only kill and were able to get for on on the power play so you know the all the talk of the world but the ... is a\nYou know lacking of of goals for for the lightning and and and for the power play we can put that behind this locally and and move forward on this short\nSuit beginning of the ... the only thing I three games in ... you know you're talking about that

teams are very big part of tonight's outcome for the lightning guys in the Greg will pull you into the conversation here\nColumbus is a good team yeah you knew they were going to make a push and the second period I think you alluded to it after the second their power play chances help me even though they didn't score on any of them it helps fuel their game\nBut credit to the lightning or they took one of the chin hair and the second period they held on to their lead and then pulled away in the third the only comment I Would have you gotten on everything\nYou need your best players I think to just show up\nMaybe when you're struggling a little bit had been did that\nEmitted into the game with a goal rate in point late in the second when you were kind of you know up in the air a little ... and you know there's a little dangerous and the second it was on the ... they responded big bucket at a good game to you mentioned Jake the Miller but part of that had a couple of shots ongoing had obviously the goal played hard so\nTough night for the fourth line enough Miller got power right time and it got some short in a tight but so many ... power plays hard for like ... like a low yeah because they just didn't get a chance to play a lot but I agree with me once that he got up there he was the fact\nIt was impactful so a really good when I'm and I think confidence wise and for ... dropped\nTo see the puck go in the\nRight call you know they always talk about that with a player whether it's in basketball whether it's in hockey if your goal score you see that puck go in the ... even if it's in a blowout let's see if he can build off of\nIt and it's amazing even if it's like an empty nickel yeah end of the game just to get that feeling the pressure off you know we stop people from talking to 'em but I also want to want to mention I thought I thought ...

trucks from one of six everybody's in a good mood yes slightly more a\nPositive atmosphere must be Saturday Night that's what it's going to end the bar is still open\nBut uh no it may also have something to do with the snowman that we saw up here on the scoreboard tonight as the lightning to feed it to Columbus blue jackets eight to two and a rather dominant performance throughout the sixty minutes hockey we saw we will be joined in a few minutes while Yani ... who had a\nRather average night at the office are plenty of time on the power play in short handed and even strength and\nSaid you know should finishing the night with a goal and an assistant so we'll talk to him about that also will be pleased to be joined by Jeff Bremmer the Columbus blue jackets for that play announcer Fox Sports Ohio and uh a man who is a cold many games are not just in hockey and baseball duties and\nHe's got some fun stories to tell to get his thoughts about tonight's game and\nUh you know Columbus isn't a bit of a gym the season to err on and off the ice and the interesting things to bring up but you know let's talk a Brian about tonight's game I think a contrary to the rumors the demise of the lightning or those rumors were greatly exaggerated\nAs we said after Thursday's last Vancouver folks there's still a lady games to play in the season so\nUh with that said it is just one game but\nWhat a relief it was just this is the lightning team that we know and love are we saw the tenacity we saw obviously they often we saw some smart defensive plays special teams at both ends power play for for seven tonight penalty kill now for team for fourteen on\nAnd I think if there's one thing that we saw in the fans saw is that\nThe team was engaged from the opening face off and just took control of the game from from the opening minutes yeah there was some trying times on the second period but never can you really say boy the lady just lost control of this one tonight\nThey had an excellent first period um and then you knew John ... team was going to come out in the second period and there was going to be you know it's going to be different and so they had a good second period\nBut the lady didn't let her get away from it and it was a tight game so you look at you know the first half of the game almost it was pretty tight and then they blew it open and certainly the power played a lot to do that\nUh we talked about that the other night you knew that you know the number\nOf ... one of the top two or three penalty ... gives me power plays of last year with basically the same personnel was going to be really good again this year you go through stretches like that are just so happened the beginning of the year was over for the first two games\nOr they were terrific I I think the single biggest difference was a hunger to score um it really just comes down to that\nFor two games there was a continuation of training camp and uh just execution in practice and they just kept practicing pass here we pass here\nThis is what the structure of looks like but there was a real hunger to score\nYou have to want to score you have to really need to score whether its power player not probably particularly on the power play that's where it shows well it was there tonight guys were shooting the ... um they moved to pock there was just a different energy you could tell by the body language and everything else that the the power play was\nCome home and and and take about something else it's it's good and I think she uh she provide me from late\nShe helps me do that and and I think that's a better rate\nYeah about five months now yeah yeah yeah and there's a there's diapers I'll take your mind off what whatever\nHappened to the game there yeah I guess that you thought the stuff that never mind [laughter] so uh\nYou get this big win you know out of the way and like I said a lot of things or you know just kind of come out in the open with this game here so how do you guys roll it into Tuesday's game of very surprising but the real deal and Caroline and coming to the building\nI Know the or the other very good team and um and we got to be ready for them they are if in choosing a lot of ... and I think uh\nWhere are you going to have to block a lot of shot then and be very strong in ours on 'em\nAnd let the officers do is saying they just a simple hockey and\nPlay in their hand and play with the park and and I'm sure we'll be fine well\nI'm sure a mom and baby are waiting for daddy to get home and uh you can celebrate this when Israel Yani Gore joining us\nHere next\nWhen we come back from from Ohio is going to join us talk a little bit about tonight's\n... some of the challenges Columbus has this season and we'll also hear

work in major league baseball the Montreal Expos the Baltimore Orioles as well we are pleased to be joined by Fox Sports Ohio Jeff ... who is the way\nBack when I say a lot of experience\nMicrophone on top and very appreciative from nice\nA blue jackets at a ceremony or on the ice or John David send the longtime hall of fame broadcaster now our club president made the presentation was a it was quite a classy night and I really think the blue jackets for that\nVery nice well before we talk a little bit about the blue jackets and I'm sure some other fun a war stories a there's a few net tonight some caffeine told\nHandle where where in St harbor hours yeah yeah if you're listening on line it's safe to keep listening but a tonight's game uh this is ah I I Know when you're on the losing end the these are not the fun games to call but uh just your thoughts about both teams performances tonight well number\nOne we started our telecast talking about the lightning and despite their ah early season a willows according to a certain members of the media and maybe some of the fans this was an outstanding hockey team and this is a team that as Jodie Jodie Shelley former player and then my ah and partner or the analysts gone the telecast\nThat there's no doubt for a team that's gone to the eastern conference finals the last three or four years and in the lightening the lightning or the team to be and we saw the best of the lightning tonight the power play especially\nA but not to take anything away ... has been an folks it's quite frankly the first day of training camp because she kind of opened everybody's eyes or the media just basically talking to a book coming back and starting a new season and he just said well management knows how I feel\nThey know what the future holds that he was asked well will you be a blue jacket after this season and it is cryptic answer was we will see\nDon't like his body language didn't like his performance tonight surprised that\nHe actually stayed in the game as long as he did the producer admirers at one point to\nHe has worked to the networks for years and former Madison Square garden a producer joellen said I Wonder if we'll see a goal tending change after one I didn't expect that then I thought maybe there might be although John ... was asked in that forty seven second post game press conference that he expects\nOr sick in terms of uh maybe uh taking ... ... what you said no and then they went to ... that the media and the ... you said I did not want to people I wanted to stay in and\n[noise] uh it's an issue they're going to have to deal with that quite frankly sooner than later because he isn't\nAnd restricted free agent in the end of the year and they're all kinds of rumors out there what's what's the future hold he wants to be pay top dollar among gold centers and the NHL yeah\nSo you're talking ten million range of is Kerry Kerry ... million right at and he's he has a playoff series I don't ever want to see how the ... so how do you pay him that kinda money exactly and and so to add to that you have the our tummy and Aaron\nSimilar situation you're single most talented player or before the game I was talking about he being sort of the mirror image of ... you know they look a lot of like very similar skills hangs right handed coach yeah great friends and coaches left handed\n... at any rate you know he he was called the trophy winner in Chicago now as a second year here but same thing he hasn't signed a new deal yet either so will this become\nA situation do you think we're Columbus just has to wait and see how they're doing like say going to the trade deadline and maybe like say a team for ... loses their number one goal and get their you know these are all hypotheticals but I'm just throwing it out there and they go well but ... want to visit a trophies will offer you this\nYou know do they make that deal before the trade deadline to trade him or same thing for print Aaron because everybody always says\nYou got two big assets like that you can't\nLet them walk by themselves but at the same time if the team is rolling along and you look like your really a threat to win the Stanley Cup than the clubs got to say maybe we don't want to trade either one of these guys that ... is that pretty much the way you see it\nBrian uh that's why they pay the general manager you're much\nAnd good of a team president John Davis and all that money but in all seriousness\nA and you only for a long time right and I go back to when he was a player and a great defense but for the Montreal Canadians and I would just starting off\nAs a broad I'm so much younger than I Am a and I was just started off in my room [laughter] just kidding\nFolks but anyway uh I'll tell you I I think they've got to address the Iraqi situation it's totally the opposite\nOf the air and situation are tending to narrow it comes to the Rick every day with a smile on his face loves to get on the ice is the first guy out there for practice you watch them in the pre game skate if you keep an eye on there and he's the last guy I Believe the ice and the ...\nHe is a great talent\nHe wants to play this season he obviously a ... and he's been very honest with me or\nHe doesn't speak grade English I think who drove actually maybe speak a little better than uh than than ... ... when he when he speaks yeah yeah when he speaks when he wants to say I'll tell you what do we had a close and I'm sure you guys have the same visual we had a close up of a a culture of on on the bench after a\nHe missed an opportunity you get what he takes three shots in the third grade never had a shot before that and the hockey game and you could just see the frustration and of course he scores the goal is a tremendous talent and in fact\nSo we start the season and we also had another member of that big red machine from Cincinnati\nAnd you'll remember Doug Flynn who was really good second baseman he couldn't hit but Flynn was a\nGreat defensively well ... didn't like me because he felt that I was too tough on the team back in uh Nineteen eighty three et cetera yadda yadda yadda\nAnd uh so I uh I say to a to Pete I said you know a ... got to sit down and true enough\nOutcomes and newspaper Doug Flynn says plainly or trade me because he's sitting on the bench and Rodney Scott's now beating them up for the second base job\nSo pizza so Pete comes out on a Thursday night were playing the pirates and Flint comes in as a defensive replacement makes two hours in late innings and the expos lose that game by score a five four so\nThe game Pete Rose comes out and its headlines in the paper the next day that rivers the most negative\nGuy in baseball I'd ever heard I played in Philadelphia Cincinnati this guy is a jerk\nAnd this was headlines in the paper the you know the the media just feeding on this so I go to peed on friday and I do a post game show in the restaurant cello Seventy six so I go to Pete and I say a feat what's all the stuff he says oh I was misquoted who was taken out of context well I said I'll tell you what I'm going to do a commentary tonight\nI Will tape it and play for you I Will not be misquoted but this is a bunch of book\nSo six o'clock I Do my commentary my opening monologue and a Pete's got the guys in the dressing room listening and the radios up than after the game I Do my post game show ... calls the post game show in the producers as\nPete Rose is on the line he wants to go on with your ... okay put 'em on so he says you owe me an apology either the baseball all these years I built a reputation for the fans are trying to destroy it\nI say I'm not apologizing you owe me an apology we go back and forth he hangs up Saturday with the NBC gave me the week I go in the clubhouse to do my post game stuff after the game [noise]\nSo I Walk in and there's general offered it was a tailor the player and Chris fire who later became

E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades ... but\nThe first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days one by one day I was sleeping on my side not our when I become aware I realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall and when I\nDid you reach the arm out\nNo I was not quite I didn't realize it was you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing\nBy the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent real when I began to move around the room and examined my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may ... but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocked when\nI was a newbie I had no idea about the what I had first stepped into here and ah over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself you\nNeed that said I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give me an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experienced some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional what I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them\nAnd you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a sin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yeah yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredible as our our world is ... you know this incredible below that were in\nIt doesn't stop it couldn't have stopped here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and with all of the systems information's human being why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any sense\n[laughter] absolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah not all human there has\nTo be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you you have these experiences and you know they're real because usually they feel real you\nKnow he was playing because usually not a language to really clearly defined what another mention is\nUniversal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died or I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to past and all communication is very elegant it's by solved\nAnd there's no need in other words\nLanguage is no longer a barrier we we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here\nThat are symbols and it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity\nExperience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere was no um when I teach my classes I there was no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can\nDiscover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow your classes ... each each at them and really Institute

leave my body\nWell it keeps you safe than you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think it's important people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience or as cars science hasn't top of that\nSo many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and there are no I'm all over or their vibrating\nOr they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call in or signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience\nNow important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now these when you are when people are going to these travels the experiences you mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research and matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery were twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror\nAnd every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nMatter of fact I speak it one night it on this class\nAnd I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say\nI'm skills that are taught for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the mind\nOf the online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved\nAnd again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to\n\nThat's that's that's\nOne of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and\nA talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with Sarah herself with are multi dimensional self right\nAnd have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nI found some great information on your website and let's say by the way it's astral into actual innocence dot org and there are ... resources on their uh\nUm I I I've found as civically ways that you can take yourself into and it will be in there and you want to go through to do that there are\nLots of great things were going to be talking about in a second senator your survey results be\nBased on your sixteen

something going on in your life a problem on illness\nYou can connect to your own answer can you connect with people that their loved ones that um can you help them with the answer\nWell you can definitely contact loved ones uh it depends on whether each individual is open to whatever information you want to share but we have the ability to contact\nOur loved ones face to face\nYeah amazing

Bonnie travel and he's been doing twenty nine years of research and then ... says eight of sixteen thousand participants who have\nGone through the ... e training and and the ... the genius and he's come up with a common let me put it to nominate on associated with the the things he explains some of this ...\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years\nSo um but I've been\nStudying this in practice in it for forty\nOr just to go on my website astro info dot org I included a over a period of ten years I did a a number of surveys\nAnd I receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were having or so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm\nFloating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but\nThere's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset of Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted or touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through close dial it if you're seen through your clothes dial it's at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non\nPhysical body because you're having\nIt doesn't mean you've actually did your body but it'd be injured in the process but\nMost people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things that\nUh for instance probably the most common it's just the jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nSo that that's I see the ... on it because that happened if I'm retired I Will switch and\nI think his muscles in or you're saying that's an out of body say\nNo I'm I'm saying it's not I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this\nIs what I have found and what many other um experiences have seen unexplored\nEvery one when they sleep we all humans are moving out of face from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint but\nWhat happens for that one third of our life we're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's\nLike a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a slate and you can observe this actually during and out of body experience\nSo what does it look like image you're looking at\nIt's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they are teaching and having all sorts of experiences\nOr they're moving their legs and the dream the cancer\nThey may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural as breathing and think about this for a moment and and that it's just that everyone is non physical we're non physical ...\nIts temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWhen ... biological machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess or play ...\nAnd most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience well\nIf you wanted to ask a question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into an OB and\nAsk that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how would you know the difference between that and imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I began to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies\nAnd I was still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two\nAnd I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOf what's going on and I think\nThis is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated or ... anyone other than yourself\nRight and it's very important that sets self verification\nIs essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always have somebody that's\nAn avid believer and anything that looks like a specialty of religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this ... and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience a menu sudden oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report

now uh we have great college ... college sure and has to let's go to Jamie in Washington state first time caller here and coast to coast and Jeannie when is your question\nOh how's it going great what is your question my friend\nI'm curious as there's any relevance between the out of body experiences and a memory loss\nGood question the question you mean not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\n... coalition a little bit of both uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experience itself but not\nStart cutting your pants off of you and the whole nine yards and what I was going to say though was a ... I was scared to death I ... I I Am truly was and\nBut right there at the end it was like a a breath of fresh air came on me and\nI wasn't worried about anything any more\n... sounds peaceful peaceful and is is what it was exactly peaceful\nHave you been able to recreate than experience I'm not a heart attack that feeling that experience as peace\n[noise]\nNo I Wish I could ... it would actually be great\nWell maybe that's maybe you can blame could he\nAbsolutely one of the things that people do report\nWhen they have and out of body experience um\nIs that they have this immense feeling of a love and peace and fly that just flows through them mhm uh I've talked about this many times um it's like you're entering into a some people reported like their entry into a sea of of love\nI'm an acceptance and it's and it's like it's difficult to even ... there was no words to even describe some of these things\nBecause they're beyond our um our verbiage but yes I mean that's one of the reasons that people do have a explore these experiences so they can ah let's just say connect with those higher aspects of themselves\n... now and thank you very much give some clients he said it I mean has there ever been reporting of that and not a good experience and we're going to be is that you can't it's not right\nYou know just like there has been an end to ease and nightmares in ... if you're a\nFear based if you've been brought up with this concept that there's a double\nA or Satan around every corner waiting for you to pounce on you you're going to have light you made likely have a negative experience your own fear will create it when we leave our bodies were entering into a very thought responsive dimensional space\nAnd that's what people forget it and I I I say this all the time you know we're not observers of non physical reality we're participants\nEach thought is a creative projection and we are influencing the energies around us we do it in the physical but slowed down here but\nWhen you leave your body through near death experiences\nSame applies to um if you're doing ... San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do the experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look\nTrue self and your beliefs and to see how and try to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them [noise]\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like this negative energy if you are going to create it when your mind is going to hold the reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that is well\nWell you are creative powerful big change and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into it incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but the it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a specific dream I guess I remember but it could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got off the motorcycle and took off your helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that um\nBrides or owns a motorcycle and it was and it woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a protection of anything and it was the night it was no\nThere isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension which looks pretty bleak pianist and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I Will cut because\nPeople are scared to each other yeah I'd I don't know of that and that as well out of body travel most likely\nMhm well it could have been but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there is no consensus reality there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective\nGroup of individuals that all agree on a reality and they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist and in our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to start to learn new what is the century the rules of nonsensical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to linear car and writers to gravity we're used to air yeah when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you don't you don't have gravity\nAll the things we're used to have to you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm\nIn my workshops but it's also in my book but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing\nExistence yes here that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they well thank you so much Williams has been great if you go to his website which is astro info dot org you'll find out about

[laughter] welcome to the blue moon hunted history chores we've been probably scaring the public's since two thousand two Stephanie waters is my guest welcome Stephanie\nLisa I'm Glad to be here and I love that proceeding commercial about paying because\nGold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan I'm going to scare the ... out of it it's lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial say can you really say pee on an original is is that that's just sharing anyway let's go to the show [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nUs so will you send me your book and we do our you know constantly in Colorado during our guys shows and I thought it would be so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's very unassuming you can\nFind things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience with her normal\nWell I didn't think go since I was me an e high to a grasshopper is what I always say\nI'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding\nAnd after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago it was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and unite the paranormal can even immunity and also just\nOutreach to help children better understand and um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friends dory spins\nAnd she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirits\nOut of Longmont, Colorado mhm and so the two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community now we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and uh we've we call it a ... feast because every year\nWe tried to sponsor it in a different community and by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in ghost or things that go bump and the nights supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them to see if it was possible that these things really happened\nAnd so that's what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to ship for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book\nGhosts legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through shut the ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you look about your Journey Through sure going to die we're cancer and how do you how you reconnected your life would go what were you doing before then\nWell before that I like I said I've always been into the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nLeaving seeing it you you\nKnow I see it and I actually feel it\nI'm just really like him as an example\nWell I can I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things [noise]\nUm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't protect that into the future\nBut what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was so I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional storyteller from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nIn managing Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I head haunted wine and cheese parties\nYou know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I knew was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love\nThis story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true we were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought\nAn old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because we wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was that in California because she I mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband and mind you and she died\nAnd so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email\nUm and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address and he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts biologist loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really\nRun down [laughter] ... extremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us\nThat they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass\nThe house and five years after five years we could do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house with what have you well after us you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and I'm an artist you know and it's\nVery severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going roe [laughter]\nSo I actually called the owner's son\nAnd he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind to fight and it would just sold a few things and he goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude\nSong about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest state so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like wow I hired twenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was\nEthic my goodness\nYou jumping Malone blew everything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till the ghost of Shirley\nActually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nWhen we come back

civically Colorado did it just ... you\nKnow I'm\nI think another reason why I'm that\nPeople were drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a path between them that they would not\nAnd guess what I went up there on our birthday man the first day which is October seventh I went up there to the theater and the ghost is gone it worked\nShe'll be manager confirmed that snow yes all of this worked up beautifully [laughter] needing now had she seen the operation of\nThis not since the book has come out it was amazing during the time before the book yes\nOh yes she knew it was on it but she hit like a ... her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand six team\nBecause the theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball\nIn this book was reaching out that's partly trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their stories\nThat yes but you seem to be the you'd like the public is for these ghosts\nOf the main thing is it's meant to be one you have a wave really connecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live go go under\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you'll always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's hard to buy the goals but like other little group that bounce the ball isn't she cute I'm like no leave in ... ... and friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere's no devious funds spirited absolutely not if they are they're just kicking you you've tricks\nOr it's here they are in prison here by their own their own their own minds that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during nighttime yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the veil as dentist and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely get picked believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes to come out at midnight you know but Tom or at three thirty in the morning but I find the best time to actually look for those if you want to see them with your eye\nIs at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nThere's a transition time why it's\nThe it's because of the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter hitting lends itself to the shadows\nDoes that make sense yes the judge and make sure when you see the shadows people and the light changes very fast right now and it\nOnly I call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks and the lead into the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the police that you're living in now haunted him did you met with non ... lead to\nGoes follow you right yes\nThey do on like two words it's very funny it's the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten\n[laughter] just kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and manage who were on a timer because whenever I Would walk on her name's lights they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know what these certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would go on when you've walked underneath them and I said [laughter] yeah that's true [laughter]\nSo they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights will flash this this town is very haunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing uh my show in the ... if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah because I happen to you too\nI mean I've heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tripping of life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd the did you notice that would happen to other people who are just you know I Know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause they'll think you're psychotic they're like oh well\nHave you tried to say it's happening at well so\nThey're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do all kinds of magic tricks I'm like no really I'm Serious I was just
