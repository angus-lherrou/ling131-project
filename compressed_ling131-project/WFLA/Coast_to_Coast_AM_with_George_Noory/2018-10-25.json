why the guy says what's the definition of war and I says well\nIt's an armed conflict civil wars on the other hand are are armed at times and at times they are not armed sometimes their ideological

Want to get to the bottom so I Want to hear what the authorities have to say about this\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing is to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know thing he's created an environment so that somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that you don't know that we need to wait and get the official verdict from\nOur authorities any and intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about it a grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroke\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica is best when we can debate ideas vigorously the break these ideas and then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever they are not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that what you had on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you want on this there that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this is a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media not not coast to coast but the media has ...\nBecause George you giving everybody a platform you're giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you bid on it I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and this we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd those on and the individual or the group that some of these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others\nHe was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go and his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski and turn them into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThey kind of spirit the I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep this keeps their mouth shut up\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nAnd our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals and institutions and in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWith somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again because I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media thing that President Trump still this weight\nShut up way let the intelligence officials doing their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who've done this\nThen we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one country we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they blew it most fix more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in ... and ... and when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye ... ...\nJoy we will talk this week and and see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon as described the killing of ... show me as a heinous crime\nIn

perpetrators of a very short period of time of being very very high\nI'm ... I mean these are all unexploded devices\nMeans all kinds of of trace evidence is available for them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI the U.S at some of them were sent through the regular mail for us here\nAnd then I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities\nThey probably have that all figured out already the entire ah UFP of network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the ...\nGot pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office cameras at\nThe post offices I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days or certainly in a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this and then some of these questions are are going to start to be possible\nAnd she'll say that again about a minute left or optics story real quick\nI I mean this is mostly a a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individual I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet is are we going to be able to afford it\nOr the ISP is going to raise the bad with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole allocation for the month and in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have tended to put the high speed a new advanced system in the ah high rent urban areas they haven't showed a lot of interest and putting them into rural areas so there's that question to are we ever going to actually see it depending on where you live\nOr am I from Lauren thank you so much will be in touch with you this week as well while a lottery ticket holder in South Carolina has scoop the largest jackpot in us history\nMega millions confirmed that was one winner for the one point six billion dollars\nLet's see how that would be a he's probably obviously meeting with his lawyer on accountants or she is and will figure out what's going on in a moment we'll be talking about dark forces demons with a which that's right next on coast to coast am [noise]\nIf you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or disease it's possible you could add a trio ... one of the leading causes of stroke mind out before we're dealing with cardio them all the FDA cleared\nPersonal EKG device than just Ninety nine dollars to order Amazon dot com and type ... dot com type cardio ... ... in your pocket you can take any ... any time anywhere right when you\nOn a boat listen libre on demand anywhere any time go to coast to coast am dot com and downloaded today\nNo dog in\nThe\n\n\nAir traffic and whether by heart radio ... job and your wife LA [noise]\n\nFrom the train traffic center powered by millionaires as you're traveling throughout Hillsborough County does he mean you might get some minor slow down and I for each time between the street and okay\nIt with their major delays report at this time to Seventy\nFive and Seventy five are moving up to speed notes or dance to report on your big bridges the major toll roads are also delivery at the same thinking and the three of wander off the moving up to me just remind your you might be some slow down ... roadwork in Tampa on candy boulevard between the eastern or the ... to make the canning news radio nine Seventy WFL a\nFairly quiet or the overnight puree to some scattered clouds around temperatures will stay mild at Seventy one degrees eighty six where your Thursday Afternoon high a mixture of cloud in sun with a twenty percent chance of a mainly afternoon shower cold front approaching on friday it gives us a forty percent chance of showers and a few storms\nSouthwest breezes Seventy fiber morning low high eighty four used when turning southwest ten to Fifteen nuts to the Tutsis in a light job on the bay news channel a meteorologist ed bloods worth for these radio nine Seventy WFL lake [noise]\nFox News I'm Carmen ...

days in a row and make sure that you pour water over your head three times in a row and before you go to sleep and in the morning set a timer close your eyes take five deep breath and just repeat I\nAm the light of God I Am the love of God I Am the light of God I Am the love of God I Am the light of God and the love of God\nSee just close your eyes set a timer ten minutes in the morning in ten minutes at night\nWhat does the salt water do gruesome\nSalt water mixed with you know it's so amazing it just does so many things but it really just clears that our our energy or\nRight everything that we have anything lodged in everything we picked up from others it can also clear our own negative thoughts and you know everyone has negative thoughts that are created on a daily basis subconsciously so the salt water pretty much just clears gives you a good clearing of the RS\nWhy ...\nWhy does a curse work well good question a curse works [noise] ah because we allow it to work for a member of curse cannot work if we um [noise] it's our minds you know the power of\nI mean is it the person putting the ... the ... the the job or is it the recipient who somehow what should happen\n[noise] it's the recipient that is a very good question yes the recipients always recipient that let that happen and you know most nine times out of ten [noise] um it's because our our our was or not intact and I don't think I met anyone with an in tact ara but it's both\nAnd it can also be comic it can be comic curses can be ... doesn't mean that you have to accept it because if you have learned you know you you said God or during the gods where the U.S into masters or the angels and if you make it very clear\nThat you no longer want this to be part of your experience you know you can really do something like an crossing and I'm release it from your being but it's both but it\nBoils down to the person who is the target it's usually are mines that are not as as strong as they can be but it is possible for each and every one of us\nTo to have a very very very very very powerful mind and when that happens persist can affect us we'll just bounce off\nLet's go to the Rockies Charlotte in Pennsylvania ... go ahead\nHi Charlotte I ... thanks for taking my call in or out my question is how does one heels himself how one he'll do I wanted to know vale much English just recently heard veil that is that something you can do to yourself absolutely merging as always always got\nExplains ...\nOkay this is just um like he does you get the bundle of stage and you light the stage and I prefer just ... just age when I'm naked so right outta after a hot bath I should've said that before and I didn't\nUm you just said in between your legs and you'll see age all around your body mostly around your head and especially behind your head because that's where entities like two to hang out [noise]\nUm so every crevice in your body just going to stage um and it works if you do it forty days in a row if you said your house and you said yourself you definitely will fill a difference\nOh I Hope that works for you Charlotte Allen in Fresno, California is with us now while I'm going to\nGo and bus um I have a question of how do you ... spears or in you know\nHow do you get rid of spirits great question you're going to have to email me for that because it's going to be more lengthy [noise] um I can give you um information on how to do a house exercises um now what kind of spirit I mean are they pulling your covers [laughter] you know when you wake up in the morning what ... how how serious are these\nWhat's happening either it's like it's like I'm I wake up in the middle of the night and you're like ... have you been talking and then when I go like into the causes no one's\nOkay so you probably have ... what is known as a a called an earth bound spirit so it can be someone\nSounds like a mischievous spirit [laughter]\nSo it's probably not like a demon it's probably just as maybe someone who lived there before and they passed on but they haven't really passed\nOn to use a possible ... that you cannot get rid of the shirt and spirit that are just lingers wherever\nWell it depends I think all spirits you can get rid of them because you can appease them as well so what happens in that case and that's a very good question George I'm Glad you asked um there are some black magicians who will send an earth\nBoundary and wanted me why would you um [laughter] so it was a revolt magician grown\n[laughter] I Know I'm Sorry and clarify and so in addition\nAnd that can actually send you an earth bounce spirit and what they do is they will go and I'm looking for spirits at the cemetery who have not crossed over and they will um make the calls to spirits who are very disgruntled you know they either killed someone or they raped someone or\nAnd they're willing to do their bidding and so they can send us your tail and if that happens actually I frequent\nAre they under the control of loose suffer Satan\n[noise] the dark lord\nAbsolutely they are I I kind of a dark already exist because\nWhen you should somebody sends them that's who I think is sending them\nWell it depends because they're always the the evil magicians are definitely being manipulated by the dark lord and you know other demon so in a in a in a sense yes absolutely\nAnd you gotta watch out you got a raw Charles ... website is her name cursor rent to re a dot com she'll answer\nAll your questions when you email or that way banks Chris appreciate your being on the program up next who's behind the secret doors [noise]\nDoing a show once in a while that was a little different so we can have some fun with him we came up with the idea of who's behind the secret doors senior producer Tom Dan highs or has been picking some guess how do you select who I'm going to try to guess who they might be tonight I'm\nA I pick the people that the audience will know in that you will know because the whole idea of the shows to have fun is in this particular door show is to have fun and people know who they are but the best part is when they try to tricky home aren't really creative\nI remember when the late Roger leader came on and uh I could not guess him at all he had you and I think in honey in was good to even even when he was very good too so I'm looking forward to this we've got three gas will take phone calls with everybody up to half on each one\nA in this night will go by really quick and one more quick question for you goes to goes next

[noise]\nActually I tell them the oil that thing and they just haven't done that yet so come on and then let's see who you are hello there\nAnd I know\nOh boy this is gonna be tough I'm fine how are you\nWell not in my ... days of 'em up oh I Know I got older things get tough for\nIts Stanton ... more hits stance in Friedman\nBoy am I allowed a\nHeightened I you know what you've got that little

need we need you on this program my friend look I heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nUh well I Am sort of retiring a I have a much wider scheduled for the first time in ten years I have no engagements and these of January November and December I Can't believe it two months of outgoing and they wear\nA against my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you how are we love your standard I got to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter\nIn Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named Stanton Friedman I\nSaw little clipping in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before a group\nOr at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know you know nuclear physicists expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this\nYou want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my Sony tape recorder out I went ... interviewed stamps and Friedman had a great interview and I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis he was the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near ... big beer\nAnd I think so at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo ... tell me tell me what's going on in the field have you followed these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank ... talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand prices and the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal\nThe latest word

away from him and he'll never forget it and it has affected the rest of his life and I'm actually going to be going to see that individual in white home in New York very soon his name's officer Brian gals one\nAnd so it's got to be an interesting book George I'll make sure that you have a\nCopy and thank you for already endorsing the book yes uh it it's something that a little different for me because I'm used to writing about my own experiences that and I'm covering a broader spectrum and writing about some other folks\nI absolutely and and build this ... this officer of course has no reason to lie has nothing to gain these are the kinds of credible witness is you have to have Harter\nI totally agree and I didn't know about this matter is Margaret from Mike super who also is a former police officer he lives in Carmel New York\nAnd he um somehow got connected with officer Gosling\nAnd went and actually interviewed him so that's how this all came about and and then I've had dialogue with officer ... cents and he's very credible and it was not only him\nBut seven other officers are over a two nights ban that actually solve this creature so it was the original two witnesses that reported hearing just God awful shrieking sounds coming out of the woods\nAnd they reported it to the local police\nAnd so the first night there were I Believe five police officers present and then the second night there were two more prevalent and had these I Witness accounts of this gigantic big foot creature in the area\n[noise] some people believe the big foot bill might be dimensional other people believe it's tied to the U.S does ah I tend to think it's it's a creature of this planet ... what's your take\n[noise] well I have to say you know again based on research and my feeling about it and dealing with this creature I'll I'll tell you a story in a second here but I Believe that it's both George I think [noise]\nBiblical a now or if you're reading things like uh

to only be one foot friends there's never really very rare that you you know here about a lengthy trail of of these types of friends\nAnd I've thought about that and I thought okay if if it's not a hoax then perhaps\nThis creature may take one step before it becomes invincible as crazy as that may sound but they're sure seems to be a pattern here of investigators or eyewitnesses that only find one track\nThat's a good point what do you think in the old Patterson give them all and so\n[noise] well I've seen it and I was kind of on the fence I thought [noise] I don't know it I'll say this
