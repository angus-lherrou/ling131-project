{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "Going against the team at least on paper Tampa Bay is supposed to when we know obviously they have to go on the ice to prove it but I think that's where it's three players that are getting an opportunity to plates and nights can maybe lift Tampa Bay up and give them some energy I'm Talking about the ... obviously in that\nAnd Ernie and cuckoo getting an opportunity to play cuckoo first time the season Ernie had been scratched the last couple of games\nDo you feel like those players can come in late with some energy\nAnd maybe you know give the team or a little bump if things are a little slower than normal knowing that this is the last game of road trip\nI Do I think that you know the coyotes are coming in back at home I sometimes that first came back at home for whatever reason teams tend to get a little bit comfortable in front of a home crowd but Rick talking at talk this morning I watched one of these interviews just about the importance of\nThis home than right now and having to bring energy ... having to play a little bit of catch up hockey 'cause they didn't get off to the greatest start uh as far as their record but I think Louis demanding you know he's proven\nThis season in the pre season that he's much more comfortable in in where he is right now in his game he's had the confidence he knows what he can do is measuring up to a veteran a finalist and Andre ... the last day every day in practice so that is only done\nYou know great things for him in as far as elevating his game but I think he's excited to be back you know\nTo play against his former team he didn't have the success maybe he wanted when he was here but put into a different situation and really florist with the lightning with fantastic last season I think you'll continue to want to prove his skill set continue to use in\nA show off his strength which is ... one of them are from John gold sending coaches talked a lot about just how poised he looks you know his speed and the way he's moving so well and with more control as well this season and then he talked about Adam Ernie he's obviously someone who\nYou know had a tough go last year right when he was starting to come into his own a little bit he had to suffer that injury so I think right now his you know thought process is just I have to make the most at every opportunity and prove that I deserve to stay\nAt the NHL level and later cuckoo I talked to him the training camp and he said you know the biggest motivator for him coming into the season was not playing a game in the playoffs you know he spent a lotta time this off season working with farm Underhill\nSkating coached along with many other lightning players but he's really motivated he knows that there's been a big emphasis on playing well on the defensive side\nOf things and being able to break the pop up cleanly and that's something out vicar headman they're going to have to get back to doing the simple things right I'm playing a simple game moving up the ice quickly and and just continuing to push\nAnd persevere without their leader on the blue line so yeah Dave I think that yes later ...\nEarn this opportunity has done great you know in moments when you had to be put in in in high pressure situation last year against Ottawa that was a tough game and he had plans to go to second game of the season last year or two goals is first to NHL goals I'm so I'm excited to see what he can bring in ...\nAnd we talked about this earlier today earlier on your head on the the lady's website and I think for a guy who was played it above he's obviously going to be silly but I did but it's the whole keep it simple simple plays get your timing back he doesn't need to play outside of himself [noise]\nIt's not like he's going to play you know one shift and if he makes a mistake he's not going to get back out there like this is his gay and he's going to get a regular shift\nAnd I think the biggest challenge for him kind of like for right now and when he made his debut in the fifth game of the year it's about timing so the more touches he gets the more pleases able to make the better in that regard [noise] um [noise]\nBut yeah I think that this could actually off that maybe a little bit of what we were talking about the grind of a road trip of fresh blood if you will coming into the light up maybe gives them a little burst of energy [noise] we'll talk more about\nThe game tonight and also what tempts they has to do with Victor had been and Andre plot Alps with Kelly and

game and the ... was asked about it afterwards last night reuniting with the key to ... and it didn't happen every single shift\nLast night but enough where you obviously notice it and they created subscribe chances obviously had the goal\nIn the first period stamp coast finding Brayden points we noticed that goes loves playing with to drop has talked about the chemistry between the two\nDo you expect to see a little bit more of that send night are based off of what we saw last night\nI think so I think you know John Cooper realizes how much chemistry those two players have their very unique players and the way they see the game the relief\nAnd kind of I mean obviously marquee players in the game so they like to play with each other obviously but I mean he's had a lot of success with the lines they've been running with and to be able to separate those two players and create a little bit more balanced and those top for\nUm lines I think has been really solid for them and especially\nYou know teams when they have to shut down one line it's a lot easier to them and they have to look at two different dangerous lines that are equally as dangerous and try to have to ... both of them down but obviously\nWith Andre polite out with a day to day injury it's going to be a much different look up front I wouldn't be surprised depending on how this game goes at these shovels the lines up a little bit because they're already\nA much different than they have been will be the first game\nThat the Anthony's rally line to Lauren Joseph won't start together David you mentioned it it might be Joseph playing on the left wing of top with brain point in Steven's camp because so I don't think there's any denying the chemistry between Sam ... I'm sure they would love to play with each other but John Cooper said you know they're having fix that they're winning games and\nYou know why change something that's you know fix it if it's not broken and that's the\nOne that well as you alluded to when they ran the lines of warm ups they were not together on the same why are they in this road trip John Cooper is pick your spots where he's found\nKind of key opportunities to put them back together whether it's the last bit of a period sometimes like off of these awful put them together or as we saw in Vegas you know breathing only serving a penalty so it's normally point stamp goes in court before the plot injury and they shuffle things but\nThe Vegas game started with that trio was alive but Yani corpus killing the penalty\nSo when the mentally and did point came out of the box with staff goes to recruit drop on their cars board had just had a pet only kill shift and they teamed up on the breeding point goals so I think that there are opportunities in games that John ... where you can put them together it's almost like yours that ice cream cone\nThey really like it and it's worked pretty well kind of putting them together and spot\nSituations but then [noise] keeping them apart maybe for part of the reason that you talked about which is does make it more of a challenging matchup for the opposition at a time and score\nAlso probably factors and so I wouldn't be surprised if we see them together just won't be maybe on a regular basis but we'll find out\nYeah and that's what makes you know this seems so unique and they want to go up and down the line up and and really have an impact to give us a JC Miller with another goal power play goal and again giving giving different look and him being on the fourth line you know we've talked about this for it's really hard to defend\nThat but they ... it'll be interesting to see tonight because Arizona it's been a a really good defensive team this year and we're talking [noise]\nIt'll be interesting to see tonight you know a little bit different lines in the top ... and right now it looks like a ... point and Matthew Joseph out yeah great opportunity for the rookie\nBrayden pointed Alice junior who came over\nYou know trade between Arizona Montreal Macs do me what the other way take that are based on January ... ... the mayors of the right side acquaintance Keller was a called a trophy final as last year for Arizona today strong enough the parts that amount you go to the middle McDonald office ski just pinball at the center right and\nKeller brought it back in in their early or still in there with Richard Potter former waiting for word\nI put off side against the coyote Seventeen Seconds in no store [noise]\nClinton color and getting a chance to play with Alex ...\nWho was traded for Macedonia and injured at the beginning part of this season came back against the Columbus blue jackets and very fortunate to have the opportunity to play with each other really\nGreat point was a neutral zone based off from cousins spam and got Shaq and president is able to hold and ended up going and drop it ... years McDonough like twenty seven minutes last night or yesterday and the winner gets Vegas my fellow to Joseph\nThat'll upper middle center across the coyote blind my circle you know punch in the near corner dumb airs is there for ... large then go rental it out or on the far side it's back and said All right for McDonald's splendid up middle ... crossed the line he got caught up by Akron Larson\nGets back from Jason to mayor is a fee for cousins that is ...\nJosh Archambault was caused by danger already lighting retreated Coburn who's playing with Gerard Ian didn't adapt since [noise] will deliver the feed the Tyler Johnson\nTurns screwdriver sunrise just folded in dark step on what kind of Christian Fisher and the lightning in district by danger already in the right corner that bond is going to come in for support but he fumbled away the coup drop [noise] upper middle it's Coburn we're going to get an interference call you're on the lightning backed by the way [noise]\nGoing on Tyler Johnson [noise]\n[laughter]\nIt won Nineteen through an early the Cape and all I Need to deal with ...

Slater cuckoo an atom Ernie are getting an opportunity to play tonight\nA cook who had a a a good pass early on up to a Nikita ... led to\nA couple of a scoring opportunities for the lightning but in this game right now he is a minus two circuits have minus three Ernie a minus one and the fourth line got caught\nOn the last school for Arizona on us three on to\nA I Believe that Dave and ... have a lightning guest and it is Derek ... who is standing by let's go to that interview right here on letting radio\nWell Derrick does not certainly with the lightning watered being done three nothing but it seemed like a couple of those ... and then you had a breakdown off the rush you decrease their chances to win the officers do do you feel that if you keep that up you can go to call your way back into this thing yeah it's going to be a tough\nPeriod to look at and the fact that ah everything against us pretty much self inflicted obviously we blew up coverage on a face off we lost the guy that three high for a non men rush and then we were unable to capitalize will opportunities was gonna be one of those frustrating periods would probably come out of it a chance in them or find yourself sounds from\nThree different players and Louis demeans later cuckoo an atom Ernie in the line up right now but just how challenging as his right now trying to adjust with Victor hadn't been not in a line up the top four lines obviously there's some different look there but how much has that been an adjustment so far tonight\nIt's obviously in judgment is more probably a Slater and that um there's some play in a while the full confidence we love our adopt a those guys had great camps or ... or season and Luis men excellent so I don't think that had a much to do with it it's just one of those periods where\nWe simply didn't execute and self inflicted ourselves into a couple of rules and that's\nWhat is the key is going into the second period to try to continue to test Ron time and maybe reestablish the for check yeah ... go get it you know when we had\nSome sustain ozone time we have some success and we have some good lox ah I think we just got us you know get some momentum here and hopefully we can get another ... kill the finish the period and you know I think our goal is trying to find yourself in this game after the second period are\nDerrick good luck the rest of the way

clicking on not\nSure it is and you know people think it's half for what title for you know if the Bible is correct in the ... you can see the people laughing\n[laughter]\nOur cameras stop rolling immediately after the blast the humor of the entire situation suddenly gave way to run for survival is huge chunks of weld lover fall everywhere\nPieces of meat past high over our heads while others were falling at our feet the dunes were rapidly evacuated as spectators escape close to falling debris and the overwhelming smell\nA parked car over a quarter of a mile from the blast side was talking to one large chunk the passenger compartment literally smash fortunately no human was hit as badly as the car over everyone on the scene was covered with small particles of Dan Quayle\nAs for the success of the effort on the seagulls who were supposed to clean things up we're nowhere in sight either scared away by the explosion or kept away by the smell that didn't really matter the remaining chance we have such a size that no respectable Segal would attempt to tackle anyway as darkness began to set in the highway crews were\nBack on the beach burying the remains including a large piece of the ... which never left the blast site that might be concluded that should've whale ever washed ashore and lane county again those in charge of not only remember what to do is they'll certainly remember what not to\nDo there you are in a way out Walt a um an offer on or early in the show and he said he described the one particular gigantic piece of blubber in a way I'll never forget the one that's locked into his car and he's the one who bitch that it was not a good idea\nAnd they wouldn't listen to him anyway he said he was standing there and he watched this giant piece of lumber go way\nUp into this kind of got small\nAnd then it just sort of hung their suspended way\nUp and this guy and then he watched it slowly begin to do sin like right out of a road runner cartoon and wouldn't you know the one guy who would object to do this whole project it headed square for just like in a road runner cartoon and slack and his car\nAbsolutely unbelievable anyway thank you channel two in Portland those of you are I'm sure it would like to see the video which is unbelievable to go with that wouldn't want to miss it\nThere it is the absolute truth about what a lot of people thought was only mid west or the Rockies you're on the air hello\nHi man why do they emerge from your caller well 'cause some people are rude to me on route back then when I heard I heard from your caller main route I yell at him [laughter] sometimes you do\nYou know there's callers like you that won't turn the radio off when they get on the air\nThat rude yeah it is a wise that well\nBecause it's confusing and it makes the callers I'm confused so I'm not\nConfused or you can turn your radio officer or ... or I Will cut you off\nThat's rude [noise]\nReally\nYou've got about three seconds two one zero you're cut off so you'll have to live with that ...\n... ... okay della how you doing by\nRegular item and stop yeah yeah and you know it's interesting both you say you might vote for power the a liberal Democrat within five pounds a Democrat and obviously that the hippie get pi racial problems they had held profile\nNo no no no he said he would vote for pound based on the color of his skin\n[laughter] I I had to drop it that way but in any case what I'm getting at it's Powell is more or less being forced to the front runner and he said he won't take second fiddle as I understand it or is it three quarter\nAnd that you know that'd be interesting thing or if Clinton a force that offers so we have a choice between Gore and Powell All right ah it's actually the American people are getting a couple more of a quote this valley\nApology Democrat Charlie whatever his name or [noise] so we're getting a lot of choice for a couple of liberals do you see it that way\nWell I don't know yet because I don't know enough about Powell\nPowell came out of New York university before he went to the point\nOf that but that doesn't necessarily mean anything well it\nIt doesn't who came a man who gave him his appointment well New York university is you know it was a hot weather or hot better liberalism\nYeah but I I Know but then he's got a military background so you could argue it either way you know an already background in Alabama\nWas unilateral disarming the United states while we weren't we weren't getting enough the Iraqis All right\nRight Sarah thank you I look I'm you can argue it either way you could argue somebody's uh\nSchedule background gave them a liberal bias or I could argue that his military background would give him a very conservative bias I don't think we know enough yet we don't know enough yeah that's that's the bottom line there's going to be lots of testing time in lots of listening ... head\nNow who do we know a lot about we know a lot about Bill Clinton and we know a lot about Bob Dole and I don't like the choice sorry I don't like the choice now\nI'm not saying I'm a bracing Colin Powell because how can I I don't know enough yet I just know I don't like the choice\nAnd you look at the polls you look at all the rest of it it's going to be do and it's going to be Clinton sorry I don't like the choice if there was another one I'm going to investigate it may not like that one either but I'm going to investigate it you betcha wildcard\nLine you're on the air yeah how's it going art okay\nThis is Mike in California yes

a great show that was\nOn Stephen King praised it a ... it's been getting you know terrific reviews from every corner ended deserves it it's just a great great story and it's told really well has nothing to do with the book right has very little to do with any of the other versions\nOf the ... house that I've ever seen I think I've seen every version they've ever made even the bootleg versions were these slightly changed the title\nUp but it was just ... it was great and I was skeptical of it going into it a ... and I wasn't really ready to commit to ten episodes I had a lot of moving stuff to do but they just it's that good so if you're looking for something to be a little bit spooky\nMore in the area of terror than horror\nVery suspenseful the hunting appeal house on Netflix um is is just one of the rare\nA Netflix series that lives up to all of its building I think everybody I've talked to watch his loved it I'll just tell you that much and I think what's even cooler like maybe the thing that has the most in common with with the original book and perhaps the original British version of the movie\nIs that\nThey they make a point to do a lot of stuff off just slightly off camera was a little bit out of frame\nSo it it there's there's plenty to you know give you a ... and ... but I mean there were some moments there where\nSome of the coolest stuff you can't see and that's what it was like in the first one I remember that as a kid when I went to go see it it was like I couldn't see it but it was it would almost scared me more than I could see it I I don't know if

LA one oh two point nine south tap off\n[noise]\n\nSo ah Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look at some of those steps that we had mentioned more vaguely two thousand eleven bar do Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt linkage shirt England\nWaiting for them and [laughter] yeah\nSo one at it's kind of like a little bit offensive but I'm On the other hand for brings people into your shop that's uh net win for them so it it's it's again rarely complicated to like a fascinating degree their whole economy there\nYeah it's a little bit like come in here get outta here come in here and what are you doing you know that exactly that\nThey get the money anyway so then do it so you mentioned that that you know because of the dean Halloween town it it it has done it and because of the ... the sheet shift you're aspect of of witchcraft as it was perceived\nAnd then that it's also a town where people spend a lot of time with you know where we'll and goes and and I'm assuming some of the other universal monsters make an appearance in Salem\nYeah so that's another aspect so we talked about it being you know which city we talked about it being Halloween town\nAnd then I also part of that they're kind of kind of horror land right you go down the street of Salem you're going to see not just which is which cost and you're going to the Frankenstein monster and you're gonna see Harry Potter and Voldemort or you're going to see you know the Addams family all these guys have there either by informing the actual street performers or as visitors\nUm good point that if you're a horror fan like horror movies than sailing you've got to kind of put that on your bucket list along with you know universal studios and some others in Hollywood and other places you want to go to the\nUm horror movie side so it's become a mecca for that as well if it has all these facets that kind of tired of them are dark I guess the ... the common denominator but they're all different than their own way\nWe're talking with Jay W Oscar a season with the which the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts um and at the same time you left the pirates right 'cause there's a there's a connection for probably the tears in ...\nThe sale built on the maritime trade there were some of the first people in the ... well not the country but before leaving the country who sent who've mapped out the Asian roots of trade like the first ever millionaire was a failing right because they were so good that trade overseas\nAnd of course that comes with pirates there's actually a pirate museum there and say on the line with the other stuff that you can kind of learn about you know they have similar stories most these coasts where all the kind of pirates had out here and there so they have a whole entire pirate chapter their history as well which again is another kind of weird layer the story of failing to have\nLike I said earlier like to do the layers above just being the side of a trial and back and fixing to\nThe uh yeah and it it's not just a trial of course to write it was a series but still those trials it was just listening to to talk about it earlier this year in in for people who have\nCaused inside or you know back and listen to the show it was ... I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... let out of jail than it is kind of you if you can test instead yet was really sorry about that then you go what are some people said no I'm not going to get this and then I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying but for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them didn't anyway\nThat right I Am ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck up for their belief all the things you're told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible such a great works of literature in place is because he kept right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or the end the population you said under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumps like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some some ... this is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more and more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country\nSo they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their whole started to pull a tourist and still happens their biggest one is October\nWhich will never go\nWell I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there they can make their entire year in the week that the states is open so I I I Would never guess shops are open for one month in in ...\nYeah but it but the other but what the realizing is there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nBut now we're starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museums so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round of film grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem ... or their rules a Laker curves that they that are either written or unwritten about how people are ... you know ... or to or how they want ... just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that it's actually about to leave here around have you on the other time of year there's not that many curbs\nBut in October for instance they are the burial ground which was the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting overrun and people were like using the graves as you know picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nBut that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar inside of a part of you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of tell people have the nights over start start heading the train and start having their cars\nFor their that's really good at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing this a hundred thousand people to the train you take some time so by midnight nobody around an aloe lean on\nAs ironic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the ...\nYeah yeah it was [laughter] it just gets bad [laughter] you're not really that that\nReally got to get them up before the ... or maybe the two and the real wishing happens after all the tourists Lee J double the locker or and or Edgar Award winning author thank you so much a season with the which the magic and mayhem of Halloween and Salem, Massachusetts is now on my bucket list thinks he's like I didn't have enough of my bucket list [laughter]\nThings are and have a great night effect I'm checking off one when I go to ... in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that coming up later on in November when I'll be back on Halloween or sorry on Thanksgiving weekend on coast to coast am All right\nSo you're going to want to hear that you're you're never going to ask you to men in my little because nine seven just got\nThe present in sunny ...\nNews radio knives seventies WFL age [noise] and then when you went to the two Clearwater [noise]\nAnd one of the things I learned that such true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers\nSo the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\n[noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged in allegedly and how it is choose mainstream you know notions\nWhat sensationalism means stories that inflamed the census right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily and at one point by the way this is a very real day to day\nConcern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird or white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law\nAnd journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the train\nUp but [noise] this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to to crime\nBefore her death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing\nAn ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or to set her size the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead in a synagogue where they should have been saying the ...\nAnd not run for your life\n[noise] ah all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine\nWhen we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up towards bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not wading into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind you'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that the

I had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is\nAnd I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime bucks but very off of a serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... and seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years honeybee out and start a series of crimes and he would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it\nAnd it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the uh with uh with with all the last last murders and the series so are we\nJust luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Sam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you say you found the arc type crimes for the prototype\nCrushed right he and he modeled ... he he perfected that crime then successfully after that um as as the years went forward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were sometimes over guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five [noise] the ah I think pretty while he used an axe to\nCommit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stock in his pocket or in his\nBelt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and could product um but um it was not what he was trying to do but his wife would do if you have to do\nTo get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to\nBullied all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train [noise] they\n... the general asked the question is the crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our of ourselves\nThat we don't like to talk about a crime stories are about lost and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but they they are part of everybody that I had the pleasure of knowing\nAnd and yet we we don't like to talk about them so\nWe covered them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of the uh uh\nThat's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader ... by the way the last book I read was the real crime but with the real world leader\nA it's a book by 'em back Weinstein's a rabid Weinstein I could have a lifetime or\nUh the uh I I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you know there should be a it'd be it\nAnd and one of the things I learned from reading that is the white American ... who was a an avid reader crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens was going to have him at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding it's it's very common among writers to be avid readers Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories\nBecause what I just talked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from\nSports I mean I actually I live in the sports world for the most part of the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try and do positive thing\nIdling hang on to that thought on crime stories that just were picking up the men from the train discovering most Americans most elusive\nAround the ... ones ... thousand ... ...\nAround people involved doing positive community things and writing demands from the train 'cause he likes to write about crime so do you want to finish that\n[noise] you're fading out there and I was not able to hear a lot of them\nAre fading out no Kennedy that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day and writing crime at night\nThey were saying that crime stories are very good because they they come from the parts of ourselves but we don't like to talk about and don't normally talk about and that sort of a man a crime I didn't make a deliberate and taught poll entry into the subject\nI got hooked like a\nA I was I was a documentary about the murders and all those guys were called ... it's an extremely well I'm a documentary him far above normal levels of crime documentary\nI was in that and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was messing which is that it's relatively our beer ... murders are a part of a serious so I started going to put an hour and who and who's trying to learn more about the series but the the our became\nA week the week of actually became five or six years\nOr so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a a true crime book her yeah\nYeah you know and that's the interesting piece too is that true crime you know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers who was the ... circuit riding preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day of somebody's execution\nAnd they would do a sermon just before the execution that we've tried to provide the context for why this person was being executed in wide the community overall would benefit from his or her death\nAnd it became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the preachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then he thought what this all just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their executions ... and then they would get passed around these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime narratives it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in it even though it's a hundred plus years later\nIn some cases you're trying to bring a kind of um a a a kind of healing anyway not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities maybe this this lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On an exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm there were things that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was a\nA a great great aunt had been was one of the victims of crime\nInternet here always believed that uh uh the man who\nUh was accused of murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released always claimed that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book back in our book that uh um it wasn't that we're not actually what had happened was\nJust a tremendous relief correct yeah that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about it\nIt was it was a shame that he was just tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually\nWith it was this other fellow I I don't know why it was important to him too well I understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it unpunished I I I don't know that there's a lot of different but it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think the book is go ahead go ahead no please no a lot of the book and a lot of ... book is about\nIs is that all all books all good books are search for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago and uh I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these\nThat these murders occur to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's ... it's sort of equal distance from me and them\nAnd that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but\nI Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was a whether the ... or what how people lived that they they lived rich meaningful lie is\nA ... people\nIn urban areas today think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives and which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that happened to happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they ... died terrible Beth I'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town\nOr a hundred years ago\nI think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story\nIn proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere and the tone for\nThe um the things that people age\nOr the way the houses were constructed ... communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St story telling and a journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThe ... and then there's ... there's what is it that always sticks with me that illustrate the point you were just banking and that has to do with the the soccer in the case of soccer in bands that you\nKnow one of them I think it would suck oh we had an alibi for the time of one of the crime is one of the crime was committed on December twenty fourth of I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a\nUm a he\nHad a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering\nA to his neighbors and an Italian community um a pickle deal because pickled deals were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because you're never buy the pickle deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in\nOn on ice for a couple of days before you eat them see a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right that would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian or the way that tell you an American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important in a crime story and that is what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details of of a or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us very effectively ...\nIowa I'm ended the crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a killer on the

his daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so sorry I got the wrong [laughter]\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing or you looked at these ah you looked at these murders\nAnd you put them in these different pockets you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove it\nOr ... or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to how many unsolved murders\nUm circumstances that are defining experiences in our life because that's how we know ourselves best [noise] so somebody who might have grown up in a very dysfunctional household\nTends to cleave toward dysfunctional relationships not go the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship to know how to act and so they keep re creating that until they break the habit [noise] um so fractals theory often explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and you saved\nYou know somebody from being destroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so that you could spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment ... thanks so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate\nBy recreating the circumstances all along the various ... of America\nWell ... that\nThere is something odd about him the vet he he was not terribly young it was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was a his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to him and that he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more\nSome variation but more specimens specificity ... along so that you know the early patterns or not that type but the the later patterns get closer and closer to the first God it's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that's\nThat's who he was a that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt that Mr ... had been the victim of terrible abuse has young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHe had tiny widely spaced teeth or he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look here that he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd it's a terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that it in any sense of justification for what he did it but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] you know the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the corps if that's what happened\nUm speaks to the age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally\nWhich makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've thought of this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know just an barking and come to the United states\nWell I don't know and you know there is speculation in the book has a lot of things we don't know about a year are you you're going to have no after you can have a speculative after it's up to you\nI wouldn't speculate that he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newt and family and that in Eighteen Ninety eight I I Would I wouldn't I don't I doubt that he'd ever killed anyone before that because there is an obvious lack of planning and\nPreparation for the of at ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I just very much which respect that he had been\nDead at inappropriate interactions with young girls that he had a\nA while you have if he had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't but like a nice guy enemies that feel that it is his the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was um it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carry to\nCarry the sangre pretty open by the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents driven about his life\nThe uh uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that that's a great point what year had gone into the navy do you know\nWe don't know no I'd be curious whether to find the tone in which she grew up in\nYes um and then check what\nYear he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there have been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge\n... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who is the victims of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they just you know they it it's a ... thing and and the ... they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not um it didn't have any charm it was not it was a ... a ... generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that maybe he was he was a true psychopath a psychopath have no fear of Arab ... norm at do not have normal fear and\nOne thing the apparent about this the ... from the trade is that from his crime that he was not\nEven not acting in fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with this for so long I this is probably not that I should have made this this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller andme after the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in ten years or Fifteen and\nGoing to say well here's what the James's miss they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed this whole story about\nThis this crime and it when that guy Illinois [laughter] and uh the I don't we don't

killer Bill James is the author and it's a it's just a terrific read very good writer a and a and yet you know until bill\nThere was not a lot in the ... he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was like ten or in longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know I mean just like even today we don't think about this people just driving around going up Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder but there are there are they get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through in a couple of weeks I'm\nIll I got a couple of questions first of all I Need you to answer for me it's a shame eight and ... like one of the act\nYeah but I really what any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe uh I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the Alaska murders were committed they ah it it's still\nIt's still around and and the has been the ... guide to the to the murders and the uh uh but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAll right uh you know whether this palm will Gary ...\nNo we don't it disappeared even ... it was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be but he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much got it all figured I figured he might have worked for the road because all he got every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but uh they can for being on the air and I appreciate destroy\nLike you might think we should that hey you know actually that's a really good question too about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\n... what ... what a in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal could make the murders on weekends this is taking to be a sign that he's employed a if a ... and if it happens a lot actually out there quite a few serial murderers who will who committed murders on\nWeekends or the or because they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to the um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working himself into the\nTrap stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that it's a lot of stocking but uh the just war himself in that frame of mind that he could get where he needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or was do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the these trains all over the country you\nKnow it was it was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen\nA ... and he came into town may no contact with anyone spoke to no one and this pair that was part of his\nCriminal Janice they ah they ah but ah so ... if his crime in the ... crime and Eighteen Ninety eight\nThey did buy a ticket to leave\nThe town and this this led to a trail forming behind him and police followed his\nWhere he had gone on the trains are for quite a while but later he was just it was just job as white used to railroads you always always used at the intersection of two railroad so they were trained came by the middle of night he could just hop on and they wouldn't be caught waiting you know if you have to we'll road you're less chance of the year\nThere'll be you'll be stranded waiting for trying to compare\nYeah this is a question that really forgot what it was\nNo that's an interesting point then it by the way when I told you about the the people that were murdered next to the railroad line in the town where I grew up they um that was the shoe sure the shoreline it was it's the the train no longer existed\nUm after like Thirty years or so but he used to be the major commuter rail road between\nMilwaukee and a Chicago I think or maybe even went further up north up to delay Green Bay or something and and the other guy\nThe other point the other question I was raised in there up until Nineteen oh eight or thereabouts\nHe a settled in an area for a period of time and committed crimes there that area after night in a way he started just morally more or less trapping it became a Nineteen Nineteen away tonight and Kenny transition through just\nRunning loose cross the country ... an interesting thing is that he never stole\nMoney at one of the ways you know with him is that why this line well up here in the newspaper story about money and other valuables were found in the room that and that happens all the time that that that there was a hit he does not steal anything from the crime scene\nYeah and that definitely is was a ... you know there's the accusation about the first crime that\nUh that that guy little was accused of that it was a a robbery and and\nIt yet you know at the at the same time ... let me ask you about the ... so the ... why do you think he would leave the is this the murder weapon at the scene I understand like in the godfather right when you wrap the handle and human drop the gun because there's no fingerprints for them to find or whatever\nBut it would seem like even then that would be some evidence to to look for somebody if they're if they leave the ax behind\nUp fingerprints exploded in the understanding of the American public and I can't afford ... five and his first crimes he just drop the accent left his buddy fingerprints\nOn the on the acts of mud once people became aware of the fact that fingerprints then he would washed\nHow Franklin or the ...
