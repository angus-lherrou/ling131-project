get a major downturn in a recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure and that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and government the recessions is bad thing\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot

blue I mean we've got shards from Pew Research that showed just in the last\nFive and ten years that we used to have both parties used to be more centrist not that far apart now they are extreme far apart there's the far right is the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal\nThat's why how he won he picked off the far right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this\nI'm much more difficult if the social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are polarized this cabin off thing it was just pure partisan\nYou know the Republicans believed him and the Democrats believed her the men believed him don't women believe ... I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality it was just political partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy\nAnd the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him and in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really I think that the social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republicans say damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff and the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate enough and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war\nOn the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge and I think there's going to be ... I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything that there is nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example that no middle ground it\nEither red or blue you know\nAnd his argument planets argument in hatred and bitterness on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy no that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost the salt and you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah

either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got ... it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year\nAnniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover in zero our\nIn our news letters than Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened\nEvery Ninety years since the industrial revolution caused the greatest boom and global his\nLawn you know Harry I've had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or you know there was one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ...\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and if I did or didn't happen that didn't happen then but it could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we're we're in the same position we were coming into a\nTwo thousand sixteen to market it gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally taught and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprised when and the markets were out of two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to upper eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a reversal\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that um and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just going to last night and\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea\nWhich would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or best in the polls on and noticed that there were going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble laughing pass\nNext to the end of next year but there is there is a fifty fifty chance of happening now and you don't want to get hit

I'm\nJust from the baby boom generation where they would predictably spent and when they would stop spent ... what we see is the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season it started in two thousand it\nWill be probably about two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see go boom again from about twenty two twenty three all the way in two thousand thirty six that'll be the next

as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bobble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spend much more of their money and\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three\nIs going to be way more on the downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only on George is a\nReal estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people that the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be best relation to be in the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war more what's that going to do to the economy\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two the\nDisruption a around the world and makes people angry as we're seeing now an even worse this time and then when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and it is a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\n... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming in there don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona to get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and then that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging now\nThey also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise] so so they're they're at risk of two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick and then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia and it's a big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack ahead\nOf ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this\nWe're gonna take your deposits and worked in a kind of bird them into equity in our dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing they're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so\nPeople have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money other than you need to pay your bills shouldn't be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that\nHave have it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen in people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens in in in in the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nAnd that's something we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nOr Mr ... I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion dollars for the hurricanes struck him because of all the corruption there which is the real reason why the recovery has been slow\nThe former New York governor George Pataki is having to head a committee so that the bondholders\nGet their money back to questions I live in Rochester here where a lot of the Puerto Ricans believe it or not or ending up they are lower skilled workers who are not finding work in us taxpayers are having to pay for their relief\nAnd uh the you're the first one to say that we're getting the better trained people laugh not happening up here ah in New York former Empire State and secondly California which is not friendly to business when people bleed state they insist on taking their\nShort sighted left wing politics with them they go to places like Texas formerly all red state which is now only purple or to sum this up uh these people with their left wing politics they're spreading their disease all over the place\nUh anti five the extreme left wing organization has taken over Portland Ore than the officials there are ...\nAnti run the city and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I Am saying flat out we're facing prove civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to beat each other's throats\nAnd a starting with that Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives that chance and ... and the same way that all all of these urban areas\nHave been struck dumb because of liberal democratic policies uh we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote you know heard instinct Democrat and because not too many of them vote republic\nBut we're going to definitely have a political huge political views this trade war we said in zero hour before this became obvious this is going to last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and there there could be some or but they're certainly\nGoing to be huge political and trade wars and things\n... heritage there with us we're coming back for final phone calls with you in just a moment on coast to coast they\nGet

because I when I started twenty three sixty thinks the path\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and got may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there to owner as we went too far and that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to bail pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes a changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nInto thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in the voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWhat will hit the I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly and the great depression but to put it on\nA permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and in the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place\nJust sin if you know send period ... to to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if they sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but\nIt would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer is only benefit of corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a mulch you're supposed to check you know he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend it rather than being you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or they get you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron download very good that you\nKnow hello there George in that area that question you mentioned earlier about the banks and you're making it again just now but uh the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite in the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems with farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to X brokerage money or pull account if they're going to do for the more fluent or towns and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with theory Dunn Hi Barbara North Carolina\nFor telling here okay thank you\nAnd I think you just answered that part of one of my question is why I asked\nA direct and I can't even buy a car and my parents were flying a lighting up oh I'm In my head and humiliate crumble on line\n... yup play all about timing\nAll about tiny one of my guiding the looming psychology and I tell you that you just answered my question about the smaller\nMy gosh how much um I don't have to worry about that so much\nLarger account holder is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure so security there's certainly going to take the benefits of a larger\nAccounts and more fluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever scenario and bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that so what oh deposits are insured they can ensure everything if you have a major club\nBut the smaller account if you spread out a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're gonna be weightless all of all that and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course when when things go bad people gonna hit foreign deposit is more Iceland\nWent down and basically all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again I still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans\nAnd business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it\nThey can't they can't pledge\nDoses reserves and well that's a good thing Harry thank you were at a time Harry's website at coast to coast damn dot com up next a psychiatrist looks at the paranormal\n\nFrom me and things

University throughout his entire life\nHe has had many close brushes with death as well starting in the womb\nSet a number of paranormal or a novelist experiences visions breed cognitive dreams auto body experiences encounters with message Barry ... says well welcome to the program Dr many basis on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started up\nWell I think it was because I almost died so many times you know when my book the borders Norma first came out many people asked me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me that my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nAdopted bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he's told by patients and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nPlus stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from I own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I had the experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls with that so many ... that [noise] um you know\nIt's been a lot of ... about the near death experience\nMhm [noise] but\nThe um term near death experience you know it's coming back Dr vehement moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right\nI think he estimated that something like one thirty Americans that had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people but there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never would pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I look at how my close brushes with death effected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\n[noise] in other words I'm having had all these close cause of death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found get myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then they and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual their first um couple the paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything that might just kind of ... the ... you know\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would leave me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went to um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeeze\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it that the the um anonymous stem cells donated pollen allergen it pass by an ...\nWith more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer I just feel like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nAlthough super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I got leukemia ooh jeeze um yeah\nAnd I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital and I had numerous um sled transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said we can't keep giving you a team of therapy because it's doing tremendous damage to your body\nWas it was still in remission\n[noise] well\nYou have to be in the mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that fight against that they gave me the transplant\nHuh [noise] now that the person who gave me the transplant he was an anonymous donor that the rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them\nAnd I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... it was a member of the U.S navy and when his name came up\nOn the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf\nWow [noise] so\nHe was flown back into the donors sent from Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of his themselves and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fine ever since\nThen have you still in touch with them the happened\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life\nAnd they hear altruism you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed and he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is that she swab\nI said that's it yeah it just it takes a lot to get the DNA so that's when his name into the donor bang and then um\nYears later by name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know\nWe found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live\nCloser but yes we've become friends then I just saw not too long ago\nDr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic Rome has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice [noise]\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients\nGenerally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to the if the ... [noise] however since I had that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between ... experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common [noise] you know for example um if someone is very if they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will\nBe some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel just touched on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common\nIn fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post death contact with a loved one even if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know an atheist and like not to have these experiences as well as religious people\nYou see that everyone is psyche again I I tend to believe you can agree with you\nOK but uh when you said that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or the cognitive beams and other things you've talked to both touches visions of voices and so on\nDeathbed visions near death experiences so certain types of fake experiences such as ESP\nAnd collapse of the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that first and then you say oh you must be ... I was just thinking about\nYou right now is that very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I've started to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic roam out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better rather than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families [noise] um\nGood low traffic in both directions or two Seventy five to ... county nuclear on the sunshine skyway bridge\nI'm AJ Springer news radio nine Seventy WFL I\n[noise] like a lot of these guys in Seventy four degrees are low temperature eighty nine for a high on friday sun shining clouds a cold front passing through the area with a slight chance of rain and ten percent\nAnd lower humidity for Saturday morning that's right sixty Seventy degrees of started the day plenty of sun beautiful day eighty eight for a high\nBy Sunday they'll some returning humidity Ninety One degrees Seventy one in the morning a slight chance of showers and for Monday of twenty percent range dance near Ninety voters northwest when the ten Nazis one or two a light job on day waters I'm used to like keep it around just Steve derby British radio nine Seventy WFL a\nFox News I'm Carmen Robert hurricane Michael changes the panhandle for ever Florida governor Rick Scott\nThis monster storm devastated the Gulf Coast and our pan handle so many lives have been changed forever so many families have lost everything\nHomes are gone businesses are gone\nResidents called the destruction unbelievable that I've been in Panama City over sixty years this is the worst I've ever seen in my parents had motels on the beach and it was the worst they've ever seen and we've never left for hurricane\nStorms heading out to see now over Virginia and Congress demands answers from ...\nThe radio about a journalist missing in Turkey\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham is warning there will be what he calls I bipartisan tsunami building if it turns out that Saudi Arabia was behind the disappearance of a possible murder a journalist ...\nSciences at Henry this is Fox News [noise]\nNews radio nine Seventy WFL a\nYou go on the eye heart radio downloaded now lightning\nBlue jackets tomorrow night at six or nine Seventy WFL a the home of lightning to be there are certain God given rights to be said to have shelter medicine clothing with many of our clients come does they faced a greater risk of losing much of what they have in some cases losing everything\nI'm John Morgan Morgan Morgan\nIn one instance an accident a natural disaster or the CFL a\nLot about hearing aids duty whole set of they have an ... guy to nine Ninety nine that when you\nReally\nKnow huge\nKnow real on\n\nLoaded will land\nFrom somewhere out there loses coast to coast am George Nouri\n[noise] there are normal day dot com is a hundred and twenty five people away from Seventy five thousand members go ahead and sign up at permanent paranormal data dot com and also in your app stores now\nYou can get the paranormal dating app that's right that's all you're going to do a search for paranormal date in the stores the capture free go ahead and do it\nAnd now here's something for you that you'll think go forever\nAging can make a wish for younger days but since we can't go back in time we turned to products to give us a more youthful look now there is\nInstantly ageless with immediate results on bags into your eyes spores roast beef fine lines and wrinkle know needle no pay just a simple cream applied lightly it's great for men and women and can easily be before makeup doctors agree instantly ageless works like this clip from the doctors\nBut I Want you don't want to imagine a cream that can certainly remove your under I back put into the past with our good friend Dr ... nearby\nProducts or even if the if it works it's called instantly inch less and the idea that it works very quickly and he just said a ...\nNow and then you pay for him I feel a little bit I had just looked at what's in the ... and one of them is something called ... which is kind of a dialing in the ... the right now is tighter than it actually relax also come kind of odd I sent to relax I work like\nThat and I can literally stand by and you're\nReading it still can switch countless acts like a clay minerals and they're making that kind of tight area actually increasing tension on the skin to hand it had\nInstantly ageless today go to our exclusive website H.

paranormal phenomenon Mandy let's talk a little bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that though you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative\nUm that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh they're so until you mentioned her name she was out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospice\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that I brings up another subject which is sometimes people\nThe messages and cream switch on the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them a message\nThat's the question like where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added we could have coming from the spirit world\n[noise] you know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear mhm you know um and maybe it's just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nOr there there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government to leaders\nTo to assassinate them and you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know when I was dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although\nWe don't really know and how how did we know it's right you know so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable mhm\n[noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't ... cognitive gene which is the message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up\nThis is the message I got I I just saw these where it said this is\nA world of illusion ... and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have permission about the ides of march\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she dreamt that he was going to be assassinated\nShe backed him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with his favorite told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he ... ignored his wife and he was killed so\nYeah that was a very strong permission premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their premonition still many\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know that said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregarded things\nWhich could be dismissed that superstition there's always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was about horse racing and ... one of his friends apparently really understood who's going to win the race but didn't bet on that horse spent on something else some loss\nIn ... in the movie screaming at ground you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that it is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think people are they don't believe in\nThey don't believe it and also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\n\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery\nAnd then when they\nRecover from the anesthesia and they wake up to ... to tell the doctors and nurses\nAre what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies there was one patient who was blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the patent on his doctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded\nThere was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures and he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on\nAnd then when he when he recovered they couldn't find where she put his dentures and he wanted his teeth back right back but then\nThen they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wow yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's pure norm\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual\nI mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or mystical their mysterious Israel different words are being used to describe the same\nEvent so I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component yeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\nOh definitely\nI think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live our routine nine to five eight you know day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many make this we're going to take phone calls your goals your stories about pre cognitive dreams and so many other things\nYou were just talking about here on the coast to coast

getting into the music\nBallet one oh two point nine cells Tampa\n\n\nOkay welcome back to our final hour with Dr many major U.S we're talking about his work the borders of normal\nAs a psychiatrist in you do have to decide whether the person is truly experiencing a psychic issue or is a psychotic how do you tell the difference man\nWell the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone's hearing voices they're certain qualities that would distinguish the psychic from a psychotic experience for example of someone who is the voice\nI'm a psychotic hallucination tends to be very very frightening it's also very frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices\nIt could be the sound of machinery or insect\nThere may be more than one voice to have the voices talking to each other about the person the voices might be an accusatory or threatening whereas I'm psychic hallucinations and to be infrequent\nThey may occur only once or twice in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and climbing the other thing is with psychosis\nYou can't just look at when symptoms such as hearing the voice you have to look at the whole person\nBecause psychosis is the major mental disorder which affects the person's ability to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work or within the family\nIf they if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other symptoms aside from the hallucinations for example the thought disorder or paranoid id Asian or you know feelings have ...\n... people are talking about them this type of thing so there's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nCan you make a misdiagnosis ... conceivable\nYes in fact it had happened there is a psychologist that did an experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had each one of them go to a different emergency room and had different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patients while they were patients they were actors pretending to be patient ahah but they were misdiagnosed as schizophrenia ... they're admitted to the word they were given medication\nThey didn't take medication and once they got the word the patients knew that they were faking so they were able to fool the doctors but they were unable to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how do they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal aside from the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their appearance their behavior the conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them completely normal so that's why I say you can make the diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come to doctors couldn't figure that out\nWell unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes\nWell that's true [laughter] but but the patients that\nI think because well the patients live with it they they know the honest so well\nThey know the symptoms and everything that's right\nAll right let's take some calls him for your duty in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting and waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot about brain I have been a mistake and that had visions all my life and I have that many many near death experiences where I have left my body\nBut I think one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me is when I went to London as an adult and I saw a picture of\nThe war room where they did all the major planning for their European front ... well\nThat's where I used to go as out of body experience when I was little and there were a whole bunch of us up up above kind of sitting like in the balcony and we were all in spirit that not ... and\nThey were very upset because I was so young and they didn't think I should be\n[laughter] but you did that as a remote viewing huh\nNo I Would I was out of the body gravel and when I saw the picture of the war room I realize that's where I had been as a child\nAbuse still been able to duplicate that\nWell not lately I usually go where there is a really intense suffering like when the Israeli people and we were hiding under the along with sewage\nCanal you what was that the fifty seven more Nineteen sixty seven sixty seven yeah um I I go to places that are are really really bad\nWhy I don't know whether I'm there to help balance\nWhat do you think of as many\nWell I'm curious to know do you have these experiences when you're sleeping or when you're away\nWhen I was little they were when I was sleeping\nOr the other ones where I've been out of body I'm just waking up okay between sleep in and awake but the most interesting experience I think I've ever had\nIs what I always looking searching for meaning because I was very depressed because I'm In physical form in series you know we're on\nThe love that you feel when you were in that particular place of knowing what all income cussing love is\nAnd when I was during meditation or we say can and I could see if you know what glitter looks like in a in a like a a helmet for a motorcycle helmet yes how different angles well this was alive\nLight and the whole screen of my vision was filled with as glittering beautiful good from color orange and yellow\nAnd I could hear the voice saying this is love and\nI was ... totally engulfed in it and it was just a beautiful experience but\nI found listening to people talk about near death experiences mine near death experiences aren't when they're just\nI'm Out of my body and I'm seeing what's going on and I the last time it happened I was in surgery and as I came back into my body I could hear the the anesthesiologist saying we're losing her and I thought\nYou know he's saying I'm back here yeah all\nRight [laughter] but you know that type of stuff and that's the reason I I called was the question about what is the difference between schizophrenia and having these types of visually because I'd been up\nAll right that's that's kind of a fine line isn't it many\nWell yes and no like I said with had study where these patients were misdiagnosed because they reported hearing voices but otherwise they were fine so the question is whether the person can carry on with their daily life or whether they're able to function or whether is an illness that's interfering with their life\nSo you can make a diagnosis just on the basis of the fact that a person is hearing voices are having other body experiences that would lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia because someone with a diagnosis schizophrenia has to have a thought disorder as well they have to have problems with their thinking and with their emotions\nFrom the train traffic center powered by climate designed machine
