impactful social media platform on the Web to kill it Google has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported\nThat the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring not expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus for Google Plus\nIs is a Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um there's going to be missed\n... if you're going to be missed by millions of people you know this is the story that's been going on for ages with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise] really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy her latest\nBook so there was no separate income stream coming from it\nIn the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have you got to have the sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's going on\nBut sizes everything was social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\n... all the right at the top of they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't is they found that in a during a if I understand that during their own audit their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school and\nThe kinds of information that we're that we're theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that a lot of stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well\nWhy stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation and they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but\nThey they should have discussed that publicly of the first place um and ah it would've been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who've been using Google Plus all these years of trying to find other places to go works\nAnd I think with other things that are mentioned that there the Google commercial version of Google ...\nWhich operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month for perhaps using of that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially or and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably about a good idea of the first place\nThat's a time at ... at the end at the time\nThat it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did

say yes they were very surprised to hear that uh but I think I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up with the pre cognition tell the ... cycle couldn't he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nSo the computer will vary that picture shown sometimes it's a violent picture sometimes at the picture of a peaceful landscape like a mountain or river want something that wouldn't arouse the body\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect I think Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture show\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chew videotapes of various anchor people and ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience and they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in present meant experiments measuring skin response\nMuseum work no cycle Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nAgain this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm\nConsciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that have been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run a Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and\nHe also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is this ability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent once\nOver time what\nThe experiment does is asked people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more once again what do we find is that they're at the mall but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible response is during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd in people people have that ability or have\nThat's right George those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators were set up around the world that people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're\nGenerating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world around an event\nThat we know a producer heightened emotion and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant ... basically at a at a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened\nBefore the plane hit the towers\nBefore the event that\nBefore the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nOr in jail or you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did\nFor psycho Comey says she had the ability to bend spoons and keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who said doll which trickery its magic but the the ... believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nCandidate B. taught can cycle can ... be taught\nWell I've heard of of food and bending party which sounds ridiculous but\nAh I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually\nBending metal for example and early ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw Keller then and there\nAre many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gal are very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I clued in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons pending it's in the context of remote viewing mhm bellies and what they say and this is a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching it closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo you know there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that\nStudies were around and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that down totally crazy\nMark would you give out

shows that light that everybody seems to see going into that tunnel or whether something is really going on here\n... is a difficult call isn't it\nYeah I'm Glad you brought this up to ... they're really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was the nation perhaps it gets into a window into a reality that we typically don't eat with our eyes that I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having a look at the evidence to me the most compelling evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies\nSo this is where people have their in cardiac arrest ever started hated and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than ... people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for Apple Dr ... a party at from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in cardiac arrest severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm wanting apple in particular is from doctors and party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation and two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience ... where he heard something in the room\nThis later found to be the difficulty later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this new doesn't experience there floating above their body\nThey see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experiencing memories are but\nWhat I've found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson as one person in particular\nWho's looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you described where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMark who you are on six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that they are in\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit with this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat's such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and our ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver\nOf the electromagnetic spectrum and what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us at our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic\nYou've learned a lot haven't you [laughter]\nI have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb\nIt let's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid at Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist than a materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah\nThere is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and the ... ah where where the mind I Would use the word mine not sold but mine are conscious just goes uh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there's no God or no devil\nI Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I Would call it may be senior Larry to you know space no time\nA dimension but my question to you is specifically I like to\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about the site medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers ...\nSack chemically the brain and therefore they do affect\nChemical you the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen\nCan that can affect the brain that through the headaches going back to ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and in the mind that's my first part my second part\nOf the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious is the mines dusting that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that if\nThe mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\n\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's ... medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue that says well is that correlation does not always imply causation\nIn other words just because two things are related to one another we can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not caused the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related to the fire\nSo I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness\nYou damage the brain if you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain and conscious experience but it's not the\nProducer of consciousness when what do you think mark reincarnation [laughter] well I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about\nThe studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children\nAnd it just does remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes they're five by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nYes and in some cases the medical records are found so\nIt's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drumming let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to\nSomething beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another offensively\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm Monique go ahead\nHi George and why I have a question for your gas sure how high thank you for a ban on the show\nSo I'm back in two thousand and one I here and [noise]\nIf you

what abreast of the earth\nWhich you know again if everything to rise from consciousness that's the same thing that Michael ... talks\nAbout ... with consciousness woman sound like you're open\nTo the possibility that there's something very unusual going on\nYes I'm In my work in my work I've often not often but several times over my career I had the opportunity to accompany a rural folks farm folks\nOn ... with water which in yes okay I've seen it work [laughter] see at work and then seeing the drillers calm and drill right to that same to adapt\nAnd there it is ... and ... you\nKnow again I'm a scientist\nSo it's not that there is this something there that\nWe don't fully understand\nAnd then can we see that it's the dolls or the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's suppose that ah the Dow is er and I've seen it with three different methods brass Raj willow sticks and ... over a map\nMhm okay I'll watch pendulum over a map which was the most strangest one of all [laughter] that somebody could they could find water and yet there it is up comes to water [laughter] so are is\nThe Dow is there a particularly sensitive to the uh electromagnetic flux than the earth caused by the water moving through various layers of conducting semi conducting insulating properties who knows when she has a scientist\nWe need to we in science cannot ignore this cannot ignore this going all the way back to your your your guest mentioned William James okay all that whole period when all of this a lot of this early early research started into\nShall we say five to ... and other other sorts of things and I I I mean I've never seen a U.S I've never seen what I could call it ... the night sky and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI so often when I never did before but I saw two yeah\nYeah so I Can't I Can't even put up all this stuff that has to do for instance a desert tortoises will show\nUp at the mud hole the desert tortoise in the southwest will show up at the mud hole prior to when the rain\nComes within\nWithin just now maybe that's something to do with the change in the air pressure\nAnd they know but yeah they\nCan feel it it's a it's they're reading something but to the to the to to to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal the pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things Steven just said we're on her way isn't it\nYeah even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's a academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is what he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field a physics\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglements and the very basic phenomenon is you have two particles two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect which suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness\nNow I Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light was the fastest anything to travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between distant particles\nThat there are things in the ... and the fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do I get ... this is open me out completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on that brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which if we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but\nTo me that this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nOr I my friend mark thank you again

stories that we're going to talk about them now the name of the book by wrong collected Maureen would more goes chronicles stories from the wrong with the unknown the unexplained and the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic tranche medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe is communicated with the ... since the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with Maureen Cabot\nWas the official which of Salem, Massachusetts and she took Moreno under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand but also control this gift\nOf the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult San says she's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more he has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nThank you so much for having me look good for to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you yes\nUh I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know he's very a a wonderful woman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned in the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high priest is salmon and feel often\nWhen I was younger I see her walking around town you know dressed in her her garb and very regal looking very on you know she's the president of a person and ... at\nThe time people welcome or with open arms who did they go oh my God there's er which\nYeah that's a great question you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but let's just say that town and Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it\nAlways seems to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft\nAnd um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right for the type\nOf isn't it you know go to town on so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ...\nNow you are a fifth generation psychic trance medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family you sent disability what year are who did it start with\nNo my um [noise] it's interesting\nBecause growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she gets you know my father though he thought the girls in the same\nUm but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was seeing and I mean it was normal it did seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just that you know she didn't tell my father she is normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still you know involved but say in the metaphysical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in there and\nHe finally told me that if you don't want Marlene ... from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll than of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and you're waiting for them and she said you know I hear the spirit\nBut I just turn up the radio so\nWould you say that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so\nI never really knew her um\nBut my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing reading for people who I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot of really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed down stories from one to the others that you could carry through\nNow the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and that she was maybe\nFive years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she had a picture of her and she looked like a gypsy\nUm and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her truth out she was very unique that what you said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about the earth anyway\nYou've been with the New England new ghost project Maureen since two thousand one would use that\n\nAh well Rwanda do much better than me to tell the story but he's started this story after on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special court for class that he took\nTo try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness I'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he started cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing it on goes that his workshop\nAnd again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus on but it's a team of individuals\nThat you know over the years I've learned is you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to gather you'd go out and you look for the things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to [noise]\nTo want to look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain and people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so\nIt's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually worked because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help on\nHow many people are just so off the wall when you go to their house and then you're just using it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nYou know show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\nUm you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred investigations\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we are big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience that you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's good reason why you don't see it [noise]\nUm so if you say how many people I say good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street you'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat do you conclude about what this may be a lot of people have their thoughts about what goes your what do you think there\nWell I think\nThere are varying degrees of what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they passed\nOn but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house\nUm there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then they might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door to door closed\nIn her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs or you know all these\nOut she'd have something go on in the oven she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in foil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her oven I'm it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look and the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nSo after a few minutes I'm thinking oh dear God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know a spirit of a man very angry I'm very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this is a man no it's not and he was getting\nAdamant that you know it wasn't and I need to talk to use them brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right\nI'm elite Ron up at the top of the driveway with the guy knows any rags me down on the driveway and he looks at me he said I Want you come back here tonight by yourself\nAnd I said well you know I really don't feel it's a little girl you got to be careful\nYou know you don't want to welcome in something that you don't know is there and [noise] and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of jail for murdering\nMy best friend she said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want\nTo hear and I thought oh God I just have to get out of here so that\nThat is scary and we'll be back in the moment with more on coast to coast [noise]\n[noise] and whether by heart radio ... is that what your Web LA\n\nFor the

for it and I'm a member of the Mets came in and she told all about uh how they used to come in in the morning and sometimes they would find books in the middle of a floor and they couldn't understand why it happened so she finished do let us be on\nOne side and then I got up and began to talk it suicide began to speak one of the books from behind me came\nFlying into the middle of Rome in front of thirty five feces and there's no way they would just fall\nNo it was like just fall down behind the I mean as they come flying by being in\nLike somebody was throwing them at you\nExactly they and like I said with thirty five people started I didn't see and unfortunately because my back was directed to it but I saw the book but by and screams [laughter]\nDo you think there was somebody back [laughter] tossing they match you\nI'd certainly looked in ... so you know but that was just the ...\n... what has for you that you know on the cases that you've been in have you ever felt that your life was in danger\nOr never fight the dead\nNot funded by the leaving me\nAnd I first book or goes chronicles is ... is the second book on the series a marine and I didn't investigation was daytime investigations jumped him and called me up and asked me to check out his house so I\nGet ... you know we went to his house and the places that massively looked like it had been trashed and\nThis guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there and ah so anyways uh they were pretty big ... ah and ah they kind of got us for a while after we did our thing and one of ...\nReady to me from the other one and the other one talked marine we later found out that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and ah so he wanted marina comeback alone but that didn't turn out so if there was any fair was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine it's\nIt's one that's left an impression with us\nI think so what kind of equipment Ron do you bring with you\nA very on on on the particular case uh\nThe you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people more a piece of equipment or\nThe small cage the lesser amount but you always want to um you know tried to bring the proper equipment that you wouldn't eat for instance if you have reports of a ... be unseen\nYou might bring more video equipment or a thermal or I or whatever but you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by\nAudio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies avoiding gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization\nThat you've come across a I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization of a visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it or judges that they weren't really well I was ghost towns in war while I was just doing normal stuff yeah\nI work with a lot of White House history funds for him and we do you know public goes on and that type of stuff and there are two separate occasions when I Do these goes to his own board of directors of Bush on top of a White House that we do these hot to toys and one time we were in this um [noise]\nIt's a like an observation tower where it's a square building with glass all around you and says windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and those who want to do it in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them doing my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman\nA walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down to the side of the wall you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I don't want to repeat myself as she came and then they didn't want her to missing anything so I stopped and waited for like I saw her continually walk all the way to do it and I waited\nAnd waited and yet nobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my bill to wait for her to walk it\nAnd yet there was no one here and oddly enough that's a vocation is with the ... because it's on the coast guard base a coast guard report and she and women walking on the wall in that same location so that\nWas kind of intriguing I'm\nA ... the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we get a public or goes on ah what Iowa lighthouse in Bedford pool meal Maine we were in the White House ah keep his house it was on\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on a picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen and I look towards the kitchen my service dog all across the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the there was no there\nWas no sign it out so I jumped up and meal you're into the kitchen\nAnd the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to a woman and she says why would you see that's just that's our dog she says can you describe it sure absolutely as far as clear as day and I described the dog she just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so I Would die lighthouse keepers afterward took care of him until the dog actually died in Ireland she says the dog you describe pretty much matches\nBecause she has a dog\nThat of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean his two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it\nCertainly saw it would appear to me as a ...\nMinute still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back in both of you are old will take phone calls

I don't know if you've\nSeen that yet or no I haven't seen that yeah it has it's pretty that's Iran is our number ... ... dot com but it's pretty cool sorry about that\nMaybe we can concentrate and bring them down from a four to nothing\nSo that would be good [laughter]\nWe've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do anything because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to you\nKnow she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to note somewhat about a for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to know a where the cost of tree you're you're investigating for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of particular area you might want to concentrate your audio recordings or if\nIf the ... are a visual phenomena or in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you kind of you have to have a little bit of it I tried to get too much into the details with tour of the coin is for like a robot or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it would what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for ... strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question because then that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know\nYou know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you hear from people but you know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know if they want help to move on that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want the ghost out of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know basically a you know what you expect from us in a in a very at the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house Clinton discipline we're not going to do it without you know a a referral to someone else\nUm but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls for both of you let's go to brandy and granted big California Welcome to the program I brandy\nHuh hey thank you for taking my call um [noise] yeah I had a question um I've had a really really rough year after year that's probably the worst year of my life and [noise]\nAnd I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me if you see here next coming or being a lot better per week starting to go more my way\nMaureen this would be for you\nKnow that's for sure yes yes at what\nUm okay so Brandi I did pull a couple of cards for you on and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding onto a lot of hurt\nThat have been happening around you right um and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but you know and the other kind of a poll is you know this was last year now and things that have been happening is like a pressure right so because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I wouldn't tell you is that\nFor you to get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that I hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that is taking place it's a learning lesson right now for you\nUm and it's a time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust that it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but\nI'm calling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying um but you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day routines are really trying to put on the mask but you're not feeling\nIs that correct or now a right [noise] yeah okay right so put ... think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a healing hand that you have and I used to me you have to go to person feels like a lot of people when they come to you and they have an issue is that correct\n\nThat you tend to be the ear that people talk to like someone I was there\nYeah yeah [laughter] okay so you need to know that you know you have to have\nPatience with yourself and your situation okay\nUm how many is coming so know that you you are coming to a breakthrough it is going to get better but I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two rights you almost have to feel it feel that strength inside of you again which you're kind of like well how do I get that back\nUm and a lot of it is balance right is finding a balance in your life is what you really need to do at this moment\nAlright thanks good luck brand new hope everything works out for you during this time do you do you find Ron Maureen the these investigations are more prevalent during the Halloween season or does it matter\n[laughter] [laughter] it it\nDoesn't matter but you know what even Ron I'm sure would agree as early on I mean a lot of people have that and they think while it's October Halloween teasing right we need to be out there um and I say over the years that might have started when I joined the group that was more it was busy or around that time of year but now I think Ron would say is probably Disney constantly\nMaureen what do you think we'd be bored [laughter]\nFunny you bring that up um you know I think that they're a tool I don't\nThink that's something to be afraid of them I just think it's ... it's the intention that you use when you're using that we ... so if you're you know you're drinking you're using the ... then that's probably not a good idea um because you're not\nOpen and you're not protecting yourself and um we had a actually a case of a woman who had some issues by using a lead you board and I believe she lives on\nHaving you know getting high at the time or whatever she was doing 'em and she invited the spirit end and her how her whole life rather went into chaos her home burnt down a she pretty much lost everything\nUh and we were actually called in an investigation on a different home she lives in that she was now losing that home um so\nI don't know what do you think about it wrong\nYou know a a a bite parish priest called me and asked me that same question what do you think of what we do boards\nI says I've got a collection of the the games [laughter] uh and uh I Do I have a collection of all different ones for use\nThose most good hope confess the kid is too [laughter] but ah not go on to say though if you're not comfortable doing anything don't do it because you don't trust it goes\nNext something let's go to Matthew in Illinois first time caller he mapped go ahead\nWhy George either um\n... or so I Love the show like you ...
