earlier that day we're talking about friday the twelfth of October\nA woman and the mother and wife are in Sims Barry Connecticut got up at six AM she was standing in her bathroom\nAnd suddenly

venture off the surface of it moving over or how slowly headed for a row of trees and within thirty seconds or a minute it just disappeared from her said\nYeah she did hear a home and that raises the

couldn't see any wings couldn't see a tailor windows and he pulled it it was so intriguing and he pulled his car off the roadway and share and looked at it\nAnd it was at that point he realized that it was symmetrical it was papers both in the front and back it just strict off across his head into the northwestern sky and disappeared from from his site\nNext report was from the next day October

from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I called psyche\nVampires but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I tried to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories where they've changed and people begin to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but\nI get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's a terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary [noise] so that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates ... the ... billion a year and then I just want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate Joyce\nSure that'll be great how you're on a charge that that's\nThe one that started with Christian Tampa Bay Florida Chris or been born on October ten on October sixteen Nineteen Seventy October sixteen Nineteen Seventy Hey Chris welcome\nOh thank you [laughter] have happy\nBirthday [laughter] I don't have\nMuch more than one\nOkay so ... ten sixteen so you have a really wonderful new cycle beginning but it has to do with creativity\nYou have a question Chris oh\nI'm very much a creature routine and I just wanted to give their routines and our break his routine you're boring after a while\nYeah but you're in Tampa that area is not boring it all to shift their and Tampa is a terrific area and do you ever do any kind of painting or art work\nI'm I'm ... I used to I Do some writing now yes well you have a\nMonth and very go at the time you were born and that tells me that you're you're extremely intuitive and you're very caught up with details when you paint you shouldn't be painting again that's very therapeutic for you Chris\nAnd that'll bring and wonderful spirit energy as well so you have a lot of intuitive abilities you have enough no Pisces so I Know you can read people very quickly so\nI thank you very much for calling it did you have a question\nNo that was there but thank you very much\nSaying okay this is Chris and Russia last yeah hey there's nothing wrong with being in a routine is their Joyce\nNo but you know what sometimes have become really really discouraged and you say they have to be something else so at that point you have to it's very very hard to get out of Iraq really difficult for the most difficult things on the planet at that point you have to force yourself to do something you really don't want it to like whatever that might be\nA ... you know just just do it and go out you fit your energy will change change your energy and so on and change your life and try prayer and meditation the you know what God I'm stuck and bring me something fresh and something no unfair it will work with you\nDo you work with people teaching them a psychic abilities\nSure uh not only that but what the new website was starting which I mentioned before which is on my website we're going to be training people to be helping them and uh in in all of my books I say the same thing you don't have to pay a psychic or anything you can do this yourself\nIt's a God given talent that we all have just pay attention to your feelings listen to what you're hearing and stop doubting yourself and stopped saying it's my imagination\nYou know when you get that late night phone number going you're going to get a lot of insomniacs calling you\n[laughter] well that's okay [laughter] I'm probably up [laughter] to me I Hope it's twenty four seven lines so you can call in\nTo the ... got a question for you in Canada and the international line I David go ahead\nYou're more than a third good lady um passed away last\nMonday of this they\nAll ... they lived December ... my two forty seven and then he was ... okay well you\nMight be able to go after she thought very highly of you and you know she puts a handout on your Dave and she says Dave I'm fine and she's also thanking you did you help her to cross over to help her before she passed\nA law was not there are other than his friends there with her she uh\nShe's very generously said a very good heart and she said thank you for saying that she thinks she thank you day so you must have been pretty pretty nice to her\nSaying oh shoot the greatest one of the greatest before\nI mean I can tell her energy is extraordinary very good heart center is\nKind you could ask for anything she would do anything for anyone but taken out different from that yourself you very much like that you have a very good hurt yourself and don't create for her she's saying look I'm Dave I'm fine\nYou know Jewish we're not going to escape that that'll that'll probably not\nGoing to happen to all of us are hopefully leaders in sooner but a user anything people can do to kind of mentally prepare themselves for this ... this trip yeah\nDon't be afraid and know that you're never alone even if you go through the tunnel that follows the physical death even then you're not alone you have always you always have an angel or a guide with you and then when you cross over to the other side it's fabulous\nYou created by people you know it's a big party and those of us who left here are grieving somewhere probably you know feeling really bad about it\nBut it's

Maine yet when my father had been transferred to the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died in hospital the doctor told my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and he came back so that\nThat is one of the experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books I must tell you George I don't remember anything much from what happened when I was out of my body age three members rather hard living on this uh afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\n... died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions and this is an appendectomy in an operating room and that time I remember what happened it sounds like the classic empty to begin with up onto the field are you looking at the the the the the scalp all of the ... not money to be around going down\nDown the beach down to loosen up talk of some pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate wanted to do with an old marine nine year old kid would want to do go on the ride go some addresses\nSo I'm going to learn a pack age nine in my Astros body and I'm drawn into I didn't know that goes straight maybe\nI'm drawn into another world and we're I'm deceived by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that rather than I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bit back eventually out this evening to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked\nTo find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding\nThat there will be on the physical nine years old who you talk about this she tried to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something the first person who could explain to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition\nIs it oh yeah we do that we get sick really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same\nAnd sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings my goal dissociation\nWas an ability to travel beyond the buddy traveling consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily I don't understand is there a world beyond the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell on the phone not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I I'm On my father's in the army and so we're moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you one of the things that kept me going is it amongst ... companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and upping face\nBecome and sit on my dad didn't say backup Robin you know you've got to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and\nOne day all day you can't kill your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you that invisible companion George was the older rubbing younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe have time travel is in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious corrective treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in their own time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a why it's a self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we have gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality in throughout the world we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nBut we're leading parallel lives this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now it was a medic parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find out so for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from what we're living right now or maybe radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then and conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solar consciousness survive physical Texas is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dreamed travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious not sold them going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from the life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who've come cooling those people to come calling my including clued but loving family members are ancestors of spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mine but science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams are wild and write them down will notice that they dream of events before they happen one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we also traveled into the past from this life and her mother lives you learned about connections with drama is playing out now the reality is another time periods in the multi dimensional universe so this is the key to dust and understanding\nOf what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experiences papa dream travel and my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from mine experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and they're giving me permission to use the story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers them but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nThey're locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history a valued dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like but you can talk to nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest salt so we might be lacking that I'd\nSay terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams\nCan be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions in attitudes from a death on a more objective perspective than we can manage for ourselves an indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious reality is that the one called ...\nAnd ... which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience have lost the sense of a deep up ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding fun to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we remember something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step process to sharing a dream of a story that makes a thon you can get it done in minutes\nYou get some help with the fact that your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our dreams I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it to be let out so the rushed out of sleep the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family we think that we should lie in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you between sleep in the wake\nThat's a good time to catch a good time to talk on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dreams because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams tell sometimes this is very interesting\nYou understand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of the NEA time altogether we step into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we're leading a power life this come very interesting when you begin to look at give some lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not at all the power of the life\nAnd it gets very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost that time will be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives of situations that people in far flung places feel proud of your multi dimensional family\nI'm a bit of an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience\nBut we have connected to dramas being lived in other places in time for a certain point of view it's\nAll going on now I wouldn't be doing what I I'm not doing but I'm not found myself connected with an Anglo Irish men who came to the American called and he's\nSeventeen hundred ...

I was in the graveyard this week and I look at him\nYeah I was in a graveyard I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk and I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name on the head start is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it or what I call she's never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to a head start he says what do you think of that I said\nIt's a great story the very great story I mean not introduce his whole themes about you know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat and to sudden\nGoal is to a certain place might even be an agent of simplicity but as I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a news story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that\nAnd in the ... these examples proliferate so\n... you know what it how it works is that the the the attitude and the energy you are carrying again to have result your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking for waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason everything in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack\nCheck what you're saying to yourself drop the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs and the open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to not to into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter of reality is a dense conscious so\n... there's no hope of separating mind and that they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the body has its own messages discoveries there is the phenomenon but used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen the fall of the mind of the brain can recognize\nWhat is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hits like gosh are my blood is but again it's\nAll new linen pants and after\nThat I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened I said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen\nYou can but the white queen scream\nBefore she put her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the before it took place on the doctor said my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment onto the patriots symptoms because but I couldn't possibly report it people can guy was looted you\nWell you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body also the thing we know thing\nWe know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough about it you know so medic responses we pick up things from a distance from other people we feel what the feeling in our body as well so that's about the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell active dreaming is a way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams you got to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guide in July from your dream I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of loose the dreaming you'd call it shut medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of talking on the loose and dream adventure\nIs to start out lose to the state loose it what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming in the workshop\nOr we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay the romance and adventure steel industry let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff the stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and I think the scary based on its own ground it might mean\nI Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream yet another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that drift eat try like state\nTo eat and sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the themes that will come to you the pool to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive dreaming of the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we ... how to look good as the outlook for signs of both in the world around you so this is also a program on a method of attending to the dream like symbol of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams and self misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams and themselves to ever deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems that are floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up things from all the other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to us that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible beast but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront these two on the ground you might find that behind something that's scaring or worrying\nYou and your dream is a power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or a life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to a narrow understanding what dreams is about can be very misleading\nYou got to Robert we're going to

well Robert you write about Carl young a lot in he even had some of his own situations didn't need it didn't they\nWhat do you mean he's unfit choices Joe in his dream life\nYeah he would do you own your own was inspired by dreams I mean he said\nIn memory streams reflection thought he has interesting thoughts every day but he takes up in his work and study only what comes to him\nAnd dream so here is the man I mean a titan of scholarship and science who is driven all his life by his dream above the stories in my new book the scariest realities in both you almost have to get into the afterlife and actually what he might be doing now it's pretty interesting title\nBut the part of it that is in the previous documentation that Yom dreamed again and again before his death\nBut he was living in a Bush and all his retreats on the lake on Lake ...\nWhich is called ball and get up in the nearby village\nIs living in another balding gun on the other side of death and those close to him said that he lost all your debt you absolutely confident and so he knew where he was going to a towel on the other side of death on the lake at the end of story in a mysterious way out of his Coby out the ball and good I follow you on\nTo that possible afterlife situation and actually give some insight into where how your mind might be working right now is he works on a great new books are you in the afterlife I mean some people might be shocked and surprised\nBut that rubbed his crazy enough to think that you would have an audience with him from the other side of that but you know you'll himself rage a great deal not always the publication about his contacts with the defaced she talked in his in his mouth and then he read book about extensive conversations\nHe had with the deposit that shaped your view of reality and he was one of those are always understood but one of the key things about dreaming is is it gives the U.S had the ability to understand what happens to mind consciousness off to death because the dreams that you understood we receive visitations from the departed I didn't dreams we made travel into the realm\nBut a nice ride as you're coming up the Howard
