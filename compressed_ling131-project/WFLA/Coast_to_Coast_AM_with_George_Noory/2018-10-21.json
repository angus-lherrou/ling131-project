vast lucky safer right there and that's where I Want to start this interview a couple of minutes a preview of what we do on lighting power play with her of various talk shows\nAnd starting out I asked match\nOur people around the league really just on board with Andrea ... being a top five even a top three gold center in the game here's what he had to say\nI mean I think a lot of people are on board and deservedly so I think that's less ... is one of the top five gold centered and the NHL and he was always supposed to be a very elite prospect pedigree you're the first round pick which is pretty rare for gold's do they use very big he's very strong explosive and when I like what am I talked to him a lot last year\nA and he really relished is getting opportunities even when he was called the part of the ... final twenty Fifteen enjoys the pressure he likes to die and that's what you want from your number one goal tender that type of swagger\nA in terms of what's going to get in the discussion among the very elite\n... and the general populace stance I just think it's just so that was the last year he was the best schooling leak the first half the year and again nine thirty one say percentage of all the all star break but his game really tanked down the stretch and I think it was because it's pretty easy shattered his ... starts and his body just hadn't\nSeen that work will before they broke down he did did rally a lot in the play offs of course but I think people look at those numbers and they'd be soured ditch the Kenyan aren't let's just lately I mean he still doesn't cook but I think he he could put together a wider wider season of consistency then he's really going to be revered as one of the top ...\n... and the hockey news joined us here a lightning power play live met this odd fences so deep you mentioned having legitimate scores on each line you know a game breaker is no doubt Jake team Miller hackers on the fourth line\nThey break up stamp posting coup trough because they didn't like what was happening there did you like that move how long do you think they stay with that and what do you make of Stephen stand cos more of a play maker then as the shooter kid he'd be as effective\nIt's very interesting I mean I guess for now I liked the movie it's just it's early right so I think it's a good time of year for coaches to play with their toys and see what clicks and I think that's what John Cooper's trying to do I I still expect a stem goes ... truck to end up back on the same line because of the magic made last season especially\nAre just too good of a connection but I Wonder if this\nIs done in an effort to spark stamp goes as the shooter because\nYou're right he has developed this tendency to be more of a play maker and he's different ... as the shooter on their line whereas we don't stand because his one of the best cure shooters that's generation especially is one time or a power play\nSimilar spots where ... and let's just shoot it and it's kind of strange to stand ... putting up those local turtles given the fact that he's a pure natural score\nSo putting your with say a breaking point\nMaybe we'll

I Would have been obvious so I mean he was a Catholic priest\nOr what I Wonder it yet but I think there are pros and cons to the subject and I went back to hear somebody um has the argument against it\nWell I don't want to excuse me what why don't you go to make some now what do you think okay\nThe people who believe in it they say that we keep reincarnate ing and coming back because they stay that way we learn yes if you remember they always say that they say that's how we learn yes\nAnd yet on the program friday night you and the priest\nAgreed that that we are a lot I don't know if you remember that but\nMy own and I remember it clearly\nYeah well if if we keep reincarnate aid to come back at to learn at issue I think we would find our way by now we would not be alive\nAnd well in other words we would become wiser in wiser in ... which is that it we're\nGetting dumber and dumber and dumber ...\nAnd there's another problem with reincarnation and that is that there are constantly more people on the earth in other words\nYeah more souls yeah right\nSo maybe um those who are learning and becoming wise or because of reincarnation if it does exist are being in effect out voted by the ... coming along who don't know a damn thing\nI'd I Know that I like\nNow when you first came on this radio station when you left the station I remember hearing you say that you intended to have a master's is I guess and I don't know maybe you changed your mind but I Would like to hear him talk about it\nFor you know I haven't changed my mind at all I have to run several times as you know\nOh and then I must admit I hear you I I seldom Misha program but I I never heard him on your program\nOh my oh no a boy and then you must not ... well I can say because I've had Roy and I would say over the years\nProbably at least a half dozen times I think you've been on this station\nWell I don't know what station you're listening to the one you're on now ah I'm On three hundred stations man well I Know I mean oh I'm In Las Vegas okay that helps you mean it'd be easy or maybe not since we've been on cable you gee that's right well that's what I mean\nYou know and uh I I Know you had him before that yeah ... ... would you consider having him of course I think he's very very interesting and\nAh or him or any any uh yes and who would give the argument the guest reincarnation\nDo you think he does not believe in it\nI I'm not sure but I think he does not ...\nWhat did surprise you if you are found out he did\nA yeah yeah that would I I think I heard him out a lot I've that I've listened to him for Thirty years in a long time ago I heard him say something about that that this would be something that devil would want because people could keep messing up their lives\nEach time and they say well I got another chance I'll reincarnate an opt out do better than the next time and they never do and then with an argument I heard him give a long time ago\nI see oh right oh well maybe I'll have them on how 'bout that\nOh I I'm going to make sure I never miss your poke them because I won't know ahead of\n[laughter] you announce it well I usually do announce guess ahead of time I thank you

they're a maybe a case to suggest that it would be a state's rights issue and that this debris\nThe court or would say the second amendment only applies state by state or I Want to ask I interviewed judge Bork and that's what he said that's what he said he believed\nIt could be the tenth amendment does give us that [noise]\nSo I wouldn't be too much of a hurry especially in the present climate\nYeah but for for the last three years the Supreme Court has refused to hear any case on the second amendment\nThat's what I said you may you probably ought to be saying thank you because that

Tampa\n[noise]\n\nWelcome back Thomas ... is one of the freshest voices offering some of the clearest guidance on enlightenment and spiritual awakening Thomas digs deep\nThe end of the subjects to reveal their core wisdom in simple clear English the first time Thomas heard this wisdom was when he attended one of Timothy Conway's sat sang in the summer of two thousand and five\nThomas's taught a class based on the sad thing for the center for lifelong learning he's spoken publicly numerous times both in person on the radio and in September twenty twelve he spoke to the prestigious lecture series mind and super mind\nWhich is run by the SBC see Graham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the months for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty fourteen\nYears the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychics but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um [noise]\nThat kind of got him going and so we as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake\nPsychics we're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right in there and having them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but\nThis time this this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer we take a picture and\nAnd ah you know the fake media would be totally surprised if it were you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini him to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics mediums and put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so I had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was ... I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were ... and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an avowed do bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nFrom the subscription you fried chicken traffic summer\nAnd right now we did have the on sixty I'm brand new Baltimore we have an accent and that's where the mount Carmel road and the right wing is watch and we are seeing some ... on the Howard Franklin and that says you're going south bound\nDue to an ad in the reserve the right lane is walk no problems for them the Courtney Campbell housebroken use or the United Seventy WFL or [noise] just a stray\nShower possible through the second half of our Saturday then by Sunday will watch the cold front arrives will sort of it's Seventy three degrees wins will turn breezy out of the northeast late in the day high temperature eighty five as some cooler air begins moving in by Monday morning we wake up to sixty four high temperature under lower humidity at eighty five degrees\nCelsius when ... to non stupid you know light job bay waters on new generally meteorologist ed bloods worth for news radio nine Seventy WFL a\n\nFox News on Del Walters new developments concerning the fallout from the deaths of Washington Post journalist democracy Yogi late Saturday New Zealand joining a growing list of countries condemning the death\nAlso sang in Boulder tend an economic summit nickname Davos in the desert and solve is admitting friday he died during a scuffle inside their consulate in Turkey what to do next seems to be more complicated\nWe need to to calm down will solve the conduct in the strongest possible terms but if it if we take out Saudi Arabia\nAnd allow Iran to to gain a foothold bigger but all in liberal on in Syria and Yemen we're going to end up in the ...\nJohn Kennedy pleasure the Trump continues to stand by the desert kingdom the Los Angeles Dodgers advance to the world series beating Milwaukee fog one game seven they'll meet the Boston Red Sox seconds for years the Dodgers\nNews radio nine Seventy WFL a of\nYou go on the eye heart radio actually download is now lightning\nBlackhawks tonight at six thirty or nine Seventy WFL a whole month lightning on yesterday from\nAids videos muddy six seven FM Pashto went over to nine ... nine Seventy telling us ballet\n\n\nThe mirror networks presents goes to goes to the you\nKnow use your guest host Richard Sayre is\nSay hello on Twitter at Richard Sayre and asked why because I Love you R.

posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nShortly after I think it was about [noise]\nA couple of years after the say on\nHe was in a really bad car accident he was with his ... eyes car accident and his healing processes aided by pain killers and some of this is um morphine and he becomes addicted to morphine a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later\nNear the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile say on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nOld James Pike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon are now a Canadian\nAnd so there's another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah yeah and I think it's in I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a stay on for pike now pike son\nHad tragically committed suicide the year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the tip of the secret to do this and that\nKind of breaking up on his Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay I'm James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide of your earlier and now Ford is doing a say on a Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little upfront research brings it into the than says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went through his papers and found his research\nFor the ... and that's why people say this but this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water for this case Houdini case as fun as it is and it is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it that it does or doesn't\nI I just it it it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite best is\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nShe did it for ten years after his death but\nShe didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry\nUm\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know that first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits anyway\nI think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail so she can say that statement at the end you know\nTen years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go back\nWith my friends and embrace the standard mainstream belief\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted\nThrough a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened yes\nYes I Do and the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um\n[noise] do a whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to disprove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible\nI Am now and here in my desire to undo this mistake\nHow all those who lost faith because of my mistake to\nLay a whole again of hope and to live with the knowledge that vice his continue with that is my message to the world through my wife\nAnd through this psychic media those are the were\nFantastic Thomas how do people get a hold of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAmazon dot com the both the paperback and e book and I do want to point out one interesting thing I'm Dr Gary Swartz wrote the book the afterlife experiments and he was a guest with art do all those years ago and I have recently heard that Gary sports\nHas Harry Houdini as a spirit that he's been working with over there at the University of Arizona

of a ... world on a flat map and so you get this distortion\nIt's called their Mercator projection map or that the most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in textbooks it was created back in Fifteen Ninety six I think it's maybe time we have data and he what was it was designed to help sailors navigate the world the ... the Mercator projection buddy distorts\nSeriously distorts the size of land masses\nSo for example you may have noticed that a while Africa is around fourteen times larger than Greenland and yet on the map both are almost the same size Greenland is huge on these maps Brazil another example Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska yet Alaska\nIs much larger than Brazil on the map much larger\nThe map also suggested Scandinavian countries are larger than India whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together\nLooks like Europe is larger than North America on on these old maps but in reality the reverse is

series the other side of history I Believe a DVD sir yes\nYes he's he came to the exact same thing in this book was was in the middle of writing this back then are researching it at least as I Do all

has a little sister suspicious you know aircraft carriers tend to be a pretty\n... pretty unnecessary commodity in a word like that and every word actually so you know they had to spare them so they left the harbor if I'm wrong\nSorry but I mean I I Can't imagine a situation where\nUh you would be taking aircraft carriers and ordering them away from a place that you're supposed to be protecting so it was pretty good evidence to support that uh you know the same you know to support that conclusion that they they definitely had a as a matter of fact the History Channel broke it I think last year I was watching something on the History Channel\nThey even said they had uncovered documents internal documents which I didn't find the archive that suggests that that very thing that the codes were broken and I thought well\nHey look at that you know I mean I I hate I knew I got it right but I didn't know how to write I got it so that was ... I was right on the money with the right\nBut as you as you or any great pains to point out and you just mentioned this earlier that the Germans\nAre in their T. V. to rocket program or almost ... they were getting close to being able to deliver um nuclear bombs and had the United states not gotten then\nUh when they did it may have been too late and imagine nuclear weapons attached to those me two rockets raining down on on England\nYou know it's incredible uh it's just absolutely incredible when you think about the situation um you know America is an economic chaos they know they have to get into this war for many reasons to the to spark the economy as well\nAnd uh it was just in the he had to FDR was put in a real bad situation and you know in the first chapter of my book I paint FDR is kind of a villain and I have to do that to set up the murder so I Apologize in advance\nFor anybody who reads that gets a time when FDR had to sell our country on this war and I believe he had to sacrifice Pearl Harbor and the lives that I Know it's a terrible thing to say but I uh I think that's that's how it happened\nIn order to galvanize public support\nRight yeah 'cause he he had already been saying this was Europe's war this is Europe's were well between the the ... the global economy which is not doing anything and the necessary time to get into the war coming through our spies\nAnd it was he knew it was time to break gut wrenching decision very gut wrenching decision\nSo that that's a that's how that came in to pass you\nKnow before we get into the U.S in World War two FDR's relationship with Churchill and and then later style and I'm just not going to remember about sort of the enemies list that he had already cultivated through you know the overregulation and and uh with with the big corporations in the United states\nOh boy ah [laughter]\nThis guy had a you know there were enemy hated money you're really didn't affect account because as much as he get his hands on so [noise] um he really\nWho was interested in industry are making money was definitely not his friend I mean he really pissed off some powerful people\nUm I'll run through the list here are the ones that I came up with\nUm the dupont family um George Eastman for Eastman Kodak hurry Firestone same old Colgate toothpaste a Henry Ford or are you still had 'em and refer Heinz family Hilton family who had hotel the melon family who's in charge of the world banks\nUm Williams told me that was the president of Liberia and even I'm Robert what was the chairman of the border Coca Cola I mean these people would have done anything to get this guy out of power because he was costing them millions of dollars not only in production but in personal well\nSo he he certainly had some some enemies and and here we are starting to get through the motive of murder and it's with all of my book I run all the suspects motive means an opportunity to come up with the person or people connected to this and how it happened\nAnd I just want to I just want to jump in and tell everybody don't buy this book on Amazon I I'm ...

Mussolini at first it was an author of Mussolini so mostly they actually started the whole thing but\nYou know again I'm history books being what they are that are you the last um [noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through Bonnie ... by ... she watched the city's burn 'em coverage of the tree and in Birmingham I'm very interesting\nSo um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way um anyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do was down at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close\nEngland came to losing the right one they were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this was what their MO was they used to go in late on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just tape around your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain and of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with um never trust them I'm of course to admit previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be be honest with the church shows the one who\nGot the two together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans because\nThey were so similar at the time that style and in America and the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world\nBecause Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be friends\nSo to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely he was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great for I think if FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been as fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful\nSure I mean there's still a communist newspaper ... as far as I'm concerned and [laughter] you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their pieces are ... million\nFDR it seemed and reading a book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned in need us we need it Stalin style and and the U.S he was already\nYou know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and installing a pack well Hitler violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind\nAnd they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march and then\nYou know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like thirty\nSome odd different drugs are so he was such a\nDelusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go toward styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and they were just says well I don't care I Want it will do it so Stalin is already\nBeating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging at his style on the table in which they get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran\nI think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have at even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world a instill at this point you know I I think she was Roosevelt still looks pretty robust\nA you know he you know by by standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was in was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nUm but I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nAnd got some ... going on there as well and watch for construction again the boulevard and read as are coming off ...

C. I got everyone from\nA rescue into the apostle John in the Bible and poison and political poisonings hit their peak right around the renaissance Italian Renaissance round the fourteenth century and even today food tasters are used to sort of advocate that um you know every ... and\nHere's some people who have actually tried to poison other people throughout history or you know it sounds outlandish that our president can be poison this way but it's it's actually quite a kind of thing the emperor equality us\nThe polio and Mark Anthony Petra Queen Elizabeth King Henry the eighth Abraham Lincoln these people all are so worried about poisoning the food's officers so they were a little bit more sophisticated about this\nWe actually have um\nIn America we have the presidential food safety theme and there's a set up a security zone where the first family can eat without complication in the cockpit of a you know food screeners and people who watch people prepare the food and uh if you get outside\nOf that the White House's own even the air and the White House was over I mean that's quite as oh right right outside of that if you travel\nUm you will\nThey'll go back to

traveling were using the same size so this is this is a legitimate threat I'm In Nineteen Ninety three um Turkey's eighth president was poisoned the Bulgarian embassy when he drink lemonade at\nA reception right right this is a this is for real thing here um as far as the world war two is concerned\nHow they tried to get rid of each other there were forty two attempts on Hitler's life from Nineteen thirty three the Nineteen forty four and even Irwin rom all they knew Hitler was crazy or when Ronald a desert Fox they're great and if infant treated genius he started who from inside inside Germany\nTo assassinate I'm\nA Hitler and on July twenty of Nineteen forty four it was discovered his ... his ah communication was discovered with other people inside of Germany\nAnd they took him from his house and they forced them to bite into assign capsule so they were trying to poison and assassinate people back and forth probably the most hilarious of this\nWinston Churchill my cousin when singer show like I knew the guy you know\n[laughter] you're like this yeah yeah right\nSo um you know they tried to get each other back and forth a multiple times Hitler was going after us so fiercely hit operational long John\nWhere he tried to assassinate Churchill FDR and style and during the ... conference but possibly the most has the most hysterical of all of these is a page right out of Maxwell smart is the Nazis were very good bomb makers\nAnd they knew um the Nazis and everybody had spies everywhere and every and every government enough to say we're not all that special we have spies too so [laughter]\nI'm Churchill they discovered like chocolate he was a poorly fell like fine chocolates so what they did is they crafted the Germans being crafted a\nBomb to make it look
