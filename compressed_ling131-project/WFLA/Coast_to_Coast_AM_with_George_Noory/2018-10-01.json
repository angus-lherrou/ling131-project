I noticed something as I was reading the new book today\nThat you make some personal observations than I Am not a I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books are insights into your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to yeah you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years\nThousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities some of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost and when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and\nA lot of parallels to my wife has a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put it in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people these are the Drake who is fighting these are the upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are\nDown and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your book help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're\nThey're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and uh\nI've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families\nAnd covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA running out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement report\nThe who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search\nOr the areas they completely eliminated and the and the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching blind and there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service government entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess\nI I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing that the families of the missing but ah it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I start\nIt out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found disappearances in their parks were they had worked that bothered them didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of

can you address that for a moment before we jump into the cases\n[noise] this is one of the most frustrating parts of being in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the named David polite is missing for one one missing and national parks there all frauds they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent and listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads\nThe only site that has me is a candidate missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click and and you listen if you don't know if somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us to people don't trust you to really don't even listen to him a less effect cannot missing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use euro in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data um for search and rescue um\nHow how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate and the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that\nAnd are filmed impossible distances away sometimes they're alive amazingly enough but I'm often found impossible distances away and there is no way no way they could walk there on their own uh talk about that\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talked about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child found say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half [laughter]\nUh well I don't know many parents to think that there are two year old could make that track but\nThat's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with a case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOf four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida was found twenty miles away through the swamps\nOr another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old a three year old ... Fifteen miles away twenty four hours\nNot possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen these numbers absolutely blow that to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is in all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere\nI'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it but as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance and extraordinary heights when I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people\nIt's a habit I said if I said OK you set your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away or watch the trial was going to do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe the plan that jerk for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents and your your kid would run up hill nobody raised around I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare but I have all these examples where the heights of been achieved by these little ...\nWhere they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on oh yeah he's got a\nMovement we talked about a two year old boy that they traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges and even some face down and know the\nNext morning unbelievably a wide and we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened and if it's not that we couldn't believe we found him and we couldn't believe it or why\nYou have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on the bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours to have to go point six miles per hour\nBut a kid's not going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water um it it seems just impossible unless somebody picked him up or some something or someone picked him up and plop them their\n... and the reason these cases have significant is that let's say a new report on a child who's abducted in downtown Vegas [noise]\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know ... somebody put them in the car and drove from there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party in anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody saw anything nobody sonic cars\nNobody else was there so how did that child make a difference in that time ...\nOr in the new book uh it's law L.

don't know national monuments are part of the national Park Service that's their property and they patrol it in their national park police are there\nWell there's a location called Oregon or Ga an organ pipe cactus national monument and it's an Arizona far southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico\nOn February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two years old named Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico\nDrove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around and she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called her\nWell I stumbled onto this case and saw it and some archive somewhere\nAnd I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff yeah some pretty documents on that case I got the documents in my hand that I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports I'm a stay at it or we don't have any\nI said have you heard of that case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all the articles in all the reports said that they stated she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working in a ... a university lab tech to earn some extra money she love the outdoors hike regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residents in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she slept in her car that first night\nFebruary first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation\nAt the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and was smart February second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture\nAnd asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he ... he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nOn February third she moved your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth\nAt nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling and found carols car parked in s this canyon picnic site with a note taped inside the windshield and it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do\nExactly you know I Wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to replace that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he had the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second he notified park headquarters advise them that he has a missing hiker and starts\nThe search process February fourth and fifth national park service that sent in to Forman teams up that trail the search whether it was described and reports of cold and blustery they\nDetermined Carol was laughing eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered\nAround the Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service started to get low on resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs\nMonth an air force base they brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent again he met Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina the parents that are the care would never ever go off trail she was an outstanding athletic condition and\nShe was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth\nFebruary twenty second that Ryan told the Associated Press it's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery march seven one last push to locate curl rangers claim to smell an odor of human decaying flesh up the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service for the team into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd again they have no documentation on the incident anywhere now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils\nAnd it was three type written pages that outlines of search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane for radio what it says one additional was turned up on Monday February fifteenth too limited locations about four hundred yards the park on the south west facing of the hosts a J. O. S.\nA very strong in distinct human odor was found but no other locations\nSupervising ranger how cross of swore oh through our national monument and one other searchers who was recently involved in the recovery of body had very strong and positive feelings on the day than vacation at the odor\nThe following day ranger cos after flying the area and a border patrol plane let an eating man search party back over this area again the order was observed at the same location but only occasionally and not as distinct\nOther members of the team described it as a very weird and scary all efforts were negative and search activities have been reduced intermittent patrols at this time\nI have never in thousands of reports seen anything described in our national park service report as very weird and scary\nLife yeah\nIt's really strange just a feeling they had or the fact that they're smelling what they think is decaying human flesh but there is no source or the older\nWell here's what's as other members of the team described it as a very weird and scary\nSo I'm sure all of us who spent time in the outdoors have spent have smelled the odor of dead flash decaying some time animals die smell it I don't know if that could be weird and scary [laughter]\n[noise] [noise] but uh again\nThis was her second hike into that area which she nervous about making the trip is that why she left a note or where she just smart about it they never found her there was never any subsequent follow ups after that first\nDays search both of her parents are deceased she didn't have any brothers or sisters there's no\nThere's nothing left of her family anymore\nYou have another a case in in the book about a land disappearance that involves a really smart person somebody who's the editor for what looks like great things his name is Steven read and his disappearance was in Nineteen Ninety nine in Oregon told me about that one\nSo this is the one time out of the thousands of times where I read this

so I Want to jump into one of the most baffling cases involving water it's a guy named Henry McCabe and this is really pretty creepy\nThat is a creepy case and ah [noise] the new Brighton Minnesota the community [noise] just north of Minneapolis not very far with the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe was thirty two years old [noise]\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids lived in a city called Mountain View again just north of Minneapolis north side this Koester area missing people that I've written about in the past\nYou had a great job using auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue\nOn September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids uh went to California\nAnd it was a planned vacation well on Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend who is a very diligent guy always on time very respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the early early on that Monday morning and return states that he dropped him off at a location in ... at the super gas station at a Seventy third avenue\nTo twenty three am Henry phone appears corrupt pocket dial this wife while she was asleep when California and walk to link the voicemail strange sound screaming paintings growls et cetera\nAnd put together some very interesting factual side note and a guy from uh Finland did some amazing work\nSent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances in Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances and your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that\nAnd then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles now in the Nevada try and go down there by you it goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle\nAnd when I first got onto that I thought you know this seems kinda hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it on a map I said holy crap you know it's in the middle that try and go to\nSam in national park yes [laughter]\nGo that's quite a coincidence so Yosemite kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and uh\nGot tons of disappearances and king canyon and ... as well [noise] and when I watched a documentary about in Nevada try and go\nThere's several thousand planes that have crashed and disappeared in this year is in that area and a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents things which seems reasonable\nBut when you bring into account that there is also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some uh uh do you have any specifics from the ... who you want to get into or should we just go you jump into the cases of air disappearances in general\nThat was just go to air disappearances\nYou have a case in the book from Moffett Field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that I grew up not far from Marshfield in Sunnyvale I grew up ... you know and I had plane flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week and it had notoriety in the early forties for being a place where all the blimps that\nPatrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed in there and Treasure Island in the middle of the day [noise] well in August sixteenth Nineteen forty two\nBlimp was getting are sent out of Treasure Island where they held the world's fair there was a man by the tenant earners Cody twenty seven years old and Ensign Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they've left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this\nWell as they depart they start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the feral on islands and Cody with control of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military\nAnd it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a a needed for patrol\n[noise] what both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to Treasure Island for the day to leave on their ship\nOr that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nThe first hundred and ten minutes of the flight was normal fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles east of the feral on islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scramble to ... to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the boy\nWill the planes encountered cloudy weather with a ceiling a five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them\nAt ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they had to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in the file and they couldn't explain why it was their\nMinute eleven Fifteen for fun and cause Moffett Field against they didn't get that in\nLA had crashed in the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast or the navy response to Daly city and they find their airship on the ground with one bomb missing the\nGone to was in near perfect condition both motors on the ship or off even though one throw was half open and the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required where life preserver over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each a airship and that was still intact the\nCabin door was open plenty of fuel within the tanks the radio was in perfect condition no distress call for fun and called back and say they said they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call\nThe central coast of California had a major search that started almost immediately the navy found to fishing boats and navy both in a postcard ship that's all the blimp dip and\nDropped to ... on the oil slick the blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowds they said all appeared fairly normal but it did go into the crowds and disappeared the crash happened at four thirty to Bellevue street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean the\nCrew did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the craft were still there\nThan there was a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there was a couple of theories that developed a and that the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break come back we're in the jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might

about this US Navy blimp it's patrolling off the coast to California and uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\n[noise] so the navy did their investigation and they said that ah there was no fire on board when it hit the beach originally when it hit land it dropped one of its bombs accidentally\nThat made the blimp lighter it was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood there\nWas a massive search off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they reviewed radio bog there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch are like that they were watching on the water there were lots of water craft in that area\nThey never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd there's an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which has had several strange disappearances I've documented\nAnd just south of the Golden Gate to a location called half moon bay in that area of the coast I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no other part of the northern California coast north of\nThat coin raise area\nAnd nothing immediately half half moon bay so it's this one area that has just strangeness attached to it\nAnd like you said they they came up with some explanation for to me that were laughable\n\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened\n... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left of the craft or a and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be have been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\nOr even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak\nRight because the area of the water that was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get in that case I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch you know\nIs going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick Marilyn ditch case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was the organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened in the winter basin\nAnd the circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken is if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I've thought the same thing in multiple missing for a woman bucks it looks like people are snatched out of the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these uh locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point at one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures end of the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that uh a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch in elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um\nAnd as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside he had a had an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... is that a and his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch\nAnd I asked a couple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone or he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the the public has never seen so\nYou know he he has a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so\nI don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody who's been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wakeup call I think so um\nSo ... you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to a disappearance that I could sing my teeth into they can relate it to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but as I said before sometimes I think\nI related to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies the\nBank robbers aren't ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it\nAnd I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it's just filled with water I have no cases from there it's bizarre\nAnd isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow\nUm it's a manmade lake but the ones right in the middle of the ... reservation to use a control lead property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but at the lake is a a\nHas a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and the objects coming in and out of the water ... said that they the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people at Brown there and uh\nSo you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things and that's where it but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that the person who told me that in D.C had brought up your books and and your subject matter\nI Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I I think I'm going to open up the phone lines and no people are going to want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs can you summarize that one\n[noise] it looks like\nSeptember is certainly going to end on a very hot know hitting Ninety four today that would break the record as Ninety three and there's only a ten percent chance of a stray afternoon or early evening shower to ... down\nOther than that because

Virginia but interesting like say thanks Nineteen forty seven\nJohn appreciate the call it's a great story try to get one more call in at least four day we're going to ask wall in Santa Barbara California in the wild card lines as well as more I've\nBeen called called about five times since they've been on and I finally got through your you go I'm\nGoing I'm going to tell you a story of an actual experience but first I wanted to say I think that there's that the higher echelons are working with the parks that won't give you information they don't want you to know\nAnd my second point before I tell you my experiences\nI'm encouraging you to read about the the Buddhist or teaching about these different types of creatures that live in proximity different dimensions but they can interact even ... years ago they talked about abductions split the Buddha\nTalked about what they look like what the realms were like what they did anyway so I just encourage you to do that but here's the story this is true it it was before nine ... Ninety six I used to live in Rochester\nBut I was living in California I drove across the country many times I went to visit some friends in Rochester ah I'll Try to find out the exact date but right now I Can't I'm going to send you an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a man or woman and a boy and a couple of other people walk in one direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around al ... seemed like to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and the one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared said Hi to the other one and she had a girl\nAnd the shuttle can our kids play and the the the people that I had been walking with the mother said yeah and we shut down at a picnic table and the the strange woman said to the other lady that I had been walking with what's your name they they tell the name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later the lady looks into boys gone and she starts calling them and I got up and I walk around and I swear to God I Am not making this up\nThere was a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bump them but this is the part I Want you know it had\nKinda futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature looked humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped at least twenty feet from the ground without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where the you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was scared I thought that that creature and those people that are pure were part of the same group I thought they were military people and this creature was a genetic hybrid this is what I Believe [noise]\nWell that's that's quite a story or David any reaction to that no one interesting\nYou know you do have some uh ask\nWell thank you for

stories and theories than call in and we'll we'll have plenty of time to chat and the next hour\nIn some of your books David and I'm not sure if I don't remember an example here you you reference it about an earlier book in this new book about the boulders and I I was always wondering well heck there's boulders all over the place how can that relate to the missing persons a mystery\nYou have a couple of cases where witnesses tell you why it it relates that these things sort of come alive um or they move right\n[noise] well yeah I wrote a story in my last book one right before the ... about a story of a Spanish priest in Texas that was running from Native American thing that came upon this giant piece a pink granite in Texas it's a state park\nAnd he said that after he ran up to the top of the granite it opened up and swallow with him and he said that he was inside this Boulder gift and made it for three days\nAnd then he said at the end of the third day it's spit amount\nAnd that isn't the only story I've got like that and uh people probably don't know this but there are stories out of Iceland that they will move over road when they're building it before they will blow up a piece of granite or big Boulder\nBecause they have a belief in their society that things are living inside of those voters\nHave a ... a missing for one one land air water is the latest book it's as
