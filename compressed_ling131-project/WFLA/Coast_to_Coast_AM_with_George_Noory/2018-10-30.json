change\n[noise] yeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now and and I don't know why and no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in law school at Seventy thirty I mean think\nAbout it really isn't that high on that's a flood not some flip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I I said listen you want you you want to hassle of women there so you don't do it\nBut we wish you had to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions\nAnd they're going to want us all excellent and was absolutely Exxon was\n... and uh so we're ... we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because it's going to be run by women\nUm what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\nA generation Z was born ... being born right now is is actually a two thousand five to ... thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there uh\nBut Gen Z is not going to be entirely different than Gen Y ... that they're going to be this the same\nCyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially is the parents of Gen Z\nA but it's what we're watching is is is a at a new crop of kids and I tell folks and if you look at you you know people say well these these ... they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complained about the millennials they caught complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to you know there's all kinds of things that are that I'm hearing about them and he said let alone let them grow up\nAs soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be find it just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated this as soon as they had\nFeed themselves and and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that and\nI don't care listen it is what it is\nWell listen here's here's how it works zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want when you want to you want it now you don't want to free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a um liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing a conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo on all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just care about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah what he told me that makes me cringe you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country\nAnd it's horrible it troubles me early does we knew not\nIt's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a I mean it looks it I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president day takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah that's and that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that do\nYou think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter thought that it would be used for tools like that I don't think so\nI Know that when when when you think of the mind of people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know if\nWhen you talk about the trends in change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to\nDebate question discuss without people screaming at each other I mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight I'm instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't get ... they didn't agree with each other\nAnd in I've never seen that this bad him you\nKnow no I haven't and it it's called diplomacy and I wonder where it's way where it's gone I I I just simply don't know you know people\nI I I Can't tell you the number of people George that say to me you know why don't we run our our government like a business and and so we you know where you want to have these huge deficits and we will make all these mistakes [noise]\nIf you think about it I'd rather have a government that runs like a government a diplomatic government or a Republican based on a constitution\nNot one that's based on business principles we used to have that yeah we used to have that but now we have a government\nThat's actually run on business principles and it's it seems like there's there's no you know we were just take it all do we have removed the rules what taken away the the we've taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat and what\nWill what's going on with China China's freaky position China right now uh\nThey relaxed they were ... their their child law to write how many people many children a family can help\nYeah they

that's just like I Can't think of any any other way to say what they've done is they've committed the biggest demographic blunder and a history of the world with that one child policy\nThey did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy let now they're letting their populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate but uh how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born babies\nThat up on his adult they're not buyers that's for sure no\nSo what what you have is is they're missing and it's it's a real number five hundred million people that were born five hundred million\nAnd a half million so so ...

what could happen and how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah ... ... whenever a country gets in trouble um with ah their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's frightening as they go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has won in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI don't know what's gonna happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the

Christian and a woman bird I wanted to see two things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump start her career uh um the orange star because she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast\nAnd that warrior here's what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he put Iran and possibly when um the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for what both of those guys yet and all the yeah was temporarily side tracked\nI'm a booming economy or try to and bring down next man but more importantly that man has kids especially a little while still at home I yeah and that little one but a young white include and his wife\nAnd we had a president did something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was aiming for him with my tax dollars and everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nTrump it's reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you have found him he's going to come back at you that's human nature the second thing I disagree that is sad\nIs that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school or by it and it but I'm I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than a big business and it should be run like a business I have started to successful businesses myself this is men and women don't have time for now and then\nYou get a deal done we're not going to have an eating to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy diplomacy doesn't win wars diplomacy doesn't faze money we need a businessman I voted for him because he's a no nonsense that is that anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had\nThe audacity to get back up yet on the horse\nI thought I I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in a dish and she doesn't care if people call him a racist because God Knows what scientists hard and other people know that ... ... it it doesn't matter about this\nPolicy she knows yes as I as a man on and uh and as a prize of that\nSo I disagree with you on both of those um things\nAnd let's get scared as common today not in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things with anyone jumping\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run a country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country in period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilet a pay the fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business they're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a bit of a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on that [noise] do you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um uh the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nThat will do but let me let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential will move more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them spoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in the punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know I think what he has done his dignify but it the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nAtkins we come right back on coast to coast they [noise]\nThe coast website is now streamlined for mobile devices Greek news if you're a coast insider who simply want to enjoy

and I really don't have\nEnough truck driver you know what that what we\nNow would you like to have a truck behind you would know drivers\nOut or you're not going to do it might not you know we I have a mini mini as little\nTiny mini Cooper right\nI mean he Cooper GDP which is the heart ride and I'm thinking to myself if I the first time I pull up next to I'm a semi with no driver\n[laughter] I mean jeeze icy day could you imagine that truck barreling down behind you know and if there's one technical full paw just one it's going to rearrange you and you're out of it in a mini Cooper ... year history\nThat's that's where the truckers are telling me that people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out of school bus it's over it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you\nKnow I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway and they're you know the truck has park there and the truck driver guy is loading everything in the store I mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt it's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please okay one of the things that that a\nA R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there are about Ninety million or um men are males\nOr without that had no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military yeah and ah it's ... there there is just a ton and and that that's what happens when you have an imbalance in your population\nSo that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another means you're more breaking oh\nNo I just I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth or is the Americans and that is a you know Canada the United states Mexico central and South American ... uh we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil\nWe got water yeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know I\nDon't want to lose always missiles into guinea\n[laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wacko is like like a Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening in ... in fact I say I say what I see\nIn in Korea is going to be a unification of the north in the south the you know that the south is not having children\nThere for ... heard that I found like about one to\nHere's my concern though not for my country but from some terrorist group of teens new or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is that even one child for a couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you know possible it has to grow\nSo I don't know what's going to happen here with the north in the south I really don't north\nKorea is about ... they're they're right at or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina he Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher against um Hi my\nIs that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and at West 'cause like Florida is now the third most popular state\nRanking New York state and also a scenic has become the largest city out raking I filled out here\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather Kenny\nThat that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound demographic shifts to head we cover every single state\nIf you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida go over to ... California Nevada I'm a [noise] Arizona and New Mexico\nOr the populations are going to increase the population of of Florida is going to go from twenty million to thirty million want to buy real estate bite in Florida now and just sit on it\nInstead I listen to the the uh uh an interesting concept is the fact that the the the senior citizens in Florida are now Seventy five two Ninety five I had a real estate journalist\nOr give me a bus and she said one is the baby boomer influence on Florida real estate going to be if you're not going to add one to say well when will begin to you know ... and I told her I said listen it hasn't started it\nWhat does it could be huge it's going to be up to charge the same thing is happening with healthcare elder Karen desk here for a Vegas is that a good market\nOff the charts huge can't believe it or one or if it's cheap there are plenty of jobs\nI go there all the time my brother has a house there uh yeah Vegas this is unbelievable\nAnd ...

Garza said her daughter is now Ninety Days silver Garza said I couldn't be more things [noise]\nNow that's the first college course in the country designed specifically for recently returned veterans Bruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for sure be my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you got to tell me why me with the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's the paranormal it's been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experiences and Angelica experience a near death experience and just from that point on it just the the things have been happening randomly but quite frequently\nAnd uh I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to\nFinally put these all these experiences together into a book\nAnd a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or Family Matters but to to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college\nI'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lot of people Bruce or little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences as it's been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nAh it it hasn't been I I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have of it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching 'em to two of my colleagues that after college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most\nNegative thing I can think about there was a a a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide\n[laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate adviser\nYou know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the field of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\n[noise] I I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had in the scientific community up of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist you know historian\nOr but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean rate and who is the chief scientist\nAt ions good guy he\nUh yeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities\nAnd from what he told me there is only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the J. B. Ryan Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nNo I it's it but I I think\nThere is and I come from this with with dean because he's doing and don't you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research and very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift\nGoing on of of gaining acceptance and I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a ... supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet are there other podcast thumbs up they're dealing with the paranormal uh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger\nAnd I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find another traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a a I've made contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just had a ... it's just as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he he works in this building at night and he's got some stories so it's like they're telling their friends who are then\nCalling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's I I think once more people in\nPositions of authority or or you know academics are professional people or express their interest in and their support I think it's going to it's going to spread a lot faster\nMore with Bruce old ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every\nOnce in a while put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control or just happened randomly these things uh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and it and in the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point at which they do this\nOne did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very I I was four but I Would and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a wintertime and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally stiff I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home and\nShe had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap\nAnd was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to uncle ... then when he got polio you know they would just scaring the heck out of me\nAnd my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep a crime myself to sleep and I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like I it it was an energetic presence ... it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be okay it took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my\nMother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first ... experience and I never question did I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic a right to see 'em\nThere's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it I\nI I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island

any demonic situations you've stumbled into that\nAnd up it was so bad in mountains were crumbling in the sky was turning the dark color and it was just like an end of the worst end of the world kind of apocalyptic scenario and I woke up in a in a sweat and and nervous and scared and\nI I went to breakfast with my uh uh friends are just like the continental breakfast and I told them about this nightmare and then we proceeded to the uh the base\nAnd uh we were on a tour when the sirens went off and they closed off the base and we went back to the education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so\nSo that was my um my pre cognitive or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nOr the you know a in a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event and later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific\nUh than mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there is my daughter had nobody goes to we didn't know ... yeah we didn't know what\nIt was bruised but uh she she she had the vision she was ah in in a city where ash was falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep um but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was\nYeah yeah some people had it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people around the world who have who have a\nVerified that this that this happened to them and so there is something to that this is the ... that people had since that an end in a on a massive scale so which is and it's been studied uh I think\nA dean rating talks about in one of his books I I I Can't remember which one of his books but yeah he does talk about that\nWhat do you think of to let the the [noise]\nI I I think I've had experience with with telepathy with my with my mother and uh she was very psychic and we used to just a regular deck of playing cards when I was a younger\nA ...\nA camping on the Oregon Coast we'd have wonderful camping trips\nOn the ah Oregon Coast in at night my mom would bring out the deck of cards and we would uh try to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have encourage you to look at it and send me the you know try to send me with what the card was and a wet well above chance we would get\nThe the suit right we would get the sometimes the number or the or the ...\nYou know there was a king or jak face card a very often we'd get it we get a right\nTo the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter a blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it\nNo more yeah he did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop\nOr in my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and that she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from it so it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but I think I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big sort of experience [noise]\nI I did uh I well I think it was a I'll tell you this was a ... near Oric\nWhich is northern California and the red woods highway there and a driving south and uh my girlfriend was was asleep in the uh uh in the passenger seat and it was dark and we were driving to you know the big tall trees it's very ...\nAnd as I was making I think it was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit\nOf a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark\nBut it was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat and uh it was just kind of leaning into the truck is we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot and and she and she said what what are you talking about big foot I said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she she [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep drive\nAnd I said well we got to find a hotel there's one here another miles from here and she goes no no you keep going keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later I found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Paterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking with them that this was in fact\nThere's been yeah there's been more siting there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand it from the ... the uh the reading that I did about it so now if it if it was a hoax\nOr this guy's taken a big chance by stand right on that on the edge of the highway in the dark total dark\nYup uh and then you can get shot at or anything she got\nRun over crazy you know whatever or you know the alternative which which you know there's so that that was my my one and only a a big foot experience\nWhat about the uh thirty four episodes that occurred with you\nWhich is the favorite for you [noise] well I I don't want you actually like\nYeah I I'll have to say it all the connections with my my my parents with my mother ah when my mother came to me in innovation after she had passed away and\nAnd uh and told me she if she doesn't say much when she comes to me but she came to me and said and she was golden you know she was herself but very healthy she you know she had died of cancer and she was very healthy looking she was golden had this golden glove\nAnd uh she came to me and said you know there is a heaven that's

course and we're going to get to your calls as well as we talk about time list the paranormal world just so many different kinds of paranormal stories you've had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda\nBeen a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket um the title alone kind of makes you shiver [laughter]\nWell I grew up in a in a I'm\nIn a Norwegian American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was\nThe man who had died that was in the casket and he was home to me and he said ah ah Bruce it's it's it's okay I'm okay there's nothing to be afraid of uh uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda\nI looked around and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut uh I didn't actually ask her about it but it and then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then that typical you know Norwegian accent and that but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um it it it was\nKind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird wasn't it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just to check everybody out\nAnd see what the suit was they're very curious I think I Would be curious to\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college sure um\nWell it's kind of paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh\nWell then you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was the that was the thing now it's a it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it is not good at\nAt the college and I am a a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and\nSo I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues\nAnd and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California uh younger people and and older people different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it\nBut there are a couple that are a little skeptical including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks in the or seven weeks in the course into the course\nUm\nAnd uh it it it's been a wonderful experience of really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomena I relate my experiences they they read my book and we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories and\nThat's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which will be fun ... that's a hunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your oh Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in a ghost stories I mean there is yeah it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think the ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you the I've had\nTwo full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it's say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the to where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria and a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in ah in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh\nIn both cases\nIt was it was shocking to say the least but uh it\nUh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was\n[noise] certainly not as chilly out there this morning but not uncomfortable and temperatures kind of all the way to eighty six degrees this Saturday well about the average of eighty one but it's
