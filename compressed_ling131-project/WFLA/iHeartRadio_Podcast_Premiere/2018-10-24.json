be you know reasonable and also limits the appeals process to two years in a non capital cases soda ... you're basically all your felony cases\nYou only have a two year appealed window which kind of like give some people some peace of mind\nFor capital cases they tend to shrink that the five years and on average it's like ten to Fifteen Years okay and that means for us to be murder and capital sexual that allows victims they're pretty much be done with it All right earlier yes that's what they're trying to do it so I'm trying to you know force that they've been trying to streamline these
