F. L. A. and legal analyst Felix Vega and James Berliners well eight hundred\nNine six nine Ninety three fifty to the number if you want to talk about the caravan or go out and give us a shout now we'll get some phone calls in a moment but my my\nThirty thousand foot view take on all of\nThis is this is\nClearly a mid term political play I\nI don't even think that's really up for debate the caravan isn't going to get here until likely sometime in in mid December they're actually taking a break right now\nOr in Mexico so\nThis isn't some urgent crisis\nThat has to be dealt with today or right before the midterms but it's certainly stirs up the base\nAnd the president today said he might to play up to Fifteen thousand troops to the U.S southern border to stop migrants traveling in a caravan from entering the country\n\nNow if you were to go to that number would literally be more than the number of us service members in Afghanistan\nOr fourteen thousand\nWe already at the moment now that they've since the additional fifty two hundred troops are there in the process of sending them there to the border we already have more when you combine them with two thousand National Guard members already in place we already have more on the border than we do in Iraq and Syria\n[noise]\nDo I think it's a bad idea to have members of the national guard down on the border assisting the border patrol now Bush did it Obama did it I don't think it's a bad I\nI don't think it's necessarily a bad idea in this specific situation when you do have a mass migration like this I just don't think it's this national emergency that people are making it out to be I think it makes us look small and weak when we freaked out about something like this the way so many people are\nWe can handle this\nThe the migrant caravan ... their original number was a couple of thousand then it's supposedly got up to like seven thousand\nNow it's it's down to a around four thousand there's another smaller group of about a thousand Central Americans a little further back they've still got the the the group closer to the border so it was like nine hundred miles\nTo go there walking in about twenty twenty five miles a day if they're lucky\nSo\nThis is going to be a long a process here\nAnd\nI I guess one of the issues that I'm having with this whole thing\n\nIs this idea that if some invasion like there's some foreign army marching towards us last time there was a caravan like this and we are again we've dealt with this before which is why I'm not worried about this one\nThere was one in April there were fourteen harass fourteen most of the people didn't even make it to the border they\nStopped off in Mexico and never came\nSo\nThis this crisis this freak out you've got people on Fox News saying that the caravans going to infect Americans with\nSmallpox they're coming in with diseases such as smallpox smallpox been eradicated\nSince the eighties that what you're talking about\n\nThis idea there is another Fox Business yes the got dropped you said it was a Soros occupied State Department look if you want to claim it some big conspiracy showing some breaking evidence already\n\nOr all the people in the caravan good people probably not rarely do you have four thousand people in every\nSingle one of them is is good\nIt doesn't mean we can't sort through it\n\n[noise] ... there are a couple other\nPoints to all of this they don't want to touch on ... will carry this over to the next segment we'll get to a Charlie Sykes\nIn a bit also I Want to open up the phone lines to I Know I got ... in Sun City center on hold we'll give you Dave half the top of the hour eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty to\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two if you have any thoughts on the caravan want to chime in or if you disagree with me give us a call now we'll get to your calls next on the table [noise]\nRadio ... seventies that was the ... [laughter] that when you went to the student to clear water\nThe Senate ... Fox News President Trump hauling the first in a series of rallies is less than a week to go until the mid term\nComes through the port of entry a legal port of entry then then you there is no closing the border there they look to seek asylum there are laws [noise]\nOkay what do I tell you what their plan is right now they're going to start at the southern tip of Texas which is the closest point right now where the caravan were rich somewheres into Brownsville they're yeah they're going closed off that particular\nArea work their way up the the Ford are more\nTowards California okay you're twenty fifth major a point of entry that the illegals that are going to try to close offer\nThey already have twenty tomorrow with concertina wire that are being shipped or the border another hundred and fifty miles versus coming down they have things they have barricade they have a ... a heavy duty construction equipment\nSo what does everybody freaking out about why why is it that if I mean if if that's the ... who would then well then why is it such a big deal\nBecause he's building the wall is not the beautiful\nNow the [laughter] come on now in the fall as\nThey're now they're they're they're doing they're doing some fencing in certain areas and they repaired some other areas there's not some giant wall being constructed along the border I hate to break into your ... your bubble but but the ... the bigger the bigger the bigger point is here that if the if you're a part of the caravan\nOkay ... ... it is much more risky to try to illegally cross the border and get rounded up and then of course you're going to get deported back and I think they most of them know that with the president with Trump being in office if they go\nTo a legal port of entry and seek asylum then they have to be processed and there's at least a chance not a good one but a chance that they could be granted asylum depending on their condition so that's why you're probably going to see happen just like you saw what happened with the Caribbean and April\nThey're going to go to the port of entry and they know where those are\nWell if that's the case then that's the case he's not ... not going to make any New Orleans or anything here what are you going to try to do is just solidify the border is especially in different places where people just call really Nellie\nAnd that's why it's bringing down the barricades the barbed wire and the extra troops and they're going to be used a surveillance is going to have\nA helicopters and ... which are ... so that they could find out of April of ... what is trying to do is seal off the border is not writing any help\nYou're never going to completely seal off the border but I have no problem with enhancing the security on the border I never have\nAnd I really didn't have much of a problem with the wall if it can be done right I mean it can't be put in every single area but that wasn't a big concern to me if there can be a broader immigration deal done uh in addition to something like the wall the problem here is that people don't seem to understand\nIs that if you go through a port of entry\nThere is an asylum process that takes place it's based on law you can't just turn people away it doesn't work like that no matter how much everybody even ones that\nRight well he said no he's trying to say that he's going to do it but he's not going to be able to do it legally\nHe's literally saying they're not going to get in well that and again that's not how it works nobody's coming in we're not allowing people to come in you know if they go through legal port of entry they are going to come in and you're going to have to process them that's part of the reason that the military is on the border to build some of the tense\nAnd to prepare for those people to be house while they're being processed\nAgree ... but they\nAre going to shut the border to answer the drugs and the rest\nOf the car and and and\nThey said I don't think this is getting a whole lot of like on the news right now the cause of what he just said a few days ago about the birthright citizenship stuff\nWell that's yeah that's a that's the new hot debate\nYeah and it's kind of like sleight of hand and now he's got all these people moving down to the border with all their equipment and everything and they're going to structure things up in his truck you know I think that certain places down there it's going to look like the DMZ and and not to a longer period of\nTime and we'll see if the residents down there like it because you know not not not every resident along the border is thrilled with with some of the measures that have taken place or are going to take some of them are are because some of these border towns have been severely affected mix for the call Dave I appreciate it had been really affected by illegal immigration some of them not so much if\nThere are certain towns where they have you know the cross border yeah kind of set up where you can go freely across between you know one city in Texas in their companion city in Mexico right and it happens you know every day but you know it's a bigger issue than\nThey may be asylum part is what people uh aren't getting the president doesn't want to deal with that right um but but the fact\nIs it's law and if the Caribbean and I got to tell you it it would be let's let's let's go with the ridiculous conspiracy theory that this is like some sort of a splendid thing okay\nIf there was some brand ... why would you have them try to go through a legally rather than through a port of entry because that's what makes no none of it a a lot of what you're you're\nAlso there's two types no no sense asylum because we can be an asylum seeker yeah if you're say for example you getting into the country and you've been here for no more than a year and you can make a legal claim for asylum that's what happens at the the border crossing\nWhen those people come into the United states\nOr then if you try and get here illegally going across the river or any of the holes in the ... the border security then it becomes a defensive asylum writer you're captured you're taken into custody you can claim asylum and you go the of the asylum process that way but you're not released and so yeah there is a two different ways that you can go about doing that and\nAnd when it comes to an asylum because I I'm sure some people will be thinking well we shouldn't Grantham asylum well a lot of times we don't the the denial rate from Mexico just eighty eight percent\nA for El Salvador it's eighty percent for Honduras Seventy eight percent for Guatemala Seventy five percent so we're not admitting a lot of people for asylum because there are certain criteria that goes into getting asylum\nAnd the definition is and all that broad so certain gang issue certain domestic violence issues actually don't qualify with for asylum laws\n\nAnd if you look in the asylum laws they actually on the the US citizenship and immigration services they give you a Christ with basically the criteria that they go through and you don't fail to meet any of these then you're not coming in and let her looking a criminal backgrounds if there's any hint that you may be committing crimes in another country ... you're not coming yeah\nDoesn't mean that ... that people don't occasionally get through right but this is not that big of a disaster\nThere is a screening process it's built into the rules\nAnd and one other thing I Want to touch on in regards to immigration and again the phone number is eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two because I've been wanting to get to this for for a couple of days now we just haven't had time with all the\nBreaking news but but President Trump said last week the Europe is a total mess because of illegal immigration Dan is just not\nAt all what happened over there in a place especially like Germany ... what happened in Europe and I'm not saying their decisions were writes their decisions have caused a lot of problems within their country's turned out the refugee ...\nYou had a refugee crisis in Syria and a country like Germany\nTalk in a ton millions of refugees that's not illegal immigration that's a country trying to help refugees now you can argue whether or not that was a good idea or a bad\nIdea I think a lot of people in Germany would say hey we we bit off more than we can chew here but that's not\nIllegal immigration and wasn't illegal immigration that made Europe have immigration problems it was the refugee crisis that resulted from the conflict in Syria it's predominantly the reason for it so\nFor refugee status in the United states is something that you make a claim for before you come here\nYou shouldn't do these cases to calm yeah in order to protect people that are you know stand your ground especially if a gun is involved right that's the politics of it so the legal part of it has gotten it should only gotten more complicated the further we've gone along now the Supreme Court's got to say okay we need\nTo sell Arizona or the mall or Newton glad we happier because uh that that would have all gone way over my head without your act and I'll go up next we've got Weekly Standard contributing editor Charlie Sykes Iran PM Tampa Bay don't move\nCBS I own veterans presented by their works relief

Charlie Charlie how are you\nHey happy Halloween\nTo you have to use so glad to have you here but want to have you on the show for for a while a big fan and and I wanted to get your thoughts on a couple of different issues would start with the midterms were less than a week away from election day mortar you watching for during this final stretch\nWell you know I'm I'm ... I'm expecting a mixed verdict next Tuesday or the Republicans hold it in the Senate Democrats are probably holding it over the house\nBut what I'm really watching is which way late deciding voters are going to break a how or\nThe events of the last several days going to be playing in 'em and whether or not the president's sort of throw everything up against the wall approached immigration is is actually going to work or not to be counterproductive\nYeah it's interesting because in twenty sixteen you know people I think tend to forget that the week leading up to election day the president was actually kind of quiet you had all their news surrounding Hillary Clinton and calling me and the investigations and all of that or he wasn't really doing the same tactic that he's doing now where he is\nAll kind of a loose cannon out there you never know what he's going to say from day to day or anything you can to fire up the base so this is a little bit of a different strategy here in the midterms\nNo that's very insightful on your part to notice that I that this is you know people who think that do well he won on immigration last time are are kind of forgetting that there were a lot of other things going on in that last month and also you wonder you know what is the you know a relentless focus on the caravan uh eat birthright citizenship issue\nToday lashing out Paul Ryan is is that ... you know it it that designed to turn out the base probably\nBoth will also turnout Democrats yeah also\nMotivate suburbanites to break with the Republican Party and that's the big question mark right now\nThat's why it's interesting to see how things are playing out here in in the state of Florida where the president's coming twice a week once uh tonight here in Fort Myers and then he'll be coming back to the panhandle to Pensacola area to very Trump areas of the state but when the president's in the state\nOr it's going to be covered everywhere and so it's it'll be interesting to see how that plays I'm sure it'll fire up his base some of those areas but it could also fire of Democrats and I think one\nA really interesting thing to look at was how governor Rick Scott handled the birthright citizenship question he literally ran away from the reporter and his campaign declined to comment\nSo really yeah so so you know when you're when you're in a position where you're running for Senate like Scott is and you're not really playing to the base you trying to get a more of the middle you're trying to get that Latino vote he's worked very hard at that over the past couple of months\nOr some of these issues that are coming up right now that the president's bringing up a they become a little problematic for your campaign\nOr they've always been problematic and this has always been the problem the danger of Republicans doing themselves at the hip with Donald Trump because then they begin to own his tweets and\nAnd the various outrages look it's one thing to you\nKnow try to divide Americans frighten Americans about no several thousand I'm unarmed or people who are heading north I mean look the United states of America back like we've been here before this not a threat yeah country they are not coming to the invasion of the nation\nSo you know the president talking about sending Fifteen thousand troops to the border is somewhat ludicrous but then the birthright citizenship issue\nThey'll really ought to be this this really moment applause for I think a lot of conservatives who ought to be appalled at the president talking about using an executive order to overturn basically the fourteenth amendment U.S Supreme court decisions on birthright citizenship\nBut also there's this larger threat to deny citizenship to America to people who were born in this country we did fight the civil war over there and so I I'm not surprised that your governor is running away from\nThat's because you know there's there's a point at which you can say I want strong borders but we have now works as nativist nationalist home that I think it's gonna be repellent to a lot of voters\nWere talking to author of how the right lost its mind which is now available in paperback he's also contributing editor at the Weekly Standard and host of the daily standard podcast Charlie Sykes so what do you think about races here in Florida a lot of national\nFigures in the media and politics are watching the race for governor assuming it might be a proxy for twenty twenty do you see it that way", "show_name": "iHeartRadio Podcast Premiere", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "01"}
