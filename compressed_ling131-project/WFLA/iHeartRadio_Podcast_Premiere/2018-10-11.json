Tallahassee said you know some of the downed trees were a bit of a problem but they certainly better than they thought they might uh maybe twenty four hours ago the people that you talked to in Tallahassee over the course of the past day\nWhere they are worried were they prepared I mean this storm became so strong so fast or it feels like there's a chance it might have caught some people off guard a bit\nEverywhere we went along the Gulf Coast that was the topic I mean this this was even in our own newsroom you know earlier this week we're talking about this might be a cap on it might be up to the cat to India you know and then as\nThe days went on the forecast kept getting updated and and by the time we knew that this was going to be a major category was on the doorstep of the day

the coastline because I can only imagine just we were in Appalachia totally last night\nAnd you know the the coastal highway you know I I can only imagine that the portions of that are are uh washed out of the water I haven't seen that for myself this is just the I guess what I'm going to see and witnessed a as we try to get down to the post lights and then you know this whole area is lined with trees\nAnd especially if you get into those areas where\nThe the the actual art or you're the eye of the storm went through you're gonna have praised out everywhere it it's going to be a nightmare trying to get out of\nThose feelings figure are you seeing anyone and it was for ... starting to get out in Tallahassee are you seeing residents on about it all way kind of looking around a kind of assessing with their houses or what the damages that they're gonna have to deal with this morning right\nSo so I'm I'm In the downtown area which isn't as president focuses on Capitol building the

typical week like this but traffic has where students a lot of the lights are now but uh you know I don't think until tomorrow people can really start by getting out as much as you say\nAnd what about

A. legal analysts Felix begun right now we've got the hotline joining us is Weather Channel meteorologist mark\nDip into mark how are you I'm doing good my friend how're you doing good good to have you back on so we are seeing a a slow weakening of hurricane might goal it's now a category one at ... pm advisory or what standing out to you about the storm as of this latest advisory [noise] but\nIt's still a look we were talking about earlier the fact that it's maintaining um this kind of strength as it goes across a Georgia which is a very a bulky state to go across so to speak with a lot of land a lot of train\nA unlike if I were to go across somewhere like South Florida like what happened with Hurricane Katrina that actually strengthened because it's essentially was going across the Everglades which does not permit weakening but store like this running right up the guts so to speak right through Georgia and north Florida\nUm it is getting weaker than it was that's a good news it's still a formidable hurricane that wins or Ninety miles an hour the pressure is nine hundred and fifty five mil a bar so it's still a very deep low pressure as they go still sub twenty nine point zero zero inches\nOn the home barometer which is a very deep low pressure looks like a gale you might find in the great lakes in the wintertime a very good one at that and are still producing some strong wind gusts or some of the wind gusts we had earlier today and this is one of the things that stands out to me with this and\nIt doesn't surprise me single Airforce base the official landfall point in Mexico beach gusting two hundred and twenty nine miles an hour wow port saint Joe gusting one Thirteen Appalachian coal exhausting to eighty\nNine Seventy one miles an hour in Tallahassee Marianna, Florida gusting to a hundred and two and pretty far inland even do than gusting the sixty one miles an hour and we just got to go for forty to fifty miles an hour in Macon Georgia which is that that's about two hundred and fifty miles inland so [noise]\nUm plowing across Georgia is a category one hurricane today with windows Ninety the weather in Tampa is extremely choir actually having a very nice evening a\nFar enough away from this all the ... war with this of actually diminished a that's not to say that we couldn't see one or two more pop up as we had through the over an hour is but it's just going to be generally across central Florida warm and humid night\nA loose dropping down to about eighty degrees so it's going to stay humid but it's going to stay pretty quiet\nAnd then our reason into a pretty good weekend across central Florida with highs and the upper eighties with dry weather across the pan handle what we're going to see tonight to as the winds coming down in fact are already starting to quiet down pretty nicely in Tallahassee the winds are right now still gusting officially up to about forty miles an hour\nAs the last observation in Tallahassee but uh some of the automated weather stations around there have actually been knocked out by this hurricane\nUm earlier today Jacksonville was actually issuing warnings on behalf of the Tallahassee forecast office because of the uh the signals that have been knocked out across on north central Florida so this has been a big deal today and I'm sure you saw A Guided some of the uh the devastation that took her to Mexico beach\nUnreal unreal in a completely destroyed the the maximum sustained winds up for this storm when it came on shore or a hundred and fifty five miles per hour right did we get any\nUh instruments record that anywhere or or or when you hear that number because usually I notice now from ... to Florence to this one\nUm typically what you see in terms of the wind totals\nOr the pop up it's not really the number that you see from the advisory is that is that maximum sustained wins only in a very small a select area of the storm kind of tell us how that works\nWell yeah typically what happens is a hurricane hunters they fly into the system and they drop they put the drops down to the ocean floor and then they get back they get flight level winds back which are usually\nThe maximum sustained winds are measured about eighty to Ninety percent off of what the flight level winds are so what happens is the drops on false the atmosphere false really turbulent conditions are very durable they hit the ocean floor we get pressure readings off this we get wind readings\nAnd we get the maximum sustained winds now that being said it's like kind of like a find needlepoint you really have to at any one point a land where you're measuring the storm that's why the hurricane hundreds of there because they get the most accurate observations by putting those drop sounds through the storm\nThe chances that those kind of maximum winds are going to run over any one point where we have observation stations back on land like Appalachian", "year": "2018", "show_name": "iHeartRadio
