F. LA\nI information and discussion board Tampa Bay and nine Seventy W went belly is alive and local now more with Brian Gorman on the um Tampa Bay and\nWe are continuing our coverage of the constitutional amendments on the ballot for this midterm election I'm Ryan Gorman joining me in Studio nine Seventy W. F. L. A. and legal analyst Felix Vega let's get through amendment seven\nThis is the first responder and military members survivor benefits are amendment along with an issue on public colleges and universities it was put on there by the constitution revision commission and this is they bundled amendment\nRight and as we were talking about bundling me and said you're combining several issues so get right to it\nBy the first issue is uh basically for any first responders military personnel discovers firefighters paramedics emergency medical technicians law enforcement even corrections officers and correctional probation officers are on this end and all all the members of the military\nUh your accidentally or potentially killed or seriously injured and later die than any uh educational benefits or Kevin defined exactly what but mostly tuition your college course or college expenses\nWill be covered for your children or your spouse or that are surviving so it's not only Christian typical programs undergraduate and post graduate studies\nI'm the only thing that they require is that the ... member of the person who passed away that you either be afford a resident or have your main a military post or you're posting located here in the state of Florida so that's a good one for the survivors to guarantee\nYou know real your whole entire you know education cause beyond you know high school so that was a good\nA thing that they put in there the other one's kind of weird that they're lumped in with here I guess because it's university related\nBut the ... like the Congress there are increasing the\nThey want to increase of the majority to a super majority when they voting on increasing your fees are not tuition necessarily for universities and colleges and those are voted on by the board of governors for the uh universities or the board of trustees on the statewide statewide level so that was kind of again make it difficult to increase the fees\nFor them and then the third one basically just bundles all the state's colleges and universities into one system in the constitution that really it's just kind of a a basically a kind of a clerical thing about point\nOh so if you want to vote on ... on that\nAmendment on seven then that's what you're going to get him your vote no on it then none of that happened\nThere there's multiple things again that's one of the bundled amendments that has multiple really different things are all in one\nA constitutional amendment that was amendments seven amendment eight is not going to be on the ballot when we come back next will tell you a little bit about amendment eight and why it's not a ballot then we'll get to the rest of 'em amendment nine ten eleven twelve\nAnd Thirteen or we'll wrap up our amendment coverage next year on PM Tampa Bay\nMore news traffic and whether nags\nNews radio nine Seventy [laughter]\nWednesday October twenty four what's new today on the free I her radio high higher\nVery interest only I our radio ads on radio ... in between the Dodgers in Red Sox\nWith the real avid fan radio wherever you\nAre you a story baseball glove with a rich history face each other and the championship for the first time in more than a century World Series on ESPN Radio he's on the\nNews radio seventies WFL a W ... two Clearwater [noise]\nTracking all would be bomber I'm Lisa like Sarah Fox news the FBI releasing more information on the package bombs tend to several high profile Democrat and to CNN's New York office\nAnd it's not only that they are also basically once you make it a constitutionally mandated that the Veterans Affairs department is be part of the state government in state of Florida that's number one that they have\nUm also it sets legislative session in January and sort of march an even numbered years whereas legislature gets sent set their own schedule to share random I Know but I'm a number of you're not a number you know that even years you get a January instead of march okay and then they create a constitutional officers and counterterrorism again random that they put it in there the main ...\nNumber of years I'm assuming a that's because of elections\nPossibly that's that's what it is and yeah anyway the the other the big one is about requiring counties to elect of local officials named in the ... summary above I put that on our website basically at your shares property praise or a supervisor elections tax collectors and all the course of the court\nThis is really it's interesting 'cause it's mainly aimed at Miami Dade County because they don't have an elected sheriff they have a police director and so that to overseas my ... in Miami Dade County police\nAnd all their operations this have been more take any of those changes are all you want to shift power around within these jobs like say what the court record to oversee death and then you eliminate another position like the tax collector or whatever it would stop all that you would have to have those five officers and they would have to have elections for those offices\nWhat they're going to do with this are going to phase is in over the next\nFour years into twenty twenty four for the sheriff and then\nOfficial for twenty twenty chair let's go to amendments eleven this one again put on by the constitution revision commission this a focus is on property rights removal of obsolete a removal of an obsolete provision and criminal statutes\nRight and the the first one I didn't even know this was in the constitution but there is actually a provision that says that when it comes to property ownership in put possibly exclude\nUm in what they call the aliens ineligible for citizenship so anyone it's not a U.S citizen\nAnd there's a provision in there that we actually allows some former governor one of the state county or a state level to prohibit someone who's not a citizen\nFrom owning property so they're strict striking that out of the constitution so chaotic cleaning it up a little bit it based and there was a high speed rail never remember that all those yo yeah when it for passage last on the past\nRight so the the amendment that the part of the amendment that passed it was still in there but then it was taken off of the constitution was a ... repealed a few years later\nSo there's cleaning that up out of there and the interesting one this is a repeal of criminal law\nUh basically it's retroactive type of situation so it'd be criminal law was repealed\nAnd then he discovered that there was criminal activity or as a crime had been committed before that statue was repealed you can still go back and prosecuted under the old system it doesn't cover like if you change a statute or men did a little better changes since then the sentencing not really talking about that is awesome reporting earlier today that they were going to go back\nAnd like lessons sentences you'd have to change the entire repeal a statute and then put it back to where it was years and years ago so a little confusing but again you vote yes you get those three provisions you vote no none of that comes on the concentration and\nYou get all three if you vote yes are you are getting none of them are you voting no this is another bundled amendment we have two more to get to you were running through all of the amendments a constitutional amendments on the ballot this year here in the state of Florida\nAmendment twelve again another one put on by the constitution revision commission this one deals with lobbying and abuse of office by public officers\nSo this one puts a ban on lobbying by certain public officials both state and local for period of six years after they leave office and they also include judges and justices weather on the Supreme Court whether you're on the district courts of appeal or your regular circuit or county judge in your local a judicial circuits so that's one part of it\nThat they do it also puts a ban on using your current office for your own personal game\nWhich seems like a no brainer but they felt the need to put it in there to kind of we do with corruption and ... so yeah this puts it in the constitution and again like the other ones were in the elected officials are in her role just went out between twenty twenty and twenty twenty two depending on the elected officials that they don't want to give the people\nThere are times when they're turning out at twenty twenty okay or twenty twenty two like within the next two to four years so that will take effect for pretty much everyone is getting out of Congress was member was term limited if you're in a state legislatures state Senate so then it would probably take affecting chicken by the time they are getting out of office\nAnd the final uh amendment amendment Thirteen which ends\nDog race yes so this one very controversial ... also got challenge for bundling bite you in a different sort of way and it's all dealing with dog racing at gambling facilities are para mutual tracks and that sort of thing so when it went up to the Supreme Court it was basically went to the ... the local circuit court\nAnd then when it went up on appeal there like we're not touching this go to the Supreme Court kind of like monopoly\nAnd so what they are going to ban is actual live dog racing across the state of Florida it doesn't affect any other gaming activities at these facilities so if you go to the dark tracking you like to gamble and play in the ... the video poker or whatever\nNot affected you could still go and do that it's only live dog racing and then also it out of state dog racing so you go to go one of those places you want what\nWatch um you know dog dog racing event from New York or somewhere or at aqueduct or whatever you want to do you can still watch those you can still make wages on them so the seals they lived ... in the state of floor and there was a lot of confusion between both sides because people thought it was going to affect all gambling operations\nWhat the way that the gambling licenses work based on what I've studied up on is that there are certain requirements in those licenses where you have to have dog racing in order to get the other benefits\nThis will not affect that they're saying don't worry about it you know you can still keep her license you can still apply for a license\nYou just can't have lied dog racing but everything else stays the same essential and okay so that one's actually pretty specific once the end of the day what you read both sides of it and like I said this isn't just sitting down and reading the amendments\nI had to read every single lawsuit was filed every single Supreme Court decisions and filed in all these cases especially the bundled amendments yeah to get to the nitty gritty of this because it was so confusing I'm and\nWe're joking around earlier because I saw something on ballot media were last year as amendments\nThe level of education that you needed according to some formulas they they have on their website is that you would need Twenty years of either postgraduate her doctorate education on your on its own in order to figure out these ballot\nAnd that's why I struggle I only Nineteen years of that so I'm I'm a year short and that's why I don't know what what's going on about anyway that's why we have you here there's your ballots ladies and gentleman or legal analysts Felix Vegas so we're going to post to all of the segment so we did kind of breaking down the amendments for you on the website and it'll all be on our

now for our weekly TV segment we have TV Guide senior critic mat Raul she can follow on Twitter TV GM Matt Rausch Matt how're you\nDoing pretty well Ryan how's it going\nGood thanks so much for joining us this evening so let me start with the Mayans on FX you know I'm obsessed with this show I was a huge huge fan I Would say sons of anarchy a top three all time show for me what is the reaction so far two minds\n[noise] it seems like a pop for effects I mean it was playing to their uh\nIt was the thing that your show for them so it's plain to that audience and it seems like it's doing okay it's already been renewed so it'll be around I don't know if it's going to have a long a run his sons of anarchy but I think it's gonna be a keeper for them or they need shows like that especially as they're transitioning to new ownership by Disney even though this doesn't this isn't the kind of showed the really fits the Disney brand\n... Disney pledges that uh FX will be allowed to stay or doing what effects always did and this is one of those things that affects did very well so I have a feeling that that says you know a show for their present and future\n... what is it a balance a show like minds orange sons of anarchy that leaves it a little short on the critics list\n[noise] hard to say I mean sons of anarchy eventually got some respect I think uh it doesn't get like Emmy nominated yeah and I doubt this one will either it's just a little too raw and and and all of that um and the role that lives in isn't particularly\nUm appealing to a lot of people um but those who you know the the sort of there's a recipe to the world they're portraying I guess that and you know there's a lot of twists within it in terms of the house\nOf factions and who's lying to who when when troops get revealed throats are going to get slut or worse you know depending on who was torturing who um and so yeah it's just I think that you know the extreme nature of the show sometimes works against it\nAnd the fact that it isn't particularly star driven um had regimes almost course in this one but um I don't think that this is going to be a show that will be ... taken particularly seriously by the industry except for the fact that if\nThe access which never hurts\nYeah that that was that was the one question I had because you know you know what sons of anarchy was like it was a cult following and and this one's a you know likely going to be the same way and the shows I I think the acting as fantastic the storyline is unbelievable uh you know so many different twists and turns I I I\nI just always wondered why a show like that could never reach a level where it was respected by the broader industry in terms of a potential nomination or something like that that I Know\nAnd and now and now it's even worse because there's just so much out there now and in between all the things that are on streaming and streaming has become the new HBO\nAnd HBO was you know got a lot of competition as well and and this the world that it portrays though is I think just so disreputable that it would be hard for the show to\nAchieve any kind of a you know mass when it comes to acknowledgement of the awards there's just so many shows fighting for attention and those that have made it are going to probably stay keeping you nominated it's really hard for new shows to\nTo break in the might take this one a couple of seasons and ah and even then it probably wouldn't be seen as the kind of show that gets that kind of attention\nIs this your dark and dirty basically probably\nYeah nuts and I we have a lot of things so [laughter]\nWe're talking about TV Guide senior critic mat rouse a Netflix is launching a bodyguard what's this went all about", "year": "2018", "show_name": "iHeartRadio Podcast Premiere", "city": "Tampa", "day": "25"}
