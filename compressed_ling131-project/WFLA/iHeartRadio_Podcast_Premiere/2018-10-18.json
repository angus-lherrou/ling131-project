I've gotten a lot of calls doing coverage for the Panama City area and a lot of them have come from ... have you been a really really hard hit area I Know there's a lot of ah assistance up there's lots of points of distribution up there for supplies and ... and things like that but the people there\nAre again they they got devastated by the storm\n[noise] exactly I actually and I encountered that kind of look at it was a curfew\nBut I never came [noise] other than English as a ... which is called south and I kept thinking well I didn't know so it was so bad habits because I wasn't looking to have that and before I realized that I was halfway through the kind of a say\nBecause I have and we're totally unrecognizable yeah ...\nI just I couldn't wait I panic and went to once I saw a couple of times I went to St Louis city homeland in fire departments police department or whatever and I just could not could not played it but that\nThey have distribution sites behind ill behind him to stay home and they just opened up one and a\nFederal credit union I'm In I'm Seventy seven and they do have a massive amount of things that are coming in I don't think Panama City Quetta which have

hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two we'll be back in a moment more phone calls to get to ... pm Tampa but that's all sixteen K A day from ... am to ... pm here next chance to win a thousand bucks coming up at six pass the top of the hour on nine Seventy W half\nYou were less than thirty minutes away from your next news update on nine Seventy ... this is Pam Pam with Brian Gorman [noise]\nComing outside just after the top of the hour we every legal thing for you nice Seventy WFL a legal analyst Felix big or is going to join us the ah Lakeland city commissioner who was involved in a\nShooting if you haven't heard about that story it might be a potentially be a a stand your ground case we're going to break it down for you will tell you everything that took place a so that's coming up just after eight right now let's go back to the phones we got a few minutes for some more phone calls let me go to Ralph in Hudson on line one Ralph how are you\nA no complaint about yourself and do it thanks for the call\n'em my concern is the concept of business politics is a business the radio stations are business I'm pretty sure that the ads were scheduled months in advance\nWell yeah but this sad by Governor Scott the one that that we've been talking about that he recently just put out it actually features him doing a work on hurricane Michael it features him housing to state troopers so that\nThat had just got put together okey dokey so that in mind yep\nIf there was a way that it could have been home but his uh you know is a support team said no this is what we're going to do we're going to show that we're going to politicize this hurricane right now\nThat's not a good thing yeah what if it was something that in the business sense with logistically put out in advance and then I can say the machine that sorry you don't get a refund you scheduled time to start\nRight and then it's going to try and like I said in your car clarify thanks for the call rap like I said if it were an ad about his work during Hurricane Irma I don't have\nA problem with it it's just the biggest one is about this hurricane and I think it's too soon and I just didn't like the fact that if you're gonna how state troopers and just how state troopers you don't have to slap that on an ad it just makes the whole thing look political uh let me go to Chris here in Tampa on line three Chris how are you\n[noise] hey how you doing tonight good for the call the\nI think yeah I think Scott Scott a of a sudden he's he's leading and that's when you get them to do your Gillum and I'm no fan of go on but if you've out there doing something I Want to hear about it yeah\nI I just don't think he needs to he's front and center anyway with the work he's doing this this comes off as politically calculated whereas he could get media attention anytime he wants or just by doing an interview in and saying hey I have an update for ya you know\nI got you but look at like ... and you had a good point earlier why the up there he's still a senator I Want to grow up like a do the dissent those that gave up his congressional seat yup well he doesn't really have a horse race anymore and our federal government does but Nelson he should be all over\nI I agree I I think he's missed a huge uh our opportunity to show that he's a engaged and involved I Know he was up there for a little bit but uh you know for him I think he just wants to use you honestly to\nGo away as quickly as possible because it's playing and governors Scots favor and not his I mean if we are being real about it yeah\nYeah I'm a nail in it by the way with Trump he should be tweeting about this getting getting people were out up to do some donations are relief efforts or something yeah I mean I Know he's got midterms coming up but uh he he could make an impact here this is kind of his home state too if this place them South Florida so he could have easily got whacked by one these hurricanes\nAnd he could he could you write and thank you but the culprits he could have a huge impact or with with just a tweet every now and then it doesn't all have to be about Florida but\nIn between your stormy and Pocahontas and fake news and a witch hunt tweets just kind of pop one in there about the people in Florida that you just visited\nAnd remind everybody hey they need help that's all I'm asking I don't think that's an on reasonable request coming up in the next hour we still got a lot that we haven't gotten to a ... ... this is an interesting\nAccording to police Lopez tried to pocket the hatch it inside the store done who's a corner of the business confronted him asking\nIf he was going to pay for the item and and then you know we saw what we saw in the surveillance video are going to put that video on line for you to check it out if you haven't seen it yet\nAt nine Seventy W. F. L. A. dot com and go to the PM Tampa Bay page when Lakeland police officers arrived about two thirty PM Lopez was laying dead in the parking lot so yeah the the question I guess would be if stand your ground is to play any role in this case\nUm did a lake when city commissioner Michael Dunn have\nA a reasonable view that his life was in imminent danger he was an imminent danger of great bodily harm rice and\nI think that the problem here is at least based off of what I'm seeing in the surveillance video now maybe there's more that we haven't seen but I mean this is like a close up angle right of of what took place at the front door of this store it just looks to me like\nA Lopez while he was in the wrong for trying to steal a hatch it was trying to exit the store I'm trying to run away\nI just reroute did a little bit further and he pulls away from 'em like initially\nThe chemistry gets in front of them and then he tries to pull away from 'em again and that's when he grabs for Egypt tries to push past them grabs a shirt and essentially as you can see him talking him back into the store yeah as he's trying to get away and then he just open he has a gun out the entire\nTime right if you're in fear for your life I don't think you'll be trying to pull the person with the hatch back at you right\nAnd that's where I think this if they do charge him he's going to have a difficult time asserting stand your ground especially when\nYou know he has a right to stand his ground obviously but when the suspect is starting to get away\nThat's the problem and that's the thing we saw in the uh Michael J. case over in Clearwater the stand your ground shooting that we've been covering is whether or not Mr McLaughlin was turning away right All right just this suggest that he was not only trying to turn away and get out but was being pulled back in when he was shot inside\nI looking at the frame where we're done pulls out his gun or he's got his gun in the sand or on the entire time but where he pulls it or to to shoot a Lopez I mean Lopez's is falling away now it it looks like he could potentially have that hatch\nIt in his right hand there is an object in his right hand which is kind of holding the door as well you can't really see it but I I mean\nHe practically pulls a shirt or\nAlmost all of them yeah yeah it's it\nIt does it look like he's in any position right there are to make any kind of move it done he's moving in the opposite direction when the shot his fire right\nAnd if he was going to make the argument that he was in fear that he was going to be stabbed or whatnot\nThe angle where Mr Lopez's I'm just doing this appear analysis as a prosecutor or former prosecutor is that if he was going to swing around he's now got the door\nIn between him and writes the the commissioner so I I don't again I'm not going to prejudge the case but like those are the factors that as a prosecutor I Would be looking at\nAnd making a determination whether or not this was legitimate stand your ground case or whether charges are warranted I mean in this case I'd say ... depending on\nAh the intent that they can reason we prove\nYou know men soldiers were in the heat of the moment we talked about global Monday yeah\nUh those different theories and intentional act obviously going to second degree murder it's more to pray mind ... difference that you knew you were going to cause death or serious great bodily harm so depending on how they split on that it could go either way but I think he probably end up facing charges for that\nNow a couple of other things I Want to point out and again a European Tampa Bay um rang Gorman with me nine Seventy WFL a legal analyst feelings may get we're talking about um this surveillance video of the shooting involving Lakeland city commissioner Michael Dunn and crystal ball Lopez two things I Want to ask\nYou about let me know if they will make any kind of difference um it says here in this report that uh\nThe video continues for about three minutes after the shooting which we have here Lopez lives face down on the ground as done walks in and out of the frame and no one has seen attempting to render first aid will that play any could that play any role in the decision making process on the part of the state\nAttorney in terms\nOf whether or not he was it was an accident in the Arctic could show that he was not it wasn't an accident the gun just didn't go off me and you see not only on one if the gun in his hand you see a ... point the gun out I'm pulling on Mr Lopez and then shooting him so it's a\nDeliberate act that done didn't try to help him at all after he shot him or her call for help or anything like that that\nMost everything in terms of like when you're talking about intentional acts it's all what is in your mind at the time time enough to shoot okay for ... because I remember and Casey Anthony I was covering that trial everyone kept making a big deal about how she went out dancing and she was out with their friends and you know how could she not a care about Kaylee that she was missing or\nNot avid or it's not how you react or before he got a another question I have for you Florida law allows store employees do you use reasonable force to try to detain suspected shoplifters how could that play into this blog\nIt comes out of reasonable force of what it was just it was an armed and he was just trying to pull the guy back in and you know say he was able to tackle under the ground take the weapon away from that's reasonable force or they could argue that\nWouldn't be considered reasonable force for done to pull out his weapon and tell him you know stop\nIt you can make that argument um depending on them to a ... if there was no other a threat to him for example if he said you know get on the ground and Lopez imply gone on the ground and any it bridges pocketing cause I'm On the media will entertain some there you know there may be an argument that\nYou know OK well does need to put your gun but he is you today on the case right you can make the ... he had a hatch it on him I was I pulled the got out he was he what he threw the hash it away I held him at gunpoint and that was that so that's an argument that he he could make if there wasn't lethal force used\nRight now the final question I have for you a game show [laughter]\nThere's a lot of of parts to the story again each and every one of these types of stories have been a they've been tragic obviously and they've also been very interesting in terms of how you interpret the law and and what goes into a building a case one way or another we're deciding not to bring charges\nAnd one of the other important things because we can't located stand your ground cases in a vacuum and that's why I think a lot of people try ... has the earlier the loan and a lot of people try and put these in one big giant on bravo like stay in the ground if a B and C or ... you know what I'm Talking about eight and see we're down into like double Q and triple T.\nAs far as like this specific detailed I have the specific action that they took\nLet me ask you this the shooting is the second time done has shot up person it's the first time the shooting was fatal they'll Lakeland ledger reported the done accidentally shot a man when he was Nineteen could that play any role in this case\nTo I don't think it would um if it wasn't he accidentally shot someone that's a different story I go to see his non lethal but there were move on time unless it was the exact same type of circumstances we talked about in the Michael drink a case where\nCommute goes goes underground us now from the Knight climate\nChange no I don't think so and he's in line with us on climate change right back talking about it that uh\nYeah yeah yeah what do you think positively your category or hurricane in the middle of the ... of October what the goal boiling at eighty five\nI think a lot of times and look I have I ever take on on climate change that that uh is more in line with the mainstream take on it not necessarily Republicans like Rick Scott but usually what they'll say is they think that the climate change probably is happening but they don't think it's necessarily manmade so that well that's the only reason all\nOf us adopt a policy a climate change up for this man if it is at it let's just say it isn't what will you be breathing healthier drinking water would that be the end result\nI think I think at the end of the Arab world bank\nDwayne during that year for the call I got to run here but I I think at the end of the day uh and I've said this time and time again that a focus on the renewable energies is positive not just from an economic standpoint but also from a climate standpoint I think if you can\nMake a renewable energies like solar and things like that work I think it's beneficial all around them I'm all for and it's making that transition and making those things work and focusing on
