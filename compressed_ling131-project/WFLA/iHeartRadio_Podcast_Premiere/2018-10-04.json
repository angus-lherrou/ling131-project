but it was twelve points after embarrassed poll conducted in mid September so ... what\nDoes that tell you it tells you that you're seeing a shift that there is certainly a a renewed energy and enthusiasm among Republicans and taking a look at some new Fox news polls on some big Senate races\nHeidi Heitkamp who is running for reelection in North Dakota\n... she's the Democrat\nShe was down ... points last month she down twelve in the new Fox news Paul\nI I don't see how Heidi Heitkamp votes against Kavanaugh I think you can lose Susan Collins and even Murkowski and still get this passed\nWith perhaps flake mansion in high camp with those numbers she's got a seriously take a look at how she's going to vote on Kavanaugh assuming the FBI investigation doesn't turn up anything completely disqualify\nYou take a look some of the other numbers and they're moving in the right direction for Republicans\nSo whether or not that holds depending on how this Kevin ... plays out that remains to be seen but certainly the Kavanaugh story is having an effect in having a positive effect for Republicans leading up to the midterms\nIn at like ... and ... you look at what you're talking with Diane Feinstein and you know when did she know about the letter when it got released I think that really set the tone for the hearing and ... really kind of people going\nWay she did what and the number of people twenty million people ... watching across five networks ... in the mid ... all day event I mean that's extraordinary\nOne other quick question I Want to ask you Rachel Mitchell the prosecutor who ah was asking the questions of Christine Ford for Republicans and then started to you know when it came to cap it all the Republican Senate eventually kinda sidelines her and took that process over\nShe issues this report right these memos her take on what Christine Ford had to say and if you go through the memos it's pretty damning I mean she she certainly brings up a lot of issues with Christine ... story and testimony\nI'm and she makes the conclusion that a prosecutor reasonable prosecutor wouldn't bring this case\nThe problem I had no one to get your thoughts as a former prosecutor is that\nShe did this strictly kinda based off of some of the information that she had and the testimony that she saw but with no thorough investigation and her not being able to fully interview Brett Kavanaugh at the hearing because she was sideline halfway through\nIt struck me as a little they're responsible um for her to issue a conclusion not for her to lay out what she did when it came to forward but to issue a conclusion\nRight and I saw that too and again we're mixing these legal standards of you know what a criminal prosecutor bring you know this case and Lindsey Graham said that you know extensively in his two or three different\nUm ah statements that he made during the course of the hearing and he like he said he was focused on you know time place and date and we didn't have those establish yeah I thought it was a little odd for her as a\nYou know questioning member you know not you know you prosecute she was not there to be a prosecutor now ... central to be a defense attorney to doing it I'm going yeah right and so I don't think it was a proper for her as a prosecutor\nTo make prosecutorial conclusions about a Senate hearing in a Senate investigation they I don't know what they're the rule is like\nDid they tell her she no pressure to gas they want to bet that memo to come out is if you read the memo it raises a lot of question right around them you know you watch the hearing you ... you know thirty forty pages of notes like you did and that's one thing but I think making legal conclusions again in a Senate environment\nIs very dangerous as far as the perception and because we get a lot of confusion I think the people that are watching the hearings they need to be able to watch the hearings for themselves and not have to be able to forced into believing that it's a criminal investigation it's very serious you know because you do not a criminal investigator does not know enter different standards are different rules just like\nYou know why is the FBI looking into the background like of course it last week is supposed to Secret Service there are procedures that are very different from normal law enforcement avenues\nEight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty Tuesday number eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two back more PM Tampa Bay it's all\nFake team pay day from ... am to hear your next chance to win a thousand bucks hunting at that fix half the top of the hour nine Seventy ...\nInformation and discussion board Tampa Bay nine Seventy WFL a is alive and local now more with Brian Gorman fun medium Tampa Bay\nAmerican Spectator contributing editor Jeffrey Lord coming up at eight or six will get his thoughts on the cabinet developments right now Chris in ... and joins us on line one Chris how are you\nActually want to say that I didn't have a real problem with Trump's statements at the rally you're being an entertainer and all that but the larger things in my position is that it doesn't matter about cabinet because that's not what senators or job is to not supposed to judge the president then make just\nAbout a Supreme Court nominee based on the president's not well I don't necessarily don't what Trump said yeah it doesn't matter trumpet Scott like when I was qualified\nAnd it does it I'll tell you why it matters in and start Chris I got to cut you off her up against a heartbreak but I appreciate the call I'll tell you why it matters\nBecause what he says has an effect on public opinion and public opinion has an effect on those senators that's why what the president says matters that's why what he did last night makes life harder for Murkowski Collins\nMansion and hike camp\nNot necessarily flake biz flakes retiring he can pretty much do you can write whatever he wants a and I'm Still not a hundred percent sure which way he's going to go I think he would like to bowl for Kavanaugh but I don't think it's a sure thing just yet but that's why because what the president says has an effect on public opinion\nAnd public opinion and constituents have an effect on the senator's voting Jeffrey Lord coming up next tier on P. M. Tampa Bay\nNews radio knives seventies ballet [noise] and so when you went to the two Clearwater [noise]\nI'll tell you exactly what it is right this this rally that the president was that that some people are taking\nOffense to where he he went after a a doctor for for her response it it's not what he said it's the response\nWhen you listen to this when you watch it it's the response from the audience which was huge and my point is that there are a lot of Americans out there who were seriously offended by the way judge Kavanaugh was treated sure\nAnd and they are are you know furious at this and this is going to have a political impact in November\nYou'll agree though I\nI Hope the tone that the president took when he said what he said last night probably wasn't appropriate right\nI I you know I I don't necessarily agree for for this reason if you're going to come out I don't care who you are you're going to come out there and accuse somebody and then all of these people these special interest groups and all this are going to slander the subject\nWith no proof zero proof yeah and then say that the whole system of American Jurisprudence should be up ended\nAnd that it's no longer about uh\nSo you can see the politically allegations down down the road and the ... we talked about the court cases judges have been very critical of the governor and the whole process that is very really for current\nProcess right right and and that so so that's an amendment I think that we should be voting on a minimum of five I think we should be voting on the rest of them to be perfectly honest with you I think that should be handled by the legislature are coming up next we're going to have our weekly TV segment with TV Guide senior critic mat Rausch Iran pie and Tampa

Matt how're you doing well Ryan how's it going\nGood so let's start with semi ratings we've got some numbers in for Murphy Brown last man standing manifest out what stood out to you as\nWell as the fact that if any new show pops it's always kind of news because it's so hard to launch anything nowadays so the fact that in the first two weeks of the season it looks like NBC has at least the germ of a of a successful show in manifested definitely open big had terrific promos than a premise there oh yeah a lot of people so we'll see whether it\nSustains it's kind of hard to sustain shows like this\nUm but it but it's done well and and the second week it was still the most watched show when it's time period which actually edged out of the good doctor which was last year's big hit on Mondays\nAlthough they're both doing just fine and then delayed viewing doing even better but the fact that manifest has seemed to have popped we'll see again whether it's the things I I did not think the second episode was as good as the first but we'll see where the story's going and like I said if it's\nIf it's if it's something that intrigues the audience enough though actually watch it and sometimes even in real time that's a hit for the networks\nI've watched both episodes\n... mainly because we talked about the show so much on this segment that I wanted to check it out and see see what it was like I like it so far my concern is I could see it going in a couple of different directions\nThat could make me lose interest really quick so we really just depends on where they're taking this story moving forward if that makes sense\nYeah I mean this this\nThis idea that they're hearing voices that steer them toward almost superhero heroically solving crimes that out of the show I one of the I Know uh but but then again you know the thing happened up in the sky they might have been gone for five and a half years but that's behind them so unless there's something that happened that is dramatic that we can keep going back to\nThe investigation doesn't even going to be that a dramatic depending on where it goes next so\nIt's it's an interesting idea but I'm not sure it's enough to sustain a series over the long haul but we'll see the other ratings do you think you hit it was about these comebacks from uh from last weekend continues into this week that\nMurphy Brown opened with okay numbers but we thought they might be bigger because of what's happened to other um rebates in the path that will and grace open bigger and Roseanne open with sensational numbers ... back in the spring so Murphy Brown didn't do super business like you know seven million that's not bad anymore but\nI thought might have been twice as much a given what's been happening with the ... yeah and then the next night on a very ... of what's usually a very slow friday night last man standing next to did better number in terms of total audience getting the eight million viewers on a friday night\nTo welcome Tim Allen back the TV after a year off the air that was significant especially on a network at a night they couldn't get business or so Fox is really a think patting themselves on the back that they've got that show\nAnd it leads into another show called the cool kids which brings back some you know pretty amazing comic talent and David Allan Greer and Vicki Lawrence and Martin mole playing sort of golden majors in a retirement community having hygiene and shenanigans and very very broad old fashioned kind of comedy but sometimes that works", "show_name": "iHeartRadio Podcast Premiere", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "04"}
