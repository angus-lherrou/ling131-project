tax\nFolks and for those of you listening that as you're concerned about your taxes folks you should be um I'm going to talk to you about the biggest trap that prevents baby boomers from having the retirement outcome that they could have\nThat ends up being different because of not having a proven tax savings strategy to save them the most unnecessary tax\nFolks I Want to share with you that what you do now has to be in in in implemented before the end of Eighteen for you to save taxes\nFor twenty Eighteen and why I think this is so important uh you know I'm I'm somebody that writes books and has national radio show but I I work with a certain number of clients each and every year and a half now going on twenty three years in the financial arena\nThat I've seen firsthand the uninformed did I think a former federal judge hand said it best he said you know in America there are two tax systems one for the informed and one for the uninformed both\nAre legal and I think this article kind of says it all so if you're somebody listening and you saved money towards retirement let's say a couple of hundred thousand or more typically for those of you listening to save money in tax deferred accounts meaning the hasn't been taxed yet 'til you take it out\nYou should have some concerns and and I'll tell you why because there are so many tax traps that the government's counting on you believe me they're counting on you in a big way and it's what I write about my books you become unnecessarily the perfect taxpayer\nYou see one of the articles out this week says why retirees tax rates may be higher than they expected says higher income retirees may see their tax brackets\nFall but still face higher levels or levies of tax because of\n... tax on their Social Security or tax on their Medicare part B and be right through the form of higher premiums considering the additional taxes many will see a marginal tax rate that could jumped as high as forty percent\nOf folks think about it in in in at a time when the greatest tax cut is ever been passed in our country's history people are going to face higher taxes\nAnd it's like upset for years with the government give us the government take us away and you've got to be informed right if you're going to save the most you've got to be informed the most snow talked about a few clients like yourselves friends and neighbors other boomers that are basically said well you know\nCharles Oliver I understand why you do what you do folks my story simple I I can tell you how to over pay tax I overpaid tax for years\nBut being a a well strategist in in writing and teaching\nAnd teaching tax attorneys and CPAs and really learning the impact of how retirement ties into taxes it's amazing how many people were overpaying unnecessarily they're overpaying tax and it could all be prevented and I want to teach you how you can eliminate\nThe IRS out of your IRAs getting the government out of your tax return I'll I'll talk to you about clients that have legally zeroed out their tax liability\nTalked about how people actually untaxed the IRA money\nHow people can avoid having up to eighty five percent of their Social Security taxed because folks many people are being caught off guard and some of you listening I've had the opportunity to sit with and you've shared yourselves while truck I had no idea of this tax scam that the government and Social Security holds\nA we would have never known I had a client in this week that said gosh we've been with the same advisor for Twenty years and he's never mentioned this folks\nReality as it gets tiring it into a comprehensive plan right it's not just what you make is we've all heard right it's what you keep\nIn in in learning and teaching and seeing and having a real life experience\nWith what it means to be self employed and pay taxes on taxes and seeing a unfortunately people that are more in the accounting area of taxation not the tax savings area of taxation it's kind of a rigged game to be quite candid\nAnd the reality is ... you've got to become informed in order to benefit the most\nAnd you know even when we look at what was that a book out called the ... golden rules of retiring rich one of the main goals are one of the main rules I should say was the rich stay rich because they are savvy enough not to let Uncle Sam to too much of their money in other words\nRight they understand that being informed legally ethically morally to reduce your taxes\nIs perfectly allowed\nIt's just the government has a tax plan for you", "show_name":
