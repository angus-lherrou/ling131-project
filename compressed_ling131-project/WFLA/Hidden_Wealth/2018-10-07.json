Would always tell the people\nEspecially if you have to provide your own leads your sphere only go so far forensic because they know six other real exactly um you know so it's difficult and I think a

dynamic\n[noise] little green men from ours are attacking and your nowhere near a radio going\nBy listening to watch her final news information on high powered radio\nFrom the radio now you've\nGot a new Web LA [noise]\nLook here's here's the importance of this point right and I and I think this is this is key the the top retirement solutions that others miss\nIs the tax peace now this is the tax piece impact us all heavens no it doesn't impact us all because a lot of people haven't ... due to this retirement crisis it's been proven with all the polls a lot of people haven't saved\nAppropriately for retirement and they're going to be in big trouble we talked about the pyramid right the pyramid back in the day for a lot of us thinking about our parents or grandparents retirement\nWas very simple a a good solid foundation of that pyramid was our pension than it was our Social Security and the little peek at the top of the pyramid was money that we could generate off of our savings well now you got to take that pyramid and in standard on it's on it's on its ear because now it's the opposite\n[noise] now we need the majority very little is coming from pensions\nAnd then of course Social Security is obviously been restricted with low cost of living adjustments the threat of a being cut Twenty one percent within technically the next\nRoughly Fifteen to Twenty years and the fact that most people went from a defined benefit pension paid by the employer to a ... a defined contribution plan which is what I call the yo yo plan which stands for your on\nYour own right you eat what you kill what you put away is what you're going to get to draw from and that's what's causing a lot of people to not be able to retire or retire with the lifestyle that they had envisioned\nAnd the good as as it doesn't have to be that way folks but the harsh reality is we're on our own for the majority of you listening and I know this by having a front row seat with baby boomers now for going on to a quarter century read twenty three to twenty four years we're in and have had a front row seat with boomers and I've learned the very real things\nThat are preventing boomers from having an optimal retirement and here here's what they are some of these are basic but we're going to get into the specifics number one even forks had a great article that said the number one thing that's preventing people from having the retirement that they could have is number one having a plan\nSo that one seems pretty common sense right having a plan I just talked to two clients this last week and by the way I'm not just a a best selling author or radio educator I'm someone with my wealth architecture team that takes on a certain number of clients each and every year all over the United states and I can tell you\nThe reality is these particular clients have said you know what we've never had a full fledged plan some of them said we've never had a plan and many of them said that particular two of them this past week we've never taken the time to actually do a budget Chuck in your budget woke us up what I call a lifestyle\nIncome budget that is in other words not just the essential but the wants to travel more to do more while you can to see your grand kids as they grow up and they said you know what we had no idea we had that much money going out of folks that's the that's the real first step\nThe second step is than implementing a plan\nThe third step in probably the most crucial the Forbes article went on to say was then managing the plan for further optimization so here's what I Want to encourage you the importance ... more so probably than ever before in my career I'm seeing\nIs the investigation into the optimization\nOf an actual full fledged holistic comprehensive whatever you want to call a plan that incorporates tax strategy solutions to save tax folks\nBecause as much as I'm for these tax cuts somebody's going to have to pay for them and ... that somebody or those that have worked hard and it's said even harder and typically it's because they've saved and accounts that the accounts until they start drawing money out have not been taxed yet\nWhich means deferred taxes equal increased taxes because the cost of living will increase of the distribution out of those accounts will have to increase to net the higher amount and needed to spend\nThat add to the fact ... you know tax tax reform one point oh and now the passing through the house of tax reform to point out all of these cuts\nIs causing massive increases to our deficit now we're seeing some positive things come from that but some of them folks are false positives the corporations cutting their tax to buy back their own stock to keep the party rolling\nIt can only last so long until they run out of the ability to do the buybacks and artificially propped our market's up candidly for about the last three years if not for\nSo it's kind of prolong the party but folks the lights are going to have to go out at some point in having a plan that not only addresses taxes but also addresses the protection to the downside right a few clients this week said you know what I really like about him while solution as you guys\nFind tax savings in wealth strategies that other people miss and folks it it's not just seeing what people are missing it's Dennis ... where the advantages are in the timing of having the advantages and I gotta tell ya\nOutside of the the chance of Trump getting uh unfortunately uh impeached which could make a lot of these tax cuts a timing go away very quickly\nIs the fact that they're going to expire unless this permanent tax cut gets put through but even if this permanent tax cut gets put through the reality is the tax magnitude for those that have worked the hardest and save the hardest is going to be even greater\nAnd let me make sure that you understand the the the ... the key if you don't remember anything else I share with you remember these two words shifting and timing and we'd like to say in our practice shift\nHappens but it happens as part of his strategy to a comprehensive plan other words one client I'll I'll share a couple of days with you that I thought were very impactful because the folks just didn't see it right so for example\nA client was very taken back recently because they were going to have to have a earnings provision penalty on their Social Security benefits that they never knew they were going to have meaning over Seventeen thousand forty dollars if before full retirement age you draw your Social Security\nEvery two dollars you're over Seventeen thousand in forty dollars you basically have to give one dollar back\nThey had no idea if you've not drawn your Social Security for a full twelve months you can get a redo\nIt but you've got to see what makes the most sense for you we had another client that learned\nHow eighty five percent of their Social Security would be taxed because of a choice of the type of pension payout that they would elect as opposed to doing a lump sum roll over which would enable them strategically to avoid having eighty five percent of their Social Security tax\nNow here's the big one right\nOne particular client had no idea that in the new tax reform bill now the taxes are on sale maybe not permanently but at least temporarily which means take advantage of the sale while the sale last that there is a one hundred percent tax deduction\nThat can be used between now in the end of twenty twenty to that one client we met with this week we were able to move two hundred and eighty thousand dollars out of his remaining IRA and the net result is paying zero tax for those who qualify under the special provisions of the code\nAnd finally\nWe had a client who was unaware right that the legislation now that is being passed is to prevent the stretch IRA meaning\nBefore when the second spouse passes the remainder of the IRA can be passed on to the next generation and then there's an inherited required minimum distribution over their inherited age lifetime will now Congress although it's passed a hundred percent before in the Senate a few years ago its back on the chopping block\nAnd likely to be passed in a recent article that now any inherited irate money has to be fully closed out in under five years\nWhich means when people can afford the tax the least while they're making the most they are going to be forced to take a distribution that indirectly makes Uncle Sam the biggest beneficiary of your IRA\nFolks I'm going to be teaching this coming Tuesday an introduction of how to on tax the the growth of your money on tax the distribution in use of your money and untaxed the concern of leaving attacks\nThe unfortunate penalty to your children and I'm going to be teaching it in a complementary educational Web and our this Tuesday and you can register well space is still available go to retirement protected dot com\nThat's retirement protected dot com and register now if you're married it couldn't be more important time even though one spouse predominant makes the financial choices for the family\nBut the choice of pensions the choice of when to draw Social Security the choice of what to do with your IRAs or rollers or for for one case\nCouldn't be more important than right now folks because again shifting and timing what your shift and what you time will make all the difference again that retirement protected dot com retirement protected dot com or if you prefer you can call a five five six six eight\nTo nine to eight that eight five five six six eight to nine to eight but you've got to hurry folks the space fills up even though it's complimentary\nThe spaces fill up quickly 'cause we teach over all throughout different time zones of the U. S. and different people have a more preferred time while the spaces available books you've worked hard for your money I mean without question you worked hard you've saved hard the concern is getting taxed even harder\nNow when we come back from this break I'm going to talk to you more about some solutions and introductions I'll be teaching this Tuesday but keep this in mind shift being in timing and the timing of this can be important more important because the tax sale could be coming to an end and the stock market's Bull Run is likely close behind\nAnd the the the known of what's predictable of higher taxes having to come to pay for all these tax cuts especially what two point oh tax cut just passing the house\nI'm a big believer in tax cuts unfortunately what the government's not telling you is where they're going to go collect the needed tax from from these tax cuts and it's very simple it's going to come from you in the form of your IRA distributions with a higher tax rate because it's going to push you into a higher tax rate\nEventually as they change the tax rates\nIf especially if they're not made permanent which I think's a long shot and taxing your Social Security taxing more of your Medicare part B indie premiums called penalties\nAnd folks who doesn't have to be that way out to be teaching this Tuesday or I'm going to be teaching introduction of how to grow money without tax used without tax and not leave a tax burden to your kids but also going to teach you to where you can have double digit potential upside\nWhen the market grows without any downside exposure focus has saved our clients bacon in two thousand one to two thousand eight early two thousand nine\nAnd it can help you to simply go to retirement protected dot com that's retirement\nProtected dot com and register it's a log on and learn educational weapon our world teach you how to get the iris out of your IRAs how to avoid making Uncle Sam your biggest beneficiary instead of your kids I'll\nTeach you how to not have to have fifty to eighty five percent of your Social Security tax it'll teach you how to do a tax free but also market loss free\nNow it's not an annuity it's a different structure it's one of many hidden well solutions that we teach but you've got to hurry even though it's a complementary education of women are the space fills quickly retirement protected dot com retirement protected dot com or coal eight five five\nSix six eight to nine to eight again eight five five six six eight to nine to eight\nVotes you worked hard for your money shifting timing discovered uncover your hidden wealth retirement protected dot com oh\nShucks we realized was your plan gives us peace of mind because we have Gehring she never lose money I guess the market a gym\nSo that means security threat count girl taxi and Lincoln acts as their money being what more can you if you want to\nCheck on over at the end well for Lucian we'll get your retirement on track retirement protected dot com that's retirement protected dot com\n[noise] New Year's traffic and whether hard radios dying Seventy WFL a\nSon that train traffic center of our by millionaire\nWe do have a problem as whole county on ice for this all the ... the U.S twenty seven that'll be mammography fifty five there's a disabled vehicle blocking the lesson exit ramp at us twenty seven so expect some delays here\nThis report is sponsored by Andy dot com indeed used by over three million businesses for hiring more business owners and age are professionals can post job openings with screener questions and Stuart review and communicate with candidates from an online dashboard\nLearn more and indeed dot com slash higher K long is right in on Saturday W.

wealth radio with your host best selling author Chuck however [noise] his mission is helping you discovered and uncover your hidden well protect yourself from taxes inflation and marketing lawsuit and now here's John\nHi to shut down for welcome to hidden wealth radio where we help the baby boomers and business owners\nSecure a safe retirement safe by insulating they're serious retirement savings from unnecessary market losses as well as unnecessary taxation\nBack when clients said you know what I Love about the hidden well solution is you do help people discovered uncover retirement opportunities and wealth strategies that others miss hey baby boomers are in particular I'm Talking to those of you listening between the ages of sixty and Seventy five\nAnd particularly to those that have saved at least two hundred fifty thousand or more towards retirement I Want to share with you a story in particular about friends and colleagues just like yourself all within that age group\nThat are sharing what they are real concerns are in properly positioning themselves for their most optimal retirement opportunities and what boomers are sharing in that age group in with that asset range of two hundred fifty thousand to typically\nTwo three four or five million dollars or more but at least a quarter million is that they're worried about the economy\nAnd they're very concerned about losing money to the federal government the form of unnecessary taxes and I want to talk to you about a really just in its simplest form a couple a Cindy and Jerry uh they're in their sixties\nAnd uh we help Cindy retire\n[noise] ah we actually met her shortly after retirement who helped her position her retirement and then we're helping Jerry get retired so if you're somebody listening that is getting one or both spouses to retirement or you're trying to get better through retirement\nI don't think the timing of this message could be any more valuable and I want to I like to teach so I'm not just a best selling author and a national radio educator I'm somebody that takes on a certain number of clients each and every year and a half now for almost a quarter century which is hard to believe\nThat we've helped insulate their serious retirement savings so they sleep better worry less and have more to do what they want when they want how they want by just having a plan but a complete plan that addresses taxes\nMarket risk inflation and obviously economic uncertainty will folks I don't think the the economy could be more on certain that it is now but I've been saying that now for gosh the last you know ten plus years and it just seems to become more and more unstable but when I Want to talk to about with with\nThis particular client a Cindy and Jerry is this tends to be what we see a lot of and that's people saying you know we've never had a complete plan we've never had somebody address how we can not just make the most but keep the most\nAnd for those of you that are business owners listening you know that's the name of the game is not what you make it's what you keep\nStrategically obviously there's a lot that goes behind that but here was that here's the reality\nRight that the two greatest risks\nAnd slashed concerns that boomers are sharing ironically are predictable right the markets obviously going to to have a loss we don't know it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when and we know taxes are going to continue to be a big threat\nAnd it's very obvious why that's the case which we'll talk about then let's start with taxes as I get into this case study of of a in this particular case of sin in Jerry one\nIs in this past month roughly the longest running bull market in history which is now standing at about nine and a half years well here's the reality folks know bull markets ever made it to its tenth birthday and we're already over nine and a half years into this one\nThe second longest Bull Run a now was the dot com right which was fueled back in the nineties which caused investors to lose eighty percent\nNow while there's no guarantees that a bull market will crash before its tenth birthday right we do know that historically the longest running bull markets go out not like in a in a in a small fashion they'd go out in a with a big bang right it's like a drop\nAnd it's a pretty significant drop especially for those that were heavily into tech stocks back in the tech boom and bust that lost literally about eighty percent of their their assets\nAnd then experts who study behavioral finance which I thought this was interesting note again and again we humans have an enormous capacity for for getting the lessons and pain of past\nCrashes right in the reality is this folks and we've seen this and I've seen this with my wealth architecture team now more than I've ever seen it is that people are woefully unprepared for this next crash in fact they've positioned themselves to be in a worst position\nFor another two thousand and eight to hit than the amount that they lost than in other words how little they they didn't realize until we ran a stress test of the retirement road there on of how actually exposed more so they are this time than they were the last time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Wealth", "city": "Tampa", "day": "07"}
