{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "It's like bringing somebody into your house and having it'd be a mess and having an not show really well the consumers now see bill lifting photos or the video as their first look at the property and when they don't look good you know they're not going to get as many showings they're not going to get as many people through the door and they're probably not going to get any offers so\nIf as a buyer you see a home that doesn't have great listing photos but maybe it's in an area that you really been looking for a house and you kinda skipped over this one that haven't taken a look at it call your agent call us we'd love to show you the property because it might be\nYou know it might be something where you can get a deal on the property all because somebody didn't take great photos of it\nGod damn I'm day right or the favorite of the cell phone photos\nYeah I mean I like seeing you can see the person in the bathroom mirror right in the picture to the one with their windows rolled down and they're taking it from their cars they're driving by right having seen that one too where you can see like their uh their side mirrors yeah put it under a you know but those are those could be deals\nExactly yeah that you know a home I said on the market longer that way because like you said when you're looking online you may not want to go look at it and it could sit there and I get a lot of activity when\nMy old saying never judge a book by its cover right and people do it every day with real estate\nAbsolutely absolutely so yeah those are just a few things that that\nTo kind of keep an eye out and maybe don't let it kill your deal or you know keep you away from\nFrom looking or or moving on a home like that I Will be back after a quick break to wrap up today show dot com [noise]\nHey back with Andrew hosting the don't get to do all real estate Joe I'm nine Seventy am WFL a see real estate expert in Tampa Andrew them getting dug in do ten am on nine Seventy WFL a\nThis is Mike ... from Atlantic bad mortgage joined again by Robert Johnson and Louis seven Nettie with the Duncan duo team and Randy Newman from BP or during the break Louis uh we talked about or are we are discussing you know now being a good time to lift your home and some things that some buyers are looking for\nAbsolutely um one I Want to start an appointee match you know a lot of people always ask when did the best time to lift my house\nUm and one in the state of Florida we don't have these brutal winters that really ever shut our market down so we're selling homes year round right I'm for us I Know we have a lot of success or in the fourth quarter\nOr a buyer that's out there looking in the fourth quarter is a serious buyer you know their pre qualified there's lots of tax advantages it's actually less competitive for them as well\nUm so we know ourselves we have we're we're still putting homes on the market every single day right now um but another big thing that we're seeing is you know him in Tori is still low but we are seeing an adjustment to the market buyers number one demand that we're hearing is for for now or turn key properties\nThey're really not wanting to come in and have to spend another fifty thousand dollars to fully redo the home so what I'd preaching is to sellers make sure you are pricing the homes correctly\nThere's no point in over pricing it having sit on the market the number one killed a home sale days on market Joe's day that up and it's kind of the worst\nYeah it's kind of a weird thing because market inventory is so low um days on market actually is a serial killer um because\nPeople start to automatically think okay well if it's been on the market is on how come somebody has been snatched about what's wrong with this house why hasn't that you know nobody else wants to his home why would I Want this homing they started going through all these things in their head and when you get two months on the market\nUnless you do a pretty serious price drop where you really addressed maybe what the issue is or why you're not selling 'em a lot of times there really isn't an issue it's just that you've had a lot of days and markets so the the really low inventories can work\nNegatively because what we usually have is poems are going to contract really quickly because they're you know in great areas they're moving ready\nAnd their price well or you have properties that sat on the market a long time because\nOne of those things doesn't add up it could be the area could be that it's priced too high which we always attempt to not to do sometimes you don't know until you get on the market for the house needs a lot of work and the price isn't as attractive as somebody needs it because it seems like when the house needs a lot of work\nThey ... buyers really really want to get those I'm at an undercover price they really don't want to do work\nI'm going back to that article that we read earlier I Wish there was more buyers out there that looked for things that needed to be done but it seems like there's two spectrums in the market there's either investors that are willing to do everything or there's buyers that\nReally want turn key and I think we can think HGTV\nFor that but\nUm people just want to go in there and they want to you know you see it when you watch those shows they're automatically think you know I Can't wait to have people over I Can't wait to entertain which is maybe one of the reasons why dining rooms are now the number one requested feature again I don't know\nUm but they just want they have all these grand plans on their head and I think when they imagine going in there and even having to paint a wall they can't get both parties\nGoing on right now I've had I've had\nPeople you know buyers say things like oh this is the perfect house but I don't like the furniture and you've got elaborate I Will ... come with the house right that's why you know we always say staging is so important\nUm but you know to the sellers out there you know a lot of people will they'll do they'll see that their neighbors sold for two twenty five and then they'll look and say you know what else is pretty nice and there's not much inventory let's see let's let's for two Fifteen see if we can get and it's really just\nLike you said the buyers have all the ins or they know that the neighbor just sold for two twenty\nFive years or buyers now because they have all the info and this was actually a great thing I Know a lot of agents are afraid of it but buyers are hyper educated\nThey um especially younger buyers they know how to stock the Internet they know everything about this property they are hyper educated they have all the information they are not going to overpay for ... not going to do it yeah I'm there they are very educated\nUm they've hired an agent to actually get them the best deal and they have that agent out there fighting for them they're knocking over pay for your property and you will sit there\nAnd again you turn around and you become stale and then you don't sell so if you do really want to sell\nYou need to price that property correctly or you need to make sure that you just have a drop dead gorgeous move in yeah model type of property and those honestly are very few and far between when we go out there and look at home\nAnd I also I'll wrap it up and saying you know I also don't always blamed the seller because they're putting a lot of trust and their realtor so if you are interviewing agents\nAsked them where they got their number from have them show you the comments that they got because sometimes ... you know realtor they're not do a lot of business and you know they know you want to fifty but you really think the house bill you know it's really only where two twenty and they'll say okay let's listen to fifty just to get it so you really want to make sure\nThe people who are representing you are doing their research as well\nRight so the sellers out there if you're thinking about selling definitely get in touch with the Duncan do a team or they sell a lot of houses and you know can provide some expert advice give Lewis Call great age of thirty under thirty\n[laughter] not under thirty anyone right [laughter]\nYeah give us a call at her office they won three three five Ninety nine nine zero or go on line to Dunkin duo dot com and we'd love to help you out\nPerfect well we appreciate your to an end today and have a great rest of your Sunday\nThe proceeding program was paid for by the Duncan below at re max dynamic\nNews radio seventies ballet and when you went to the Clearwater\nRight they understand that being informed legally ethically morally to reduce your taxes\nIs perfectly allowed it's just the government has a tax plan for you if you don't have it\nTax plan for yourself and when you think about this that the deficit right the treasury just reported that the deficit for fiscal year twenty teens hit seven over seven hundred and eighty billion its up Seventeen percent\nRight now what's kind of a ... year about that right when you really think about it is that in in the end unusual jumped in a year which unemployment hit a five decades low\nRight that the economy experienced a significant expansion\nRight but the increase demonstrates that the tax cuts signed into law late last year have reduced federal revenues considerably even against the backdrop of the booming economies to think about it in an economy that just booming and similar view is shared that ride and we've been blessed to have this booming economy the reality is\nTaxes are are are unfortunately going to have to be collected more heavily because the revenues are falling they're falling because more people retiring so they're not consuming as much because now they're conserving but also the fact that we've had these tax cuts on top of ten thousand people retiring a day\nAnd on Monday This past week the treasury reported that revenues acts that were predicted to be three point five three trillion were only three point three three trillion which is a two hundred\nBillion dollar shortfall in guess folks where they're going to collect that shortfall yeah they're going to click the shortfall from the people that have worked the hardest to save the hardest are going to get tax the hardest\nRight and the tax that the cost the boomers can avoid that's costing them the most or will cost them the most is taxation and the irony is the area that's causing people to most gets the least amount of attention until tax day rolls around so I Want to give a battle cry a shot across the bow of the importance\nOf thinking about taxes before the end of that present tax year right so what you can do to save tax has to be done and twenty teen if you want to save taxing twenty Eighteen\nAnd here's the reality the tax sale that's on with this new tax reform bill is only going to run through twenty twenty five so to take advantage\nOf each and every year Eighteen being the first year to take advantage of this this tax sale is vital you see a couple of people has learned that over the next years they can completely untaxed their IRAs which means they won't have any require minimum distribution\nWhich means they won't leave a tax burden to their kids but they also leave a tax burden to themselves while they're living because they won't subject\nHaving eighty five percent of their Social Security tax or that the require distribution other IRAs is so large that forces there Medicare part B indie premiums to be increased by three four hundred dollars per month\nEach books we see it all the time I see people that are paying more tax in their eighties than the tax they paid and their highest wage earning years right leading up to the year that they retired when they would have been their highest wage earning here\nTheir taxes are higher Twenty years later folks that doesn't need to be that way the question is are you ready for your twenty teens tax and do you have a plan that's better than the government's tax plan for you right I think of\nA Marty in Debbie right they used one of our hidden well tax savings strategies that actually enabled them to zero their income tax out for twenty team and it's already done or done and Steve sold a highly appreciate it asset that was exposing them to a massive capital gain cost\nIn legally eliminated the capital gains\nI think of mark and Donna right that they legally untaxed their IRAs in other words the ... the IRS is out of their IRAs\nThere isn't any concern about their you know distribution of their IRAs pushing them into a higher tax bracket or forcing eighty five percent of their Social Security to now be subject to tax and I think about Mick a mic is older\nAnd it was already retired but his requirement of distribution was just annihilate in his taxes was pushing him into a higher tax bracket and we completely got rid of his requirement on distribution so whether those of you listening or trying to get to retirement\nAnd it's all about how you can reduce your your earned taxable income or you're somebody that's already in retirement and you're drawing money out of your hard earned savings of these tax deferred accounts\nOr some of even listening that have hit the milestone age of seven and a half or the government then forces you to take these distributions the good news is folks you can save tax but you've got to act\nAnd here's the opportunity\nFor those

taxes inflation and marketing lawsuit and now here's John [noise]\nHi I'm Charles Oliver and welcome to the human wealth radio for\nWe educate baby boomers on how to have a safe retirement to secure grow and protect their serious savings so they can thrive in retirement\nYou say we find retirement opportunities and wealth ... areas that others ... in essence helping people discovered uncovered they're hidden wealth throughout proven process the hidden wealth\nSolution and I want to share with you the two biggest boomer concerns that end up becoming the two biggest boomer retirement success techniques\nIn fact it really comes down to the reality of this there are two types of taxpayers\nAnd there are two types of retirement accounts\nSo let's get into this boomers two biggest concerns and I'm going to start with number one is having especially in light of what just happened a stock market protection plan\nC my story is simple what am I talk to you how to get a complementary copy of my most recent book the baby boomer retirement breakthrough where I teach you my story see I was a I was somebody that got greedy as a buffet would say be greedy when others are fearful but fearful and others are greedy and I I mix that equation up\nAnd ended up being a victim of the tech boom and bust the last time the tech bubble hit and unfortunately people lost on average eighty percent on the NASDAQ being heavily into tech mutual funds or stocks\nAnd what I learned from that experience all that many years ago was that I always had the proper financial foundation for our family in structures that really only the ultra wealthy had ever really heard about\nBecause I became a student of finding a superior alternative\nThan just following the crowd you see and that's the concern today because if we look at what's happening history is likely repeating itself especially being this far into this next bull or what some people are arguing to be the longest Bull Run in stock market history\nIn fact the headline said All right the markets fear index just exploded upwards of stocks around the world plummeted that was Business Insider\nBecause volatility is returning to the stock market in a big way back yesterday's a drop in the Dow eight hundred and thirty one point was the fourth largest single day drop in the Dow Jones stock market history\nIn one of the things that that we track called the VIX or the ... volatility index see it's more than doubled in the past week and it's added another six percent as of just this most recent end of week\nAnd the fears of a major market correction came to the forefront and I hopefully as many of your sharing a I've shared again not just a best selling author or radio educator or or wealth architect I'm somebody that personally takes on clients and have now for almost a quarter century\nAnd this has been a continual theme right people got hammered in two thousand one or two that got hammered again into this\nI was an eight and early two thousand nine and many people are shared look we we don't have time to recover so if you're somebody listening that saved at least\nYou know two hundred thousand or more towards retirement and typically I'm Talking to those of you that are baby boomers so that could range anywhere from ages you know forty a five per se to Seventy five\nYou can protect yourself and it's not just taking a a simple way to ... you know get inferior results it's actually using a more secure way to get\nSuperior results which I'll teach you you see the volatility index reflects the expectations of the volatility of the S. and P. five hundred that's the gold standard of what all of the wall street money managers aspire to get as close to in performance but long term none of them ever have\nThat's what we called investing and there's a distinct difference between investing in indexing and I'm not talking predominantly about in indexing type of an annuity some people confuse that\nThese are techniques that the ultra wealthy of used for years that I was fortunate to learn almost Twenty years ago [noise] and if applied for my own family that has saved our bacon\nAnd the safe so many other clients that we felt now for over these period of years and the time is upon us folks are the key is not being too little too late because many people unfortunately won't have time to recover\nSee or CNBC came out there's more pain to come for stocks according to analysts watching the charts right with the u._s. stock market in the midst of an October sell off some Wall Street ... chart watchers are worried the situation could only get worse\nCNBC also had this last week they're warning signs a big market sell off was coming and investors believe there's more to go\nA the a warning for boomers this was out of NASDAQ dot com what will happen to retirement savings and the next market crash and sadly Fox News reported that both the Amazon and Facebook just on this past Wednesday plummeted\nTo the worst day in seven years I could go on and on folks but I think you get the picture\nAnd let's review what we do to solve the stock market loss risk", "show_name": "Hidden
