{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "Yeah that's what you know a lot of people may not realize the credit cards for instance Ninety nine percent of them are variable rate so as those rates change they're going to eventually go up which\nYou know makes that minimum monthly payment go up higher which you know it all kind of runs together it it may make that same two hundred and fifty thousand dollar house not affordable anymore because\nYou know even though you have the same debt load those monthly payments so I can be affected\nDo you think rates will continue to go up\nI Do yes I Do um I I've seen some different forecast um that that they will continue to go up and I've seen some say that it may even approached the six percent Mark I'm you\nKnow I think that that really and yeah I mean I think that that is probably what will happen again historically that's totally new\nOil when I first got in the mortgage business which was about twelve years ago uh the the first loan I ever did for someone at Atlantic bay was six and a quarter right so um you know we we've really just been fortunate that rights have been so long for our are so low for so long that\nIt's going to take a little bit of time for people to get used to it I think just you know like I said that mental block normally what we see two are are a lot of buyers for instance jumping off the fence you know that's always the real estate market you know because of that writes\nMyself personally I haven't really seen it yet it doesn't seem like it it's been that big push like it is sometimes\nUm but it'll happen you know as I think it's more the norm for for rates to to be over that five percent mark and and everyone kind of knowing it's their you know then it will keep them from from waiting in even longer for instance you know rates don't don't appear like they're going to be going down anytime soon again yeah\nInteresting I was so mad 'cause my rate was four and a quarter of four years ago and they went down to like three six yeah exactly so now famously went down but you know I\nHave people and we don't have a lot of time left on the segment but you know people will call me every once in a while asking if they should refinance some and kind of a general rule of thumb which I I personally don't feel there is one because everyone has different needs but\nThere's you know if you bought your home and the last ten years there may not be much of a benefit as far as rates are concerned with refinancing unless you have an adjustable rate um you know more so now you're you're benefits likely going to be either\nA cash out in debt consolidation or or to do home improvements in kind of take advantage of that equity or reducing ... right you know you it's going to be difficult to\nTo do a a rate reduction and and our current market so I'm well if you have any questions on interest rates feel free to give me a call a Mike Yates at Atlantic mortgage a one three three for three eight five five one I Will be back with our last segment to wrap up\nThe show that your next year the way that thousand bucks coming up tomorrow at six six am I. nine Seventy W at LA [noise]\nHey back with Andrew hosting the dumps getting duo real estate Joe I'm nine Seventy am WFL a the real estate expert in Tampa Andrew Duncan [noise]\nDuncan do ten am on nine Seventy WFL a fucking\nBack to the doctor can do a show just wanted to finish up\nThe show today and talk about some of the current inventory out there what buyers are looking for you know if there's any sellers out there that may may have this uh currently list as you know give us a call to\nYeah absolutely and you can go to our website that Duncan duo dot com um car off as they went through three five nine eight nine nine zero on but really the one of the quickest way to get in touch with us is going to our website you can take a look at our listings\nOr we have a spot for ... or ... or anything you want to know but we love to speak with you about your home or if you're currently looking for a home we're above to help you out but what we're seeing as far as inventory on the market as inventories kind of steady doubt\nI'm a little bit a lot of buyers um again interest rate jumped scared them a little bit but um it seems like there was so little inventory on the market for so long that a lot of a lot of buyers just got into a holding pattern because they really wanted to buy something\nBut there just wasn't a lot out there to buy a lot of the stuff that was on the market either was going really quickly as soon as they hit the market or it was pretty stale I mean what were you seeing out there might when you were working with with buyers\nI you know during the summer months out of this past year I'm ... moving quickly but homes are hitting the market pretty quickly um I definitely see a kind of it kind of tapering off a little bit right now I don't see as much inventory coming onto the market so that's been a little bit of a struggle with some buyers and they're just it's kind of been stagnant and so they've kind of All right we'll put things off\nFor a few months and see where things right at that point was because of\nInterest rates right now and that's one of the discussions we've had obviously\nBut the biggest thing is just tore so um it it's still kinda tough to find out what some of these fires are looking for what\nWe're talking to right now um is a lot of sellers call us and a lot of people call us who\nTheir homes were listed earlier this year and especially over the summer and they did not sell 'em what we're also seeing is that most of those homes were overpriced of course and the guys don't sell because they've got very aggressive with what they thought their home is worth and maybe their home out some of those features that weren't necessarily worth the money that they thought\nOr to bring in full circle but uh but they got really aggressive on price they maybe had an agent that wasn't honest with them or ... maybe even the agents that they should get a certain amount of money and those people are calling us and they ... they want to sell but they weren't able to sell the first time and\nSo that's what we're seeing 'em and these homes are going back on the market and they're much\nMore realistic prices the second time around\nAnd that's what I'm hoping for myself that it ... the prices just weren't realistically I when you're looking at the market\nAnd you're looking at comparable homes have sold in the ad recently ... it it just didn't match up and and it scared some of the buyers I've worked with off too like I'm just not going to pay for home right now let's wait till things kind of calm down it and sell us get a little more realistic with they're asking price\nRight and you know we I mean the markets go through those kind of cycles um but uh what what I found interesting is even homes that are on the market over fifty percent of homes on the market price dropped which is\nReally um a statistic to look at more homes or put our having price drops than are going on the market um or going under contract so I think even in\nThe market at large I think a lot of homes\nAnd on what are you to aggressively earlier and\nThat's what I was going to ask because you're starting to see some stuff and\nYou know the talking heads are saying that the housing market is heading toward another crash and prices are starting to decrease um but if you look at the numbers you know even though appreciation isn't rousing as rapidly as it was we're still appreciate and you know an arm or that we're still seeing around five percent\nSo out of you know one of the things I wanted to ask you is\nDo you think that any price reduction or saying I don't think it's due to the market is just that people were probably priced too aggressive kind of ... and see what they are and\nWhat happens in a capitalistic economies as they build till they can't build any more than they go down and they build their damn overtime eventually it always ends up better than it was the first time ...\nThe real estate crash it was ten years or was over ten years ago now I was eleven twelve years ago the market really bottom in about two thousand nine two thousand ten\nAnd we've been on a build ever since then and so usually the market builds for about six to seven years before it starts to go down we're past due for that and a lot of areas of appreciated past\nWhere I'm prices were last time ... graders that average wages are up I mean\n... when you look at a whole bunch of different metrics the market is nowhere near where it was last time I mean my gosh we're not getting people to mortgages were not getting people to just stay out of income loans or without but\nUm but I think the market will go down a little bit has went down a little bit but it's just doing historically what it always does what happened ten years ago\nIt hadn't happened since the Nineteen mid Nineteen twenty right okay so you're not going to see that again right now I mean maybe eventually I'm sure in fifty years four years whatever I don't have a crystal ball\nIt mostly I mean it could happen again and it happened before so who knows but right now you're just going to feel a little market correction which needs to happen because you have him into where he got so low interest rates have been going up in prices just got too aggressive and they actually will help the market and it has started to help\nThem I was gonna say it's more of a stabilization as opposed to drop we've actually you know really uh stabilize market just means it's a healthy real estate's\nCNBC also had this last week they're warning signs a big market sell off was coming and investors believe there's more to go\nOr the ... a warning for boomers this was out of NASDAQ dot com what will happen to retirement savings and the next market crash\nAnd then sadly Fox News reported that both the Amazon and Facebook just on this past Wednesday plummeted to the worst day in seven years I could go on and on folks but I think you get the picture\nAnd let's review what we do to solve the stock market loss risk\nBy first looking at some facts right last month\nWe at that actually under the longest Bull Run in history being an about nine and a half years no bull market has ever made it to its tenth birthday I've been preaching this the second longest bull market was the dot com right the tech\nBoom and bust of the nineties which caused investors to lose nearly eighty percent and while there's no guarantee obviously that the bull market will crash\nOfficially right ah [laughter]\nUnfortunately the bang that many people think that this is my next market correction is going to cause will not be a whimper\nAnd as the experts who study behavioral finance note again and again we humans have an enormous capacity for getting you know for for getting per se the lessons that pain of past crashes have caused as many people are still folks I see this on a weekly basis are woefully unprepared\nFor the next downturn right Peter shift as some of you are familiar with Peter [noise] uh he says a U.S stock market crashes long overdue but people are oblivious right NASDAQ said its biggest game this past month since the year two thousand right as I said history has a way of repeating itself [noise]\nBack in the two thousand peak though it hit for many people from peak the trough in eighty percent loss\nRight now think about that so the fact that we haven't had a month this strong being the prior month\nSince two thousand should give people pause which we've been preaching day in and day out\nIt's long overdue Peter says it can start at any minute which obviously this last week proved that people are oblivious infect Jim Rogers Susan investment commodities guru with one of the longest positive return track records on Wall street said we're heading towards the worst ... excuse me Barry market\nOf his lifetime\nHe says when the problem in the stock market is going up is based on a slew of misconceptions about the U.S economy when reality sets in\nBeat her says you're going to see the U.S market tank\nAnd folks whether it tanks whether it cracks or whether it crashes the reality is retire your risk of stock market downturn right create your own protected pension plan have peace of mind of having a secure\nFuture cash flow for your retirement income that won't be disrupted when the next market crash or correction comes now or when it comes later\nRight in ... and please be advised to stay away right of one of them are shared how much he had lost by being advised from listening to more of a TV personality posing as a fraudulent financial investment advisor advice\nThat ended up costing him a ton of money and I won't name names but we kind of call it the entertainment channel ah folks that are telling what to buy and sell in fact this particular a\nFraudulent financial advisor investment advice giver a TV personality said ah two days before Bear Stearns a celebrating its ten years of going under back then two days before said by all the bear Stearns that you can\nFolks nobody has a crystal ball that's why you can play it safe and have upside without downside now the second biggest boomer concern is not just number one as a as a reminder having a stock market protection plan but also having a tax protection plan and you see\nHow you can eliminate unnecessary taxes is indirectly the form of getting a better return right if you're not giving up ten twenty thirty forty who knows where tax rates go fifty percent that's better than earning ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent\nAnd that's a given not a an assumption\nAnd avoid the government tax scheme folks because the government's gotta tax game I I can assure you they do I see a time in in in in in time again where people don't know what they don't know where as I like to say you can't be aware of something you've never been made aware of\nAnd they get exposed to now becoming what's called the perfect taxpayer they did everything right they differed their tax deferred accounts of their company for ...\nTo care for three bees and then they hit that day of reckoning when they're forced to take require distributions or if they start taking distributions out of their irate early they didn't expose up to eighty five percent of their Social Security being taxed\nAnd then depending on how much tax they have to pay by the distributions they're forced to take or that they decide they have to take\nThen they can ... expose themselves to paying penalties on their Medicare part B and deep premiums but it never stops there the end up not realizing they're leaving a major tax burden inheritance to their kids\nIn fact one client shared I Know why you Charles Oliver reside in the state of

yourself from taxes inflation and market losses and now here's Chuck [noise]\nI just shut however welcome to hidden wealth radio where they've been teaching\nBaby boomers and business owners how to eliminate unnecessary taxes strategically ethically morally and of course legally\nAnd teaching them how to grow money without this tax distribute money without tax and to do it with market double digit potential upside without ever a negative market down side\nAnd I want to teach you how to have what I called the baby boomer retirement break through the unfair advantage to a safe and secure retirement and we've been keeping a focus on taxes especially with the house just passing this last week tax cut to point of making the tax cuts\nPermanent now that's looking to be the case but of course there's obviously a lot of pushback\nA fact it it passed the house a hundred Ninety One positive votes to twenty two negative votes of course with the Republican led house right to approve the legislation and things pretty much went along party lines but here's the challenge that we have\nRight is that many people are accusing or making the assumption which I think there is some validity to it that this could really blow up the deficit by already adding one point five trillion to\nA tax cut one point no to it then add fuel to the fire with tax cut to point out you could create a serious danger to the uncertainty of where tax rates will have an impact on taxing un I those of you listening to save at least a quarter million or more towards retirement\nThat somebody's going to have to pay for these tax cuts and the reality is those folks they're gonna have to pay for the tax cuts are the people that work the hardest and save the hardest unfortunately are going to get taxed the hardest\nAnd here's why this is important because with this vote right\nThere's a lot of let's say other party opposition because of the concerns let's just say with the midterms are there's I was going to be a lot of pushback but that was interesting uh one of the professors economic professors I've been studying for a while Theresa\nDriller to do see I don't know that I always ever pronounce your name appropriately um her question isn't an article this past week who benefits from the tax cut ten months later from tax cut one point out\nAnd she goes on to say ... regrettably the president's tweets turned out not to be true right with the economic expansion unemployment at ... at a new record low gross domestic product better than it's been in over ... basically a decade and perhaps that's why voters aren't so enthusiastic about the tax cuts she says\nBecause she said there's really no definitive detail of proving that this tax cut is actually\nDoing anything well folk so low I mean look look around the only thing that's keeping us out of the dismal massive recession and I would argue to say we're in a recession we're just faking that recession out how long we can fake that recession out is anybody's guess right we've kind of kept this Bull Run going\nBecause Kennedy the trees that goes on to talk about that you know the claims of the president which I Would say are true has obviously continued to keep this bull market in check because again the buybacks right the corporations that cut their top tax rate from thirty five to Twenty one and now that looks to be\nA permanent as well as the tax reform bill for that to cutting the tax rates obviously for a lot of folks especially the folks that have strong income and have have strong savings\nHas actually created a false positive right because a lot of companies turned around and bought their own stock back which is giving this sense that the economy is going to just continue to roar and go positive in a bullish direction and many people are saying the market's going to come because being nine and a half years into this Bull Run\nNoble runs ever made a ten years\nAnd nobody knows right and I talked about last week on his wealth radio the top concerns that boomers your friends and neighbors are sharing likely the same concerns you have are the the the uncertainty of the economy and how long this is going to go I talked to apply this week the truck\nOr he calls it instead of Murphy's law his last name as the last thing you know as soon as I sense that things are good I can see the market going bad this is the climate lost fifty percent twice between two thousand one two thousand two that was one or two and then again between two thousand eight and early two thousand nine\nAnd he said you know I Can't afford to do that and folks he's right you know this is the client\nA wife or he and his wife are in their mid to late sixties between the two of them and the reality is they don't have time to make up for another two thousand and eight or two thousand to two thousand and two market debacle and many people are predicting even the great Warren Buffett that that's not a matter of if\nIt's a matter of when and when is unfortunately going to cause what some are even claiming to be the worst recession or the worst economic downturns in their lifetime and these are folks that are talking about this that are well respected on Wall street that have been doing what they're they've been doing now for forty years\nFolks look here's here's the importance of this point right and I and I think this is this is key the the top retirement solutions that others miss is the tax peace now this is the tax piece impact\nUs all heavens no it doesn't impact us all because a lot of people haven't ... due to this retirement crisis it's been proven with all the polls a lot of people haven't saved appropriately for retirement and they're going to be in big trouble we talked about the pyramid right the pyramid back in the day for a lot of us thinking about our parents or grandparents retirement", "show_name": "Hidden Wealth", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "14"}
