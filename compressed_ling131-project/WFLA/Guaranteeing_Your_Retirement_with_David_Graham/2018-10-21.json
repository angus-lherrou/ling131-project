sort of artist they plan or Roger ...\nThe one the only Mr Ted Web good morning ms Graham good morning to Roger\nAnd good morning to everyone oh let me ask you to ask yourself this if you're getting ready for retirement you feel that your impulsive when you're investing\nYour money you know I I can say this in in more than four decades of trying to help people plan for retirement I've seen this pattern repeat itself way too many times and exactly the wrong time\nSome people will throw caution to the wind and the other side that holding cash in reserve is a waste of time and money and what do they do they go all in they'll buy stocks that are nothing more than ... tickets symbols to them\nTicker symbol stand them simply because some fund manager on a TV program was pushing them or their golfing buddy there ... there were Barbara who knows but the bottom line is that they act as if getting a return on their capital is the only thing that matters rather a return of their cash right\nSo if you feel that your impulsive\nAnd you know what's coming at us sled at the end of the tunnel in the end of the tunnel like Ted says it's a girl with a flashlight and you need some on his ... help and then go to our website let us help yeah we have well over a hundred years of combined planning experience we've been to the mountain top\nMost of most of the guys are rage we've already retired now because we can tell you anything what not to do I have officers on main street in Sarasota Kennedy boulevard in Tampa, Florida\nThe infamous K Street three blocks from the capital go to our website scheduling appointments it's Graham capital advisors dot com and online Ted\nOnline right now we have the commissioner of Logan circle and also happens to be the president ... capital advisors Mr Alex Graham Alex good morning how are you\nGood morning gentlemen how are you all doing we're ...\nWell a a Alex I've been hearing a lot about China in their markets are really in the correction territory so I'm just curious is that going to bleed over to us\nWell you know we are heavily connected to China um even with the current sort of trade dispute right on with things more accurate or there has been a history of when things go pour in China just like things go pour in Europe at some point they come roost they come home I mean a lot of us based\nCompanies rely on China fall and their stock market and and also for equities and obviously also the domestic market\nChina has been fueling their boom with the debt and continue rises and they're on their financial markets which at some point does trickle down to the consumers of China that obviously are us based on his love to sell to love to grow in a kind of have a whole new market of ... billion plus people\nIf they can sell their products to [noise] uh so yeah I mean there there's some point will be a slow little trickle but it will eventually cross the Pacific a and it can definitely impact our markets are starting to see that now the past week or so with the extreme volatility on that I have come back the ... down the swings up than\nBack down and it's just becoming one of these kind of a as I said earlier in the show like you to your stomach curls everyday look in the markets to see which way it's going\nTo like riding that roller coaster when you have China's\nChief ... market regulator\nTelling people to be calm and ... it was just the day after the Shanghai ... composite index plunged to it like a four year low and and President Trump knowing that he went for the throat he took steps to escalate the trade war with Beijing\nAnd third quarter growth figures now showed that you know China's economy it's just it's expanding much much much weaker since the since the global crisis began and and uh I guess and then the question is hopefully\nIt will help us in the process is like with everything else President Trump is trying to do only the only time will tell\nI think it will definitely help on on the trade front and some in some ... actual property which is really the big issue for most of corporate America because China tends to wink wink borrow all of our intellectual property [noise]\nUh but I mean the ... the Chinese economy is losing steam um it's not just the trade a trade issues but it's just things domestic did um there's just a lot of debt in China while they may own a lot of art at domestically there a lot of their big state owned companies\nAre heavily leopard and there's ... it was always a chance at some point of the house of cards will fall down as we see in here and he doesn't eat when all these people are heavily leopard with their with their mortgages\nIt catches up at some point I mean they take a while but it's not a pretty sight building China has going forward is its type of government the government says goes\nWell again we we heard to say this in the past on the show here but they are a communist country communist country and they're evolving towards some form of ... was a socialistic capitalism where all the comments are all these prominent communist now or in the ... ... and the free sector\nAnd the last ... and I had was they were thirty one thirty one thirty one billionaires disappear headed ... or something\nLike Senate holiday guys don't worry about it\nI mean I tried that I don't want to try to make a living over there when\nYou might actually get lucky and very successful and work hard and all of a sudden you're going to disappear and the last guy was that what was his name Ali Baba Alex what is his name\nYeah oh I don't believe it was al Ali Baba you're not talking about Jack Ma\nYou're that's right it's\nIt's a he's he has and it's the um oh boy it's\nThe ... the insurance company a being are aging or life seconds OK any\nEither either way you know he was a little English teacher in the nineties and he was one of the first ones to you know start to start a program and then he became a multi billionaire but they they at least you\nYou're going to disappear he ... and I'm just giving all my money away and going back to teaching English as a write so maybe they're going to start letting people go back to what they were doing without disappearing honest but look the bottom line is that it's a totally different society than what we have", "show_name": "Guaranteeing Your Retirement with David Graham",
