M. sixteen ... day your next chance to win a thousand bucks coming up tomorrow at six so six am a nine Seventy WFL a\n[noise]\nThe guards would mock go\nRight back as\nCorrected morning or good morning Hi I was wondering I heard something about planting the pineapple and December ... ... what if I get a cap on August or any other month the your guide\nTo enjoy it right there and enjoy it [laughter]\nBut don't planted only in December\nDecember and January ... is in is a ... he is the the uh the\nExpert or with over Thirty Years' experience better than Thirty Years' experience and growing by the apples and of course working with for Dole pineapple company and ah he if you're not planting\nA otherwise ... December and January that's the only time\nOkay okay yeah I was wondering if I don't know if he knows this but if I get a for data pineapple or or if\nI get a non organic pineapple and I take the head off but then I grow it organically that considered an organic on that or or the or the non organic apples or they do not have genetically modified or something [noise]\nWell that's really depends on a whom you're talking to about organics but if you grow any plant organically began to this one is hereditary is it will be organic\nProvided you grow it district organic\nIsland right that will be an organic plan you will not change its genetic ah capabilities voice for industry in any way and if you take the crown all I Know gang grown pineapple\nAnd then plant it and then grow it with allies are and what not it will not be an organic grown pineapple but that's entirely how you grow that particular plant\nOh well if I buy and non organic an apple does that mean that it might be or get a genetically modified in some way or the do they even genetically modified\nLike we don't know if you grow a an organic pineapple or a non organic pineapple it's hereditary will be the same\nTo the best of my knowledge there's no genetically modified a pineapple around when it comes to be genetically modified by the insertion of a gene\nNow over the hundreds of years\nAh Durbin literally hundreds of modifications to pineapple true cross breeding\nAll sort of selection mostly through selection and things like that but uh nothing's identically there's nothing being genetically modified at this time in pineapples\nOkay that's great well thank you very much\nVery good Greg I appreciate the call\nOkay I have a good that you bet thank you and let's go real quick to Tina Tina in moods good morning\nGood morning America I ran out to my mind the other day and I was noticing these caterpillars when I looked at my pine trees I noticed they don't read and it kind of a mature pine trees\nIn them like like\nA candy are terribly yeah there you know all the foliage\nOr if this is a large\nTree the the easiest thing to do is to treat the tree or if you want to save the ... well if you want to get rid of the caterpillars are depending on the height of the tree you can spray would die pal which only kills caterpillars\nWhich is a pretty effective but if it's a tree that you can't get up to the top of the spray than you can inject that tree or just like going to the doctor and getting an injection and that can kill all the uh uh caterpillars really\nKill a tree\nNo no they know they're going to ... to ... to ... any type of plan a weakens that plan for a given period of time uh but I haven't seen a kill a tree yet unless it's repeated repeated repeated repeated repeated you do this three or four times and you know just like yourself if you're getting at the\nCold cold cold in the last time before I get the flu okay so okay yeah All right though I die pal D. I. P. E. L. or Beatty boy time and I\nCan I can I Do that my ... and you can spray the tree with that and if you can get up to the top of it yeah they will kill every one of those caterpillars\nOkay but if I Need to inject it otherwise\nOtherwise if it's too big of a tree or tune in an area that you cannot spray then you'll have to do the other yes\nThank you so much for being from a very welcome pineapple and for all thank you uh\nYou know what to say the thank you very much ... were were just out of time here this morning what a great uh a program people have learned probably a lot about growing up thanks for being here no more than welcome\nYeah ah if you want to see in next time at the rare fruit council a University of South Florida botanical gardens I think there's eight or individual or a club in the area please stop by say Hi to end\nAnd uh check out the pineapple growing there until next week remembers all plants wouldn't be here stay tuned here's John request in with the news\nRadio Nice seventies LA Times when you went to the two Clearwater\nJust to try to slow it up a little bit and and it's been\nTen years ten years and it it's a record you know what goes up comes down\nYou know David concerning these uh raising interest rates with the fed there's a theory out there that says yeah they're going to raise these rates because when the big recession hit\nSo when this big correction happened they can immediately lower that interest rate back down and at least they have someplace to go wherever they left at low there's no place to go\n... well that well that that's it you know the train is leaving the station you know the stock market crash or a really rigorous correction could be ahead of us can't be stressed enough you have to be very very careful if you have stocks on your portfolio now and if you're getting close to retirement\nThink about it this way everywhere you look there are major institutions big investment houses big banks giant hedge funds\nAll have a tremendous amount of buying power when they make a trade it moves the market\nYou have all those guys and you have all these well known economists analyst and they have an incredible influence on what happens in the market and what it is they're all becoming skeptical about what is going about to happen\nAnd if we have this skepticism if it continues to continue for much longer that in itself could could trigger a stock market crash which just happened since last week's show you're a regular listener to their show look what happened just in the past week\nNASDAQ is down nine points nine percent Ninety nine point nine percent\nAnd what do you think is going to be happening what do you think's going to be happening by next week's show\nSo you I look at some of these people people that Graham capita wealth management would follow um\n[noise] I'm In Germany Segal he's a professor at at work and oh ... where he well known and and the financial services industry a year ago this time the Dow was twenty two thousand four hundred and Germany predicted the Dow by the end of this year could possibly hit thirty thousand this is a year ago\nWell it got well over a twenty six well into twenty six thousand five hundred or wherever it was so it was on its way and then it started to drop so what does he telling people now\nBe cautious there are challenges that we face and for two thousand Nineteen at the very best at the very best it's going to be flash\nSo again and that kind of sentiment just doesn't end with him we go to or another a economist you always hear us talk about Robert Shiller the Nobel Prize winner of the Yale professor and you know he's known for his series on the markets and he's\nAlso very skeptical about the stock market now you know not too long ago Dr Shiller said we're over launching a trade war and people aren't thinking about it is that a good thing I don't know I Do know this\nIs not going to be good times for the stock market that's for sure and look what's happened since then we just had earnings reports come out all these companies now\nAre or yelling to the White House General Motors Ford whirlpool John Deere kind of a for a best buy black and decker three am I'll cola\nUm Tyson Foods General Electric Harley Davidson there's like over a hundred companies now major companies that are feeling of the trade war and the earnings are being affected by it so again shoulders is writing writing in\nYou know his cynically adjusted since he has said cynically again is ... right [laughter] it's a little mal proposition\nManagerial you know sometimes the truth just happens to slip out of hand [laughter] cynically versus ...\nMe or his Cape indexes cyclical e adjusted price to earnings ratio is index stocks are still fifty percent overvalued All right\nYou have your life savings inequities you let's say you have a hundred thousand inequities that it's fifty percent overvalued that means you got a Nobel Prize winner saying it's really supposed to be fifty thousand if you've got a hundred thousand boy I take that off the table so fast has this little quick\nAnd oh no I mean just look at Warren Buffett last thing I heard eighty billion dollars he's got sitting in cash usually really wants to return to pounce in the market when this correction happens and buy everything that she and send\nIt out there that just ... personal money yeah hundred and twenty billion a virtual ... is that right I think that was this money's in stock right right right it's just the idea that he himself with everything he has in his foundations and all the money's accumulated you know when you give money away right as taking off of your kid he like ... the money's given away\nYou know he probably would be the richest men in the world\nBut again you look at where we are going well gold price of gold went up three point five percent just in the last three weeks and in that time the dollar went up less than a buck and the ... ... five hundred down nine percent you know gold is a move that shows which is called investor sentiment\nAnd it always ... you know it's always been the preferred safe haven that means when things are bad you're going to go to these with these big money managers [noise]\nUm you know and since gold is rising stocks were falling that's telling us that investors are worried about putting our money some place other than in stocks and\nAnd if it's not good yeah and you're always go to gold and then you go to some of these other major banks you go to the big banks bank of America\nThey drop below their tune Earth Day moving average you have um a Morgan Stanley they also have dropped below their tuna are they moving average the big institutions\nTraditionally have been a ... areas of stability that investors would go to\nBut again it's all changing you know and think about this despite all the rising interest rates you know people felt that the U.S economy was still going to grow fast enough to absorb all these rate hikes the mid then we'll look what we have coming up we have the midterm elections the motor report will come out in a few weeks I should add some excitement everyone's life\nThe trade war Russia whatever\nBut it's all changing because the U.S and the five hundred two hundred day moving average it's a critical technical indicator [noise] the rest of the world is slowing down and the markets now already getting much much worse than the fed the Federal Reserve rate heights that could be a ticking time bomb\nAnd you know what if investors start thinking that it's going to be happening when you might as well strap on an explosive vest yourself because when Joe the plumber storage doubting the stability the stability of our financial system\nFrom the train
