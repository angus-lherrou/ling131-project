LA [noise]\nGardening with Marco van tonight Seventeen WFL a\nBan is getting right to Richard in home harbor hey Richard good morning\nHey mark morning been long time yeah you're probably something you guys do that when you're not talking to you you can listen to you guys on the phone and don't I have my hearing aid to all the way up and doesn't work\nAh yeah I mean he may not while you're on hold or something yes\nThat you know I'm going to I'm going to be a twenty five years I've been hearing that [laughter]\nI yes you will think that they\nWould be able to do that that that's one of the reasons we always have a problem with people turn your radio down when they finally get on because they were listening to the radio because they couldn't hear it on the phone app I I I'm going to agree with you as a listener or when they you know a lot of times a day will call me up or at home to to comment on different\nThings going on a different shows are here WFL way\nAnd I I run into the same boat that you do I do sit there and wait until they say oh there's Marco then [laughter]\nYeah but yeah but what the afternoon shows during the week sure you hear a lot louder well now he's maybe he's a lot louder you can hear him\nThat it could be I mean that's all that's all it to me it's all a technical stuff you know so\nI don't know if they are if they are able to do it I Would assume that there would be no difference between a when my programs out or anybody else's I'm sitting at the same chair and the same microphone that everybody else you out of here so\nBut yeah it it it's been bad and go where the ground so that tells you a long time\nWith that is correct that you have twenty five years that I've been here so\nYeah okay a couple of questions like you guys are talking about um trimming the um mangoes yes or you\nShould you should eat them now because if you missed the July ... he cut the mangoes and or cut 'em ... out on the end back\nYou know I think you still have I I think that you ... probably yes because I think some people still have ... that are ah they're picking off the trees are still seeing some people have some under a tree so if you want to go out and do that now go right ahead of the mango trees\nHey if you sacrifice\nLet me let me think February is generally the time for me to go into blossom\nHere we are at a mid October October November December ... past four months away you might have time if we keep the warm weather up I don't see any problem with it I I Would still go ahead and do it or if you if you have any reservations just wait until after harvest next year\nYeah\nBecause you know I I you know I'm the one that lives in the ... all of the\nUm uh the fungus area in palm harbor here in Spanish oh sure yeah we're ... we're protected from free pretty much\nWell you know ... it it has been a while I mean let's say that you went and you were pruning in August well this year a couple of months late so that going to be a huge thing\nProbably not but I Would make sure that when you do cut depending on how far you cut back that you're making sure that you do proper cuts that you cut back to a a a leader that's going left or right you know on your ... tree you know you all want to leave stubs offered year that's for sure yeah\nOkay All right one okay now my\nOh I'm and I just have your what's your favorite plot um flower\nTo marry or you mean\nYes yeah I forgot the name for I got I got way too much stuff on my plate right now okay but you know and I'm and I'm not talking about meeting either\nBut [laughter] it\nWould be that the merrier are up against a vinyl rents\n'em in the springtime downloaded they're dropping leaves up big time right now but I don't know if it's because the heat of the summer it's against the vinyl fence and cooking them in the afternoon\nI don't think the vinyl fences having too much of a problem and I've only got about Fifteen seconds here I think it's more or less that we're we've got some Ross problems that are out there and we're getting some cooler nights and that cooler mornings trying to make some drop a little bit quicker\nOkay what main ingredient to your unit for week killing with St Augustine now\nUh Celsius Celsius Celsius yes like Fahrenheit and Celsius okay that's that's okay that that's all correct It's a it's a herbicide I have to go I'm Out of time OK okay thank you okay\nBye bye I until next week remember\nPlants we wouldn't be here stay tuned for David Graham in retirement guy David John and Ted Web here to help you with your retirement also we have our very own ... question standing by he's in a newsroom he'll bring you up to date with what's happening in the world see you next week [noise]\nSo what does this matter to sum it up so often happen you know they happened back in February in January of this past year\nBut think about this if you're getting close to retirement\nYou're to date for the Dow Jones average to point one three percent right here today for the S. and P. five hundred three point one ... percent for the ... which is obviously a little speculative\nEight point zero six percent you know October now is a very volatile month but think about those returns and think about how you're investing your money\nInvest your money you're taking all this unnecessary risk\nTo get a whopping ... five hundred three percent return ...\nWhen you could easily be losing thirty to forty percent what am I missing here you know try to understand is for those of you that live down in Mars and Venus down and down there for about ... leads the crashes are twenty per cent decline or more from a recent high a correction this ten percent\nAnd if the market really starts to fall soon and it could now since it's in October and we talked about this the last month right selling into a falling markets is never a good thing\nNever a good thing and if you're concerned about your money right now than the stock market was never the right place for your money in the first place and the first place you know who you know what's been happening stock market President Trump\nYou know they're not pleased with the Federal Reserve right now because they're moving too quickly on interest rates well guess what the fed is officially ending the era of easy money\nRising rates they sent stocks crashing this week and you know President Trump the sand the fed has gone crazy is out of control but but in reality and this is something that Nobel Prize winning economists have been warning about that when those tax cuts were passed it could backfire and it has\nAnd its overheating the economy remember tax cuts work of a radical piece of legislation in ... that that kind of help is usually typically reserved for when we have like times of war or a recession\nBut long story short greed is good in big business in corporate America it didn't use all this newfound money to rebuild their companies for the good of the country\nAnd you know David I have a handful of clients who decided to put their money into gold ... said well if something happens the stock market they were sold on the concept there's an inverse relationship so if the stock market goes down gold will go up well guess what stock market went down to like David said five and a quarter point\nGold came up one half of one point what happened to the inverse relationship so see that that thing just watches out it doesn't it doesn't work\nWell people say is if you see that and they think one goes the other goes down the shore of gold is a safe haven but it doesn't really swing unless something really radical is happening but all of corporate America they use their money to pay dividends to shareholders oldest new tax money\nTo buy back their own stock in and remember when a company buys back its own stock there are less shares\nAnd if there are less shares the price of the uh the shared goes up and\nAnd the company does it have like improved earnings\nThey're just doing it through financial engineering and and I can honestly say this is the first time that I can think of an over four decades of watching the markets that personally\nThat the company no longer has to make a profit for the stock price to go up all you have to do is ask the government for a tax cut it and use the money it's kind of like socialism for big business and then maybe am I missing something didn't we just bailout corporate America and all those years ten years ago who vows innate yeah I think\nWhat is going on\nWhat happened to the average guy in the first quarter this year there were a hundred and Seventy billion worth of buybacks and the second quarter a hundred and eighty seven billion Goldman Sachs says that by the end of the year there'll be a trillion dollars worth of stock buybacks and\nThe congressional budget office says about Thirteen percent of all those trillions of tax cuts will actually actually washed down to Joe the plumber an All right\nAnd you know there's something wrong here which means eighty seven percent\nYeah you know quite frankly we've we've really been in a in an artificial boom and all of the the era marks of a buster developing and much less the fact that people are going to start voting very soon apple feel it in there got\nYou know people say why is it that the stock market is booming and I haven't got a raise in ten years I haven't got a bonus in ten years what went on what's what's this all about you know this is kind of like economics one oh one and you know it's it's really Reno right out of a textbook\nThat the higher interest rates go up it's going to shift the economy and it's going to shift the stock market and and if you're an aging baby boomer\nYou might not liberal and then up to see interest rates as low as they've been for the last ten years you know easy money meant ultra cheap borrowing costs for everybody you know is help tone values gets backed up where they were ten years ago\nBut the trend is now reversing mortgage rates have climbed above five percent is the highest level now since February of two thousand eleven\nThat's almost eight years ago so the question is\nIs a recession coming no not right now on friday Wall Street kind of ... to report that said consumer prices increased less to point three percent in September naturally the Trump Administration responded to all of this was talking about the strength of the economy which isn't it indirectly true\nBut naturally with the mid term elections in three weeks everything that you hear about coming out of the White House about the stock market's only many described as record breaking or incredible but if you think\nThat last week was bad just wait until the day after the election boy there are major hedge fund managers that have their super computers programmed to sell everything about a week before the election because all bets are off now so hopefully\nIf you have a lot of stocks and you have some kind of a super computer that can sell everything immediately and not be stuck in mutual funds that you know remember with mutual funds you gotta wait to the end of the day to

morning to you\nWant to guys in area well happy happy Sunday to you you know we had quite a story of the week last week and the end of the week and um I guess the question is let's just start off with the basics you know how did you see the markets had they wrap up\nA well markets were obviously a pretty bad and and for our purposes historically bad or do you have some ... lower by a four point one percent the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than four point two percent and the tech heavy NASDAQ was down three point seven percent now\nMarkets are down even more of this month because the first this is only the second week in October the first week was also in the red and so you're or month to date ... from the beginning of October to today a markets are are are lower the S. and P. five hundred is down\nMore than ... percent which is ... very worrisome and the NASDAQ is down more than eight percent or during the same time period again we've only added up and to a wedding trading days and we've already seen this amount of downside volatility\nNow obviously there are fears a potentially weekly economic data is one\nUh orange growth is is another or lack there of of earnings growth is another concern and so this is where we are and it's legal stocks in three months I was going into third quarter earnings she's just started\nTo come about on friday where we had some of the big major financial banks\nReport earnings are but again it's going to be a very interesting earnings season uh because right now sentiment is obviously very negative when you have the amount of selling pressure that we had and to put into perspective\nYes at peace five hundred a was up approximately eight point five percent\nA year to date\nAnd now it's all you have to point five set\nWriter to date it gave up Seventy five percent of its game\nIn a matter of and a ten or ... days\nYou know what what what surprised me is one thing that surprised me but the small cap Russell two thousand I'm you know traditionally traditionally scary indicator\nGay that that's stock sector is usually the first one to a pool and a major correction historically the ... pool is always small cup stocks in the mid cap Russell two thousand [noise] you know it's it's the loan benchmark index in a closed well below ten percent from its highs and in August [noise]\nUm I think it's now living point one five percent for the year and in the process it hit a five month low on friday having won't falling way below it's tuna are they moving average so is is that an indication of of things to come\nYes I I think so because historically it's been a fairly accurate indicator now is it going to be in this instance ... is is the question of but it has been a fairly reliable indicator in the past when bear market your corrections happen\nI think the other variable and this and this is something in conversations with clients [noise]\nOver the last few days of you know we were either will reach out to or they'll call in\nA one of the primary insurance is hey Howie adjusted for this a week down six to seven percent or like the markets are in in in in by large answer's no uh but but the second part of that is a lot of people really feel surprised by this\nUh in it and it's funny because one of the major talking points I have with people\nAre in regards to this is maybe it shouldn't be that big of a surprise if you've been watching what's going around the world especially emerging markets internationally markets have been terrible for the last or maybe three to four months of eventually it was going to have to find its way\nTo the United states now we've been major beneficiaries of being the world's largest economy having the world's reserve currency and US dollar\nBecause as we've talked about on the show the U.S dollar\nHas continued a very very consistent strong appreciation over last fortified much we spend a lot of time on the show talking about how strong US dollar it's got a\nMajor reason why the u._s. dollar Scott and stronger a is because international money as transforming into the United states to buy treasuries\nBecause that international investors country is doing terribly and there's a lot of worry um and so again international markets had been very bad economic growth and the international market have been very bad\nAh and eventually there which some worry that this was going to come to the United states and it was not necessarily matter if it's a matter when because regardless of the rhetoric", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Guaranteeing Your Retirement
