I'm Tobar\nAnd for the last hundred years October has been the most vulnerable month\nIn in ... in a century so let me remind you what has happened in the past October's\nStock market crash started in Nineteen or twenty nine beginning of the great the great depression we had giant thousand point drops in Nineteen Seventy eight Nineteen Seventy nine black Monday Nineteen eighty seven the tech dot com bubble that popped October two thousand two\n... two thousand eight Lehman Brothers crashed at the end of September a week later in October after the realization set in that they're losing six hundred billion dollars isn't ... five hundred went down fifty eight\nWell [noise] David uh where's the good news [laughter]\nAnd there is is if you're planning a gram capitals ... you're you're you're already aware that you're not going to have to worry about losing it goes good gosh I mean think about it Warren Buffett\nHundred and twenty billion in cash look we can go on with this long story short last week to the what happened is you had more sellers than buyers and so what does that matter if you're getting close to retirement you might simply you simply won't live long enough to remake what you could lose and\nSo last week so off who knows where that that would that be the beginning in the beginning of it or not is it a lot of CEOs ... oh my gosh\nWell I'll tell you a grand capital advisors and you know we have that big Bloomberg Terminal in Washington and we followed the best and the brightest then last week one blatant point a concern was this dramatic rise in the amount of short positions that are held by professional traders\nAgainst all the major U.S indexes futures futures\nThey are now more than sixty five billion worth of short positions to be exact which is the largest dollar amount in history simply put there was a historic amount of money betting that the U.S markets will decline in the near future decline in the near future sixty five billion worth\nPeople speculating that it's going to decline and older do now and November makes it ten years since we've had a correction think of this and it's all happening while the Dow Jones is dancing around having record highs and earnings growth and the economy is strong\nSo you know perhaps it can be explained why\nBy that by that fact because we are near Hi Records on everything and you know the professional investors they're starting to hedge say fuel that could be a mess of self or a correction or\nRemember that cliche by Warren Buffett be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy you know which is good advice at all times but now I think its head on\nSo what do we have next well earning seasons about ready to start for U.S companies and that we should give us kind of a a good overall picture of how companies are feeling about where they're going to be in the future you know they need to start hearing from their customers their suppliers especially what's going on overseas\nAnd we've already heard from several companies urging caution because again with this terrible thing one example is coming to the world's biggest engine manufacturer right out of Columbus, Indiana and they just projected they'll lose a hundred million in this next quarter\nAnd so again there's so much out there then then think about this also also we have six hundred billion six hundred billion in margin debt we just talked about people shorting on shorting\nSixty five billion ... borrowing money to buy stocks powering money to buy stocks and back in two thousand eight before the last crash it was only\nThree hundred billion think think think about that\nA ... what is going to happen if the market started dropping in with interest rates rising margarine calls will become like a forest fire and all this margin debt is going to be like gasoline being thrown out of us are going to have their short everything just to get out of a bad position so not no matter how you look at it\nThan any perspective that you can think of it's incredibly dangerous now if you have stocks and you're close to retirement please don't be led to the slaughterhouse doors one more time\nYou know plan accordingly especially if you're near retirement you got to keep your guard up or you're going to get punched in the mouth right jak term a ...
