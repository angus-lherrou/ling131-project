and we got a new feature here in the\nAir and recorded our first CEOs spotlight which highlights successful businesses in the bay area and here's out\nToday we have Josh Matt skin in Studio CEO neutral air and he's going to share his story of success and how he was able to build his business from the ground up Josh thanks for coming into the air and how you doing doing well I Love the product and I I Want to get into it because new trailer it is the product you're the c._e._o. envy nutrition\nAt first of all tell us a little bit about how you got started here Josh\nYeah so how I started was I was working with who's my partner and organic chemist in this business name's Frank Lewis I'm he was actually in the hospital\nAnd or the nurse who was taking care of them was telling them about how these doctors were trying to administer probiotics be an election knowing his background I asked them if we could do melatonin or caffeine ventilation\nAnd he said well in theory yes let's give it a shot we use vapors Asian technology because what it's really doing is just\nAir socializing or the components so for nicotine for instance if not vaporizing anything\nNow you are the test funny you said what was that process like um [noise] it was interesting I'm definitely had one of the ... went a little too heavy on the caffeine a few times um ads but got a little light has here and there but you know after a while and some safety testing you know we made sure that we scaled it back\nAs long as I Know you've tested it on yourself that's actually kind of relieving for a consumer yep\nAnd I am still one of our main tests findings to the state of everything that is on the market I have tested over and over and over and\nTalk about your roots here in Tampa and how you got started in the bay area and what these routes Mindy\n[noise] yeah so actually I went to high school at Berkeley ... went to Penn State and then you know was back in Fort Lauderdale working for a big advertising from down there um didn't really like that [laughter] to be honest and then I kind of started my\nEntrepreneurial ventures from there\nSo I came back to Tampa because I obtained the rights to do what's called Google business photos and I don't know if you're familiar with that but\nWe would do a three sixty tours of inside of businesses seeing them up and they were actually posted on to Google Maps and to this day you know if you're in Tampa and you go look at some local businesses and you can go take those tour it's probably from us\nSo how do you market this when it comes to a lot of people now are trying to stay away from the nicotine products as far as vapors Asians in relations go so how do you make sure people know this is not a nicotine product\n[noise] yeah so the you know in the U.S we're really focused on directing consumer um e commerce so on your commerce platforms you have the ability to educate people much more than through your retail or environment\nOr you are you able to spend time here in the bay area and hang out and and kind of a yes or no I ... listen I Love when I can be home um\nYou know a lot of our distribution in the U.S most of our distribution is just direct to consumer I mean Amazon or you know direct to our website so\nYou see any way in the future obviously when the business continues to grow to get back to the to your roots the Tampa Bay area\nYeah absolutely so I mean we try to keep as much in Tampa Bay right now I'm as we can so when we started we're outsourcing everything because while we didn't have the money to have a bunch of employees\nSo over the last three months you know we've grown to now we have eleven employees but we're also bringing in all of our logistics all of our shipping so we're continuously trying to grow out our operations here\nNow for somebody like we mentioned earlier somebody who wants to be a CEO of their own business one day own companies start a company from the ground up what would be your advice to that person\nPersist and see I mean I'm honestly you have to because\n... you know something to change overnight right so just like I was talking about earlier I got woke up got that order that I didn't think we were going to get 'em if you're not persistent and you're not consistently trying to learn about how to market your product how to get your product out there\nYou're going to fail I mean I think most business ideas die within the first month right so when I was a good idea okay they start trying to do something and then it's hard to you know and they give up and then they go back and you know work nine to five and it's more comfortable that way\nWell listen I I Am proud of you I Know the bay area is going to be proud of you as well when they try the product a neutral air check it out go try it for yourself and and most important I Want to I Want people to know this is not a nicotine product nada nicotine product not a tobacco product um\nYou know and you know go check out our website we've actually done fibrosis inside of toxicity testing on human lung tissue ought to make sure no negative effects I'm and we're always doing more

here and Kevin understand we don't have any movies\nWhile we have movies they just were not screened widely uh partly because it's not really a great weekend for movies apparently I the one that's probably the widest release is\nHunter killer starring Gerard Butler as a submarine commander who is trying to stop it and we weren't rushing up from starting World War three and have to go after them under the Arctic ice\nThis one I actually it apparently it's ... it's gotta be terrible because not only did they are not screened it but they they had screenings they just wouldn't allow from ... in\n... what does that tell you Kevin if they don't allow you to screen a movie\nThat you know sometimes they if they don't have the budget that ... that just tells me they don't have the budget but when they actually have screenings and I ask about 'em and then I'm not allowed in that tells me that they're hiding something basically\nYou got a great job professional go to the movies guy\nOr you will and the thing is it's a a ... it's it just sounds like the plot sounds very\nMuch like something that probably would have come out in the late eighties but apparently it's coming out now and it all starts Gerard Butler had at one time kind of a big name but he's kind of not in in the big name movie anymore I mean this isn't three hundred [noise]\nUm so that is one of the movies that's out there that that uh you know you can choose to not spend\nYour money on a new Johnny English movie which stars Rowan Atkinson which actually has made money overseas already\nAs what the other films buddy is of course the bumbling spy\nAnd this one is is probably not going to do very big in the U.S I think it's original relief of bigger and then they decided to bring it down to under for like five hundred screens and uh the last one series made less than ten million dollars in the states\nAll right well we'll check it out it bad guys at the movies dot com and That's Kevin car and Kevin

about amendment three\nAnd I don't know anything about it and it just seems to me like somebody's trying to pull one over on the voters watches amendment three actually do and is it really good force or is this by a special interest group is trying to get something done that we might not want to\nI'm not familiar with a really depends on who you ask him in three deals with the casinos and the ... they say gives the voters the exclusive rights to decide whether a new casino can open in the state it's a very confusing amendment because you don't know you hear some of it if you vote yes will benefit\nOr the the seminal hard rock the tribe um so it's really confusing when I'm jak confused on an amendment I typically tend to vote no\nWell the problem with it is that means that uh the seminal hard rock and all that I Love it and I think a Disney is yes Disney's off oil or they love it because it would make it very hard for casinos to come in and you'd have to wait till the ... election then get sixty percent approval as I figure\nAnd you need hundreds of thousands of signatures to get the referendum yeah and so it's going to benefit the larger companies that have the resources to get all those signatures\nYeah so I'm a lot of people are going to be voting against it so help at all Dave\nWell I guess I have probably just voted against it because it just seems shady

five [noise]\nIt's six fifty two on AM Tampa Bay and Megan Kelly seems to be in a little trouble about a black face joke that she did and Michael ... our our NBC News radio reporter joins us on a um Tampa Bay and\nMichael I understand that our show may be terminated or at least her presence there\nI think a little of both on that one jak you're looking in Megan Kelly was once talked about is the future face of NBC News might might remember that a couple of years ago now according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter\nMeghan Kelly is quote never coming back end of quote and that they explained that due to Kelly's non break deal she actually stands to walk away with as much as sixty nine million dollars which would be the remainder of her multi year NBC contracting this\nAh after two days where both Megan Kelly and NBC has unsuccessfully tried to contain the damage from several statements she made on the Megan Kelly today show defending the desire of white people to dress up in blackface costume for Halloween and this particularly\nTough because immediately after she made the statements you at NBC co workers uh mostly through its broadcasts go on the air and start to uniformly can damned making Kelly's remarks on NBC's airways Lester Holt made some comments about as did al broker\nA concern and argue the statement I Know I I Know you will not share your opinion on this and nor should you\nBeing a reporter but they're idiots because this is ridiculous taken out of proportion here somebody who was talking about maybe their favorite character of course she wasn't talking about the you know Nineteen twenties or whatever it is a black space that's not what she was talking about and anybody that thinks otherwise is making their own narrative that's my opinion I think\nTo a certain extent here I mean listen whether or not she was defending any element of that I think more importantly what I was getting from the conversation and again this was a conversation with a panel that she had on her show\nAnd again taken out of context it would appear associate defending white people wearing black face make what I got out of this is I mean this exists in our culture whether you like it or not it was been a part of entertainment for years you had Robert Downey junior just a few years ago and Tropic Thunder\nAnd full full makeup\nYeah playing an African American character and very funny added\nHilarious at 'em with that I I don't\nKnow that this is something that we can as a culture can ignore has ever happened but what this is Don is in a situation where you already have that ratings for Megan Kelly show in a situation where for weeks\nPrior to that she was in discussion with people in the executive at NBC about wrapping up this element of her today show and moving her to an NBC News portion of things I'm this did not make the conversation any easier the comments any less shocking to the audience it was presented to us on any level here you're looking at executives across the board\nFrom networks saying that they feel that\nComments made her talk to her agency not only does she walk away from our current agency she was going to another big agency was going to represent her\nThat agency has stepped away from her because of these types of comment so the concern here is like I guessing and this is a theory that I think we probably heard in radio before guys if the ratings are there you can get away with saying and doing a whole lot if they aren't you cannot\nNo doubt about it yeah and and again I I mean I remember as a kid they had a\nRotary who I forgot what club that was but they used to do a minstrel show every year would be eight\nWhite guys at all in black face during the minstrel thing and ... and used to do it and all that sure if it was acceptable then and obviously it's not acceptable today but I don't even think like you got to look at it in context\n[noise] I I think I think that that's the key is ... ... ... it may not seem like it in social media world we're living in nowadays but there is new watch um there there is the element of what else was surrounding this conversation how\nHow did this come down rather than let's get it as an eight second clip put on our social media page so that we can be shocked and outraged by something else today\nAnd I think that that's a certain element of this that we all need to step back and look at here but again\nListen it's going to be difficult for Megan Kelly to find a job here already we know that there are higher ups in in the broadcast networks that are saying that she's talked with these comment\nWe also know that her lawyer has requested that are in these discussions to wrap things up with NBC that they bring in Ronan Farrow we know him as a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter who has said NBC impeded his reporting on the Harvey Weinstein story last year that doesn't sit well with not only NBC and why would you be wanting to bring him to the table for these discussions is if there's some sort of a threat\nThat doesn't sit well with other people who might be thinking about hiring or down the road here I guess on the plus side if she does get\nSixty nine million dollars out of this money of time to pick and choose where she's going to go to ... million who\nCan Michael thanks for joining us Michael by our NBC News
