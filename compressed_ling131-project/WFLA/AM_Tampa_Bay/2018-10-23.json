war soldiers but you could still have these types of operations\nAnd I think that's really one of the most fascinating things that I go over in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one guy there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nOh Georgia since you're a gift there has been a an Ohio northeastern part you know I've got to ask I Believe you during the show from there the man's school reform matory\nYep we sure did and every time I go there and there's something it's electricity and if I could I'd like to share a love story was\nSure okay my mother and full blooded Cherokee of called in quite a few times\nA follower runoff but anyway uh my father died and three months\nLater my mom she's really depressed didn't know how things were going to work out the you know to put two kids\nAnd just before they liked woke up my father was there you came in her bedroom sit down on the bed mom sit up her daughter kissed or said honey everything's gonna be All right both\nBeautiful and the strongest power of everything is love and it was going to share that\nWith sweet mhm\nThese sometimes these stories are just emotional as well or if they bring to\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part it's been in my in the ... and the accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative\nAnd it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye are saying you know it's okay um ... you know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one\nAnd and these are important things and like we talked about before it could heal some sort of psychological will help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that sometimes paranormal experiences arts uses coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes goes scary scary is\nNot like that then realize it's going to join the Bronx I chose to go to George how are you know Joe\nGood a brand and yeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe you really a story about a full up are rich and I've seen um [noise]\nYeah the um the question is do you think that there is a subliminal under channel of communication going on between the go see a Parisian and the recipient of the ghost experience\nUm maybe perhaps subconsciously there's this supplemental um communication to weigh communication going going that precipitate the a ghostly operation appearing\nAnd I had a full reparation experience uh after my brother passed away um I'm a singer songwriter and I was having writer's block on the song and I've really destroyed before and coast to coast um my brother comes into the room [noise]\nUm he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital I'm short of 'em and uh it's it's during the day or at the foot of my bed he walks by\nAnd he speaks to me and says just get it done and then this\nHere's an to an all um can you maybe elaborate on what\nCould have precipitated this\nDoes your does your brother pass away or he was he this was the best way how long ago that he passed away\nA [noise] before you know maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years\nOkay All right I'm while enter your second question and we'll get back to the first question quick so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know with the husband thing his wife and then the wife kind of said hey check buying the workbench and he finds a pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is it happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation the resonate with the consciousness of your brother\nAnd when you resonate with something it's not just information it's the visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there was one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night\nAnd this\nFeeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog laying in the water injured and you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow\nFeel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they had a reading each other's emotions and then you know wakes up cars finds a dog that type of thing so you know why there isn't physical communication or words there is some sort of like I'm understanding or collapse you're reading a mind type thing\nWhere do we get the book to go study sprint and\nUh the study is available at Barnes and noble a it's

I'm On the morning of October second came in and remove the hard disks from all of the security cameras within the Saudi conflict aside from that that was really nothing new there was a timeline that he throughout their indicating different portions of what they had seen and where they were gathering their information but there was no detail whatsoever\nAnd the fact that just kind of adds more speculation to all of this thinking why did president or along with all of this information is audio tape it was allegedly out there and the possibility of any evidence that they found inside the conflict maybe even the bones saw that was used at this member\nA ... none of that was brought to the table today is leaving a lot of people wondering what's really going on inside turkey\nAnd that's why we're trying to figure out all the details and the reason I Do think it's important and I think it's important that President Trump does wait\nUntil he gets all the details but these are people we do business with and it's important to to draw a line somewhere or just because based on trust you see these people and what they're doing if they could commit these heinous acts as brazen Lee and as openly as they did a these are people we do business with\nAnd and even to that they're saying the yesterday there was reports yesterday that came out from Turkish officials that said that very they told various media outlets that prince ... close aide sowed could Tony subtle Khatami was beamed into the room and is that all the conflict October second we're to show he was being detained via Skype so they\nSomehow were able to above\nHim on the screen on some level in their walk a show he was being detained on the video call\nAnd at that point in time um this assistance of a print selmont said

not exactly sure they're getting these would be elements that would help explain the detail in a better a better light and understanding as to what's going on here but if you're not going to release that uh he he did call on Saudi Arabia to say\nListen you guys did indeed admit to the murder\nAnd that it was an accident but where's the body where is your assistance here inside turkey\nOr that helps you get rid of the body calling on them to step forward and try to see if they can bring this thing too close so I'm Wondering if there is some element of well with this all the end of the day
