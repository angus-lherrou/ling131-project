I mean I Know that like I feel that as well too because when I'm watching it I'm going wow this is going to be great tomorrow yeah but\nI also know that you're going to have critics then I saw it on CNN this morning already with their headline critics questioned Trump's priorities of course they do and that's what I knew would be the headline when I saw ... and then and then when I heard Kanye in the oval office now let's put this in\nThis makes me honest Kanye West and Donald Trump\nCould've solved world peace world hunger and killed three diseases yesterday and they would have been critics of that meeting\nIt no it's true like it's funny but it's true that is actually where we're at right now that's how divided we are in this country\nAnd I I fully expected to hear that and see that yesterday and we did now we really do have to keep in this into perspective and his perspective you that it's it was only ten minutes it was ten minutes it was a ten minute sit down in the oval office and then they wouldn't have lodged\nListen if you listen to ... after the meeting you know that he can get a couple of things in in ten minutes\nHe will go up a hundred will get into that we have plenty of audio to get to later in the day plenty that will drive the show today um\nBy the way it was ten minutes to you it was six hours for Kanye West because time is a myth for [laughter] well that's that's that's a fact food like yeah yeah you you thought it was ten minutes I was in there for six hours in comedy land Hi ms unreal when you see him back in the future I Love it so\nI you know it was ten minutes of and yes was the all over the place at times absolutely did he make a lot of sense of times yeah he certainly did\nIt's also extremely nerve wracking knowing the entire country is watching you I Know he's a performer but that's something that has been doing his entire life speaking about policies is something that Kanye West on stage like that is not comfortable in that role I didn't I mean maybe he would be eventually you\nWeren't comfortable with him do it and I feel like he was extremely comfortable\nWhile you could tell he he was rambling like and that somebody who is nervous that somebody who can't collect his thoughts of incredible and like I said we'll get into this and play some of the audio here because it really was it was an entertaining ten minutes there I was trying to think\nA lot of things were going through my mind what Jim Brown thinking right now like you see cool with it 'cause it's a big Trump supporter but he's also got crazy Kanye West spewing whatever next to it now as far as me being okay with it it's ten minutes\nThis is not ... you see what you want about Obama and Trump going out and playing golf whatever how many ever rounds they both have played a whatever Obama plane his presidency whatever Trump will play\nThat's like a three and a half hour four hour deal to go play around the Gulf we're talking ten minutes sitting in the oval office and then they went and had some lunch if anything\nThis can tie together the black community the African American community with Avi\nSo the other people that they feel have right now\nDo you think this helps no not the cognac or if maybe I don't know 'cause I feel like a lot of people will just turn on you if you say things we don't like\nIt's not that they'll go you know what you said something I don't like and now you're going to bring me to the table instead now I just hate you I ...\nI think it depends on who it is kind of us we all know is a little you know\nHe's cuckoo for ... which is why I feel like we're all winners for this the only people who lose in this situation are angry people and they always\nLose or we tired of winning yet I'm never tired of women of course I don't want a lot so how do I know we\nHave some really good audio to play throughout the show from Kanye West but first time to check in with storm teammate meteorologist ... and ... it's been so brutally hot but that could all change today right\nWe get we get up you know that twenty four hours ... for a friend that you're in us this morning and still feel a little muggy but during the day we

Seventy five and like for more ...\n[noise] five\nFifty two on an am Tampa Bay and we do have our CEOs spotlight coming up here on AM Tampa Bay with United vein centers and here it is Dr was knee founder and medical director of United\nThe main centers and good morning doctor was and how you doing today good morning very well thank you know first of all tell us a little bit about United van centers\nUnited vein centers is a state wide set of band clinics that are there to serve those with what we call the innocence efficiency or van disease\nNow how prevalent is vane disease right now\nVery prevalent actually about one out of five adults have an disease\nHow did you all get started at United van centers\nWill back when I was training many years ago we used to treat vein disease in the operating room the patients with pain aching swelling invisible veins would have to go to the operating room and have the barbaric procedure called vein stripping done\nOver the years about near the end of my training lasers came out since those came out we saw a great opportunity to use today's technology or bags in technology to help patients in the office and keep them out of the operating room\nAnd I want to go back Dr was the end really look at van disease and what it is and how does it negatively impact our health\nVan disease negatively impacts your health like causing the heaviness aching pain and the swelling from blood pooling in your legs in bad veins I'm In addition to that\nIt can cause blood clots and ulcers so it can have some pretty negative impacts\nNow Dr was me I Love highlighting successful businesses here in the bay area so why did you choose Tampa Bay as the starting point for United vein centers\n[noise] we chose Tampa Bay because they in disease is even more prevalent in the older population the older population so as the decades ago on even though most vein disease happens in your twenties every decade the symptoms of pain aching swelling get worse\nA Tampa Bay has a high population of patients over fifty years old so we felt if there's a place we can help\nThis is definitely the place now there are other vein centers in Tampa Bay so we're not the only ones but the reason why we've been so successful is we pay attention\nTo patients or the customer care we pay attention to how the patients experiences their journey to us sinners\nWe're speaking with Dr was the right now founder and medical director of United veins centers on CEOs spotlight you mentioned symptoms doctor was and what are some of those symptoms critical signs of vein disease that could be fatal\nThey'd all is when your legs start to swell a that could be a sign that you may be getting a blood clot\nNow what's the difference between something that's fatal as far as being disease and something that can be easily treated and not not fatal off the bat\nSomething that's not going to be fatal off the bat is if you're getting the the aching a Andy cramping in your legs without the swelling but if you start to get swollen you should get checked out\nHow did you decide to get involved in this field the field of vein diseases\nAs a physician your goal usually is to help individuals but when you can find a field where there is not help on every corner you get that gratification that you made a difference in this world and in vain disease we were able to do that\nAnd everybody's different and and the way they treat and the way they practice so how does your treatment different from other practices\n[noise] it's the same in that we use lasers and lasers is what you should be using today it's different in that unlike a typical physician's office again we care about the patients journey\nWe actually uh make sure that our patients are seen on time we don't over book are patients we call our patients to see how they're doing so again it's it's it's a very positive journey and I think that's something that is forgotten in today's medicine\nAnd certainly that's comforting and positive but what is that treatment like as far as pain goes\nThere is no pain remember these are office procedures and were able to do a lot through just a tiny little Nick in the skin so you will feel the pinch when we treat you but again very tolerable and I would be hesitant to call it painful\nYeah and that's why people will do their due diligence do research of course the doctor that they should use when it comes to vain disease what should a patient look for when deciding to choose that Dr\nWhen a patient is assigned to choose a doctor for any procedure whether it's your heart or your veins always go to a facility where they are dedicated to that disease that is all they treat that is all they do and they do a high number of them because the more you do the better you are at it\nJust so people are aware what happens if it's left untreated water some of the complications that can arise from vein disease\nIn vain diseases left untreated not only can slow your life down but it can lead to a fatal blood clots and all sorts and your legs\nThis is CEOs spotlight here Aaron Jacobs in your host with Dr was neat how have you seen the business continue to grow in the bay area\nIt has expanded we're all over the bay area where in Sarasota Tampa Clearwater in Lakeland ah so it has expanded where the number one provider in this area and um we've asked you expand it outside of the base so there's definitely some growth\nDr Watson if people want to get in touch with you they want to find out more about United van centers how can they do that is there a Web site they can visit\nUnited vein centers dot com or just call one eight hundred vein doc\nHe is Dr ... founder and medical director of United main centers and our CEO spotlight today for Tampa

[laughter]\nI was ... defended the idea of the failure because Ruth from Americans who don't know anything about it to the Europeans that say oh you're American or do you think about it though I started to\nTo be honest though ... it is true that there wasn't a lot of people that are obviously like you just said so what does that mean does this impact Jeff the rowdy is at all because we know the rallies or trying to get into the MLS just that low attendance impact them at all\nWhat it doesn't mean it's a low attendance has been over thirty five to forty thousand\nWhich is like if you go to Portland Timbers or something like that they sell out every game which is thirty five to forty feels like Ogle member would exactly the stadium is reduced so that out every time that is funny because it's a smaller stadium do play a raging that's what we'll examine jak UC lives in thirty to forty thousand there was no thinking through it it looked\nIt ... it was just a lower oil it wasn't that Matt it's a popular sport man like soccer is really not I'm not sure how much like whether or not there was a lot of people there I'm saying if it was only the lower ... that's not thirty to forty thousand okay enough if it's less than sixty as somebody who's a day or\nYou know every Sunday or whenever the box play there and you know that stadium I'll take your word for it but I think that you know a lot of people here Jeff makes a good point where you want to go to a stadium you want the perception that it's packed so you don't want to put yourself in a position where you have this huge stadium like Raymond James stadium and you look on the TV screen and it looks half empty that's a problem the bulls had as well\nI mean they don't have a big attendance anyway but it doesn't help when half that stadium is empty even more so\nNow it looks bad it looks really bad and we've seen that with us up like you just mentioned their football team is not getting the kind of a tendency to just show me there's almost forty thousand less what really thirty eight point six thousand I'd only they only in the lower ... there's no way they were only in the lower of all if it was forty thousand people\nI didn't see anybody in the upper tiers ... even the second level where I was hard for me to toe TV what's the level of ... there was nobody on the top tier which is why this one\nAnd just because they sold that amount of tickets doesn't mean that everybody showed up to the games people could buy tickets in advance and maybe done something yeah I don't understand that you had to buy tickets to something you might have got it from a friend who knows uh we got a lot coming up here on an Tampa Bay lightning last last night fill us busy that will few with us next on an Tampa
