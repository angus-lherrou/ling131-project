the maintenance of society that certain places be respected by also I I think it's an extraordinary of a negative\nPart of this whole scenario and certainly you should have the death penalty\nOh yeah and in their ... basically they don't use the language hate crime but it was a hate crime any way you look at it in that normally is considered a more severe crime then just murder itself\nYou're correct now unfortunately we've got a lot of hate crimes against a Jewish citizens in this country I'm certainly in Europe and they're coming from the left I don't know if you're aware of that a lot of\nKids on campus Jewish kids they're being accosted in there that there are being pushed in show by people on the left who are anti Israel as well as certain Islamic\nUm organizations college
