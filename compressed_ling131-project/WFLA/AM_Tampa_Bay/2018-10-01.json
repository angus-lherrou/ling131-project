people on the brownie paper towels would have had a hard time picking up a like a four hundred pound ATV and\nSomehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes I Can't remember this was a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses but I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dresses not what you would expect\nFor going out scouting hunting areas in the rain forest in the woods um\nThey were like blonde hair blue eyes wide again\nJust like if aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans it was like they were too perfect\nNot a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the cloud shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nSo they just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\n[noise] they kind of stopped in chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they hold off and they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped at night I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two three minutes of course I was on my way gone to the lake\nAnd like I said I've got the guts is logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life sometimes don't sink in until after the fact and you know I started thinking about it we'll wait a minute how could they even get that ATV onto\nThe road that show [laughter] alone how weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um\nYou know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there'd been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that the records their their sounds it was in those same woods\nWhere I heard this ah ungodly sound that couldn't be any other animal and I don't think of the best opera singer POV raunchy could have imitated the sound\nAnd I'd encourage you to find out what coast to coast did with the audio tape they used to play of this a legit big foot recording ten or more years ago George ... used to play it I think art bell used to play it hasn't been played for years but\nI heard that up in the shame woods\nIt's a unique recording never heard of it before I'm starting to buying more and more to the fact that these big put my feet dimensional might have the extra terrestrial connection the humanoid that I saw in the woods the more I think about it there's\nI'm Ninety nine point nine percent sure those were not human and hindsight I'm just glad they didn't take me whatever they were doing up in that area\nWell we're glad to cause a ... you wouldn't have been able to call in presumably thank you Jason for sharing that story that's a that's a pretty strange you need to start carrying some recording equipment with you wherever you go thanks very much try to get one more caller in close to home here Brian in Las Vegas hey Brian what's on your mind\nOn\nA couple of comments won the on the Michigan for one one one on\nPrevious callers and are quick to get the story in real quick um I had kind of a big experience and it wasn't until he played this year sounds like coast to coast they realize that that's what I heard I\nWas that um the Willamette to for national forest is a lot of ill between um mount bachelor and three sisters in Oregon\nAnd um it was up there a late night watching the stars and hanging out you know like to play music stuff sometimes I just kind of hanging out somewhere where it's quiet and there's nobody around for\nHours up there and went down to looking at stars who binoculars and I heard that same sound that he's talking about it as best as I Know what he's talking about [noise] um and it had a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody else it had this experience but um it was kind of like a what do you do end up here and and I've got a second guessing but\nOil really far away and uh you know maybe I'm just imagining that and\nSo I kept hanging out look at the stars in about ten minutes and they closed oh I'd say at least three to five miles in maybe ten minutes and it did the same sound again only the the impression or psyche congressionally all it was like hey I'm coming at you\nAnd may I jump to my car so bad and got out of there and\nYou know I never really piece together what was you know um my girlfriend and I will do a lot of reading once in a lot of course coast and when the sheriff down it was like oh my God that is what it is it has a you know musicians like

thing that happened there and I'm Wondering when they're going to actually have a boat I guess toward the end of the week will it be the end of the week after they had a week and by the way this thing about the FBI investigation\nThat is just blowing a week again Democrats scored getting at one week close\nTo the election they'd like to put it off until after the election if they could what do you actually get a fine\nDuring the week long FBI investigation\nCertainly over something thirty six years ago yeah the distinction they worked for the criminal justice system\nAnd the the FBI is the executive branch which has just so already over the criminal justice system\nThe confirmation process occurs in the legislative branch and gives the Senate sole responsibility for evaluating presidential nominees so in other words they're not going to do anything that are going to find anything because that's not their job Howard Altman\nWriting in the Tampa Bay times yesterday did a um\nA a an interview with Fred Humphries who retired earlier this year after Twenty one years with the FBI and that included several investigations like this one\nAnd he said because nobody has filed criminal charges against Kevin ...\nThere'll be no subpoenas for documents or other informations\nAnd all the witnesses have to agree to speak voluntarily they can't be subpoenaed to come or anything like that and ah he said it would be different if somebody brought charges then you're talking about a criminal investigation this was not that this was basically blowing a week just\nThrow in a week away when he could be confirmed and on the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd incidentally it's gonna be interesting to see if they'll confirming there are three that are questionable here I'm Susan Collins from Maine or ... from Alaska and one other one Jeff Flake yeah Jeff Flake\nAnd I think flake might be ready to go in and vote for him because he wants to run for president in twenty twenty he's not running for reelection here but the interesting boat uh I Know one Democrat vote they're going to get\nAnd that's um the senator from west by God Virginia\nUm what's his name mansion yeah Joe mansion he is going to vote for him because if he doesn't he doesn't have a chance for reelection in the state of West Virginia\nWhich has become a very red red state thanks to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and uh so that's one Democrat vote I'm almost sure he'll get if if he doesn't vote for confirmation he's may as well not even run for reelection\nThey should have their minds made up now because they're not going to find anything from this FBI investigation\nOh I Know nothing at all and they're just putting it off there trying to get it after the election so they're doing everything they can to get it after the elections because they're thinking they might take the Senate and have a little more power there but of course they don't take office in all in January it's just crazy what they're doing to this guy and his family\nThey said they're going to look at anything that's credible ... will listen we've already heard uh from Ford we've already heard from Kavanaugh we've heard I it's not

another Cold War that would take us back to the Reagan days given what's happening with China particularly and even Russia at this point yeah you\nKnow what jak you're right guy ... and not exactly the way things were you know we're not talking about hitting missile silos and and uh that drama on espionage spies and stuff still some of that going on but uh this is a little bit different than we're ... we're entering an era now where our intelligence agencies say you know\nEver since two thousand and want to nine eleven the majority of our intelligence resources have been\nFocusing on counter terrorism and battling ISIS and al ... and preventing a large scale attacks on the U.S mainland well now that they have been degraded to the point where their abilities to do that or drastically reduced\nNow we're beginning to look at once again the old adversaries up Russia and China as major threats but the threats are not the same as they used to be it's it's a new era of of global cyber conflict is what we're worried about now\nWhere everybody agrees that Russia and China or two of them ... major hackers in the world we heard the president lash out at China for interfering in our elections he said we know what Russia does as far as that goes\nBut uh the estimates are in China alone there are fifty to one hundred thousand people\nIn their so called hacker army that do this every day so this is now becoming a priority for our intelligence agencies to detect and defend against this type of warfare\nYeah it's one thing to try to thwart an attack where um you know you amp up security things like that it's another thing when you're dealing with like you mentioned fifty thousand people in China alone who had the technology to commit these hacks and I don't know how you can stop fifty thousand plus people and there's so many more\nYeah ... ... the only thing you can try to do is uh number one beef up your cyber defenses\nWhich it always seems like a it's a back and forth the hackers find a vulnerability somewhere you have to defend against that\nUh and the response time as what's critical there but we know for instance we know that Russia tried to hack into our power grids over the summer or trying to uh targets a certain utilities and and areas of the United states where there was a cyber vulnerability so it's all it's an ongoing effort between\nTrying to stop it and keeping up to date with what they're doing to to get through our defenses\nYeah it's ah you just hope it never goes beyond being a cyber Cold War that we don't get into some kind of a physical conflict with a given the fact that we've sent ships into the south seas in\nA China that like that and with the Russians are doing some things in Syria's they aren't happy about and on it goes\nYeah absolutely jak and it's not only you know there is still that conventional worry as well or Russia with a new generation of weapons systems that Vladimir ... and has been touting their exploitation of the polar regions there now\nOr expanding with a military base is up in the Arctic uh also uh with China you're talking about increasing in military spending and increasing their global presence I mean China never had overseas military bases\nBut they have started to do that now with a base in Africa they're\nTalking about maybe establishing a an outpost in Venezuela so ah the global influence uh physically by China and Russia was also an issue\nOf bill appreciate your joining us on AM Tampa Bay bills in for our NBC News radio reporter and we'll talk to
