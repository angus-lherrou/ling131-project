I'm Sorry what was the question again he's he's asking if the pyramid is actually the tip of the iceberg\nAh okay that's a great question so um I you know one way to marry the the the theory of a law civilization starting something ... and then the old kingdom are Egyptians of a building on top of it is basically\nTo draw the line exactly where you are asking a Michael I think micro is your name right yes\nSo um yeah so I think ... and in fact when even when you look on on the pyramid itself on the ... on the north east corner I I was there just a few weeks ago and you know what that is bedrock\nThat's not human stone that is actually the original hill that was there and it was molded to sort of you know allow for stores to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert Duvall has insinuate it is that he thinks that maybe there were shrines on the in the three locations and they were lying to you know the belt stars of a Ryan a dating to step peppy\nAnd then you know in the old kingdom a Egyptians came they basically built their pyramids on top of the\nShrines and so I end the softer so what's under the pyramid also you know the subterranean chamber from the looks of it it looks much older and when you walk into the pyramid or you walk into the what's called the kings chamber\nThere's also a you feel like you are you are basically in a to phase monument like there was something there before and then the pyramid was built on top so it's an excellent question um proving it is a little bit difficult of course but uh it's definitely something that's possible\nThank you so much my new a just an absolutely perfect fascinating conversation tonight here on coast I loved\nIt so much to me we've got a twenty seconds left what's next for you\nUm what about your ... one of your listeners asking exactly the right question about the connection between go Beckley tippy end or in Egypt and that's that's what the next\n... there's no doubt that there's a connection I there's a seven thousand year gap in there and we're going to fill it in and ... with your help thank you so much Manu they safe out there\nWhat a conversation tonight this is what coast to coast is all about for me is being able to come in here and discussed my favorite thing which is lost history and Egypt well of course time travel ghost UFOs all of that stuff counts too but for me it is Egypt and loss history\nAnd with that I got to get out of here\nSo I'll see everybody here in a couple of weeks but before I Do that I've got to think Nathan for running the board of course Donald behind the glass Chris for being the producer for me here\nLax Greg Tim Lisa Stephanie George and my beautiful wife Rita\nWith that I Am your host Jimmy church spent coast to coast am I'm signing off go back to lead tabby [noise]\nAnd you feel run down I mean I of course we get older we don't feel the way we used to feel what is it something that's just not quite right going on inside your body you know something's off with your daily routine your energy's not there maybe it's hurting you in the bedroom as well will now you can change that you can improve\nYour light improve your energy in your mental focus new mail medical center Aaron Jacobs in here and that's what my friend here at heart media told me about they told me about new mail medical center they had\nThat train medical ... that they're going to make sure they find the right approach for you that's important they are going to guide you through this you're going to go to their location right here in Tampa they have a lemon nationwide but they have one right here in Tampa they're going to take your blood work that day they're going to have a solution for you\nKnow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider will find you the loan them he writes for\nCall a civilian gets started\nFor you walk out of the door it's that easy check them out on line new mail dot com and you and they alley dot com or give them a call ... won three by zero one six six three six don't be okay with just feeling down and having no energy in your life to get that vigor back revitalized yourself new mail dot com\n[noise] Waco matter\n[noise] news radio nice Seventy ...

evidence of his murder what's the latest we're hearing now bill\nYeah and even that is very confusing Aaron ... because if they do have the audio or video why hasn't anybody heard or seen it yet nobody has been able to access this uh this evidence and over the weekend we heard a report that perhaps he was recorded on his apple watch\nAnd then automatically sync into his phone and sent to the cloud and that's how\nAre they we access this audio well since then or some tech experts have said that highly unlikely are due to the fact that uh you would have to have a Bluetooth connection between your apple watch on your phone and his phone stayed with his fiance in their car some distance away they say there's no way that could have happened so\nThe audio come from does turkey have\nIllegal surveillance equipment inside the consulate of another country\nI mean there are still many questions to be answered now we are making progress today because uh just a word just came out this morning that Turkish and Saudi investigators combined team will be searching the consulate in Istanbul today\nA earlier Saudi Arabia had denied access to Turkish investigators to search inside the consulate\nBut today a joint Turkish and Saudi team will be conducting a search inside their uh where this will lead is anybody's guess but they're still many questions and and many things to that her head scratcher is in this case\nIf the Turkish officials haven't released to the evidence yet where are these rumors coming from wherever they emanating from\nWell there's a just newspaper or media reports in Turkey that have been pretty reliable the bar a that are releasing this information so that's where they're coming from they're just media reports out of turkey at this point a but\nA Turkish officials have yet to comment on whether they what kind of evidence they have or whether they have any evidence at all\nBill given our relationship with Saudi Arabia do we really believe there will be severe punishment if we find out that this was all true\nWell I as soon as the president said that severe punishment or Saudi Arabia shot back and said if there would be sanctions or political pressure by the United states they would respond with even greater action\nAnd the truth is that in this poker game Saudi Arabia is holding a lot of pretty good cards a number one they have a an economic relationship with the United states that included a recent huge\nMilitary purchased by Saudi Arabia or they could simply cut that off the president has already said he wouldn't want to lose that number two is of course their influence in the global oil market\nAs the biggest producer in Pakistan a country that has influence over the other OPEC countries or they could simply\nTweak the global oil supply and even now just on the prospect that there could be tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United states' oil prices are spiking so if they would indeed take some action there there was recently an op ed in the state run media outlet in Saudi Arabia that said\nIf Saudi Arabia decided to do something with the oil market we could see oil go to between one hundred and two hundred
