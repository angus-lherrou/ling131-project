um [noise]\nMichael vow or will be a long hair and a little while and we're going to continue to explore the hurricane which is coming up in the Gulf of Mexico\nAnd [laughter] and then the mean time a couple of other things very interesting here that the new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh has hired more minority clerks\nThen the hero of the left Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did enter entire twenty five years on the bench and I'm\nAccording to this source Kavanaugh's already made his office more diverse than nearly any other in the U.S Supreme Court he hired a black law clerk for his new chambers\nAnd Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nHad one black on her staff in twenty five years it was all she ever at and of course you have turnover among those clerks and he also set a gender composition record because he\nUm well\nSince joining let's see Kavanaugh's new clerks or Shannon ramble Megan Lacey Sarah non and soon and Kim Jackson you'll notice those are all women's names has an all women's clerk's office and normally\nThey say the uh the hiring pattern is to favor white male graduates of elite law schools\nAnd Kevin ... didn't do that and\nAnd you mentioned Ruth Bader Ginsburg think about the work she's done with the ACLU working on women's rights project so to hear that\nA stat net number from from Kavanaugh's camp that's pretty that's pretty interesting you know stick that near abroad Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the other issue yeah\nI'm into it that's that's for the word you knew it was just added a Scrabble comes from my mom would approve she's Jewish\n[laughter] [laughter]\nBut he is the first Supreme Court justice to hire an all female class of clerks course on the other hand now they're going to say that sexist why don't you when you're looking at this as a woman's job being just a clerk I think they'll find something that they don't like about it\nThat a yes it's not good enough for a guy got to be a girl ... but anyway it's\nKind of interesting and and there's a survey out over the Kavanaugh curve folded we had there\nUm well of course Democrats are fundraising off of it\nAnd they're thinking this was going to be a blue wave now than they are going to elect all Democrats on November six but a new Harvard Harris Poll and that's pretty liberal polling data founded sixty nine percent of Americans call the Kavanaugh hearing a national disgrace\nWith fifty five percent agreeing that Democrats were completely partition in their handling of the Kevin all matter it's no doubt how many wonder what other forty five percent thought\nHow many Democrats can hold onto that anger though for a month until they go out to the polls because you're going to have the people that are gonna vote any way but there are Democrats are so they say they're Democrats that might not make their way out to the polls they might forget their anger a month later\nAnd I think the Republicans are properly angrier given what they did the cabin on the way they handled and but a rescue mission poll finds the public agrees the process has become a search and destroy mission that's a term that a cat on a launch used as a matter of fact\nAnd according to the poll analysis most voters think he's right even Democrats are conflicted\nFifty six percent of all voters agreed the nominating was a national disgrace\nAnd that included Seventy seven percent of Republicans fifty one percent of independents and even forty percent of Democrats thought that that was a national disgrace on the way that was handled anyway six Fifteen almost six sixteen and let's go to the news

cannabis\nOr marijuana for health shaken Todd tell us about your company\nAbsolutely a Altman Florida is a Florida owned a business we are one of about fourteen licensed producers of medical cannabis in the state of Florida\nAh we are what's called vertically integrated and that means we cultivate our cannabis and Apollo beach we manufacture our products and we just spent so we do from seed to south\nOf our products are dispensed through our move dispensaries MU V. with a little ... over to you to create a happy face\n[laughter] a little loom lot happy face what's the process been like since the state of Florida voted yes for medical marijuana what's the process been from then until now\nThe good news is we have a program in Florida to provide relief for the hundreds of thousands of patients who need access um it is still involved in program a boat from a regulatory structure and from a operator structure we were one of the second wave of license holders\nAre so some of the original operators had a couple of your head start on us but we have now open three dispenser is to serve patients and Apollo beach Sarasota and just last weekend we opened on north Dale may bring in Tampa the survey patients in the Tampa market\nOr the patient count is over a hundred and thirty five thousand\nCurrently in Florida are about twenty five hundred to three thousand patients are being added every week\nThese are patients that are being prescribed to cannabis for pain and things like that\nAbsolutely uh the state constitution lists Thirteen qualifying conditions a there is also in or statement where your physician or can determine that the use of medical cannabis would be of more benefit than harm and can also a a approve of patient to receive medical cannabis\nAnd it won't be long before recreational cannabis is legal all across the fruit of plane or do you all planning to move into that area is well\nAware of medical cannabis company uh we were founded by people out of the farm and biotech industry\nAnd our focus right now is on simply delivering the highest quality most consistent and most effective medical cannabis products to patients will be opening over twenty five to Spencer is throughout the state of Florida and that's really our focus right now\nWhat's the difference between obviously some other states there smoke marijuana the flower form when does that come into play here in the state of Florida\nThat's an open issue a that's currently in a legal situation in the state of Florida ah smoking flower or candidates buds is not allowed currently in the state of Florida are there are some lawsuits and stay on the lawsuit\nOr to allow that uh we also operate in Arizona where flour and smoking is allowed\nAnd again as the laws change we will deliver the highest quality products including smoke about flour went allowed and that's really you know a part of our business and patients also uh receive some additional and unique benefits from what's called the entourage of fact a cannabis has over two hundred\nActive in an active ingredients\nOr it can ... noise and the action and interaction of all those together or create some unique benefits are only found in smoke about flour\nI've got one question is a little bit off to be in that as a legal nationwide where do you do with all your money\nWhere are you [laughter] well right now we're investing\nIt all in a building our operations but banking is a fresher and issue a there are banks that will do business with you or they keep it very quiet ah we also offer a lot of a digital payment systems for patients within our dispensary so that they don't have to be a you know a hundred percent cash transactions\nAh but banking is a challenge there still you know that disconnect between state law and you know legal medical cannabis programs and legal adult use programs and federal law uh so you know we always have to have a bank or in the background or in case they change their mind and don't want to do business with us anymore\nWell the website is ultimate A.
