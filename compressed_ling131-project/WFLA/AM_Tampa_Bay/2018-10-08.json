it's on the western edge of Cuba about a hundred and Ninety miles south south west of the western edge of Cuba that was as of last night and moving north northeast to three miles an hour\nAnd they say it will become a hurricane by the time it makes landfall so it probably will still not be a full hurricane when it's offshore from us\nNot up to a Seventy\nMiles an hour but it'll be between forty in Seventy and that's still a pretty significant amount of wind and\nGovernor Rick Scott has already declared a state of emergency as a result of this storm and the problem is that when she fears have

meteorologist at ten minutes after six and get the word on what's going to become hurricane Michael and what's going to give us a little bit of weather for sure\nBut in the meantime we'll talk to none hurricane Michael vow or NBC News radio reporter and\nMichael it seems it's over\nWe're now that the um the Kevin ... been sworn in but the Democrats some of the Democrats are a lot of Democrats just aren't given up on this thing\nNo no they aren't even before Kavanaugh one the consent to send to the Supreme Court Democrat and Democrats had already started looking for ways to remove and we know that they're\nA is a an impeachment uh a petition that's out there it's got over a hundred twenty five thousand signatures we know the progressive groups have raised money to expel him from the federal bench and even one democratic lawmakers promised to investigate the judge of the party re takes the house\nIn November and and on the Republican side of course they're handling this is a watershed moment that they hope will propel their party in the mid term so both sides\nUsing this on every single level that they can and have so since even before the swearing and happened to try to see if they can sway voters coming into these November midterms and four and a half\nWell yeah that's the big thing is looking at the midterms as to what impact it's going to have and it seems like it's probably going to inspire both party voters I mean Democrats are going to be trying to get out there so they can take the Senate back or the house and Senate back so they can\nDo something to Kevin all and the Republicans are inspired because of\nWhat the Democrats did saying we can't have that crap going on at the end\nYeah and I think that's the big key here jak 'cause I think that that's what you've seen more you think we we you know we've had conversations about whether this blue wave is coming and what that's going to look like and it's got a presidential even presidential aides being concerned about this blue wave coming in the possibility of Democrats taking back and so on and so forth but I think we're really seeing here in the past you know two to three days has been\nAn onslaught of Republicans saying yeah well listen to were not happy with the way this whole thing went down were not happy with the way you know Democrats tried to push this guy out of here and and really try to harm somebody's reputation without any evidence of that\nAnd that element of things is really starting to get fired up and I think that that's going to propel a good a good amount of people to the voting booth in November and again I think this is going to be without necessarily something that we kind of knew it would be an issue going into the into the midterms in November but I think it's becoming a much bigger issue\nGoing into the midterms in November and like everything else that we've seen in the past year or two in politics this is going to be blown up to a level that people don't ... the intricacies the the nuances that we're a small part of this and and the Kavanaugh hearings are going to be blown up into big elements here going into November\nInto we see the impact though during the midterms this is a huge win for the Trump presidency what was his reaction over the weekend\nAnd then this ... in his particular case talking about cabinet or\nA President Trump said that this was a massive win for the country for the United states of America this was what needed to happen and you're right they're calling this possibly the has the best week that the president has seen from a policy level when you're talking about unemployment and jobs and the economy and then this it does look like it's been his best week that's far so\nAt this point the president's got to be riding high and feeling like he's doing good work and people are seeing that now and clearly a that kind of highlight about the swearing and you're going to have tonight at the White House or the ceremonial swearing in for Kavanaugh and he's supposed to have his first day on the court\nTomorrow where he's going to hear cases involving firearms and immigration\nAre but that's what's going to happen here and it at this point in time it looks very strong for both President Trump and for the Republican Party\nAnd you go to ... like Mazie Hirono who was a believing Dr Ford the senator Mazie I mean she won a very anti Kevin O's and she's who are calling for\nA ... is she still sitting for do you know with the FBI blew the investigation and everything so it's going to go on for a long time so you just did it in about ... below sea\nTrying to get the FBI ah investigation now to be public so uh she is filed paperwork to try to get that happen and try to see if she can get every element of the FBI investigation out for the public to read and I guess on some level that's supposed to help Democrats I'm not exactly sure how about that for a plan\nIn the gate the investigation on though the gate the investigators anyway Michael thanks for joining us on NBC I Want to call him ...
