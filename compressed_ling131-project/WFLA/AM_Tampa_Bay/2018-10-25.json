my big question is this whole thing why we're FBI agents with him in the first place that was going to be my first question here or there has to be something far far deeper than just giving\nHim tickets to the Hamilton or whatever it might be to see\nA Hamilton on Broadway it goes way beyond that also a trip to I think it was Costa Rica and a couple of things like that those things are not that simple I mean\nPoliticians everywhere to gifts like that but the fact that there were FBI agents who were traveling with him and FBI agents that were around them\nThat doesn't happen unless there's something much much deeper than that and yet the FBI says they're not going to\nLet any of this information out until after the election and I'm thinking what what the heck is that all about what's wrong with the FBI\nThey got a major problem they're saying oh Scott kill forty people but we'll wait till after the election let's you know about it within the same thing with the older they did was only invest the oh yeah totally investigation but she did this this this and this and this will do anything about it\nBut maybe that's why they're holding back on this because a lot of people speculate that that impacted the twenty sixteen election that investigation being reopened just weeks before the twenty sixteen presidential election that could've hurt Hillary Clinton now I don't know if they're weighing that weighs into this action\nDoes it impacted not doing it to absolutely so yes they do their job is to do is to do it a job is to find criminal conduct and just say well

that they think may have been set to former vice president Joe Biden\nAnd was incorrectly address so they're trying to track that as well\nSo there could be another one but all of them a saint

all similar uh and I would think that uh the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia ah will do some pretty quick work on these with all of the information they have to work with\nTheir pretty sophisticated bombs in reality\nWell you know they say that they they are sophisticated when you look at the fact that day it involves a digital clock in a battery power sources but they say these are pretty easily attainable meaning you could go on the Internet and find the way to construct this type of bomb that it's not anything that is that\nThe that complicated meaning that it doesn't take an expert bomb maker to put one of these together\nWhat did we hear from President Trump or basically people or you know come together in this time and make sure his politics right now we know how how crazy it is a

you're walking you feel the history\nYeah we couldn't be more excited about this project or I personally in so many people say the same thing I've been driving past this building for the last twenty twenty five years looking into thinking man that would ... why is that not a hotel and I didn't I didn't know the story of the history of the building so when we started getting involved in this ... a project\nOr I I you know I'm I've got goose bumps saying that to you know right now to to bring this grand lady fact of life um and bring back it's music roots is just something we're really passionate about\nAnd when you say music roots quite the jazz place at one time\nYeah it it's a ... uh open up during the jazz ... had his own house a jazz orchestra and jazz band but even before that\nIt opened up as the first radio stations you guys know in in in the county so they had the uh\nUm radio station on the uh on the roof and so we really thought that you know that the history of the building as it is an obvious story but we wanted to bring something in that had a little bit more a soul to it and so our goal is to bring this up a big place back home English so and just full of life music\nHow close is it too when the hotel actually opened in Nineteen twenty seven\nOr the ... the ... the only thing originally the buildings probably the or the stuck on the outside I you know the uh the unfortunate thing is the buildings fell on a very bad a repair and those conversations for probably a decade about tearing it down and building a brand new building\nAnd the city was passionate about keeping this jam and uh so we took that as a challenge so um we we have a nod to the original history and the furniture and the design in the style um uh but uh so we wanted to bring it back to life in the contemporary way\nWhat was the deal with the tai chi people at one time for us to build it yeah\nSo the tai chi people really get the credit for saving this building um they they uh they're based out of I'm trying to Canada and they wanted a Florida warm weather climate for ah for ah for the cold months up there so\nThey bought the building and they were going to just a run it as really a retreat Center for for what they do and then they realized um they weren't going to be using it the majority of the time and so they sought out a a hotel operator and they found us\nAnd so we are we're partners with them and so there'll be using this building as as a convention hotel for their for their programs five times a year\nOh that's neat who's responsible for the rooftop bar and want to shake his hand and get out of Hollywood\nOr I'll get out to get that the joke all your president he had the vision um and and you you you ... you'd have to see it to understand that but I'm\nNot too long ago there was nothing in that building except the next year we had to rebuild the entire ah interior of that\nPut in metal a beams all the way to the roof that that rooftop are doesn't sit on the building actually sets on a on a metal cage that supports the whole thing there was there ... there was nothing from from the dirt to the to the roof and the whole thing was

the state would go for a social [noise]\nThat they're ready for socialism in this state I mean I can understand that and Miami because you've got a lot of people from there that come from other

killings going to do is going to continue to attack runs a census on racist issues and he's going to take the the comment that one comment that runs Assange has made using the term monkey um and in a in a way that you know you'd have to really be in my opinion stretching to make that you know racist away and use this\nCrazy to think he would say something racist like they have to be in any way to be an incredible fool and the\nTruth of the thing is he was obviously using the word like mocking around and he should have said mocking around instead of monkeying around and that makes that makes\nGillum that makes Gillum the races for choice of words absolutely racist I don't think so and that makes that makes them the racist he's the one seeing racism and everything\nAnyway Dr ...

debates I've heard in a very long time I was sitting in the audience and even there is out of control the sad part is true and that didn't have their minds made up\nProbably wouldn't have lasted over ten minutes of that but for the just shouting at and abusive commentary for for the men that each candidate got I can assure you sitting there that ten seconds was something positive and the other fifty seconds left to bash the opponent\nIt really a was\nProbably the worst debate I've ever seen the\nThing we're talking about here this morning is the deal about um about Gillum getting tickets to Hamilton and and taking trips and things like that but\nIt seems way beyond that that if you got FBI agents who are anonymously embedded with uses there must be something more serious than that going on to have FBI agents who are tracking you and and all\nOf that stuff and and they're saying they're not going to talk about it until after the election which is kind of crazy or what are the what do you suspect that he is also suspected up by the FBI\n[noise] well I don't know about that but you know I said it's very equivalent of the white or not saying anything before the election I think he's not going to [noise] um but the bottom line was the two teams in the evening for about corruption and about racism\nAnd frankly there's a lot of other issues that are very important in a state that
