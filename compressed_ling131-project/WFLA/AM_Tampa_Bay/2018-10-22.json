{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "To tell you what do that's quite a bit to chew on their look let them tackle at least the last part of that question a nobody on the ship I mean really no one really knew what it was\nYeah even uh even the cap and didn't know what it was that this was the most closely guarded secret at the entire war and the most highly classified naval mission of the war and so even a even as I said even the captain didn't know what it was only major\nFrom and what it was and his uh his companion happening games now when it was along to monitor the radiation so\nThere was a little chance that a Japan would've known\nAnd I don't know that extra precaution with taken because the ship with traveling so fast almost at thirty not that they cut it out run any Japanese submarine that were to try to target or\nSome funny stories about speculation among the crew about what it might be a because there was a fairly conspicuous package that was delivered there and in fact as you noted in the book the the the uranium the\nThe radioactive part of it ah element was carried on to the ship in a briefcase but there was a lot of funny stories that we are told about what might be in their right to Sarah\nOh yeah I mean again these are teenagers and they have this large crate that delivered which is really a diversion to everything but they brought you know they see this crate come aboard and it's surrounded by a marine guard\nAnd of course there first gas is Rita Hayworth undergarments or scented toilet paper for Douglas MacArthur\n[laughter] no one guest anything close to the bottom [laughter]\nYou know I thought it was a a an odd post script sort of the the ship itself got blamed in the court marshal they were a thrashing around to blame somebody in the ship itself got blamed a ... which you would like to tackle that\nWell they were in effect blaming Indianapolis for her own own demise so in one one case in point is that no distress signal got off the ship\nSo they were saying that that was happening they thought that was the ship fault for getting hit by torpedoes and having her power you know flown out\nI'm also as a treaty cruiser at their mentioned she had a single through back that went uh all the way through a from ... stern and\nEnded in certain cruising conditions in the in the most button that craving conditions the multiplier tight creeping condition that through back then ... minutes off by water type ... heads and hatch is\nBut in order to cruise and hot South Pacific they cruised in a slightly different condition which was called yolk modified and not let some of those kids I'm not the old or in other words not water type that when the ... was blown off the ship\nAnd she was continuing to make way through the water\nSki with just flowing in three that that a long through deck and so um\nThere were a lot of questions in the court marshal about why that was the case why she why she was open like that and because of that because of the questions because of their reporting on those questions\nSome of the families who had last man on the shit I blamed captain they even know keeping that three deck open with standard procedure\nWill try to get one more call in first time caller Jay W you're on with Lynn Vincent and Sarah black talking about the Indianapolis\nWhat's on your mind\nUh I I've

trust trust the poll back in the eighties when I went to school for liberal lunatics took over academia way we had a logistics professor they teach you how to look at the polls objectively like how they were done\nThe whole nowadays I guarantee you if they call a hundred people Seventy percent of them are going to be Democrats that means the polling already conducted in a in a way that they're looking for a result they're looking for an agenda and they're doing everything they can to make sure they get that result so if you look at the numbers that we're looking at now\nIf you're showing this even if he showed a ten point spread that means some of the Democrats in the poll had to vote for it is and isn't the first place that don't even trust the polls and this is what are they just ... back in eighty so they're they have an agenda and is it that the numbers are looking at clearly showed that\nYeah there's no doubt that I'm most polls are left leaning and they want to come up with a left leaning a response and they do it throughout they ask the questions who the question things like that\nThere are a couple of them out there that are fair or maybe right leaning but I'm certainly not many and\nAgain you can't trust the polls are Hillary would be president today and the only poll you can trust his election day course today can't even trust them because of illegal

sent us\nAnd he brought that up last night that was one of ... and that's how you could tell he was going on the offensive he was bringing those things up last night and they were going back to say on his dissent is was yet from the highlights I I was seeing how did he manage to monitor that I'll have to go back and check that out but uh I think he that was the response Gillum have already said you're trying to deflect\nAnd go to something else which\nWhich is what they were both really yeah you just\nPointed out that you're a crook that you've been involved well to quote the story or an ongoing federal probe of alleged public corruption in Tallahassee involving development deals in city hall and this is what gets me though this one really\nCrossed my muggy or former FBI agents don't believe there will be any definitive action on the case\nBefore election day so basically they're going to wait till after the election when Gillum becomes governor then they'll announce solo stuff and then everybody will say well my goodness skills or crook why didn't we know that before November sixth and of course early voting starts today in the Tampa Bay area in\nA ... in Hillsboro in Sarasota into Soto counties all have early voting getting underway today so\nHere's what Andrew Gillum set on raising the minimum wage last night that shouldn't be too much to ask them the state of

T. brown and the lightning when he uh protested and what we did recently with the buccaneer football players and\nAnd I'm very you know is due to the problems that we have police in certain communities and the and I'm very you know try to be aware of that but\nWhen you look at the number bike stops that we do and and then the reality is predominantly number of them are black people\nUm but it is less than one percent of the documented work that we do I mean we've done we did three thousand bike stop so far this year and it has to be illegal stop you have to have a legal reason for stopping a law violation\nUm but you know they say that we're targeting a certain group or just not a a fair assessment when you look at there are racial disparities and everything that we do and police work you know one of the things I brought out that was kind of\nA shock to a lot of people um when you look at our DUI arrest we arrested over a thousand people so far in the city of Tampa for DUI this year\nSeventy five percent of them are white people eighty percent and it's how Tampa the DUI arrest her white people so if you want to say that we're targeting blacks for one thing or we targeting White's for for DUI\nYeah we pointed out to that there are more black bicycle is that you see or at least that's just a personal observation that there\nAre a lot more in when there are a lot more in\nAny race whether it be white or black that they're going to be more the contacts with those\nYeah you know what happens is it sounds obvious but it you know sometimes I think it gets lost on the conversation as you you whoever whatever neighborhood here and whatever that racial background is or economic background that's who you tend to come in contact with\nAnd you know we have a certain neighborhoods where the mode of transportation where they're committing crimes is on bicycles\nAnd that's what we tend to do is stop people that are violating the law or the find out what they're doing\nA misconception is that people think you're just stopping these people they're actually things like not having a bike light or running stop signs being on the wrong side of the road there are factors here to why you pull them over\nExactly there has to be a legal reason we're just not randomly stopping people that have to have some type of violation law violation for us to be able to stop\nThem well the one thing you are targeting is low breakers and that's all I see\nNo you're you're exactly right them but it but a lot of that gets lost in the conversation when when you start throwing things out there and you know I don't want to make police work you know ... it's to me it's not that difficult times the let's be honest you know you you police you know you go fishing and where the fish are in the police were the criminals are\nReal quick I don't want you to call any names up but does your job become more challenging with ... a political elections on the
