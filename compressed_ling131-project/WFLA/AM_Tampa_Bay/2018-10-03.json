actually sectors you but if the man but just keep your mouth shut and make the decision that he's going to make do if you're going to do I would ask him up one hundred percent\nWhen you're like a child if the president I support that and I don't think a lot of other people do either\nWell you do agree with the previous caller and Trump has mouth off for tweeted often gotten himself in trouble before that's his style though and you know what that's what helped get him into the ... got him there yeah Maria in Clearwater what do you think\nThat I disagree with the last caller I like what Trump said he had like it is any that I Know the Americans the truth of what's going on but\nFor this he doesn't know the truth either I mean it's speculation and I think we have to make that we have to determine that for ourselves if we believe as forwarded\nOn us side that is anti Ford and pro Kavanaugh usually either appointed Gavin all so he's going to say bad things about the opposition that's what the Democrats are doing they're saying bad things about Kavanaugh\nRight that that I lied about from polygraph procedure while the significance of that is that she's got a light not one thing she can very well I think [noise]\nYep you're right about that Maria and thanks for your call and I think that's the same thing they're trying to paint or say about Brett Kavanaugh if he can lie about one thing\nYou know you can't ... appoint Hindus yeah right now the new thing is he was a big drunk when he was in college and I'm thinking well are a lot of other people that did that kind of
