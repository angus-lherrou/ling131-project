as a women's typical thing if you believe it or not because it's a it's a little less of a little less of a serious movie although it does\nPretend to be ... times um well let's start with that one anyway the venom starts Tom Hardy as a an investigative reporter who gets a basically a attached to this\nAlien parasites that that that bond with his body and he turns into this somewhat of a superhero he's as big\nMonstrous or a creature that that then is it sort of trying to balance itself in his in his body and go after the other creatures that are from from the aliens\nThat have have come down to earth based on a comic book and the last time people thought was when Spider Man three came out back in two thousand seven I Believe\nUh and and that wasn't done terribly well this one is a I guess a little closer in some ways the comics books but it is a bit haphazard and not quite focused on that as well it it does try and do\nSome goofy things some sort of silly things which I think bring it down a it feels like a superhero movie that was made maybe in the early two thousand you know before the dark Knight and Iron Man kind of changed the game\nI personally have never been into the superhero movies I Know a lot of people are but a a movie I might see speaking of aliens Lady Gaga is in a movie this week that\nIs true yeah you've got to where we sanctioned innately\nHave I Can't decide I Can't decide how I feel that lady Gaga sometimes I'm very attracted to her sometimes she looks like an alien\nOkay well you know hey but\nBad things like sorry continue typical friday night to me but\nI like her music I think she's very talented I I'm I'm sure she's a great actress to\nAn actress and she has very talent are\nBorn which is the fourth time they've made this movie I think the first one was in the thirties and they you know remade it in the fifties and in the seventies\nUm it it is Bradley Cooper directorial debut and if you ever saw the ribs and not the original but the the remake the most recent remake which was in the seventies with Chris christopherson and Barbara Streisand it's very much similar to that one in terms of the story it's about a\nMusician played by Bradley Cooper like his head who also directed it was a self destructive tendencies and he's an alcoholic and he sort of ... he's on the top of his game but his career starting to fly and he falls in love with this ah with this young engineer who's played by Lady Gaga who\nGets her career sort of taking off the same time and their paths are crossing a he's completely self destructive uh she's trying to build her career out of it as well a\nPerfect movie for her Kevin because she gets the singing it\nYeah it's actually quite I mean obviously the singing a really GOOD Music and it's good it's a I'm a\n... you know of course and she's she's gay gives her a chance to really shine a as a thing or it's a much better role than when she was in like machete kills a which I think was profit for them if you've [noise] um\nSo yeah it's a ah it it's emotional movie and it's something that is a you know it's one of those films that that that shows the self destructive nature of some people\nWell the original one was Janet gain or in Nineteen thirty seven and in Nineteen fifty four was Judy Garland and then again in the seventies I don't know did it in but I don't think Lady Gaga to live up to that to those name a little tough little tough for anyway harbor strike\nStand in the last one back in the seventies heard Chris christopherson yeah yeah a lot of buzz around this one uh

and they say counseling centers and hotlines where sexual abuse survivors say they're hearing from people\nWho feel like they've been traumatized again they say the constant barrage of news on TV and radio and social media and in everyday conversations can cause survivors to read a live their own experiences\nAnd they said talk to someone who is safer call the crisis hotline\nAh I hadn't heard of this when there's a crisis hotline to one one\nThat should be available all the time and they said that one in four women and one in six men experienced some form of sexual assault\nAnd they say um you know when you post something on the um\nAny kind of social media that is for many it can be very personal and everything but that those are a lot of people that have gone through but I'm I'm surprised that one out of six men have been sexually assaulted does that by other men or by women are\nI think it's by anybody but\nUh\nI guess a woman can sexually assaulted guy ... are you going to get out and if you don't want it what if she takes you down and she gives it to you don't want it was this coating prison\nAh it's actually a ... as a good question yeah maybe that would be where most of them will be as far as the guys I don't know how a woman could take a guy down and pass Roseanne Barr\n[laughter] I mean think about a jak there might be some men out there that might not want the advances sexually from that one but um well it and then they go ahead and they do it anyway traumatizing from it they would take him\nDown and and uses male\nWho had been chased by women and taken to limit this happens a lot to me oh it does here they everybody says assaulted but they've chased me do it was you know different but they should out I'm so damn good looking jak wrong we connect the dots\nI'm Whitney jak uh but I um\nI don't know if somebody some guy has been assaulted if you're one of those one in six I'd love to hear from you and explain that situation\nAnd it's all just sex because you know with men men have to be a rouse to complete the ... yeah\nThat's what I was thinking if you're getting assaulted and and it's not there you know what are you what she going to do what's not there jazz splint or out of their uh their fans inflatable I don't know\nIt well it depends on in today's terms what they consider as salt it's hard to imagine that well could be I\nThink you're hot you've just assaulted me\nOr something like that assault all day yeah never heard of before in my life but if we got a guy out there who has\nBeen assaulted by a woman I Want to I think the sheer shows they acted the difference between men and women how men feel and how women feel you do you're thinking to yourself how is it possible that a man can be sexually assaulted by a woman I could\nSee maybe by another guy or in in prison like Jeff was saying\nBut by experience them a lot of hope not [laughter] and Katie or do you know women who have you ever been in jail even water for
