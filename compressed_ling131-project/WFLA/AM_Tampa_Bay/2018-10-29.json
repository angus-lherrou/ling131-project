reporter and the investigation of course continuing on\nThe shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue and of course the pipe bombs Mayo last week and it's been a pretty violent or near violent weekend Michael\nYeah uh uh on many different levels and and it's gotten it it's it's gotten people into a shaky ground element here heading into this week you gotten a gunman who enter the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh Saturday morning opened fire killing ... eleven people six people in addition injured among them for police officers\nAnd this individual um isn't fair condition has been named\nUh and it's going to be in court today FBI agents say that he did not appear to be known to authorities prior to events on Saturday he was isolated he kept to himself he was an awkward guy who lived alone and struggled with according to a intelligence report your basic human interactions\nSo hum while he was quiet on a face to face level when he was on line in that case of sort of having Internet muscles he was viewing murderous hatred and bigotry for months before the shooting he was a ... of anti immigrant anti Jewish conspiracy theories on a website or at least a\nA social media hub known as gap I was unfamiliar with it but when I went to go look at it I was disgusted at the social media network they'd been raised by white nationalist it was it with me that there was a lot of hate on Twitter and Facebook you haven't seen anything until you went to this which has now been pulled down and technically the people that were hosting aside\nA told the people gathered needed to find somebody else a with a host host them and according to reports today that people who run gab are saying that they will find a place for the continuation of freedom of speech on some level\nYeah I I thought the gab was just more of a right wing social medium or because you've got Twitter and Facebook which are very left wing and they've been basically banning a lot of conservative talk on there and I'd set a long time ago somebody needs to start a conservative social medium\nAnd ... gab was apparently gab is not something like that but\nIt seemed to be that that was the direction they weren't actually starting on and then within a nine month timeframe had become completely embraced by white nationalist like that became their place uh to do business and became a place to to have their voices heard a with others and and and and I guess if you have to look at some sort of a similarity\nHere because you have to completely individual and you're looking at this person out of the pipe bomb suspect oh this guy the shooter in Pittsburgh\nNot a fan of President Trump that President from needed to be more extreme in here to do it needs to be tougher on situations that he was so he was not a fan of President Trump's you look at the pipe bomb suspect who was allegedly a huge fan of President Trump's the two things that these guys have in common seemed to be maybe even three uh seemed to be the usage of social media\nOr the second part of that is that it seems like that was their only social life on either one of their house and the third one is the conspiracy theories that were used ... and it would seem as though that seems to be a big portion of what fired them up and the places that they were visiting this this\nGap networking and other places like it even for the pipe bomb guy seemed like Twitter and Facebook were big places for them to show these kinds of\nConspiracy theories stories and let's face it the president hasn't done a whole lot to sort of downplay those conspiracy theories right now I'm so maybe that's an element of this that is probably the the more concerning and if you had a tiny thing in together that might be the rich are giving to\nWinning gums comes to the uh the pipe bombs were hearing some you know stories that they were defective we're hearing some stories that you know they had acted bomb components ... which one is it Michael according\nTo FBI Director Christopher Wray are referring to the Thirteen bombs as I age he says the press conference if they were trying to determine at that point whether these devices were functional so they're trying to figure out if they actually are actually regardless of that\nThey were explosive devices they could've exploded in the right situation they were made with the desire of an explosion at some point now whether that was a trigger devices that would do it whether it was he would do it or some other form of charge they were ready to explode and according to Christopher rain this was as quote these were not hoax devices\nWell interestingly I was noticing what the um he is they've got twenty nine charges against Bowers and he was the guy that up in Pittsburgh that killed eleven but eleven count of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death\nThose are the charges against him not just killing people but that's kind of bizarre but anyway\nA lengthy phrase to say hate crime is what a come around and that's why you're looking at attorney general Jeff Sessions saying that these are possibilities of of of um including the death penalty you could have twenty nine different charges of death penalty causes against this guy\nYeah for sure all anyway Michael thank you for joining us on a um Tampa Bay this morning we'll talk to you later\nYou
