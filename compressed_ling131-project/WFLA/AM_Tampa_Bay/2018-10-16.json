... and the question but President Trump and his administration will be are they willing to accept that explanation but that he is unconventional Saudis on commenting on it but but yeah that that they have to there's going to be an internal investigation into suggested in these unconfirmed reports is that\nThey are perhaps ready to say that this was an interrogation gone wrong\nWell don't ever be

News radio reporter and talking about President Trump who is pretty busy and one of the situations facing him right now Michael is this situation was Saudi Arabia up on the air and the death of that journalist\nAh what do you think's gonna happen there\nThat's a great question because things are changing so rapidly things where we're hearing different things right so we had a we know this two weeks ago the journalists Jamal soggy disappeared and we know that that was entering his country's constantly as temple and then we're hearing that there are some reports that there's audible proof of him\nBeing tortured and killed thanks to his eyes apple I watch uh the worst of waiting for that to come out now what we know is that President Trump had a twenty minute phone call\nWith the Saudi king yesterday and then kind of parrot in what the king had said which he said he didn't want to get into the king's mind but it sounded like the king was saying that there could have been some rogue killers somebody off the books that had nothing to do with any sort of a religious or on some level at least\nAssociated with the king a political element that he was aware of and that the president said we don't know what we're going to get to the bottom of the show which I think is very important the president has said from the get go there all these theories out there but he's also saying we're going to get to the bottom of it we're conducting an investigation so he set my palm pale\nOut to uh to go visit the salaries so interesting here\nMike Pompeo's visit was about Fifteen minutes\nWith the king that's all fifty it took us long it would take you and I longer to talk about last night's baseball game I think than their investigation did a vet said Saudis talked yesterday about how they were going to acknowledge\nThe death of the journalists and that was a result of a botched interrogation and we're still waiting for that statement to come out so we've been waiting years since the better part of yesterday afternoon to see if they're going to be releasing statement exactly what is in that statement and whether or not they are admitting to the death of a journalist that happened on the grounds of their consulate\nBy the way it was a great baseball game last night I why don't we have half the game why do I feel like the Saudis are behind the scenes right now going how do we come up with a reason for why we did we need to have an Asian that\nFar off that I don't because I think they're probably waiting to see 'cause listen to the other part of this that happened yesterday was that you had a Turkish investigators showing up at the constantly getting ready to conduct a DNA testing and looking to see blood samples all that stuff and then what we heard from them two things one is as it were arriving a cleaning crew was coming out of the conflict which is\nYou never want to see that when you're trying to look for evidence and DNA and then on the other side of that one of the walls had been painted recently inside the consulate as well so they started taking like soil samples from outside of the house they started or from outside the causal they started taking\nThis good gates off of the hinges on took that with them about this study for DNA so they're they're trying to look for evidence and I'm Wondering if the Saudis are waiting to see in this game what it is that the Turks tell them they were able to find or release on information wise before they're willing to admit to anything because it they're like\nOh they found blood okay yeah you know what it was a botched interrogation it got a little bloody there was some fighting going on there no ... little hitting going on like what are they willing to admit to your once they find out what the evidence\nThey have like a board of excuses in scenarios ready to go to circulate off they're like okay we felt\nWe got blood were good we have these multiple excuses we can go to all they found hair are that's going to be a little bit more challenging but we've got some answers for that as\nWell let's hope it doesn't cause conflict between us and the Saudis we said earlier we need them in trying to\nKeep that Iran and Iraq under control not to mention we kind of need their oil so there's a couple of things they got a hold against us and Michael thanks for joining us on
