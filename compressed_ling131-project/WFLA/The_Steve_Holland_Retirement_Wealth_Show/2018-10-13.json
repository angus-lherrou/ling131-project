F. T. S. A. B. C. action news twenty eight Sundays at five thirty also W T S P that CBS tend news Saturday morning at five thirty and of course WFL a news channel eight NBC Sundays\nAt eleven thirty is the we're talking about some of the most important assets that we have for retirement and you have a list of ten tell me what is one of those intangible assets that we can bring into retirement\nThis one vegan so important this can go a long long way towards dictating how your retirement actually goes um and that is of course something we all want it is so high on the list and that is your good health\nYou know people spend a great portion of their lives working and saving towards retirement\nAnd once you're done working one of the assets that you're going to rely on to enjoy the next stage of life is your health and I certainly certainly hope that you have a wonderful health and retirement\nThat's so important so the goal is to have a reasonable amount of wealth plus the good health\nAgain having the time to enjoy the wealth that you've ... you've created that's the bottom line it it it truly is and while there are certain things about your health\nThat you can't control you know you know what I'm referring to genetics you know some people [laughter] I had a client she oh my gosh Megan she she lived to age Ninety eight and she smoked like\nHalf a pack of cigarettes every day why no it was it was incredible I mean I mean she kind of talk like this but [laughter] but she was a great lady and um\nShe just had great genetics you know she really did um I remember this other clients that I had I loved her dearly oh my gosh I miss her her name was asked her\nAnd asked her always had a joke for you I mean all the way up until you know the final couple of months before she passed but there's one thing that Esther had\nIn addition to good health she had a great attitude a great attitude and I would say to her when she would come in for an appointment I say Esther how are you and she'd say Steve and she put her finger out she say it's a great day to be vertical\n[laughter] great life Montreal yeah is\nShe would say that all the time great day to be vertical and um\nYou know I I Can't stress that enough in this one of course is so obvious it really is um having good health\nBut I'm going to give you some advice because as many of my listeners though I've been doing this for a long long time I've seen a lot of retirees sadly come and go and I don't mean come and go meaning they open an account and then they they transfer their money out into three five years I mean that they open an account\nThey stay and stay we become great friends and then you know eight ten twelve Fifteen Years later they pass on and um my advice is simply this this is as vice\nThat my dad always would mention to us six kids growing up he would say turn off the TV turn off that TV you'll never learn anything from that idiot box [laughter]\nSo not are not really the advice was turn off the TV but get out of the chair get off the couch move move move\nClients that I've seen over the years who do not stay active well I'll tell you the the outcome is really not good so please do not take your good health\nFor granted make sure that if you're retired or even close to retirement they sure you see the doctor bare minimum once a year\nRemember don't have that philosophy if it ain't broke I ain't gonna fix it nothing's wrong when they I feel great there's no reason to go to the doctor make sure you get a check up I I tell most of my clients yeah you should be seeing a doctor twice a year just to make sure so don't\nI'm simply ignore your good health um it's a gift\nAnd um it's a gift you want to cherish obviously a for as long as you possibly can\nYou know the wise old Albert Einstein one said\nThe only source of true knowledge is experience experience I mean think about it from a minute I'm you know we have experienced gained in the trenches fighting market battles day in day out I um\nI remember sitting in my office on September eleventh\nThe year was two thousand one that was the day that threatened our great country that obviously was a really bad day\nBut I Lived through that and I helped my clients through it\nAnd I'll tell you for Thirty years now I've helped client at their client family after family after family protect their wealth and invest brutally making sure that their taxes are properly managed making sure that they they have the correct\nHealthcare strategy to get them to and through retirement remember retirement as easy anyone can retire stain retired\nThat's the tough part if you would have like some help on retirement planning you've got a lot of choices we all know that\nBut just like anything in life if you can hire an expert if you can hire someone that is truly seasoned someone who's been doing what they do for a long long time\nYou might get a little bit more knowledge you might get a little bit better advice I encourage you to
