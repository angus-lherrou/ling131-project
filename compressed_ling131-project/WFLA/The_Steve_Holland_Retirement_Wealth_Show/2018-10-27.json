the recalls done\nAnd the reason I mentioned that is must adjust to expand the recall to about a hundred and fifty thousand vehicles so I Know he's got a lot of miles to listeners out there\nOr if you've got a two thousand and ten through two thousand and twelve see X. seven to two thousand and ten through two thousand and Fifteen see X. nine\nAnd a twenty ten through twenty Thirteen miles to six some of those vehicles have been added to the recall list give us a call it the dealership check it out the wonderful thing with Mazda\nIs they've got parts available\nSo we can take care before even if you didn't buy your Mazda Tyrone square miles you can still bring it to us we'd be honored to take care of it for you there's no cost will give you a loan or car to use while the while the airbags being replaced and for everybody else out there\nDoesn't matter if you're driving afford it doesn't matter if you're driving a Mercedes a Toyota Honda Nissan a Chevy a Chrysler product most every manufacturer was affected by the ... the airbag recall\nAll you've got to do is you know go to safer cars dot Gov or just look up national Highway Traffic Safety Administration look on recalls put in your vehicle identification number if you'd cars part of that recall take it in get it taken care of that could mean life or death of God Forbid you're in an accident\nOr it really is and Florida is one of the states that you really need to be worried about it because what causes these airbags to malfunction is for heat and humidity which Florida's a heat and humidity state\nBecause of the ammonium nitrate in there to degrade and like I say in the case that airbag explodes vehicle comes out in an accident the canister that holds the propellant which is made out of metal can actually break apart and sent shrapnel out there and people have died not because of the accident because of their airbag deployment\nAnd it's a free it's free repair so please get a get it done a Mazda right now they're working with the state of Florida\nJust came through I think with the state of Maryland and other manufacturers of working with state with state organizations now to make it part of a\nLicense plate renewable that they'll sending you recall information and there are some states that will not let you\nAh get your car re registered until you get the airbags replaced and Florida is going to be one of those states it's going to start sending notices out\nWhen there's when you've got an open recall but if you've got a card check it if you're not sure how to give us a call it the dealership give me your vehicle identification number I'll be more than happy to look it up and like you know again it doesn't matter what brand of card is everybody is affected by it\nGet it taken care of any wait time for our last break we're going to do that real quick and we'll be back with more square talk on cars\nAll ... all over all the beltway register online at all\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the eight\nFive times the most iconic brand into booming cannabis industry just went public joined me I peeled now tied time in bed [laughter]\nAnd then it didn't pay your next chance to win a thousand bats coming up tomorrow at six am I Nine Seventy ... ballet\nBack Tampa Bay you're listening to square talk on the cars with you too very best friends in the car business go ahead Randy [noise]\nRandy ever answer earn extra\nYes or talking to your phone they can hardly hear you anyway yeah it's weird that having in the studio here but listen very carefully Randy\nCause you heard me talked before about the five hundred thousand dollars you know four hundred and some odd thousand dollars you know for the uh GT or Marilyn Monroe Z for thunder bird and occasionally you know you and I talk about you know maybe investing in some sort of a collector car\nRight you know and I don't know neither one of us can make it into those others you know talking four hundred and Ninety nine thousand dollars and things but I I think I came across something that just might work for is\nWhat the\nI don't know maybe this might be a good investment you know I don't know if you know it or not but hot wheels there'd been celebrating their fiftieth anniversary this year\nAnd more to the celebration they re released like five of the original sixteen cars that\nHot wheels had I guess originally that came out they were sixteen cars but they released five of the original sixteen cars and they were packaged in like an ... an replica of the original packaging with a spectra flame paint and red line tires\nSo you know die hard collectors 'cause that's a big collectible you know hot wheels are huge him\nYou know they they you know it was pretty neat thing\nBut a hot wheels just came out with something else and I don't know might be something good to invest in they came out with an impressive rep replica for diehards of distorted display from Nineteen sixty eight with all sixteen cars\nAnd it's like a big beautiful display it's full size and they say it would look perfectly at home like it a contemporary national car show\nThe cars each each one of the sixteenth cars or sit on their own platforms that ark and rise above them\nAnd there's a little city skyline in the background to complete the looking at and it's also a special in it that includes all sixteen reproductions of the original cars so not all of those were available right now\nAnd the display even comes with the little drawer to put the cars away if needed so they say it's only extremely limited availability maybe I shouldn't be talking about this on the radio they say they're only going to make cars they're\nGoing to make Fifteen hundred of them there'll be offered to hot wheels a redline club members first starting on November sixth and then ... thirty six hours later people with hot wheels collectors accounts will be able to purchase it if you haven't been sold\nAnd they're going for five hundred bucks I don't know if it is maybe but you know now that I'm thinking of a I kind of let the cat out of the bag and we'll have a lot of competition out there\nOf the problem is that they'll probably start to you know after the thousand they'll announce that they're going to make another two hundred more\nWell that's the only on to Ford's [laughter] and then somebody's got his own and said wait you're only going to make a thousand of these things but it is a pretty neat looking thing I'm looking at the display and Scott ramps and it's it's it's neat yeah I Would imagine you buy that for five hundred bucks keeping packaged up and hold onto it for ten or Fifteen Years and\nMaybe but then again there are people who thought that was beanie babies didn't they\nJust true boy was that not a\nCrazy thing that when he cabbage patch dolls and beanie babies\nYour average patch though my daughter's still has her cabbage patch doll from thirty six years ago\nThey still got a whole collection of care bears\nThat she alright what\nGoes to show you were growing up kids anyway um got only a couple of minutes left or by the way we've got\nSo many Mazda owners listening out there and I don't know as they tell you when it comes to incentives and things like that we never know nobody does the manufacturers never tell you what's going to come out in the next month 'cause they're always trying to pack and as many sales or they can before but Mazda owners if you own a fourteen or newer Mazda\n\nAnd you've been thinking a little bit about maybe getting into something new I Would encourage you to do something\nBetween now in the end of the month and you know me I never saw I always say the best time to buy a new cars when you're ready\nBut Mazda traditionally has had five hundred dollars owner loyalty for your Mazda owner you come back by another ... you get an automatic five hundred dollars on top of anything else this month first time I've ever seen it they increase the loyalty to seven hundred and ...\nThe dollars and if you're trading in the fourteen or newer Mazda they will give you an additional five hundred dollars trading bonus\nSo that's twelve hundred and fifty dollars and let's say you were looking at Mazda six on a sport or Tory model there's two thousand dollars customer cash on that car that's three thousand two hundred and fifty dollars\nEven on a six nine you've got the same two thousand dollars ought to see X. five you've got a thousand dollars at twelve fifty it's a good time to do something\nPlus like I say we've got one point nine percent financing on most recourse anyway this hour has flown by is not quite as fast as it normally goes when you're sitting here with me Randy it just seems to go faster\nBut to go pretty quick I\nDid but go visit Randy to St Petersburg international folk festival it's at the north part come visit us at the dealership if you're thinking about buying a car put us on your shopping list things are ugly out there hopefully they caught this bomber and there's no more out there\nI'll see

down and bonds with a longer majorities in bonds with a lower quality tend to come down even faster so that's really important\nSo many investors are told today that hey bonds are you're safe haven bonds are safe investments and we tend to disagree right now ah we tend to look at bonds and say hey you better be really careful because the one in States Army he did about three four separate

and then bam I hit everybody with or whatever and they say\nOh no I haven't thought about that one and I apologize in advance but here's an important one what if your Social Security benefits get reduced right smack in the middle of your retirement\nAnd that's not a very happy thought at All right Megan that\nAt all yeah that makes people think like oh great you know Social Security is the majority of my income in retirement\nUm so this was a really important one while Social Security financial outlook is filled with uncertainty certainly we can only predict that the benefits maybe lower than expected\nNow this reduction in benefits maybe contributed actually to the worker to beneficiary ratio today which is actually about three to one when compared to a ratio of Fifteen to one when the program started back in Nineteen thirty five\nOr you look at those odds and you look at those numbers and say wow that's\nThat's pretty scary how can this be sustainable so this is why we

steam Holland dot com Sistine if there's a gap in coverage what other sources of guaranteed income could we be considering\nWhile another source of um guaranteed income is in a lot of investors think they know how this works and most of them don't and that is a having some money go into an annuity\nBecause when you're retired knowing that a set amount of your income is going to cover essentials every single month\nIs really really important and so the problem with a new it is is that everyone thinks they know exactly how they work and I got to tell you they're usually wrong\nThis is what most people think Megan okay I'm going to give my money to an insurance company they're going to give me monthly income and if I die they're going to keep all my money and\nYou know we look at that and say no that's not what they do that's not what we do that is a very old outdated piece of information most insurance companies don't even do that anymore\nUm another concern that we have there are some a financial advisor are out there that say oh you know these are bad they're all bad and I say really that's that's kind of like saying all automobiles on the road are bad\nThat's just ridiculous\nThe fact of the matter is very simple you may need to supplement um a portion of your portfolio to create an additional income source remember\nRetirement is not about your net worth no that doesn't matter at all retirement is truly about monthly sustainable\nInflation adjusted untaxed advantaged income income that will be there to de income will that will be there in five years ten

lose money to the stock market\nThe type that we like have very low to know hidden\nFees and inside so you don't have to worry about\nGoing into an annuity that has a lot of crazy fees because we

initial deposit plus the interest that it made its refunded right to your family right to your beneficiaries that's a quick overview on the type of annuities I use\nAnnuities are called a guaranteed
