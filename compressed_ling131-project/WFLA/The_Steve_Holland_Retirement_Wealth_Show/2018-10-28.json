should handle your money we talk about that every single week and ship it gives you frustrated gets me frustrated\nI Want to take a moment I Want to talk about what someone could actually do with the capital they have I Want to talk about the market I Want to talk about trading as a business you know\nFirst hand that people can do this as a business the average person doesn't think they're smart enough let's talk about it I don't think of the American dream build a business have equity on something you know have a piece of it most people trade their time for money many of you driving down the road right now you have a salary or an hourly wage and if you don't go they stop paying you\nNew trade your time for money and successful people entrepreneurs people that become elite in life financially leach they typically build a business they go out and start something and what's great about that is that there's a lot of you probably have businesses that you own your business and your business zones you your small business owners you know exactly what I'm Talking about\nI see it every day and I constantly seeing the God does is typically get behind that guy with letters on the top of his job because I talk about him every week there's somebody driving down the road right now the letters on the top of their truck who's a contractor who's a self employed individual who's the last one to get paid is chasing as money's good employees you can't count on it is amazing and think about this\nThing about if you could have the results of that business without the headaches and I'm not saying that trading and investing as a business without headaches what I'm saying is this\nMagic if you get a business with no employees no overhead are very low overhead no liability insurance 'cause you're not dealing with people's property\nAnd I've been worried about customers 'cause they're online you can literally post something and every time you want to sell something there'll be somebody to buy it every time you need to buy something if somebody wanted to sell it to you but if you didn't have to deal with worker's comp or leasing a building or inventory housing selling products are recruiting people think of that and imagine if you had no limit on the profitability other words the cap was off\nYou can make as much as possible that's the dream\nThat's trading and investing seats of business and if you understood as a business you treat like a business you can get business results and I've met lots of people that have built wealth and the financial markets because they treat like a business and the masses don't understand that it could be set up as a business treated like a business put in a few hours a week and watch what happens then here's the key folks\nThis is the land of opportunity is that the land of a secure job with benefits yet most everybody you know it's a secure job with benefits and how secure that job and what is it really going to get you how many people do know who are wealthy because of their four one K. I'm Talking well I'm Talking two three four million dollars a net worth not\nHalf a million or two hundred thousand and four one K. cars that money will run out if you don't measure will I'm Talking about true well I'm Talking about top one percent or\nVery rarely does somebody build wealth and a four one K. if ever imagine if you had a business where you could build well without all the traditional headaches of a typical business or you can take advantage of the enterprising process of the American dream in entrepreneurial spirit go get it rugged individual is when we talk about that a lot the rug and individual and bill something in the great thing is the market's\nA way to do it exactly champion you know what the person out there that is working a job the person out there is not financially happy\nThey do want to do something different they do want to own a business in the best part about the financial markets I've seen some of the best traders investors I Know they start on a shoestring just a couple of thousand dollars to get into account open they learn a skill set over a period of time and it turns into a major business do you do need to have a ton of capital you have some desire and a willingness to learn\nAnd the sky's the limit exactly an online trading academy to sponsor bulls and bears they understand a lot of people out there they want to own a business they already own a business they're trying to take it to the next level\nHaving multiple streams income is paramount and trading is a business and that's why they have a class called trading as a business now have your brand new to the market you don't even know where to begin you don't know where to get started\nOr you've been in the mark and you don't have consistent results this is the key thing for you this is a five hundred dollar class how ready to campus trained as a business from our sponsor online training academy we're gonna take callers Fifteen to thirty pick up the phone right now called aid for four or five on trade that's eight four for\nTo our finances meaning there are forces that can boost your financial portfolio but also there are opposite in equal forces and we're going to call those the what ifs today and those can bring your finances down\nThough with all that in mind the we gotta talk about this you're going to walk us through some of that did financial strategies to protect our retirement against these very common ... so we need to get the ball rolling here or maybe since we're talking Newt and you've got to get the apple rolling Steve ... [laughter] that's\nRight of course so like a law of nature I'm Megan the important thing for everyone to know the water is or not really want us there actually are more of a ...\nUm for example the stock market it will go down it's there's no what it's about it to you know no tree grows to have and everything that goes up will come down prices will go up prices will go down\nAnd of course we uh we we look at every single one of these contingencies like for example I'm too old and I can't take care of myself\nWell that's not going to be or whatever it's going to be a win\nAnd again Meg and there's there's so many of these so many of these and I think the real big difference is\nAh the difference between a good advisor and a great advisor or good advisor talks about the stock market talks about things you can invest in and that's about it a great advisor really is the type that says\nHey wait a minute we got a plan for some what ifs here because they will happen\nAnd it's not just about your investment portfolio there's many other things that we have to have to take into consideration I'm you know a real important one right now is uh what if interest rates continue to rise\nUm the risk of rising interest rates is that of course bond prices are going to move continue to move in the opposite direction of the rate or the coupon that we call it that's tied to the bond product\nSo as rates go up on prices go down and bonds with a longer majorities in bonds with a lower quality tend to come down even faster\nSo that's really important so many investors are told today that hey bonds are you're safe haven bonds are safe investments\nAnd we tend to disagree right now ah we tend to look at bonds and say hey you better be really careful because the one year the three years a five year with most of the big bonds you know you can look at the bond fund of America\nWith the American funds you can look at van guards or a total bond index you can look at him goes total returned bond fund and many other very very pop your funds they're down two to three percent already this year\nAnd they're down two to three percent over the past three and five years so this is one of many many things that we look at uh in our list here Megan of what is\nA lot of what has to think about and I want to know how we actually protect ourselves against some of the stuff's Steve let's start with interest rates there on the rise\nThey certainly are and again this is problematic because rates go up bonds go down you know Nineteen eighty to all\nThe way up until about two thousand\nSeventeen we saw interest rates do one thing they were really high and they came down and they came down lower and lower and lower and lower and when that happens the value of bonds go up so a lot of investors thought it was very good to have a\nDiversified financial portfolio of stocks and bonds in addition to cash in cash equivalence and today\nThe word of caution from the ... group is be careful with your bond allocations because you may be losing money every single day\nRemember Megan a couple of years ago we were talking about cash accumulation and having money too much money in cash and we used to jokingly say yes cash is the same thing as going broke safely and\nYou know we looked at the bond market now when we say because of rising interest rates we see the similar outcome you're going broke safely inside your bond portfolios they're not giving you the safety that you once um that you were once receiving so\nGot to be real careful what do you do about it well here's what you do you get control get control of your financial future all you have to do take out your phone right now and tax one word\nTax the word retire that's right ... the IRA\nThat were directly over to the following phone number four seven four seven four seven okay so Meg and I want to I Want to mention one thing because this was coming up we do this every single year\nSeveral years ago as you know we lost our our son in law and our son in law was a soldier in the United States Army he did about three four separate different chores or Afghanistan and Iraq and and ah he saw a lot of combat and um several years ago he took his life\nUm stop soldiers suicide wants everyone to know that the facts are\nAre horrifying that twenty two veterans on average lose their life every single day so soft soldiers suicide is the first national civilian not for profit organization\nThat is dedicated to preventing active duty and veteran suicides again every day about twenty two veterans\nTake their lives so\nSunday November eleventh we're going to have our five K. run we have this every year in honor of sergeant Eric land and my son in law who again passed away a few years please come out and meet may come out and meet my\nMy wonderful bride Elizabeth and um my daughter's Rachel will be there and a leash of course come out and meet my grandkids as well\nUh we are

number on your retirement savings find out how to protect your assets against two more bigger than\nIt's my name on the door you but I Want things done a certain way every idea has to be best for the client\nYou know back when I first got into this business financial advisors were mostly tied to those big name companies they have that broad name recognition but they were restricted in the products and services that they could offer\nI just didn't want to do things that way so even though people weren't exactly knocking my door down at first I knew in the long run being independent would help me

the next one that will bring us a little bit of concern\nYeah I Know I'm I'm kind of like the Debbie Downer of this radio show [laughter] like\nUh we we talk show we try to talk positive in all the positive things you can do and then bam I hit everybody with or whatever and they say\nOh no I haven't thought about that one and I apologize in advance but here's an important one what if your Social Security benefits get reduced right smack in the middle of your retirement\nAnd that's not a very happy sought it All right Megan that\nAt all yeah that makes people think like oh great you know Social Security is the majority of my income in retirement\nUm so this is a really important one while Social Security financial outlook is filled with uncertainty certainly we can only predict that the benefits may be lower than expected\nNow this reduction in benefits maybe contributed actually to the worker to beneficiary ratio today which is actually about three to one when compared to a ratio of Fifteen to one when the program started back in Nineteen thirty five\nOr you look at those odds and you look at those numbers and say wow that's\nThat's pretty scary how can this be sustainable so this is why we like to make the most of this benefit so this crazy thing called retirement planning this is my life this is what I Do you know I I jokingly say that here at the Hollander we retire about five times every single week\nAnd we love it we absolutely love it our goal is to help you\nTo help you feel confident about your retirement plans\nAnd you may not feel confident until you're really sit down with somebody who knows what they're doing don't go to a typical broker a bank or a financial advisor go to a specialist someone who's thinks of every single contingency in reference to your retirement\nCome here sit down with us at the ... group will give you a free consultation and we'll review everything that's important to you call us right now seven

welcome to check out ask steam Holland dot com so Steve if there's a gap in coverage what other sources of guaranteed income could we be considering\nWell another source of um guaranteed income is in a lot of investors think they know how this works and most of them don't and that is a having some money go into an annuity\nYou see when you're retired knowing that a set amount of your income is going to cover essentials every single month\nIs really really important and so the problem with a new ... is that everyone thinks they know exactly how they work and I got to tell you they're usually wrong\nThis is what most people think Megan okay I'm going to give my money to an insurance company they're going to give me monthly income and if I die they're going to keep all my money and\nYou know we look at that and say no that's not what they do that's not what we do that is a very old outdated piece of information most insurance companies don't even do that anymore\nUm another concern that we have there are some a financial advisor are out there that say oh you know these are bad they're all bad and I say really that's that's kind of like saying all automobiles on the road are bad\nThat's just ridiculous\nThe fact of the matter is very simple you may need to supplement um a portion of your portfolio to create an additional income source remember\nRetirement is not about your net worth no that doesn't matter at all retirement is truly about monthly sustainable inflation adjusted untaxed advantaged income income that will be there to de income will that will be there in five years ten years Twenty years down the road so\nAn annuity here's a quick overview an annuity is a product that's offered by an insurance company the type that we like our non variable annuities so you can't lose money to the stock market\nThe type that we like have very low to know hidden\nFees inside so you don't have to worry about\nGoing into an annuity that has a lot of crazy fees because we don't use them but what we do want is a type of investment\nThat says I'm ready when you are do you need income and thirty days or do you need income and two years five years from now we're ready when you are will turn on that income stream you'll have a guaranteed\nFor life if you pass away it'll go to your surviving spouse if surviving spouse passes away if there's money left over from your initial deposit plus the interest that it made its refunded right to your family right to your beneficiaries that's a quick overview on the type of annuities I use", "year": "2018",
