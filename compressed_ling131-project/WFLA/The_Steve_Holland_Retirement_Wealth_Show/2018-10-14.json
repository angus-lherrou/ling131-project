that a person can use\nTo get them where they need to go in life\nYou know things that have value and again as you just mentioned we're not talking about just money money is obviously very very important in a according to every single client I have it's a lot more fun to retire with money than without so that's a obviously a\nNo brainer but an asset um it can be tangible something that you can actually touch and of course it can be intangible something that\nYou can't really see 'em it's a conceptual yet it has defined value if you will so both concepts are represented on the list of valuable retirement assets that we're going to share\nOn the today show and if you're just joining us again we're going to talk about\nTen of the most valuable assets\nFor your retirement and how to maximize them\nSo the first one that will talk about is tangible bricks and mortar if you will or water stone in steel concrete and that asset of course is\nYour home where you reside and if you own your home of course then you call it your dwelling\nA along with any other any other real estate holdings that that you might have 'em\nFor many people a home is probably the most valuable asset\nThat they're going to bring into retirement\nUh especially if you you have a a a mortgage that has been um all paid up you know you're all paid up you're done you're in retirement now and you're free and clear\nThat's very very valuable we often say that when you get to retirement you want to make sure that your free and clear of all deaths if at all possible\nAnd and that is of course I'm even their free time it's going to be a year or two down the road as you can possibly swing it that's very important so you of course I Want to make the the the right decisions you've got to you've got some important choices\nTo maximizing the value of your assets and again we're talking about the first one your dwelling your home where you reside and are there are several different things you can
