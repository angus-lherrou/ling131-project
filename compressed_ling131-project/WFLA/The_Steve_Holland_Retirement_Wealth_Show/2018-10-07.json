M. sixteen K at day your next chance to win a thousand dollars coming up tomorrow it's six oh six AM on nine Seventy WFL away\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nWelcome back the bulls bears have it's a blast over to the head over to Facebook Like is that ... radio see some of the bloopers behind the scenes and some of the educational stuff yeah there's mostly bloopers [laughter]\nSee what has always made me like that but you know or the stuff that doesn't make the production is ... does it is it worth your making the production of as a lot of there's a lot of fun to go watch his head over there like us on Facebook a check in with us if you ever in the academy you know of the studios of ... and ... we've got a lot going on so excited to have you listen to us and\nWe're really making that big social media push to try to get the word out\n... one of the things that we always talked about um bulls embarrasses understand that the financial markets is not a game it's not a hobby\nIt uh it it can be a business they can pay as a business you know early we're talking about trading for income trading as a business truly setting us up where you can receive monthly income where you can get the tax deduction or you can do this where you can build your business for you and your family that's what I Want to talk about I Want to talk about how someone can utilize the market and trade as business\nWell let's talk about the American dream build a business land of opportunity is not the land of a secure job with benefits and the opportunity costs\nThe people that take advantage of the free market and so there's a lot of ways to do that you can buy a franchise you could start a ground up as you can run a restaurant I mean there's a lot of ways that you can own a business in America but think about this\nMost small businesses are not successful and the reason is because there's a lot of liability this cost this hard causes fix cars you know you have variable costs you also have employees and benefits in insurance and inventory to house and lines of credit\nAnd it can be overwhelming and for a lot of people it's basically what causes them not to have success is that they have to deal with all these day to day incidence of traditional business now imagine another business imagine if you could\nNot have to worry about inventory if every time you needed a customer you just posted online something to sell no somebody there to buy it or if you need to buy something at a lower price at wholesale price somebody was there to fulfill that order and sell it you never had a housing been tore never had to deal with employees workers' comp liability ... building\nDidn't have to deal with employees that right there what's that worth\nThat's trading that setting up your trading and investing as a business you have all the tax benefits of a traditional business and yet you got a lot of the non traditional headaches taken out of your business when I saw that when I started trading as a business when I first got introduced to the financial markets [noise]\nIt was just amazing to see because I'd run small businesses for years and had some success some failures lots of failures and when I began to realize that I could do the same thing as far as income and potential income without a lot of the daily daily grind and stress of running a small business\nFor every day when I'm Out on the highway or I'm driving down the road I always get behind that truck with letters on the top and I talked to that guy all the time here it blows and bears radio and I always say there's a guy right now driving down the road with a bunch of letters on the top of his truck who's going from one job or the other is Jason ... good employees that are trying to stiff him he's got people that are shown a fork he's got people that all money\nAnd my heart goes out to that guy 'cause I was that guy then I found them financial markets and this as a business is the dream and when business owners get exposed to understanding how the financial markets can be treated like a business\nIt's a game changer an eye opener for them we see it all the time and so many of you you don't understand that the market can be treated like a business you have these dreams of owning a business\nSeriously inquire to looking at trading for a business because what's important is the long term results are still there but a lot of those traditional headaches at most visitors deal with you can get those are the picture and guess what the sky becomes\nWhen it well and that's exactly a champion a lot of individuals out there they want to start their own business they don't know how to get started they would love to utilize it business from home and that's what the markets can do for you online training academy\nThe sponsor bulls and bears I teach a class specifically on trading as a business now this is a five hundred dollar values taught right at the campus every time we give it away your ... and bears a photo it up we only have a few seats the way we're gonna take callers ten to twenty pick up the phone right now in call a four four five on trade that they for four five on trade for colors tend to twenty to get a five hundred dollar class on trained as a business\nFrom our sponsor online training academy if you've always wanted to start a business and you don't know how to get started in the financial markets this is a unique opportunity for you again for callers tend to twenty pick up the phone and call eight four for five one eight Seventy two thirty three that date for four or five on eight Seventy two thirty three for college ten to twenty\nNow I'll be sure to give you this phone number a bit later in the program as well but I Want to make sure you have it from the beginning at seven to seven seven to\nFor thirty three thirty four\nMake sure you call that number if you had any questions about what we're talking about today or if you'd like to set a visit with Steve and his team you are welcome to call again at Seventy seven Seventy\nFour thirty three thirty four\nNow Steve your grandfather your dad and I'm a mom and boy do we know how painful it is as parents to take your kids than to go get immunized to get their vaccinations maybe not as painful as it is for the kids right but it's hard to know why do you know\nAnd we've all been there we watch them get their immunizations her mom's than measles and hepatitis a even their flu shots and I hate to watch their sweet little faces a critical up and and in pain but it's a necessary right it keeps them it keeps them protected keeps them helping\nAnd Steve I was thinking about that thinking about vaccinations and what would be nice if there was a shot out there a vaccination that could protect our financial health our retirement out that's a pretty nice\nBecause within just like we want to have long lived to let our kids to live long healthy life I Want my retirement assets to live a long life but I understand you have some strategies to do just that\nTo ward off these five major risks to our financial health and retirement so where do we start here with this risk right that's\nWell I'll tell you I I got to throw this and hear Mac and you know when you were talking about that I remember when when my kids taking them to the doctor for the uh the first couple of times you know when when Alicia my oldest so this was back in ... right before we moved to Florida leisure was born in Brooklyn\nAnd ah we lived in uh Brooklyn Staten Island\nAnd this is Nineteen eighty eight so ... was born\nAnd as a little baby Elizabeth and I got pretty worried because every time she would eat she made these really weird noises\nAnd you know we're thinking is she okay is she getting enough oxygen when she eats she ordered to being breast that as you're allergic to baby food I mean we're thinking of all this crazy stuff\nSo we take her to the doctor and the doctor says yeah she she's just making that Simon she's enjoying her food and [laughter]\nAnd it doesn't sound like a lot today but you know back then it was like okay that just cost us Seventy five bucks to uh you know go to the go to the doctor and find out that our baby was in fact just going in to lean over getting fat but ah\nYou know we we worry about that stuff that's our job that's our job to worry and that's what a what we do it's the same thing as a retirement advisor\nYou know the the question that you had is where do we begin this risk assessment well I'll tell you really it all boils down to one risk that everyone thinks about\nAnd that is\nAm I going to outlive my money in retirement am I going to be Seventy five eighty eighty five years old some day and then just flat broke and that's a terrible thought that's a very terrible retirement nightmare for anyone to\nAh to think about so with with people spending two or three decades and retirement these days that risk feels\nPretty real for for many so that is by far one of the most important things is to address the risk of making sure that you do not outlive your money and what I Want to do real quick here Megan before we continue as I Want all of our listeners out there who just joined us to\nHave the option to come and sit down and plow through this stuff because we know retirement planning is very very comprehensive there's an awful lot to think about in reference to\nHealth care and inflation and taxes and risk\nAnd am I invested the right way so here's one I'd like to do I want to give without sat sounding too redundant I Want to give my phone number many many times because I was told by many people in the past year you know Steve on the radio sometimes you give your phone number so fast\nI just didn't have time to write it down or I was driving or by the time I found the phone you moved on to the next segment so you can receive a free consultation\nA free consultation from a retirement planning team\nA myself with more than Thirty Years' experience a when you come in for the free consultation we're going to plow through your tax return and we're going to analyze all of your investments were going to look at everything you're doing and we'll probably throw your three or four maybe five\nCompliments and what you're doing and we'll also point out what we think you're doing wrong or what you're not doing enough up\nSo come in for the free consultation our phone number is seven to seven seven to for\nThirty three thirty four now again um I did warn you I'm going to get a bit redundant here the phone number again Seventy seven seven to for thirty three thirty four\nIt's the same phone number for over twenty five years so for more than twenty five years you can reach the hunger Baptist number seven to seven\nSeven to for thirty three thirty four now here's a couple other ways to get in touch with us something that we initiated a relatively uh uh recently actually in the past month and a half or so\nYou can simply tax the word retire and everyone loves taxing these days begging as you know my my mom she's going to be Ninety I'm In a couple of months in December\nWhen she was eighty four she bought her own iPhone she didn't even consult with her kids she just went out and bought her own iPhone and she said why ... I had to learn how to tax because your kids don't call anymore [laughter] so\nUm if you refer to fax tax the word retire and tax that\nTo the following phone number four seven four seven four seven\nWhich is kinda pretty neat because that's an age right around that age is when you should initially be thinking about\nThe possibility of retirement someday right at around age forty seven forty eight so again that's the word retire to the following phone number four seven four seven four seven Oregon call us here at the office setting to seven seven to for thirty three thirty four\nLast time that number again is seven to seven seven to for thirty three thirty four\nWe are pleased to have you here on the show today again this is the steam hall in retirement wealth show and
