I'm Talking well I'm Talking two three four million dollars a net worth not\nHalf a million or two hundred thousand and four one K. cars that money will run out if you don't measure will I'm Talking

traditional headaches of a typical business you could take advantage of the enterprising\nProcess of the American dream man entrepreneurial spirit go get it rugged individual as we talk about that a lot the rug and individual bill something in the great thing is the market's a way to do it\nExactly champion you know what the person out there that is working a job the person out there is not financially happy they do want to do something different they do want to own a business in the best part about the financial markets\nI've seen some of the best traders investors I Know they start on a shoestring just a couple of thousand dollars of getting account open they learn a skill set over a period of time and it turns into a major business do you do need to have a ton of capital just have a desire and a willingness to learn\nAnd the sky's the limit exactly an online training academy to sponsor bulls and bears the interstate a lot of people out there they want to own a business they already own a business they're trying to take it to the next level\nHaving multiple streams income is paramount and trading is a business and that's why they have a class called trading as a business now have your brand new to the market you don't even know where to begin you don't know where to get started or you've been in the market and you don't have consistent results this is the key thing for you this is a five hundred dollar class taught right at the campus trained as a business from sponsor online training academy\nIt now stands at about sixty two that's a lot higher than it's been but you do for a lot of people his team that's just not soon enough well about half of Americans quit working between the ages of sixty one and sixty five about what five that's Eighteen percent\nRetire even earlier\nSo Americans retiring earlier it's indeed unappealing goal we all want to quit the workforce don't we enjoy those days and retirement outweigh the steps that Steve takes us through on today's program it actually might be an attainable goal for you\nSteve we know Americans have a complex relationship with retirement don't they\nThe trend suggests that uh that they do Megan as does my uh my own first hand experience I gotta tell ya working with those who are close to retirement age or already there so first let's talk a little bit about um about the trends\nSo slightly over Seventy percent of Americans say they plan to continue working\nAnd you know some in that percentage actually say that they're never going to retire usually that means they know they haven't saved enough and they can't possibly support their lifestyles whether they're going to continue to work I mean what is America's biggest financial fear\nThe biggest financial fear that we hear is that they will never be able to retire we get this we hear this all the time am I going to be able to retire heavily saved enough\nFor retirement at what age can I retire so I'll tell you unfortunately many Americans are reluctant to face those fears please people you got to remember one thing don't put your head in the sand is not going to change the outcome\nA recent study found that just over half of American adults and when I say half I mean fifty three percent\nHave a rough idea of how much money they'll actually need to have a sustainable retirement which means the other half or the other forty seven percent well they don't have a retirement number in mind at all\nThat number that you will likely need to cover your cost in retirement\nIs believe it or not an average it approaches throughout your retirement a total of seven hundred and forty thousand dollars now obviously I'm not talking about seven hundred and forty thousand dollars a year Megan I'm Talking about\nLet's break that down over a twenty year period because as you know we always say your retirement it just may be twenty to Thirty years of unemployment so let's take that number seven hundred and forty thousand dollars divided by Twenty years is about thirty seven thousand dollars\nA year divided up by twelve months it means on average the average retirees are going to need at least three thousand eighty three dollars a month\nBut I'll tell you this\nYou know we retire on average about five times a week and I see different numbers see them all the time many times these numbers are much much higher so it all depends on your lifestyle and obviously different factors that ah that go into play here\nWith those numbers are contacts Steve let's start going through the steps we should consider taking now if we want to retire earlier\nAbsolutely so the first step all offered today is to take stock in your retirement income sources\nYour retirement income sources the amounts the duration whether they're guaranteed or not now generally you may have access to a number of income sources for retirement the most common one of course is your Social Security benefits\nWhich for many of you provides the lion's share of ah your future or current retirement income now maybe you're one of the lucky ones maybe you have a pension when you uh retire if you do consider yourselves again one of the lucky ones because we are in a pension was society\nHardly anyone receives a pension these days what about a qualified retirement plan such as an IRA an employer sponsored plan like a four one K. maybe a Ross IRA raw fiery is fantastic I've often said there's two things\nRetirement number one you want good health I Can't help you with that I'm not a doctor the second thing you want to have is you want to have some tax\nFree income well I can help you there I can help you with your retirement lifestyle and that's very important that you prepare a this way and investment portfolio that may provide income\nThrough the systematic sale of assets like for example if you have stocks you might have mutual funds might have say unit investment trusts or ATF and you want to systematically cell that\nMaybe you have a investments where you're going to take just the the devastation of dividend from stock or maybe the income or the interest from a bond\nSo you have interest earned on money parked at a bank is well CDs CDs are are coming back to life believe it or not you can now get a five year CD that's a little bit north of three percent that's fantastic it's it's terrible when we look at\nTwo thousand a prior to two thousand eight rates were much higher\nAnd of course there's there's other sources such as maybe maybe you need an annuity contracted an annuity to supplement your overall portfolio maybe you've got income from a rental property or some different things like that\nSo the greater the share of that income that is actually guaranteed now when I say guaranteed I mean your Social Security benefits guaranteed by a by of course the federal government or maybe you have an annuity guaranteed by the legal reserve of the issuing a insurance company\nIn my philosophy in my experience I think you should have both you should have some income that comes in from guaranteed sources and some that comes in from non guaranteed sources and I know that this whole thing about retirement planning it can be very very confusing\nAh that's why one thing is we always go back to the same thing what you have to do is you have to plan you have to plan on having a plan you've got a plan on planning out your retirement how many times do I have to say the word plan that's exactly what we want you to\nTo realize please don't just when it\nCome in sit down with us sit down with myself Steve fallen Saddam was one of my advisers here\nAnd um we'll talk to you about increasing your income in retirement\nWe'll discuss reducing your taxes will show you what the right hand and the left hand has got to do that is of course work together will show you how to invest conducive ally to your tax return will show you how to reduce some portfolio risk you may have\nA little bit too much risk inside your portfolio that needs to be reduced and we'll show you how to identify and old lemonade implicit hidden fees that may be dragging down the performance

mention and this has very very close to home this was a a tragedy that happened\nTo my family several years ago and I want to tell you just this twenty two veterans\nEvery single day\nThey lose their
