I ... I pay ... page when they called the way they works right so yeah and but they can work like I think it's like five hours a week you know something like that how it'd be reasonable\nEnough in eats it up the things like oh did you got to remember to call that person back there you go yeah see that's also called yeah like Ethan really excited about being my by my assistant when he when he gets a little bit older\nYeah that's right and I think we brought up a good point catch them before they're teenagers they're not going to listen to anything you say so in\nReality all of us have you and I have about four years left maybe with a\nWith the age you might not even have that I don't have that man you might you might have to pay that maybe we might have for with Ethan inland and\nUh you know you've got a few more years or five or six yeah yeah five to seven but what is it just one of the bombs that's one of the ... that's not a bomb and a lot and have the rise in theory\nIs is that the reason the bums they'll blow up is because then people made 'em [laughter] and they were to try to act like it was a Republican yeah now that we were joking on the on the burgers they had you know ... ... he's like well normally this comes from the left is like well maybe it's still is [laughter] it wouldn't surprise me nothing would surprise me about the Democrats\nAre areas as point source mailed out twenty bombs and label them from Donald\nTrump's [laughter] do you spend about ... with a guy that I've gotten I've gotten her\nYet that I mean that that is good but ah it's it's just funny that I did a mailing out bombs you always hear about this stuff and nothing happens\nYeah so they've been sent to a Miami they've been sent to California and New York so there's all over the country all over the country so far we'll see what happened to the Soros got one yesterday portion that\nWell his went first 'cause he mailed from his house so we got there faster yeah I got there are a lot quid right right I mail is cross country course George Soros ... old male [laughter] yeah right yeah that's the funniest part\nEverybody they mail of do they don't take you know Obama [laughter] I don't think of any taste and you\nCan you imagine being the poor assistant that gets their arm blown off because um they wouldn't get they got a Clinton's mail\nHey well you taste is the guy you know somebody that's been going on for thousands of years uh what about the billions somebody one he had a a lotta one one ticket won one point six billion so that's going to be the next or oh so the next ... mosque or something right I mean there are a billionaire now nine hundred and something cash prize\n... but that all that I that had reality is is that the average uh the ... the average person that buys lottery tickets or is in the bottom like twenty percent of income\nOr I've read that so the average person spends I think it was like average American two hundred and thirty three dollars a year or something but they're in their ... category like make under thirty thousand a year there in the bottom income bracket yeah where where the smallest percentage a lotto tickets are sold to the people who who make a good living right a lot of money for a\nWedding all the time I ever do it as a jak outside\nSo as that is the only time I ever play so if you if you look at the law of averages this person that just one one point six billion right after they pay their fees and taxes what it'll probably be nine hundred million nine hundred and something if you take the cash so hold anyway taxes so you're probably looking at six so how long will it take for that person to blow through six hundred million\nI Would say eight years there'll be bankrupt ... it in your point I assume\nThey're smart of all you do is take half immediately spend it and that's the other half you bend it yeah you have six hundred million you spent three hundred million dollars the first week you have it and then you then you said during your by three hundred million on on five percent was about one point I knew those\nYear when I really do because I'll be right next to you\nKnow you never be able to decide how to spend a three hundred I\nGuess arrangements and spend it probably like five hours\nI'll help you I'll help you though is what I'm saying is you know I\nJust remember the financial advice if it floats flies or ... you lease it your\nHand why didn't you tell me that ... years ago I floats that flies or flirt you [laughter] or or\nYou could buy it and get rid of that three hundred million very quickly I think I'm more pictures of the bombs those are just\nI mean they don't even look real there's a lot of American flag stamps on that one [laughter] I don't know I Can't see what the return addresses though having\nInteresting interesting so Powerball tonight which is already be over if you guys are listening Sunday six hundred million so fully that's us and then you will never hears again because we gone longer a week we're going to have to hope for more than on the show a next ... he's one of the mayor oil candidates offered\nTampa right now he's a he looks like between in the leader tied for second [noise]\nYeah I mean I I'd say it's kind of a it's a scary thing if you read that those those amendments man it it got really irritated I don't understand him you know the the one the one about the offshore drilling putting that with ah with with with ... I mean that's\nIt's just shocking that they would that they would do that yeah ...\nShocking shocking that are that our politicians will try to slide something in like that I\nDon't have a problem with people vaping indoors but I definitely have a problem with people drilling for oil off off our shores\nYes but here's the one you're talking about are prohibited really for the exploration of of extraction of oil and natural gas beneath all state owned waters between the main water line in the states out are most territorial boundaries\nAs use of vapor generating electronic devices do current prohibition of tack tobacco smoking an enclosed indoor workplaces with exceptions permits more risk permits more restrictive local vapor ordinances\nIs one ... one has to do with yellow nothing absolutely nothing but the only way they could get one on the ballot is that is the added to the other one so so if you still got a choice like what if I Love him but I kinda want some cheap oil offshore\nCan't do it well you know I mean I don't I don't I mean we don't we don't even offered you anywhere near do know\nThat is not as long as Florida is relies I mean almost all fours revenue comes from tour\nAs far as you see things they're ten Fifteen miles offshore and they have a high I'm\nTelling you I can see the drills we we've talked about this and so you have thought it was crazy I can see fire coming off the top of\nYour Gary thing I'm not seeing them\nNo value on CNN unless you're like out of ten I Am looking at them I mean I've gone\nForty fifty miles offshore before I haven't seen any oil platforms out there\nSo what the heck am I seen either or I or boats with fire and the fire most [laughter] I ... ... tankers all times every day\nThere's what three oil tankers all time off right or they are they like mobile platforms anyway anyway we love to talk about other social media segment guide over yet listen to us on Alexa\nOr ask for the business happy hour on my heart radio check out our part gas in my heart radio that is our new things go listen to that podcast guys we're going to be back next week\nWith ... Morrison and we're actually gonna break down all of these crazy amendment and uh we might listen to Dover says to vote for probably not but we will ask him about that I met than we do like to over so we can't wait to have him on next week the business happy hour's out tune into our social media segment\nRight now they're proceeding was it paid program paid for by Lincoln lending escort\nOn the radio you got ... was it was only has one guy who's actually solving problems instead of wasting your time although the Rush Limbaugh you know\nRush yeah think again being smart he takes on the issues that affect you want and don't be surprised if you get a couple last night where he lives as an entertainer ...\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower was spot in trouble before it happened well now it's on us to protect our home and family\nWhen you want to spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after you see it as Sean who's blink camera alerted him a burglar tried to be around\nNews radio I Seventy ... LA [noise] that when you went to the two Clearwater\nI'm John the question our top story\nThat's true you know hearing loss can occur at anyone at any age if you think about the causes of hearing loss I think if you ask a variety of people the number one answer is noise they may have worked around noise maybe there they had hobbies with noise things like\nThat and my mom used to tell me when I was growing up and I like to listen to the radio a little too loud like hey you're going to lose you know you're going to lose your hearing one day\nThere you go but you know the natural aging process causes us to lose hearing about this as we age our sensors aren't as good maybe our visions not as good our reflexes aren't as good or hearings on his good that can that can certainly cause hearing loss\nTurns forty this year I've noticed that myself certainly that or something\nThey're managing yeah but then also you think about this you see children with hearing aids they were born with hearing loss yeah so it's not just the elderly people sometimes as its children too so\nIt's a great point that you bring up with the children too because I think for children they don't know that it's happening you know the rest of us we've had normal hearing throughout our lives and we might notice that all of a sudden it's diminishing but it's hard not only for children to be able to recognize that hearing loss to be able to communicate that to their parents is there something that\nParents can look out for when it comes to children and in in fence that is that is a you know kind of a signal fires that this is something they might be dealing with\nYeah there is you know most children get tested at birth in the hospital and then I get tested in the early years of school so they usually find that pretty quick parents can identify by people not the children not reacting to their voices and things like that but when we talk about adults\nWhen they come in our office we kinda have a hearing checklist that we give them\nAnd it has things on it like can you hear but you can't understand huh how do you find yourself complaining that people mumble do you I'm continually asked certain people to repeat and if you answered yes to those questions then you need to come in ... and get checked out because there's something going on there and we need to get to the bottom of it\nNow I Know that sometimes with children going back to the kids real quick\nPeople with ah or children that have some kind of autism sometimes have the same kind of issues when it comes to just paying attention or noticing when when their parents are speaking to them is there something that helps you differentiate hey listen this might be a learning issue versus a hearing issue\nThat's true um you know we don't we don't devil so much into pediatrics we do mostly with the senior population those are the people that come in our office they want to get reconnected to their environment to their loved ones to their\nTo their friends or family because when when the person has a hearing loss\nAnd not only affects the person with the laws that affects the family because the family can become frustrated they have to repeat a lot\nOf the family can become disconnected so the person may feel isolated are asked so all these emotions surface and they don't have to have that they can get a hearing aid and and relieve themselves from that stress women emotion\nWell let me ask you this again if we're talking with a Randy ... the the heat from audible hearing aids\nLet me ask you this and when you talk to adults who are dealing with hearing loss do do you deal with at all like maybe they don't want to admit it or maybe they're not quite sure what's going on and and they're just they're they're almost reluctant to find out if this is the issue\nThat is true people come in and we call that a different states of denial yeah because hearing loss typically as a gradual thing it's not like an overnight I lost my hearing it happens over several years and they don't wake up one day and things are different so that's a gradual thing a lot of times people around them notice before they do\nSo they think something's happening like their mumbling like I said earlier there'd be a think people are mumbling or not speaking up than typically they might blame it on somebody else they don't see it as their problem when in essence it is it's it's their ears not able to pick up that signal\nAnd if you're dealing with something like that the good news is you know there are tests that take a while but when it comes to the initial hearing loss test people can get this done really quickly right Randy\nThey can when the when you come into auto bell of course we're equipped with an expert staff highly trained professionals we have state of the article it meant to analyze their hearing analyze your hearing find out exactly what's going on and provide a solution for that for that hearing loss so\nWhen you start talking about auto bell takes about an hour to do that is probably the best our or you could ever spend I tell people you know I Do a lot of seminars\nDo some public speaking on hearing loss quite a bit and I give a lot of information to people and I always say in my seminars and wherever I go that the most important information you can get is about yourself\nComing into auto belong and take that hour of your time to find out about your hearing is the most important thing and the good news is that is a complementary service that we provide that's great well not charge for that\nYeah because a lotta times it's difficult for people to afford a you know certain things and they'll put it off because you know what maybe this is more important right now where I think this is more important right now there are few things in your life that are going to be more important than you are hearing and\nIt's unfortunate that people sometimes don't realize that until they start losing their hearing when you're talking about it being a free test that you can come in and find out if you're losing your hearing aid it'd be absolutely insane not to take advantage of it\nThat's right and you know the thing about auto bell where a patient based company we always are concerned about hearing hearing is our concern your wellbeing and you're hearing is our number one priority allotted other companies sell hearing aids that's not what we do we actually fit hearing losses\nSometimes I say we save hearing lives people come in there during the state of a stress for one reason or another because they can here and we relieve that stress like they come out a new person reconnected into their environment and they're like they got their life that I mean that's just that's just priceless\nAnd we've all seen the videos on YouTube when someone who did not have a site or did not have hearing gets to see or hear ... for the first time because you know these new developments or or if it's somebody that was colorblind and they see color for the first time\nIt's such an emotional thing and when you've had leave ability throughout your life and then lose them that's emotional as well so I can only imagine when you guys get set up correctly when you guys get somebody to the point where oh my God I can hear everything around me again it's life changing for people\nThat's it they become disconnected from society it's it's a life changing event for them you know the implications of hearing loss\nOur long term on when I say hearing loss untreated hearing loss that's the danger when people don't get help for their hearing there's a thing called the auditory deprivation you've heard the term if you don't use it you lose it yeah a lot of people have heard that\nSo what are we doing my muscles are we so we we deprive the brain of the signal the ear picks up the signal in the environment transmits it to the brain and the brain processes that\nTo into a meaningful spoken word music whatever you're listening to it so if we disconnect the ear\nOf a sudden we've interrupted that a pathway to the brain so the single becomes it's either gone or distorted or whatever\nAnd confused as a result so there's a thing called auditory deprivation when we deprive the system\nOf the signal of the brain forget how to interpret the signal for example and what we talk about in the in the hearing industry has word discrimination being able to understand the spoken word so we have a percentage people will come in with the hearing loss of maybe they've lost fifty percent of their ability to an all stuff that I think I'm going to be do\nSo with the here and I were given the results on the spot like we said a minute ago they may be able to hear a Ninety two percent now well if they don't get hearing aids and wait another five years come in or two years or three years they can regress maybe now they only hear Seventy percent with hearing aids\nDepriving their brain from that single creates this deprivation over time and that's the danger that's the real danger they can't get it back in ...\nIt's a great point because you mentioned earlier in the show listen this is something that will happen gradually over with a with time it is part of aging and I think for a lot of people maybe they go oh I check my hearing a couple of years ago or five years ago and it was great\nWhen should people start looking at their hearing and whether or not they're having a hearing loss more often and maybe how often should people come see you to make sure that things are what they're supposed to be\nGreat question now at auto we recommend if you're sixty years or older you get a hearing evaluation right away it's critical al Davis you have normal hearing at that point\nI I'd be honest I've never met anyone over sixty that doesn't suffer from some kind of ... I'll be drastic but\nDid they do if you have normal hearing at that point we will tell you to come back and maybe two years re check it so we can stay on top of it that are about we're going to keep that on record\nWe're going to offer you to come back at no charge again and re test you're hearing again see if it's gotten worse so we can get on it when it does start to develop into a problem\nSo amazing we're gonna check our oil all the time right we're going to go every three thousand miles away and go get that oil changed we're going to do that for our car we do it for our air conditioners at home living here in Florida right we don't do it often enough for our health and especially when you're talking about a a free pass why wouldn't you\nKnow why would you not it's about an hour a little longer we mentioned that the other thing too when you get a hearing aids from auto we have a forty five day risk free trial period after you get your hearing aids for any reason you're not happy with those here in age you're able to return the hearing it with no obligation\nAnd and that's a big part because what I found out which I think is so big that you guys do at ... hearing aids is you're allowed to buy you know by the government's laws you can ask for a dispensing fee for people that have returned they're hearing aids\nAnd you can only give them thirty days to return them you guys not only give them forty five days to return their hearing aids\nYou also do it without that dispensing fees so if they don't work out for you lose ... you're not going to be on the hook for money like you would with somebody else we can talk more about that and more about the importance of hearing loss on the other side pat Donovan Randy aid for audible hearing aids right here on nine Seventy WFL a let's check in with news right now with the guys in the newsroom\nTraffic and whether by heart radio ... down on your Web ballet [noise]\n\nSome of the train traffic that our power by climate design have an accident on ... east ... theme park road and county line road blocking everything except the center lanes and expect them to life we also have\nFifty for a shutdown did an accident at Lamar road does it ... me meat eater and to ... for another guy let up on ... not on price shutting it just five Ninety nine on the unlimited buffet only see the prices in participation taxes the next six credit restrictions apply\nTo long nine Seventy W.
