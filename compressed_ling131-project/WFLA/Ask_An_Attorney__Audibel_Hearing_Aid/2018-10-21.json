L. C.\nAnd plays the rental home in and they'll see then if there is a lawsuit about an injury on the property they can only see the L O L C L L C and can get the through you personally you can then assign your interest in El al see to trust that word probate\nBut about retirement accounts to put those in a trust\nWell our retirement accounts are also protected by Florida statute to twenty to pollute totally I'm Free from creditors there are some exceptions to these rules like in an inherited IRA\nDoesn't have the protection that are regular IRA that you have\nTo have some questions about asset protection maybe nursing homes and he will talk but those a little bit how to plan for that\nYou have a question about avoiding probate if you do uh well the most common question I get is what is my will have to go the probate I think I I have a plan I signed a will pay the attorney to prepare this will\nWhy does it have to go through probate well simply because assets are that wind up in the deceased person's name have to go the appropriate you're listening to ask an attorney it's a live show on October the twenty first it six\nTwelve in the morning you have a legal question loved to

started with the money being supervised by the court you don't put retirement accounts in the trust although there are some exceptions to that rule suppose you want to do a stretch\nDistribution oh stretch distribution means that you don't want the person to be able to receive all of their money all at one time you liked to stretch it out and make it last for them\nSo um if you want to do that you can have it come into the trust or just special language they have it come into the trust that would er take care of it without creating an adverse tax situation\nSame thing with eye insurance IRAs annuities\nThey generally have a beneficial that already avoid probate\nSo does that or do I have a call or it's not on the color screen\n\nAll right let's go to Daniel\nDaniel how are you this

more than glad to try to help you get the point in the right direction\nYou know the most common question I've gotten over the thirty four years I've done this show I think if you um what is the most common question actually involve something like this previous caller in the most common question is if I come to Florida and I have a will or trust from another state\nDoes will Florida except that\nWell the answer is more than likely if you will is a done properly\nIt probably would work in Florida with some extra steps I call it the most common uh you know your will says you're a resident of wherever you created the will the very first sentence with the will usually acknowledges what state you encounter you live in you know will\nSo if you die with ... you become a Florida resident and then you have an old will from another state that was going to say your residence somewhere else and it was probably going to be governed by laws that say there'll be some language in the\nDocument that says it'd be governed by the laws in that state so\nIt's and it may or may not be witness and notarized properly to meet the ah Florida standards of what's called a self proving we'll\nSee if you have a we'll\nSigned in another state was like two or three witnesses and it's a notarized banned before you can proceed with the ... who will be a judge here would require an appointment of a commission or in another state to take the oath to one of the witnesses\nIf it's witnessing other I sold my wills and trust are witnessing notarized with the proper language and the proper or language makes it so you never have to find to approve the witnesses\nThat's pretty much a hassle and it slows the process down somewhat so I'm the most\nCommon question is miles stay will good in Florida you can eventually get it probably accepted if even if it has a problem or two in it but if you have a a properly done in Florida where it's witnessing arrives then you don't have to prove or find the witnesses sure makes it a lot easier and quicker in most costly\nI'm attorney Joe hip and asking attorney all about Florida law you have a legal question\nToll free number one eight hundred nine six

should do\nA so we talked to a little bit about that he had registered decoration dumb song got to change you get your car registered in Florida Florida driver's license\nOr Florida voters cards update your wills and trust change your mailing address of course when all your bills and everything we had a question about a plumbing problem\nI have sounds like the polymer was over his head on the

question toll free number one eight hundred nine six nine nine three five to in Hillsboro nine nine zero Ninety five to in the nose for six one\nNine three five two\nSo when would you want to consider not giving the child an outright distribution\nOh there are multiple examples supposedly um suppose a child I recently had a client die up in Jacksonville where we have an office\nAnd he had one very successful son and he had a son or that had an addiction problem was homeless\nSo the sun a that was how to you know good marriage good job knows how to handle money was no money very well good um it was great to his father\nYou know had good relations with his father and family he got his share outright or will be getting insure All right the other son the or father was wise and not wanting to give him a lump sum of money all at once\nSo he arranged for a trustee to uh have money paid directly or the child's rent so uh in this particular case there are those are ... successor trustee actually\nSo what does the trustee do well the trustee had him ... apartment to live the trust he makes the payments directly the rent payments directly to the landlord\nOr an amount of money was decided to give the child every other week\nAnd the dead one in the ah son to have his teeth fix which would probably be about six thousand dollars and the sun a pay as other expenses as they come up\nSo hey that's really why I mean there's no this is my child has an incoming ... source of money to take care of all of these situations for a pretty long time so when do you stretch out distribution in that particular case was a good example\nWhen uh you have the inlaws it might take total control is a good example addictions\nOr a good example special needs child and government benefits can't really receive an inheritance without losing those benefits those were all a good examples of how you distribute out money over a period of time in why maybe you should All right let's go\nTo a David in Tampa\nYeah I got a question about a hurricane or if if a neighbor's tree falls on your house and you don't have health insurance\nOr are you cover but is your\nThe insurance cover your house cover the tree fall on the house\nProbably not\nA moon you certainly can try but that's a bit first of all any damage caused by a hurricane is\nIs that the act of nature\nAnd so most insurance policies exempt that damage out there are some policies that you can get the cover hurricane or wind damage\nBut if your neighbors a few neighbors tree it say it wasn't even a hurricane and your neighbors tree fell into your house\nYour neighbors not usually responsible for that unless the maybe the tree was dead or damage there might be a way you could try to make them responsible you give them warnings letters this was a dangerous tree you did everything you could do but it's still selling the house or those type of cases are very difficult\nSo uh\nThey answered the famous legal answers that just depends but you know it was a good chance that it wouldn't be covered\nAnd there's another side question about about a goofy about getting on Mars insurance because of the new roofing up\nA litigation eight and I think about that because the Fifteen year policy if you root for over Fifteen Years old you have to have a new group in order to get insurance you know anything about\nWell and the insurance companies to make up their own rules about if they're going to insure your house and\nNot so some insurance companies require for them to ensure that house that you get a new roof\nAnd they come out and do inspections are about lots of guy I\nCouldn't I couldn't get a ...
