four let's go to a re in Tampa hey ray [noise]\nHey good morning I'm trip so olive Josh\nBy a few years ago I trust but my wife and I\nTrust decisions powers of attorney go to one of my daughters who happens to be as ... ... ... ... ... to make those kinds stations try and keep it simple I also made her sick\nOr just to show that hurt her first they're very close so they'll just paid any issues but now I'm starting to be a little concerned about spots abilities of\nThe in check tore up of trust and to ensure complications should\nShut it happened to one of my church or [noise] trust execute it showed\nWell there's language yeah go ahead\nHow you can trust the company in other words that law for arming in its past or whoever is available at the time what does that relationship with you [laughter] [laughter]\nWell well first of all the daughter that you named in the document she can hire whatever help she needs if you want to keep it within the family so\nA lot of trust administrations very simple a trusted ministry shouldn't basically is to collect the assets pay the bills do taxes do creditors and then eventually make the distribution\nIf your daughter is a doctor and very very busy she can hire whatever help she needs or you could have chosen to have a a corporate trustee like a bank or broke a brokerage house with the trust department ordered attorney or to be the trustee\nSome people would name the daughter co with an attorney or corporate trusts the\nOther people would have to name the daughters is co trustees so they can uh sharing the work a ton of equally hopefully\nUh so you have multiple choice is it's a good discussion point when you're in within attorney to do a reviewer an update situation we we all for all of our clients a review every three or four years to come in there's no charge for the review and things things like that that's the perfect discussion topic ah do during a review meaning if you want to make some changes on who the trustee is\nRight and speak with you why trust is\nAbout two years old now maybe I'd be a little bit when the appropriate time to consider here there's been through life changes but I mean just by the time\nWell we we try to in a ... in between three and four years to all clients to come in and suggest they do a review so I Would say between three and four years but you could do on any time really\nIn fact this was on your mind and you want to kicking around with someone you know you go back for you happy with your attorney go back to your attorney um and if you wanna get maybe a second opinion go to another attorney perhaps but you know I think it's good to be on your mind you need to go to discuss it with someone else no\nWe don't even charge tour for unemployment like this to review documents or have a discussion that nature\nOkay try to change and get us to go to another attorney and they're still issues with the current attorney other than just spend it to another charge I Would check like trust and I should try to it as it is and and\nI dont\nKnow what when well we know if you decided to make a change in the uh trustees would be just be a simple amendment\nAnd so any any estate planning attorney a good you know that does lots of wills and trust with can easily do that for you\nTo show once the trust is completed by the attorney in the family\nIs still a relationship with that attorney and the and the ... only if there's a complication an execution might lose something by moved from the rich are turning to another attorney in my losing some type of relationship that trust\nNo no you'd be a trustee you now or the trustee or are you and your wife or the ... and then if you and your wife both dire become incapacitated than the successive trustee in at any point whoever's the trust that you can choose whatever attorney they want to doesn't matter really who created the trust\n\nOkay All right so that that was it we can cause points for generating anyway invalid day\nOh no not at all you know attorneys retire attorneys a a\nChange practice areas attorneys move to different locations you can you can always you can always have any attorney you want to represent you regarding the trust\nOkay All right well that short shut it but may to consider and obviously it's on my mind that's a recent but yeah I appreciate your ah your counsel on that shot in the first time I called about matter\nAnd very much a a appreciate your guy it's a matter of fact I Am considering the offices of you\nKnow great chart raised safe travels\nAre to losing you
