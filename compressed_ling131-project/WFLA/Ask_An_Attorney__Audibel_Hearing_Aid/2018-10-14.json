{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "Guys welcome back to the business happy hour we've been talking with John ... he's the writer and director of humans do have you guys have not looked it up check it out or Google it you can watch it on line I'm sure Ryan's already picked it up to ... and where do you watch the documentary she watched you for free if you're an Amazon Prime customer\nHey yeah even better Amazon Prime pull streaming HD but John's very a very interesting gas we were talking before the break about evolution and he was in lightning me and breaking down or how how some of this actually work\nI'm John we've got a couple of minutes left with you I I Want people to definitely watch the er the documentary at the I think it opens your eyes to a lot of things and\nAnd uh we do appreciate the way you add differentiate between the alt right\nBy and and ah you know the the ... and all that we understand that it's a it's a maybe a small group of people um but now what what else do we want our listeners to take away from this you know uh this is a dark chapter in American history with the thing that happened to oh to banged up which is which is interesting to see how he put 'em on display\nI'm Doug and I we were talking about we saw that movie uh the greatest showman what you're talking about the T. Barnum and I understand he I had a role in some of this at one point but if if the movie's accurate he changed his mind and it became a celebration of humanity and then on that sort of\n... I mean the the bottom is a great guy in American history culture but that film\nThe brush that it really wasn't quite empowering people and the one actually he had a human ... he had someone an African American who dressed up as part that he ... he called it the one that was probably his most famous\nExhibit and that was left out of that film and he just right after dawn and published on the origin of species to capitalize on this and so he did it for decades um ... got what sort of left out of the\nGreatest showman recovery in the film so people can hear the other the other federal immigration Sherman can bring about\nInteresting okay Doug in Iraq and ride he hadn't seen it and we had the and then we were like I Wonder if it was painted differently sure movie fashion that there are yeah they're always\nIt's always this this there's always an angle there was a fun film I mean as a as a nurse and it was it was definitely get\nA soda so John what do we want to leave the listeners with your died about the humans do I\nYeah I think the fundamental thing even dealing with the scientific racism it's today without getting lots of this year but whether climate change or or whatever else we have lots of people who are always saying experts say if and if certain experts say there's no one can question them or discomfort or they're shut down I think\nThe human fears is a cautionary tale expert knowledge is needed but experts can be wrong right under and we really should value people raising questions or even when it comes to expert knowledge and and not just\nBeing shut up because like I said what the eugenics for example the Catholic Church one of your mattress there was a bigger ... opponents of eugenics and forced sterilization America and they were berated upon by five votes for being fired because they were forced or ... well\nI think we all would have been better off if there had been allowed to articulate there is a little more than in fact when anyone says you have to shut up because well you don't have the backing of our house you can't even after question\nI think in my own mind this is just for me personally I think that is not very good for a free society\nNow we agree that's a good point out of ... I think too far too much now and then I hate to generalize but it's the left is more\nOf a you know shut everybody up and if you're not with us you are not right and it's sad that we we see this on college campuses we see this and everyday society that there's there's no discourse anymore and I couldn't agree with you more experts are needed but experts are not always corrects I think that's a great take away a for everybody\nI think you always have to have an open mind to be willing to challenge to the thought you know if you're not willing to if you're not willing to dig deep than I'm Sorry but you're you're you're lacking I have a you know you don't just go along with what people tell you exactly how to do your own research right\nRight the John appreciate having ... been a great guest and uh I don't have to watch the documentary myself Ryan's are stat guys they brought me up to speed as Bessie good [laughter]\nYour check it out it bought your show sounds fun I mean yeah\nWe yeah we we will be like fun gas to an end you fit right into the mold and and we appreciate your opinions and coming on and ah we ever have another opportunity will definitely invite you want to talk about some of those with us\nOh well thanks for having me\nAnytime John everybody that was John Gee west a director of human\nZoos check out that documentary and feel free to chime in on our Facebook page about it as a heated debate\nYou know I Am going to last night I Would I Would I Would down and watch it watch it uh I I think that's what's interesting about the alt right in in that are a lot of views a lot of the people that they actually talk about in the alt right\nAre really not Republican at all they're not all those are more socialist yeah than anything else yeah and so it's it's strange how it's gotten to this point it's like a they're confused about what these people really are you know everybody's advanced\nNo I think I don't know All right I think is really more fascist and socialist then\nRepublican I mean they're not Republicans you should be no correlation no there there shouldn't be angry now what about ... what do you think [laughter]\nThat was doing some research I just had to get him on that look real quick but he got his [laughter] he does is not the way that does that mean he's not allowed or he's just not responding to my head I respond to your ... and they are as\nI Love it so ... out quite fun story we got kind of fun we\nGot in with the here a couple of minutes left or so um I'll start with a Ryan Lamborghini or right and they begin to your friend in China and it was not see the uh drove drove her his son to school in a Ferrari and he got all kinds of backlash Doug you write about this story as well\nYeah I didn't read the whole thing on basically just I guess you know hurt feelings or some parents really I'm a parent parents don't have as much money so they get\nYou know they don't they get jealous of another parent having kicked him off of the classes social media as being like\nYou know ... I was going on is dropping off a school can just go on a regular is happening in China in China oh my God I always regarded China hired because they say there's such a a wage gap in the ... it's not proper you should not show off no matter how how rich you are\nLena Lena drove over her uh her kid to school in number sooner Mercedes ... Farhan landrover hey Alina landrover\nThey're out there that the veteran does I'm going to be in our Land Rover so Franklin beginning\nTo you know the wealth gap they say well that's a real thing it's better to educate children face it rather than\nThan to go at such a joke well well that's no no I sure do that's what we know you miss that I think that part because they it's better for the kids to face the gap to face these at all yeah and I know in Toronto fact that there's a there's and instead of ... there has to be an income inequality\nAlways inequality I look I mean the ... and we're not talking about opportunity inequality right\nWhere we are talking about any of them there's always going to be a big difference between the higher earners in the lower ... unless it's a socialist society that you guys were came right after the judge that that's where I felt when when you guys have ditch diggers right this is just I Love it another ... ... ... don't forget about the social media\nThing that we're going to get anyone that doesn't mean it's like that but I Believe my guess would this on the business savvy I\nWhen you were a kid and you saw that that drop is get off in a Ferrari that motivated me yeah oh yeah I make right now I only have one that yeah how do I do that you work hard that's at business happy our listeners your work hard we'll see you next week listen to the social media say they're proceeding was a paper program paid for by Lincoln lending ask\nThey want to get reconnected to their environment to their loved ones to their to their friends or family because when when the person has a hearing loss and not only affects the person with the laws that affects the family\nBecause the family can become frustrated they have to repeat a lot of the family can become disconnected so the person may feel isolated to arrest so all these emotions surface and they don't have to have that they can get a hearing aid and and relieves himself from that stress when that emotion\nWell let me ask you this is again if we're talking with a Randy feed the heat from audible hearing aids\nLet me ask you this when you talk to adults who are dealing with hearing loss do do you deal with at all like maybe they don't want to admit it or maybe they're not quite sure what's going on and they're just they're they're almost reluctant to find out if this is the issue\nThat is true people come in and we call that a different states of the Nile yeah because hearing loss\nTypically as a gradual thing it's not like an overnight I lost my hearing it happens over several years\nAnd they don't wake up one day and things are different so that's a gradual thing a lot of times people around them notice before they do so they think something's happening like their mumbling like I said earlier if you think people are mumbling or not speaking up\nThan typically they might blame it on somebody else they don't see it as their problem Ryan when in essence it is it's it's their ears not able to pick up that signal\nAnd if you're dealing with something like that the good news is you know there are tests that take a while but when it comes to the initial hearing loss test people can get this done really quickly right Randy\nThey can when the when you come into auto bell of course we're equipped with an expert staff highly trained professionals we have to stay there are equipment to analyze their hearing analyze your hearing find out exactly what's going on and provide a solution for that for that hearing loss so\nWhen you start talking about automobile takes about an hour to do that is probably the best our or you could ever spend\nI tell people you know I Do a lot of seminars I Do some public speaking on hearing loss quite a bit and I give a lot of information to people and I always say in my seminars and wherever I go that the most important information you can get is about yourself\nComing into auto bell and take that hour of your time to find out about your hearing is the most important thing and the good news is that's a complementary service that we provide that's great I Will not charge for that yeah because\nA lot of times it's difficult for people to afford a you know certain things and they'll put it off because you know what maybe this is more important right now or I think this is more important right now\nThere are few things in your life that are going to be more important than you are hearing and it's unfortunate that people sometimes don't realize that until they start losing their hearing when you're talking about it being a free test that you can comment and find out if you're losing your hearing aid it'd be absolutely insane not to take advantage of it\nThat's right and you know the thing about outer belt where a patient based company we always are concerned about hearing hearing is our concern your wellbeing and you're hearing is our number one priority a lot of other companies sell hearing aids that's not what we do we actually fit hearing losses\nSometimes I say we save hearing lives people come in there during the state of a stress for one reason or another because they can here and we relieve that stress like they come out a new person reconnected into their environment and they're like they got their life that I mean that's just that's just priceless\nAnd we've all seen the videos on YouTube when someone who did not have a site or did not have hearing gets to see or hear ... for the first time because you know these new development or or if it's somebody that was colorblind and they see color for the first time\nIt's such an emotional thing and when you've had leave ability throughout your life and then lose them that's emotional as well so I can only imagine when you guys get set up correctly when you guys get somebody to the point where oh my God I can hear everything around me again it's life changing for people\nThat is you know worldwide there's over three hundred million people with a meaningful hearing laws there's a lot of people out there I mean and I want people to know they're not alone there's there's a lot of people out there with hearing loss if you're over Seventy five years old for you know forty to fifty percent of the adult population I have a meaningful hearing loss we're here to help ought to be able to say that again\nBecause I don't I don't want people to miss that that is unbelievable number\nOver Seventy five years old forty to fifty percent have a meaningful hearing loss and that's just the way it is and it ought to bill we want to make you feel at home part of our family when you come in we're going to treat you with dignity honesty respect and the things that you deserve it's going to be a very pleasant experience\nAnd by the way you're not going to have to drive all over the place because twenty seven a Tampa Bay area locations ... hearing aid\nPat we've been doing this all quite a long time we have thousands and thousands of satisfied patience um we serve the patient that's what we do this or to the patient\nNow let me ask you this because I think again that sometimes people don't really understand hearing loss like a lot of things you know we hear about it or we know people that are dealing with it but there was still a lot of misconceptions about any area and health talking about maybe some of the misconceptions about hearing loss if maybe things that people don't understand\nYeah I Want to talk about something that's that's very important to a lot of people\nUm for decades the medical community believe the here and has provided a nice improvement for social herb or business interaction but getting hearing aids could wait while we've we know now that was grossly incorrect that's not true today we know that auditory deprivation from Montreal and hearing loss can list\nThe last the gray matter in the brain actually and lead to the opposite of dementia\nSo it's like you don't if you don't use it you lose it yeah so when people when the ear becomes disconnected from the brain the result of confusion in the brain tries to focus more\nTo ... to the understand to try and understand words mhm and that's to the detriment of other processes like memory so it uses all these resources that try to understand but then now your memory starts feeling so actually a Johns Hopkins University in the national Council on aging\nIt was not be drastic but did they do\nIf you have normal hearing at that point we will tell you to come back and maybe two years re check it so we can stay on top of it that are about we're going to keep that on record\nWe're going to offer you to come back at no charge again and re test you're hearing again see if it's gotten worse so we can get on it when it does start to develop into a problem\nSo amazing we are going to check out our oil all the time right we're going to go every three thousand miles away and go get that oil changed we're going to do that for our car we do it for our air conditioners at home living here in Florida right we don't do it often enough for our health and especially when you're talking about a a free test why wouldn't you\nI Know why would you not it's about an hour a little while longer we mentioned that the other thing too when you get a hearing aids from auto we have a forty five day risk free trial period after you get your hearing aids for any reason you're not happy with those here in age you're able to return the heritage with no obligation\nAnd and that's a big part because what I found out which I think is so big that you guys do at ... hearing aids is you're allowed to buy you know by the government is laws you can ask for a a dispensing fee for people that have returned they're hearing aids\nAnd you can only give them thirty days to return them you guys not only give them forty five days to return their hearing aid you also do it without that dispensing fee so if they don't work out for you lose ... you're not going to be on the hook for money like you would with somebody else we can talk more about that and more about the importance of hearing loss on the other side pat

Seventy WFL a audible hearing aids\nAnd we are talking about the importance of hearing and and\nAmount of hearing loss of so many people are dealing with when\nThe reality is they just don't have to win for so long I've heard it from people are hearing aids they're begging they're clunky they hang out of your ear I don't want to be walking around with that thing it's just not the case anymore is it Randy\nNot at all pat and you know when you look at the American population thirty six million Americans have some degree of hearing loss amazing it's amazing and a lot of those people are not getting help and\nBy the way if you're one of them you don't have to deal with it anymore\nYou don't have to go through the stress you don't have to go through the emotions hearing aids are miniaturize now hearing aids or have gone light years in technology over the last ten years they're not like your grandfather's here and it's not at all\nAnd and you talked about you know not only are these smaller but they just function so much better as well when you're talking about\nIf you're one of those people that you've been married forever if this great relationship with your wife my wife and I love to watch television together but maybe you don't watch TV in the same room anymore because your husband or wife or whoever it is has to turn that volume up so loud that you can't even take it don't have to deal with that\nNo pet you don't you know we're blessed with with the best technology for hearing in hearing devices in bar none and we have those at our fingertips\nWe have a device you can hook to your TV Now where the hearing aids are connected to the box it's wireless connection you turn on the hearing aid turn on the stream or that sends the audio stretch here here in age correct for your hearing loss\nI'll tell you my wife would probably like to get those for me the way I watch TV at night and ...\nThen you have your own volume I mean you can actually mute the TV and still have the audio come into the hearing aids has been saying\nSusan mute the TV for two you're hearing it so ... you know it's not just that hey it's\nComing out of the television like it was ... and you're hearing it better but now it's sent directly either as some people really need to to grasp a hold of because if any of us that don't have hearing loss or even somebody that does have used a Bluetooth devices and think about how convenient that is to have that kind of technology within a hearing aid how do you just massive\nIs wonderful wherever we have accessories you you can add to a wireless when I say we have these wireless here and it says something and I say wireless the hearing aid has wires and but it has a radio system built in so for example if I Want to answer my cell phone I have a device I can connect Bluetooth to my cell phone when the phone rings I had to answer\nRight to my hearing aids so cool from my cell phone correct for my hearing loss of hair everywhere that's wonderful\nYeah and and we've talked throughout the show about how life changing this can be and we we think all the time about when you have hearing loss that you just don't hear as well and you know maybe it affects the way that you you communicate with people or maybe it it affects the way you watch television but\nIt it it rocks you to the soul when you're unable to communicate with people who really does and you talked about earlier there actually be depression noxious dimension but there can be depression and people deal with a lot when they're unable to communicate with their loved ones\nThey do they feel isolated that can be depressed or they can be disconnected socially but all these things happen in it and the interesting thing is everybody's unique so everybody reacts kind of in different ways are hearing professionals in our officers are trained to identify that address it and take care of it right on the spot\nHere's what's great though everyone might be unique as far as why they've had hearing loss or how how they were dealing with hearing loss what isn't unique is when you go to ... hearing aids\nThey can take you regardless of your situation and not just tell you but show you that day how much they can help you and that's what's amazing is there are so many unique reasons for hearing loss there were so many unique ways that people have or deal with hearing loss but when it comes to what you're able to do with them\nEven though there are situations unique the result usually is not right because you guys can tell them before they walk out the door
