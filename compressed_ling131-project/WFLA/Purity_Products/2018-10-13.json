{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "Just call eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine now let's talk about the weather [laughter]\nIt was it was a ... here's the thing this is really important to show if you're just joining us or you've been with us the whole time I talked about a couple of things you know I talked about your retirement plan at work how important it is to use that\nAnd so make sure you're utilize properly if you want to come and sit with me I'll be glad to show you how to do this\nBut take full advantage of that plan that's really really important and sometimes you're advisors are going to tell you not to do that they're they're crazy you need to use these plans\nIf you're not happy with you that's been set aside there's some they called it in service distribution that allows you to open up your choices so just make sure using plan right we also talked about health care writers\nAre healthcare writer as a really valuable tool that they hope no one needs but if you're concerned about the possibility of home health care or nursing home or any of that stuff\nUh it it keeps you up at night this is a tool you want to look at a just cause I'll help you with this stuff but we'll we'll put it together and uh I'll show you how to use these things\nUm the thing I Want to talk about right now that's really important is this market has been on a tear I mean it is really high\nAnd the mark has been going up and up and up and you know there's a saying Todd that rising ties for all boats have you heard that before of course you know so everyone's doing well now some people believe all I was not the visor wasn't doing a good job but today's doing a good job I'll sit tight but the reality is the market's going out the market's going up everyone's doing well\nYou know there's also saying that floating boats are uh are rising because of tides but\nAlso there's another uh addition to that that uh you know a high tides are they they thought the bus but also a that boat will also be money pit as well so yeah yeah be prepared to just up all kinds of what you're going to blow your whole retirement and about you know what I said\nSo so what I'm saying is everyone you you feel grade because this is a good mark and things have been going well and I hope everyone is doing great in it but be careful there's a lot of musical chairs right and that music is going to stop one day\nAnd we don't know when this party is going to be over so when I'm sitting with people that question I'm getting a lot is Scott how long it what what do you think's going to happen this year how much longer is this going to go on\nAnd and I got to tell you something uh I'm pretty optimistic I'm always very optimistic and I believe if you invest properly do things the right way you don't have to worry about this stuff\nBut this party will end one day and we have to remember what happened to us back in two thousand age right and that was really really bad ... protect yourself so it doesn't happen again you know be careful you know it's kind of like Todd ... you know the difference between a tornado and our hurricane\nWell folks here here we go this this is now the weather's segment here that they would let me\nLet me tell you real quick you know a tornado comes upon us very quickly it's unexpected you don't know that it's coming but but look here in Florida we know the hurricanes they find a way out in the Gulf of Mexico and they try to predict where they're going to land\nAnd a tornado's unexpected butter hurricane is somewhat predictable right we know what's coming we can prepare for 'em and everything\nAnd so it's really important to understand the difference so with your finances the market's been great everything's good\nBut a crash will come and the correction will come at the party won one day\nAnd we can start preparing for early so just like you know boarding up your windows and putting a little water aside or whatever that is that you would do in a hurricane or why don't you start protecting some of those gauge in your portfolio\nSo we don't lose them as well I mean that's been a long time since the last corrections has two thousand eight\nOr is probably overdue\nAnd typically have these ten to twelve percent pulled backs every year we haven't had one of those for a while\nAnd and prices are high and I'm not saying that the market is going to stay on a tear I'm very optimistic about all the things going on and frankly are you know we're investing for clients were not hiding from this but you know what we're also doing were being realistic about it and and we're saying look\nMaybe it's time to start thinking about protecting some of your games and not losing everything finally your for one case of come back and grown in your accounts are on track and everything's good\nWhat's wrong with thinking about this might end one day and it may not end well so I Want to be protected with my finances and a lot of your stockbrokers are are I guess in a car you said pedal to the metal let's go go go go well look we're getting good returns to but we're doing it\nWhile managing risk\nDon't take all that rescue work too hard for your money and so I think it's a great time to get your financial house in order and and what I Want to offer to our listeners if you haven't called in yet you've probably been a listener for years\nGive us a call come sit with me one of my advisers I'd love to sit with us review your finances was make sure you're not taking too much risk let's look at your ... and I see all the time people that think they're paying one percent a year or less and they're really paying three and

protecting your finances so it's a market keeps up you do well but if it crashes you're going to be OK\nFolks [noise] it is a simple process you know I just don't want the listener Bob to be intimidated by the process of coming in for a meeting\nIt is local is relax the environment is friendly and you just need to look at it folks from a total educational standpoint\nAnd why would you want to be doing something financially that's not in your best interests and that's where the heart would team is going to look at your current portfolio your current strategy\nThey've got to give a a

com and we'll see and I saw [noise]\nTo find out more about financial advisor Robert Harward and the hard way call Harwood financial at one eight hundred three nine five\nFour to seven one eight hundred three nine five four ... four timeline that Harward way dot com [noise]\n\nThey're proceeding program was paid for by the investment advisory services offered through the Harwood advisory group El Al see a registered investment advice\nRadio Nice Seventy ... LA and telling us TV two Clearwater [noise]\nGetting ready to meet the president I Rogers stern Fox News American pastor Andrew Brunson is back on American soil after two years of captivity in Turkey you arrive this afternoon a joint base Andrews near Washington and deported immediately for an Oval Office meeting with President Trump Fox's Garrett tiny is that the White House\nThe solar actually costs less per month than what they used to pay for electricity so for people that are listening if you pay a hundred and fifty bucks a month now for electricity understand that if you get rid of that bill and you go with solar you're going to pay less than a hundred and fifty bucks a month right away or right away right away\nAnd the best part is is that actually and eventually the lower payment you're paying eventually completely goes away and then you absolutely have no bill whatsoever so you're saving from the get go\nKnow what's the install like because obviously you see a when you talk about solar these big panels are that are going to be going on your roof maybe not so big it depends on what you guys are installing what are the ...\nIs it a panels and what's the cost to get those installed in the\nProcess so there's there's no money down first of all is anybody that wants to sign up for solar the best part about all of it is we install every thing before you ever have to spend the ... the whole point of that is we want to get rid of your electric bill\nBefore you start making payments for your solar so that way there is no point in time where you're coming out of pocket and we mean it there is no out of pocket expense so if you're used to paying a hundred and fifty bucks a month for electricity we're going to get rid of that bill and replace it with a solar bill that's less so like what John was saying\nAn electric bill is higher monthly payment for ever solar is a lower monthly payment for a very limited time to say that one more time so people really asked me that that's important an electric bill is a forever payment and it's a higher payment a solar bell\nIs a very short term bill and it's a much lower payment so it's kind of a no brainer to do anything right off the bat yeah actually saving money\nWhy when you say something like that and that's something that I've heard you say repeatedly and you know that saving thousands on top of it in the long run as well as the short run why aren't people jumping at this because you hear we're in the solar revolution now why are people not bought into it I feel like it's just\nPeople aren't aware yeah it's a lack of knowledge that you gotta think solar is it's not a new industry it's been around for a very long time but to the average consumer it's very new ...\nA year ago today we did not see as much information online on Facebook on television radio like about solar like we do now so it's very new to the average consumer most common I don't know if it's questioner objection or thought\nThat we've experienced people having is well how much is it going to cost or I don't have that much money to just put towards solar and that I think is the biggest reason people haven't gone with solar quicker\nIs because it's a misconception you don't have to ... you can have zero dollars in your bank account and still and you can yeah and you can still get ... for people listening with zero dollars in their bank account like myself you can have zero dollars in your bank account and you can get a full solar system installed on your home or wipe out to a lemonade your electric bill\nYour monthly payment for the solar is going to be less\nThan what you used to pay for electricity\nAnd it's a shorter term because you don't pay a forever like you would with the electric bill\nAnd it was so too it's not like you walk into target Wal Mart you don't see solar everywhere that's why there's not a lot of information on it that's why it's until it's in front of you you don't really understand it right and that's why a lot of these people that we so\nWe have to be in front of them we have to find them and sending them finding us but I feel like the game starting to change that I feel like people are starting become more aware and now we have people that call us to come out and get quotes we have this radio show where we have people that call us to come out and give them free evaluation and and it's starting to change yeah\nAnd a lot of our customers that we've helped in the past there there is some of the biggest advocates for us and solar as ... variants that first hand they had there are a hundred and fifty two hundred ... we've got customers that have had four hundred dollar bills who are now yeah eight hundred dollar bills who are now paying nine ten eleven bucks a month ... now that's one customer\nAs hundreds of dollars yeah just that month every single month yeah I mean it it's rare to run into residential properties that have bills that high but there's no exceptions to every rule there there's things out there that we run into but just for the average consumer hundred and fifty two hundred dollar bill\nJust remember that that's a bill that either you pay for the rest of your life\nOr you just do something about it and if you do something about it you're going to pay less you're going to save money this isn't invest it's an investment but it's not like\nAn investment into the stock market where you're hoping your investment pays off this is a guarantee we we guarantee the production of our systems if you're not saving what you're supposed to be saving we take care of it whether it's installing more panels whether it's you know reimbursing the difference and it doesn't happen often but\nIt it's more or less for peace of mind for homeowners that are new to this that don't really know and they're thinking well what if it doesn't work\nIt's gonna work but don't worry if it doesn't we have a procedure and steps in place to make sure that you're taking care of and that we do get it to where it needs to be so all in all at the end of the day it's absolute win win for homeowners I'm no reason no legitimate reason not to go with solar\nSo you're saying that people don't need to have money to get started first off you got it second off if something does go wrong you guys are so loyal to your customers and as I've gotten to know you guys

right foods and nothing is happening and I'm telling ya you know I've been through that before that is a I don't know if anything and be more frustrating than that you're trying it's just not happening yeah absolutely\nLauren let's say good afternoon to you in law I Want you to know and you don't understand you are a household name in our clinic but our girls absolutely love you you are an inspiration to what we do\nAnd I'm so super proud of you what you've accomplished but along the lines of what both you and run we're referring to Lara it's interesting for me every single week I've young ladies that come in their thirties or forties or fifties or sixties and they're working out five six days a week they're eating healthy they're eating organic\nAnd they're still gaining weight or they're not losing any way whatsoever you must understand it's not eat less\nAnd exercise more but its body chemistry Laurie you understand this you've gone through a forty they program awesome effort on your part but you just you dug in you did the program the right way but if your body chemistry is off track\nYour system your body is locked into fat storage that is our protocol is shifting gears but getting your system to move out of storage\nInto a beautiful holistic state of fat metabolism and that's what we want health restoration and Laura I Want to ask you every body is numbers driven all the females here in the studio they want to know how much weight did you lose during the forty days program\nI've lost a total thirty pounds\nRight you have to see you and good of a petite young lady but if you can put into perspective thirty pounds in forty days and lower I Know it goes without saying in general how do you feel\nI feel amazing um it's great because it's easy to keep it off I have not gained any weight and um I don't crave like sugars are carbs I haven't\nHad any headaches I have no more hot flashes I have no more night sweats on what they tell you when you're in your forties is like everything goes\nDownhill from there and on his way and you're going to be\nMiserable and I feel awesome and I know that you talk about sailing clean on the inside and that's how I feel and that is even more important the fact that my inside is healthy um my outside it's just a reflection on that\nImpatience always want a new law will what exactly did Lara do what was so special about her program nothing really at all Laura with home she dug in she executed the program Christine lilley and really the result speak for themselves but just super proud of you hey I Want to ask\nYou thanks so what are your your colleagues your co workers your your your kids your husband your family members think about your your transformation but some of the changes that have occurred\nUm actually um before this phone call I just had one of my colleagues say that you some weight I was like yeah like thirty pounds and um you look awesome uh my husband is so proud of me but he is like my number one cheerleader and um\nHe he thinks like I I look amazing and my friends and family and my girls are so proud of me um but they're even more proud because I I feel good about myself I wasn't feeling good about myself I wasn't selling beautiful and I hated this scale um but now it's like\nI've made friends with the scare\n'em because it's not a reflection of who I Am I'm the reflection of who I Am as how great I actually feel and how healthy I Am now\nAnd it's a big part of our program or you touched on that but showing all of you\nReally how to embrace this for a lifetime and again Ryan knows this I always go back to this\nBut I don't want to show you how to lose weight but I Want to lose weight and really doing it the right way building health again I Want to health restoration but then losing that weight Laura and keeping that weight off and so I Want permanent CNN therefore\nAs you transition out of the program it's a lot of what you're referring to today we want to show you how to just bring in the proper foods the proper foods that promote found metabolism but I Do I Want you guys on the scale\nEach and every day floating two pounds above two pounds below and I have to ask you this women\nLaw they just do and I've learned is it's just pretty awesome but women resonate with close how much fun how enjoyable for you know to put clothes on to trial new clothes to go shopping et cetera\nUm well I like that's exciting for me I went to go put on some of my close thinking you you just your mind has to catch up of where your body is [laughter] so I\nPut some clothes on and I was like these really don't fit me they really don't fit me and I was wearing a size and pushing a twelve and I\nWear like a four and some tears now and I know it's not about that but that just makes you excited because you feel good and you're close now you don't like worry about do I look fat you just and that they're just excited about shopping and I'm excited about that I don't know if my husband was excited that I needed\n[laughter] by on\nLower real quick and I want to ask you words of inspiration to reach out to the females that are in their thirties or forties the ... the fifties like you're sitting across the table with him at lunch but just breaking down our system does or program work is it truly a life transformation that one goes through\n[noise] yeah I've I've only like I Love that it and you know\nDone just for me like I Know that somebody else saying enough is that I did might not work for them but I Love that is particular to a person and\nPeople think that that hard you know to start a diet it's not a diet it's not about that that's what I tell everybody that this is about correcting your metabolism and um so my encouragement is\nJust to do it because the results come fast and um the fact that you start to feel amazing\nIf you just can't believe how good you fail and how good you fail so fast\nSo it's worth it is worth giving it a shot um even just to come in and find out where you are um and then finding out like we're visceral fat the fat fat and your body it kind of like a wake up call to say this is more than\n... pounds on the scale of this is about my health and living healthy for the rest of my life because God still has a lot for me to do [laughter]\nSo I Want to live that my life to the fullest potential and also I have two daughters who um look up to me so then seeing that changing my eating habits and what I find important in how I feel about myself I'm has resonated with them as well\nWell there you have it from Laura I mean you just listen to or you can hear it in your voice you know the successes there thirty pounds and just forty days and it it sounds like it's something

we see coming because they want to retire but they don't know how how many ... we've seen that we have showed them because we run a federal benefits analysis that you can get enough income today and actually make more if you retire that if you continue to\nWhere we just showed a climbed this past week they came in and we should um hey you can retire and get Social Security turn your pension or more income coming in then you woodworking and she sat back and said what did you say and I said it again I said just you're gonna get a pension you're gonna get Social Security you'll have more income coming in when you were tired than working\nAnd then she sat back and she said I no one's ever said that to me\nAnd we showed her we showed a tax return shouldn't pay less in taxes are going to keep more of her money and she didn't believe it but then she saw it she said oh my God what am I working then that's what we're talking about can you argue in that situation if you are a federal employee scheduled time then it with us because we can show your benefits\nVisit our website federal educators dot com if you're not a federal employee and you have\nWorked for a company for so many years let's help you understand your benefits your pension benefits\nCan you take a lump sum can you do in in service distribution was four one K. what are your options do you have to take the single payer option what can you do is there a survivor benefits these are things that we we we talk about we help you understand so you can have that a ha moment and say oh my gosh now we know what I can do that's what we do here\nBut I Know what Christ said sounds overwhelming but it's not because another thing that we are talking about many view of many of you out there have for a one case you may have a four one K. from a company who worked for years ago\nIt was still sitting there you need to give us a call so we can get that four one K. roll it over to an IRA because remember it's your money and of course many times we see people with more than one or two or three goes oh yeah you know because people are changing jobs right if you don't understand the distribution of them four one K. how to withdraw\nHow to roll it over give us a call eight one three nine zero nine zero zero two two it's so important to have you understand about what you have and then you're going to make the right decision\nTo a lady come in last week and she had too old for one case and one was uh twelve years ago there was eight years ago\nAnd we asked her one simple question who's managing your foreign one case\nThen she said nobody and you know she she doesn't work there\nNo one's helping her and she had the same allocation twelve years ago and although eight years ago when she first started\nAnd look at the market's been up but what if the market went down she has a lot of exposure and that's that's what we're talking about here is this your money let's say it again this is your money make sure you understand what your options are what is it currently doing what do you want it to do for you mean with the right advisor who's going to help you educate you and put together a plan\nAnd how many of you remember when there was a time when you could retire gracefully knowing the company that you worked for providing you and your family maybe you had a pension remember those days well a pension you'll listen this is the thing that we talked about how many of you listening to they have a pension\nAnd ... actually know what a pension is but if you do not have a pension plan we can do this on a pension plan for you\nHow many of you remember those good old days because that's a guaranteed paycheck crush the pensions Social Security and think about that for a minute because that guaranteed paycheck in the form of a pension for many people Chris is gone\nIt's not there so let me say that again that guaranteed paycheck in the form of a pension plan is gone and that's because you don't understand how to set up a pension plan like we do and help them\nBut there's good news what's the good news the good news that you can create your own family pension where you have control where you get income and if you're living\nIn something happened to you and your spouse can get the income but there's even a better benefit is if you both passed away most pension plans or pension plans stop there I Would your own family pension plan it doesn't stop\nIt stays in the family goes to your kids or your grandkids there was enough there that it will last forever if you set up the right way that's why it's so important to get a complete plan you know it was so\nWere so passionate about what we do why because people need to know what we do people need to know that there are other options

good I mean you know the the penalty kill the goal tending [noise] you know have they are going to get their shots of Tampa Bay that happened but hey you can't argue about it so far\nNo and I love the rotation of they got going on right now which are already in headman and then you've got strongman in\nMakin and then a circuit seven Coburn and you know a lot of people look at Coburn like you know public enemy number one but at the end of last year and a post season and the first two games this year I think he's played really well yeah dip into the fountain of youth one thing I've noticed I Love that you guys about his\nVicar heaven seems to be a little more aggressive all offensively this year jumping in and get no shots on goal\nAnd it's really funny to see when guys when a big trophy elected north trophy what happens next year he looks like a guy that just out to prove that wasn't a flu the what's the one another one wants to win another one and I think he keeps playing the way he has the first two games it's gonna be hard for anybody else in the league to be able to measure up to him because\nHe's the guy that he's just so imposing on the ice you just you can't miss him and I just think he's been phenomenal through the first game just jumping ended up like an adding that extra offensive element\nI think we're going to see it just call me crazy and wouldn't be the first time I ... I think they're going to happen is going to have a better year this year but I I don't I don't think that's about the ability to go to Jason point there about\nSeeing it'd be more aggressive and jumping into place two years ago he felt he had to be that guy because they lost ... ... you know he felt he had to be a God and make up the difference in the earlier\nLast year was Santos healthy in the in the strength to him in ... after he admitted he backed off a little bit [noise]\nIn in terms of jumping on the plane trying to be a part of the office and\nHe he pushed out on the second happens up scoring Greer high was Seventeen years old I think this year and they get money this way from the start yeah absolutely the potential is for twenty you absolutely does he's on a first power play as well\nSo I that's why I think numbers wise his numbers this year I think are going to be closer to what they were two years ago when he felt he had to be more of an office of guy now he knows he can be an office of guy and he's still going to be that solitude way guy both ends of\nThe art and I think two things go into that one I think even a guy like Gerard he has his partner right off the bat not Jake dodging idiots not kind of a revolving door you know a guy like danger already nobody brings to the table and it's a guy that's going to be able to stay home and he's not going to be caught up ice oh\nHeavens not going to worry about him and the second thing is you know we talked about playing number one minutes on the ... like because Ryan McDonalds here now for a full season he doesn't have to play number one minutes on the ... so that's kind of taking some of that onus off to him it can get a little bit more wrestling like take off ... that's going to help\nAnd all the power play you can find a shot a little bit more he's everybody knows it's banned posts in the lab circle to draw the rights or where everybody's shady over toward that by that is going to open him up in the in the middle there to take that shot\nOr talking about all this with the fact that and we haven't seen the ... circuit chefs the power play but the reason you betcha done it was it was playing anchoring that second unit hadn't of course when I was not going to come off\nThe ... the guy that I thought was blankets that's hockey late in the season the vitamin even though and he barely been able to get on the power play which you would think allows him to itself does that change knowing the team is struggling to ... and the fact that he is the young player with a lot of outside\nI I I think it I think it does and I and I think it should I I Would like to see retail search and with more power fight a minute because we saw what he can do last year [noise]\nYou know and we talked about as an intermission me on my resume that brought it up that this is just to me this isn't just the coaching staff saying [noise]\nSold him just a little bit if we're going to we're going to take some responsibility away from let's make sure you're doing what you need to do and then you get your candy [noise]\nYou know then you get your power plates on ... we are certainly absolutely going to see me ... good power claim it this year I don't know if that starts tonight but there's no doubt that he will be back I think manning that ah that number to power play urine and if nothing else you know you kinda you kinda feel like some of them in a storm for rhyme again and learn that situation because\nI don't play the most [noise] less than the last remaining if you want to get technical up you know it's second over Victor had I think that is really really interesting what do you look for tonight is go round the the us yeah we've got about five minutes left here on on our show\nBefore it gets that extract Columbus I think it's an interesting team just because they're almost there not a Tampa Bay the Columbus has always been one of those teams over the last three or four years everybody talked about them being\nMaybe that next team that can get over the hump but they're kind of just right here below the elite team then\nYou heard me with a air force talking about an error he thinks he's probably tried before before because they want to get something probably not going to resign yeah but how do you tell your fan base hey we're playoff team [noise] but we're going to trade our best player Jay he's arguably it's often off that's where the sleep\nWell forget about the fan base how does the ... you know when you have that whole hanging over you and we remember just a couple of years ago when we didn't know what was going on with samples and that whole contract situation I don't think it bodes well for them\nAnd when you have the injury to Seth Jones on the ... on the ... that doesn't help her out the one of the best when he's at his best he's one of the better the regular season H. L. but at the regular season point and the radio and he's in a lame\nDuck situation he it yet although we've got to know Trey cause or ... whatever it was saying you trade both those guys deadline flag waving even have hockey in Columbus [noise] yes [noise] but you will\nMarket but I mean what is it that it it just shows you\nKnow the things are when you're a professional sports team you either want to be a team that can then make or team that's kind of on the rebuilding you know like hey we're going around the worst thing forget about sports anything in life is not knowing where you stand and I think the Columbus blue jackets or that perfect example of\nThey're kind of are they contenders are they not content or that they go on a nice run when they pick up a piece out a deadline and make a deep run or could you see the thing go down like a dumpster fire and then selling off assets that the deadline get like\nNobody and no team knows that that purgatory so to speak of hockey then the Columbus which I Can't really ... years yeah they were never bad\nEnough to get a top three or pick but they would never good enough to be close to the playoff they were always picking that nine to ... and you don't get the ...\nThe only prospects at that that position so that they just kind of in some ways treading water in a lot of ways and that's why we're always talking about this in just on the cost of doing you know the the [noise] I just they just haven't been able to make them home\nAnd if they have to wait ... or\n... or ...\nI don't know what kind of a mess of soup for the team\nFor the money yeah so what kind of whole you're going to let it bother you know leverage but I mean who's going to give up player [noise]\nBecause arguably if you're doing it to trade deadline [noise] how are you trading with a who can resign um [noise] 'cause he's gonna want to be who's going to give up players at the deadline knowing that maybe that team is in contention for a playoff ... [noise] I don't know if you train them out west [laughter] ... [laughter]\nAnd I will say that perhaps even a get out of that we'll see what happens but I think the lightning rod for the rest of science for that though I think I think they're going to I wouldn't be surprised that gets you want to say\nI mean for me I'm looking forward to the golden Urbana looks like it's going to be the last ... versus ... lunar legal tenders going against one another so with that will probably be a stick by two Valentine's Day about it and we don't see any good go ahead and but uh yeah I don't think this is a game that did when the delta the lightning breaking out of there are offered\nThe scoring slump but they have so far but yeah I'm really excited to see this gold center battle\nTo best Russian goes in the world right [noise] right [noise] yes to best Ashville

coming off that for one last the ... on Thursday and while the team play better on Thursday compared to the opener against the Florida Panthers scoring through two games has been a problem\nLetting it scored just to go through two games it's certainly head scratching when you consider this was basically the same team that led the NHL in scoring last year\nLook teams are going to have their ups and downs during an eighty two games fees and that's a given but not many thought the lightning would have some issues growing coming out of the gate\nAnd it wasn't like that he didn't get scoring chances
