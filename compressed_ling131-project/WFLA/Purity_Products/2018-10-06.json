percent I I had someone in yesterday\nThey were almost three percent a year and the ease\nOkay their financial advisor as a family member and the\nWay it was a family member was hosting them on\nMy list in my industry does the ... what's your what you said in them I say to them find if we do Sherry obviously fighting rather relative show [laughter] Todd within ... investments costs money but you want to keep your expenses as low as possible but in in this industry\nNot everyone's transparent you were produced shares will do share a transparency you know everything that's unique to my firm

incredibly thoughtful\nElaborate I mean we'll person real talk answer touch that's what I think people want from a financial advisor\n... ... we can make a difference we can make a difference together

but we're all different and I'm going to tell you when you come into my front door and you meet with us\nYou're going to know at the minute you walk in the door the way you're greeted\nEverything

know that the one up do you guys you always coming here looking great smelling great and then you just got one up I had not smell Tyler yet but I'm sure it's fantastic as well so Tyler tell us about why you love these guys that these fish in home services\nReally just ... talking and whenever he's talking about the the business it's all about the customer the customer experience\nWhat we can do to help people et cetera and there's a lot of businesses out there that look solar is incredibly lucrative right and it it's blowing up but there are all about the bottom line and how many customers can we get and how much revenue can we do\nAnd and literally in the last three to four years that I've known these guys had never been about that it's how can we make this better for our customer how can we have a better back then how can we make sure that we know they're being taken care of and then their vision is is incredible\nSo they're really liked that because I've gotten to know them and I'm like trying to look for flaws and this is how you know they can be themselves and I understand you know it's how they portray themselves as well that is who they are\nYeah but you walk into the office and you feel that immediately right it's not just in they lead this group that culture is that matched I've never been in an office full of ... truly believe in helping people right and they make great money doing it that's the benefit of solar but\nThat the number one goal is to help people help customers you know what I mean bill the value and it'd be good at what you do if you don't believe in true you know just like you said you you went on vacation couldn't wait to get back right that's how we feel we all kind of have the same thing that we can't shut it off\nRight this is you know it doesn't it consumer lives we have a whole like the we love what we do we love our wraps we love our customers and I think that shows in the house we go in ...\nNow you guys got involved or how long ago how long you know when were you name the president of sales how long has that been going on and what's the future like what are you what do you see here with this partnership guys got going on here\nSo so me and Sean of if we wanted to go national for quite some time we we know it's something that that needed to happen that these products and services that we offer too great to just kind of limited to to one city or one state so it was definitely something we wanted to do a son with it\nAnd Tyler I mean this guy's given us so much information he's helped us out take our company from literally nothing to do what it is today and it's something that I think he was wanting to do it himself he wanted to be a part of something bigger and something that could really grow and expand so\nUm as far as the national side of things I mean that's exactly where Tyler comes and he he knows the solar industry better than probably anybody\nUm he is absolutely a solar expert not just of Florida but of tax is of the of the United states of the world this guy knows this industry so um if it's in great with yeah he's\nA great guy he's got a great character um and he's fits into our culture perfectly\nYeah it's it's like he's been here the whole time and speaking of timeline that was basically I'm just yes yesterday at our our company meeting is when we actually introduced him um as the president of sales and came and our teams ... they they got to spend a little bit of time with him and\nI've honestly never seen our team weren't pumped up ... they get it they know what he's bringing to the table they they immediately look at him like okay that is our leader and we trust this guy and you know he he's got the history and and the knowledge and experience to really lack of what he's all about and what he's here for so immediate credibility with our team and\nIs it seems like Tibet expansion like what does it mean for the guys get only going to help them\nRow yeah I mean they were going to create more jobs more positions with yeah you know means more money from them and more homeowners helps\nSolar experts of Florida show check them out solar experts of Florida dot com of course as always Shawn Henry and wildly fan here but they brought in their new president of sales Tyler Tucker\nWho's going to be on with us the entire show now of course you originally from Oklahoma but uh did some work in Texas as well what's it like from state to state how does it differ as far to solar goes if it does it all from state to state\nHate it depends on what part of the country you're and ride it in a lot of it has to do with utility rates things like that but solar has become\nSo efficient and so cheap that it really doesn't matter what state you're in it's becoming cheaper than electricity right everybody has an electricity bill\nHey so that it used to be in a conversational well it's got to pay off in ten Fifteen Twenty years it doesn't make sense why wouldn't make sense from day one in in literally forty eight out of the fifty states which is ...\nAnd that's what I kind of stress here and we we all we all try to do because what I Do in the mornings or nine

com but only one more segment of and they have a special guest and today\nAnd I really think and and they want to highlight him and I think it's important\nFor Tyler talk or their new president of sales who is in Studio today just to kind of talk a little bit about himself in what he does and how he got involved with them and efficient home services so it's a Tyler the floors yours Tyler talker how do you know once again getting involved with them what it means to you what the team is like what's the future look like for you and everyone else there\nThat the future's bright that's that's for sure but you know going back to the last segment or maybe one of the first segments how we met with us just you know really getting on the phone calls I I had been in this industry a little bit longer so I knew a lot of business owners people in different states and I would set up these civil\nThe mastermind right and get everybody involved and we'd go over things at work things that didn't work\nAnd then it just became to where we would find ourselves just the three of us talking almost daily right outside of though it wasn't just that\nAnd you know while he said it best we want the good guys to win right even even in the markets were in it's not just about all we want to be\nBetter than all the competition we want everybody that's doing the right thing to helping homeowners to truly do that because of the day it promotes solar promotes that makes everyone better ... absolutely right so these guys have laid an incredible foundation\nRight they have a business model that scalable right they have a culture that is again I'll say it it's unmatched\nTo be honest that's my favorite part of this I Love first of all wallet I Love making money I Love saving money it's one of my favorite things to do I cannot work in an environment where it is negative it is somewhere where it's not going to be conducive to a positive impact on what's going on in front of you on a day to day basis and they have nailed it\nYep oh I absolutely and you know with the foundation the culture with everything they've done they've set this up to to where we can go state to state this exact same model they these exact same five things we can instill in every route that comes to work force and and that's important right character you\nKnow people have good morals people truly want to help people versus just make money or or put solar on a home and move on that that's not what we're looking for that expansion is is where we're headed I think that's a big reason why I'm I'm here now\nRadio next where's the expansion so uh it always talked about yeah we are starting to go to that I've gotten into it\nYeah so Texas will be an act of or we're going to do Houston where we're going to be in Dallas Fort Worth area and then it looks like the Carolinas shortly after that\nNo we've we've talked guys about the referrals and how that can make you money just by referring\nLet's say I have a cousin in Texas\nRight and I know you guys are expanding out to Texas I'm here in Florida will I be able to refer my cousin just say hey they're moving over there they're expanding this is the time to get ahead of the game will I still get that five hundred dollars for wherever you're expanding do not so we really love this game\nAnd we're looking at more officers in Florida as well we're looking to the Jacksonville and I'm over on the east coast somewhere ports port St Lucie or St\nLucie down to West Palm beach area that in mind if your family or friends out there that are across country keep that in mind you might be telling people here but you can also be spread the word because you guys are expanding\nWillis wrote on law for sure there are we really do\nAnd what else I mean what what what do you see with these guys I mean what the future and and kind of where this has gone I mean solar obviously is and we've talked about this before I mean solar is now and if you're not getting into it and you're you're behind the eight ball so it's not too late you could still get involved but you don't want to wait and longer\nYeah I I I feel like we are definitely a part of something that that is much bigger now so we probably don't even understand\nThe magnitude of it right now right forty fifty years from now I think solar is going to be like an electricity a stay at home right so we get to be a part of something special but\nYou know with the growth with the business model with everything we have a I think the sky's the limit and and these guys you've known them you've talked to a week after week that big goals right which is something I Love about um something I respect but after looking at everything they've done truly getting to see the model that the culture\nI don't think they even understand their own ceiling ... right I truly feel like this is something that they can go state to state that we can touch and help thousands upon thousands of families truly go green save money eliminate that build that it's only going to ... year after year\nI didn't go green park for a lot of people like that is nice I think it's good for you guys it's important for a lot of people that want to speak and generalize for everyone but that's one thing I mean you hit on the ... the going green and the environmental issues which is a big deal but like the money I mean when I hear the money that is see the thousands of dollars\nThat people see the free energy ought to just by calling efficient home services check them out solar experts Florida dot com I mean to me that's where it's like the no brainer comes in\nMost people don't understand they pay a bill Marr the month right so here in Florida if your electricity bill is two hundred and fifty dollars\nWith with no inflation in minimal increases each year that the electricity companies doing a two hundred and fifty dollar bill over the next Twenty years it's sixty to sixty five thousand dollars you've spent on electric bill is that people view it as a select ... habit\nI have to pay its two fifty and if it only goes up ten bucks next year nobody's going to notice that right that they may be I use a little more electricity whatever it is they don't notice that the two to four percent increase every single year\nAnd then you look back and there's no benefit to pain that sixty five thousand other than keeping your lights on rights idea would solar is essentially eliminate that and put Fifteen twenty twenty five thousand dollars back in your pocket which is incredible\nLike you hear about investments and people are as if I Want to invest for the future I mean what better investment than this if you're a homeowner Fiona residents and you want to invest in the future I mean you're looking at stocks are looking this might not investing yourself invest in something you know is foolproof it is for\nSure yet that the return on investment in solar right now is normally ten to twelve percent on average there's very few things in the stock market right or returning every single year ten to twelve percent isn't it it's big right so people that truly understand that and think\nThat I Want to spend sixty five thousand for no benefit or do I want to turn this debt into an asset it's it's crazy and we can figure that out in twenty or thirty minutes if it's something the benefits you if there's other things we can do and again with the model they had the culture the foundation we can take this anywhere in healthy\nA little less than a minute left what do people need to know and anyone jumping shot and while you hire the guy is your body so or Tyler just speak for yourself final words what do they need to know about you and I'm ... with a future for you guys what school about this\nWho loves hoping homeowners just like we do yeah I was going to say he's you know we talked about how ... spent hours on phones with homeowners and and clients this guy's going to do the same thing ... come out to your home he'll sit down with the only answer questions will be there for any of our wraps he he ... he's one of those guys he believes in\nBeing as knowledgeable as possible about something so that way there's no question you're going to be asked that you don't have an answer to\nUm he's definitely someone you can feel comfortable and know that he's going to take care of you\nI Love the chemistry I Love the suit and I promise next week I'm going I'm going to look good here on these solar experts a Florida shy I Know I speak for for Sean and Wylie when I say Tyler thanks for coming in and sharing all this with the listener\nShe had anybody I loved it absolutely and you'll hear more next week with John Henry and while the ... the CEOs of fish in home

our traditions of bipartisan cooperation any means necessary\nTo reach their desire to and\nThey blame Dr Ford and Democrats\nFor judge Kavanaugh's flaws they were intent on shrouding the truth

was one of the most hotly debated topics in personal finance a and and it's very difficult because people think they have enough money they can just pay off the home\nAnd among homeowners age sixty the sixty nine forty one percent still had a mortgage in two thousand seven that was ten years ago\nHow many uh two thousand eight teams do they have\nThis is a large number so you know seniors are strapped for cash\nThey might want to consider what they call a reverse mortgage I Know some you might cringe but somebody that had done a reverse mortgage it makes sense and it makes sense only Chris

come playoff time he prepared to seek cuckoo going in and out of that\nLine why they bring up a good point about the ... J rush around Breton I like Brian Burns airfare Olympic part of our roundtable here at the rock which grill a section one of the six oh if you're in there and you want to suffer fibers that he mentioned the ...\nTwo things one going to be interested in the search for the typically how they adjust to the lake now the second season sometimes it takes you take a step back just because the league if you have to [noise] but if certain chef kissing which is essentially [noise] he does give the back in\nA different what does that mean he's the one guy where there is a side and if he if she's outside the sheer\nFact that it can be pretty dangerous\nYeah he's the one guy that kind of compliment what hadn't they can do all sorts of ways that other guy that could really do some of those same things that they had been provides for you or with the op ed so back in but you know former lightning GMC vitamin during his night and that is kind of weird but\nOh you have to qualify that now there but he said during his exit interview that the uh ... was playing his best hockey in the postseason so if you'd like to see that he was able to elevate his David those big situations you like to see him that now translate into that second year and for me it can he worked his way up to a cop or well\nRight now it looks like he's still in that third airway breathing ... can be elevated game a ... and\nYou know put himself up there for top or role\nAnd of course to piggyback off that air [noise] I think everybody wants to ... percent of the ... [noise] if there was one airline ration that right there was one area last year where was there ... it was it began I actually think a lot of that was just the inability to get stuck out lately from the zone\nWhen they had an opportunity to clear sometimes with lots of ... but I've got to take your point that if they wanted to say\nIt absolutely is you know those are the two things um again going back to the exit interviews a\nGeneral manager Steve argument talked about last year is that\nYou know they have to approve defense of am and he pointed and if he came into the twenty ninth overall\nThe article I Need them so that tells you how deep and talented\nA scene in the eye and is uh but yeah that's an area and and and in the hope is is that what Todd Richards moving and we saw the work he did with power play you know in the two years and turned it from what was a dumpster fire for a couple of years and we asked momentum killer\nA way absolute strength on this team the hope is that taught Richard now in charge of the defense and apparently kill speaking kind of help turn that around\nJ I think also talking about the PKK which was really interesting because they struggle but their goals or I thought was your best player last year and a hundred plus you can also allude to make that he came over it seemed like he found his role as the legitimate Sacco center and I think he accepted that role and I think didn't they understand [noise]\nX. amount of gave some of the play here and here they are pretty well do you look at the goal tending Santa Fe for vastly this year [noise] fifty five fifty eight game is what you would shoot for or you know it's like a sixty five assuming that's the thing is playing pretty well\nYeah I mean I was I Know it's probably one of the few guys last year was you know with vast these first full year uh\nI was a little worried about right about him playing too many games are but you know what I did a decent job early and then Louie dimming just kind of wrestle that away from him even booed I got healthy again to me was the mayor was and he really showed a lot especially on the road which is a lot harder you think I don't have that\nYou and the way he played the park was a little more aggressive kind\nOf makes you remember about the ... and I think to me when the theme is that transition gift that up and down I don't like the Showtime Lakers I think what the lightning taint on yeah I think that's when they get excited and not only we can make really get comfortable with the team he got yoyo pretty bad in Arizona they weren't\nCompletely up front and honest with him and his role in the organization\nI think him coming here and I'm just being transparent letting them know this is what we expect their backup you're that you're at but you know what I mean it's like it's one thing because he'd had a pretty good rookie campaign for for Arizona and then they really didn't commit to him right and it was just it it was kind of wishy washy and it's easy to be like he's approach should be able to do it but it's not easy year expecting\nTo go out there and play colleagues are very regimented sigh players and I think coming here knowing that the big cat Andre ... and the number one he can go in their number two you know that he's going to be sharp as you're playing against those studs on the ice every day when it's numbers called he's going to be ready to go I think they have the best goal tending to end up in the NHL had we've had\nSolid take their yeah Allen anywhere on Rhode Island right well that\nWe think that you've been covering him that's the only thing that I actually agree with that I mean I Would have to go through everybody's [noise] I I think actually the tandem tonight for Florida is it that\nYeah I mean I I'm not going to obviously foot long ago was that a lot of people in the long\nIs a very solid number one and ride around the table of famer along as a whole theme hair and guarantee yeah he didn't like you said the holiday ... he's playing a hall of fame I mean\nThe other the other team I I look at it is in Chicago when you bring him word in a back up I Know it's not the same ... more than ... he's got a Stanley Cup under his belt if that's the guys back in the court drop it every night it's a pretty good fan in the middle of that no but you look at this lightning team I think even though they're very very strong supporter panther slapped if it's your turn I think\nSo they're kind of my uh I don't know if it goes ... or we go next coming out here I think\nFlorida is a a playoff team I it may be Boston fly back down to earth a little bit from last year I think Iran who obviously did a lot\nYou know in the yard and they all these are they're going to be considered right there at the white name but I see Florida finishing third I think Buffalo's going to be a bit better than they've been in recent years Montreal they didn't play too poorly against Iran or the other night to everybody another team that you know as long as the price of healthy in putting together there's big performances like we've seen him do there are team that's always there and\nThey are but you're not going to win a championship unless she starts around the carrot priceless guys that can feel that had a little bit out there like I\nI'm Sorry I keep hearing about Garry price\nGet to see what are you doing around\nYeah he he can carry price of gold center who\nTurn mediocre teams into contending team and now in my opinion all he's doing is taking a left the media or team and making a mediocre\nTo me that I mean that's what good goals and he can do but you're right you have to have guys so I mean they traded the two top most wars and ... you can yes they have coke and yummy yeah their first overall paper what are you going to get out of him his year you know he's probably go down the line you know what are you going to get on a match the only other than\nGetting suspended every season got another nine that seems to have another guy the other for\nThirty something renting out you know the guy the guy or a\nYear now I mean yeah ...\nThere you go and it it looks like a major grandma he's got long hair drove by you but but again you have to surround Jonathan's room with lawyers out so tremendous play maker we saw that in his time here if you don't have somebody that can help him Spanish then then you're not going to have you know the often statue need shade Weber's on the show he was a big\nA weapon on the back and we had to shop that he has\nNow he's a ... you know so I I just I look at that march or obscene secretary price will keep them in gangs how many they're going to\nIt's almost like you're wasting your look at the just the position of those two teams we talked before about the roles guys knowing their roles there's a team in Montreal where there's a bunch of guys I have no idea what their\nWing or science center the GM wing the GM doesn't even know let's keep him because he speaks French what kind of set does that make the money to to make terrible decisions I don't care how many languages here's a shark dresser he

was with us to hold open or for the lightning and for the second straight year of Tampa Bay host the Florida Panthers the lightning when three in one versus the cat's last year including eight five three victory and they're meeting on opening night\nTampa Bay average five and a half goals per game and therefore matchups the season to go\nAnd openers had been very good some lightning recently they've won four consecutive season over is of course this is a theme that has high expectations this year sledding advanced eastern conference finals last season so the third time in the last four years and just about every one from that scene is back\nThe lending won their third all time division title last season\nAnd they made it all the way to the eastern conference find out where they lost the eventual Stanley Cup champs the Washington Capitals they average three point five goals for game last year that was most the NHL since two thousand nine two thousand ten\nYou can see why so many people like this lightning team a great deal after all they had eleven guys foreign double fingers last season they also got a legal setting from Andres off less yet forty four wins and a nine twenty the percentage from top to bottom this might be one of the deepest lightning teams in recent years\n... Johnson was asked this question a couple of days ago\nIf this is the most ... thing since being a member of a lightning I think so I\nI think that you know it's a testament to I ... that we have a lot of guys that\nEven the guys that have been sent down today that or you don't deserve to play an NHL and maybe on some other teams they might be up so you know at the internal battle for us you know to get our eyes time get her lines and everything the same time it's great for us I feel like we can really role for lines and really contribute everywhere\nNot being the lined up tonight he's dealing with an upper body Andrew not believed to be Syria not Laughlin from series that\nManage our radio was on my lightning power play live show the other night and he also things from top to bottom this lightning team is loaded\nTheir stepped up front step on the little on it picked Ryan but done it has a much better season to start with Tampa feeding their from day one and not just being thrown into it at a late juncture like he was last season after the trade with the New York rangers\nSo are they from that perspective a yeah there's that doesn't seem to be much in the way a week to solve this hockey called but again until they get the job done come springtime and you've got to do all the heavy lifting to get there was the first place but I guess the question is little doubt\nAnd one of the ways you ensure you make the playoffs is getting off to a fast start Tampa Bay one tenth two and one in October last season which was the best opening month in franchise history by the time November rolls around letting out a five point lead on the next best team in eastern conference\nThat great start in park allow them to finish the season with a hundred and Thirteen points and fifty four when\nBoth franchise record John Cooper knows it's important to start fast\nI Know that you're you know when the Stanley Cup\nIn October but you should give yourself or really much better chance make the playoffs if you get off to prepare for it will be the first team to tell you in Tampa being the year before you fall behind you can have marketable finish\nFor thirty days as filmmaking because roads chase and so we're not to do that is cut off to a good start and\nYou have not\nSeen ... believes getting as many wins is possible early on will only help this team moving forward\nGiven you see a lot of the game and they you know the Bush and through the years so I think last year was a great indication of\nHad a good training camps are well prepared and lose straightening low and that gave us some leeway throughout the year is get them to start and\nCatch is going on the same page alternative\nGame planning and all you know what's going on and get\nIn many windows beginning and that was a good recipe difference last June to just\nLet's get an inside look at tonight's game thank the Tampa Bay times get more than the score from the Tampa Bay times in print than online make sure you subscribe to a Tampa Bay dot com\nWell we know how good rating point was last season and he was terrific against the Panthers he led the lightning with four goals against Florida in fact he was finished with eight points of peace against the Panthers and therefore matchups last season he sat down with our own Jason ... discuss the opener\nHow much the excitement is Eric ... the entire week leading up to opening night yeah I mean\nThere's tons um hottest it's what you\nJust trained for all summer and what your words so I'm\nFinally it has to play on\nOn opening night it's a it's super

you can't get\nToo excited and and not think I guess um you know the promotion and check you still find a gamer involves all the same thing and I'm ready for that but uh we we worked hard all week and um [noise] I think we're we're going to run for it and it should be spending so\nWhat do you expect Florida to bring to the St Louis seem you saw a lot in the pre season\nYeah they're they're they're fast and and they've got a ton of scale um [noise] you know they they're they're very telling me came they're very good hand or do they play a game so we're really skating and are competing for a rare
