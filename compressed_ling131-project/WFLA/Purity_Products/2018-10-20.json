{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "But with that being said what I'm seeing with almost everyone that come to the door is your portfolios are invested in my opinion typically in the wrong places\nThat you could be doing either much better or have much less risk or overall uh there's so much room for improvement and I'm telling you I mean people coming and they've been with her the visor Fifteen Twenty years I mean people that come in to manage your own money have been doing it for Twenty years themselves smart people\nA room for improvement there's always room for improvement don't close your eyes and think that I'm okay and then we go through another two thousand eight and you're sorry\nYou know let me equate this to physical exercise\nIf you have the same routine all the time if if you if you talk to a doctor's if you talk to a physical therapists a ... a trainers\nThey'll tell you that you you need to mix up your exercises you don't want to do the same thing constantly and I think the same thing goes for finances at what if you're just in the same\nTrajectory the same rut then you're on that same hamster wheel over a long period of time well what if what if you're in on the wrong hamster wheel\nWell even more importantly what I'm seeing you know we adjust portfolios we stay up with things we we're one of the few independent firms actually have the\nUh the financial managers internal in house with us it saves our clients money it allows us to make good decisions in a timely manner is a right way to do things what I'm saying is people are investing with your professional advisors in the wrong places I mean places they have so much risk\nYou know you look at the world you got to the United states you've got international you've got emerging markets you've got real estate you got technology you have all these places you could invest some of those are good and some of those are bad and what most financial advisors do Todd is they put a little bit of everywhere\nThat's not healthy why would you invest in something you expect to go down\nYou know you don't expect them all to go up right of what we can do is sit together look at your portfolio\nSay well look this is good here but maybe you need an improvement there or a risk is a big deal with me I Know my my goal is that you get your destination is safe way as possible and and maybe just maybe you're not doing that and and what if we sat together for a few minutes\nAnd we had a nice meeting and I was able to show you how to maybe find a safer way to accomplish their goals is that worth an hour of your time\nYou know so so it is important to come in it's important to have the right balance in life and you're right if you exercise the same muscle over and over a year not healthy that doesn't make you healthy as the balance of makes you healthy that's what we can show you how to do and we could show you how to do it\nIn a challenging market like this\nI think much safer than what you're doing I say a thing because I haven't seen your portfolio we haven't met yet\nBut but I I bet you that we can teach you some things that are simply going to make you do better a ... that's the most important thing about CPR is the ability to come in and improve because we spent time together\nAnd it's a simple process a lot of people are I I use that hamster wheel in the same exercise regimen and\nThey haven't made adjustments and the fact is is that\nGood investing requires active eyes and I love the fact Bob\nThat you know your team you're analysts there in the house and you're not you're not relying on others of course you draw from ... in look at opinions and you look at strategies across the board but your core team\nIs internal it's right in the heart would officers right here in Tampa Bay area\nAnd that's important I mean that is really essential you know the ... they're not satisfying some big wall screen for him and and stock holders up in New York City it's it's a right here in Tampa Bay and I think that makes a huge\nHuge difference or I could even say you know ... different folks the number is eight hundred\nThree nine five forty two Seventy nine and I and I can't stress enough you know what I hear I heard the stories of people that have listened to this radio show for years and they finally after a long time so you don't want to

your clients and they they love you guys and I I had a ... a guy I Can't remember his name but he told me listen I've been listening to you guys on the radio for for a while\nAnd I finally came in and I love the Harwood team and he says his only regret was that he wished that he actually cold in sat for CPR and joins your team\nSooner that that was his regret that he wish he would have got their earlier folks the number to call is eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine\nNow that is the number to make an appointment to have the Harwood team looked at your current portfolio and

website and we'll see you next to [noise]\nUm for most people it it's kind of a no brainer\nIt as a no brainer and also if you have another quote from another solar company let us come out and give you a quote from us because we ran to a few companies this week there were under seizing systems for homeowners and oh yeah that was that's awful that's they're they're lying to you so a lot less than professionals come out when\nOr how often does that happen where people are just like completely lied to yeah I mean I I'd\nSay there's a lot of the house as we go to it seems like there's probably three or four other companies that they've talked to and I'd say at least half of them if not more are given them very inaccurate information telling them you only need this many panels to save this much money on your bill\nAnd when we do the math it's like they're not even going to cut their bill and half and you know like I was saying earlier not everyone knows this stuff the average consumer\nIsn't a solar expert so they don't know they're trusting the sales guy to tell them the truth and unfortunately it doesn't always happen\nBy those sales guys coming from and I don't want to name any names but are these like bigger companies or with a lot of employees because you guys always like that to you know really hit on the fact that your family at fishing home services\nUm honestly they could come from any company me and care yeah there's a few other companies out there I won't name any names but we've run into a few and they're definitely under seizing system is not going to be the same company that's not going to be here for you and two years of your breaker trips in your your system goes off line for a second you have to have somebody come out there\nYou know you're going to end up calling us are calling a company that's been in business and you're gonna end up spending money to its service\nI think you guys brought up something important that if somebody has gotten a quote from another solar company why not call you guys for free and at least find out like don't just stick with one let's see what else is out there and kind of match 'em up against each other\nYeah it's not going to hurt at all if if they don't like us okay at least that makes them feel better about who they already went with but I think a lot of the times they are going to see that\nThere was a there is some information that they they didn't give him um a lot of times to continue touching on these other companies that are under seizing systems a lot of it's just due to them not being educated on on what it is I I don't think there's\nThat many people out there that are purposely trying to rip people up I think a lot of it just comes from an especially with a lot of knowledge lack of knowledge with these new or solar companies these ones that just pop out of nowhere\nWell we've noticed is there some of 'em they pop up every couple of months and then they're gone and then there's another one and they're gone and they just don't know what they're telling yet they haven't done the right research\nHow does your team no though because you\nGuys had you always talk about your team how your rally around your team what gives you the confidence because I Know you guys\nClearly being the experts getting to know you but I mean we'll get to know some of your teammates along the way here in the next weeks but what about that and that you can you can know deep down I Know you guys trust you guys that when they're out in the field they can be trusted\nBut one we've been there we've gone to trial and error free on us I mean we've perfected this\nWe train more than any other solar company and the business I guarantee you that we told him sometimes strange a three to five days a week yeah on seizing systems on a numbers on how to do professional energy out not just so I was a solar systems actually go through the home and find the inefficiencies in the house\nYeah making sure that the roof has enough room for the panel making sure it's facing the right direction and making sure it's not covered by you know forest of trees before you know were signing somebody out for one of our packages you know we\nWould rather let somebody know hey we're not going to be able to help you then try to kind of BS our way through something just to get a salad that it'll it's going to be a nightmare and the N we'd rather not put ourselves through that um especially not you know a homeowner\nThis is the solar experts of Florida show if you're just joining us

for you guys to kind of bringing the team to what you've been building I mean we've only just gotten started here with the solar experts of Florida show but to bring them into kind of see what what you guys are growing up where you\n... it was really cool I mean we we talk about so often you said just a few minutes ago we're we're a family ADA chest so we we want to bring them around this and and let them experience that I Know a lot of the team was\nExcited just about the fact that me and Sean have been doing this but to actually get to come up here to take a look at things I think it was really cool they really enjoy themselves and it was something different than just sitting in an office you know they got to get out and\nTry something else that was cool it was great we we really appreciate it\nI got to be honest the or the talk around I one person came up to me and they're like so I was like a cool crew as we look at\nThat were family man we uh we have a good time and we have found them to help people we all have that one thing in common is um is helping people up\nSolar experts of ...\nThe dot com or by the way people free if you just want the appointment the audit the free energy audit you reach out to these guys and you guys just give it to them for free and then once they're on board they have your number they can call you whenever they want right\nOf course here's the thing if if I came to you and I said I could give you fifty thousand dollars for thirty minutes of your time would you tell you\nWhy would I Would definitely listen to it that it was ... I mean I'd be like really well look comes with it I mean right what's the what's the what's the catch why\nWell let's see the catch the going green and getting solar um ... it's not free so if any one thing that solar is going to be completely free will will dead that one for you it's going to cost them money but just anything and just like anything you know nothing is free so honestly that is the catch to\nThe solar experts in Florida now continues on nine Seventy WFL a tune in every Saturday and two pm to learn how solar said you thousands here again or your host Aaron Jacobs Shawn Henry and Wylie fanning [noise] wrapping up\nHere on these solar experts of Florida show these shows always go by so fast but\nNo different this week learning so much a throughout the the show but really most importantly guys\nAnd save thousands upon thousands of dollars all you have to do check them out at solar experts Florida dot com this is the solar\nExperts of Florida show and we've been over you know how much money you're going to save and that's great that's that's for me at least and I'm sure a lot of people uh that's that's the big one is saving the money but there are some incentives that go into solar aside from saving money right\nAbsolutely yeah there's there's all kinds of stuff I mean right now there what what's happening as\nYou can actually get your entire system installed without having to put any money down whatsoever so\nI'm In a in a lot of cases we give people anywhere from twelve to Eighteen months where they can actually take the whole entire time period where they don't pay a dollar for the solar system so what that means obviously we know what twelve months in Eighteen months no payment says but\nWhen you're looking at savings that means a year to year and a half or you just get to save money no electric bill no solar bell and immediately month one after its installed you're putting money back into your pocket\nI don't want to give anybody any ideas but is there like are there are scammers that try to take advantage of that\nI'm sure there are scammers out there that do try and take advantage of the ideas but I I mean the mind that that that happens to people all the time I mean that's where credit comes into play with us in life you know I think something like that obviously is not something we recommend doing because\nNot around ... you'll probably end up you know at the very least I'm taking a major hits your credit and nobody wants to especially this day and age that's that's not in the right but it is fraught and\nYou know that that's not something that we've ever do I've never had that happen to us because we have customers that there there's best wishes yeah but something like that though it's not like they're going out and buying some you know big screen TV and surround system on twelve months no payments like\nIt if they're paying for their electric bill now than they are going to have the money or so\nAnd these are homeowners like these are people that just don't have you know if they own a home they are going to be able to have the money they electricity\nIs if you're going to afford to pay your electric bill you can definitely definitely afford to pay for solar\nYeah I mean think about that though if you've got a hundred and fifty let's say you got a two hundred dollar average electric bill and you get Eighteen months where you don't have any payments that's thirty six hundred dollars\nOver the next year and a half you're putting directly back in your pocket so whether whether you need that thirty six hundred for something else or you just want to see a pile up in your bank account so a lot of money that you can save didn't want to have already six senators or if your bills less than that it's still twenty four hundred bucks after that Eighteen months that that's a huge amount of money\nAnd you're not really doing anything different you're still using your light your air conditioning fridge everything the same way as before you don't have to adjust your lifestyle and that all that and not at all yeah that that's why we love solar so much to is going to have to adjust you don't have to do anything different\nYou know the electric company comes out and tries to show people how to save money but it's all about changing the way they live oh you need to set your thermostat\nAt this number not the number you want\nWhat about like I like to fall asleep with my TV on it's just it's a comfort thing to do it every day and said okay I see my bill or it out and kill your belt you know the the biggest the biggest drain on your electric bill honestly is going to be your AC for one cause where we live in Florida it's about fifty to sixty percent of your bill\nUm water heater heat and water is expensive ... those are the two biggest things that are going to contribute to Ohio electric bill\nAfter that that is when you got all your appliances and things like that\nYou have a what do you have three kids were for kids ... because I remember when I was kid my mom or dad always yelling at me just turn the lights off before you go that yeah well mine are all still pretty\nYoung so not all of them can reach the light switch yet but a couple of them do and yes we definitely you know ask them to at least before we leave the house we'd like them to turn the lights off\nWhat an impact in that and like when I'm a dad eventually I don't want it to yell at something like that I Want that to just like there's going to be so many other things and we don't want to yell at them for I don't want that to be one of them\nNow I get it depends I mean we used ... at my house so you know depending on your bowl but if you're still using a a light bulb that was designed thirty forty years ago then yeah you're going to have more usage from running your lighting but if you switch and they're so cheap now\nSo cheap you know that's why we're fishing home services orders ... come in and we do a full assessment as just give you a solar assessment will go over your lighting where if you're a see your insulation in your water heater your ... and we we show you how to bring down that front loaded before we put solar\nOn the home absolutely check him out solar experts of Florida dot com make sure to download that podcast as well you can check it out on the eye heart radio after you always want to have that let's ...\nAbout the federal tax credit guys this huge yeah federal tax credit is is beautiful right now so ... there's a lot of confusion\nNot everyone knows who qualifies and who doesn't and that's what a lot of the solar companies have gotten themselves in trouble with\nIs telling everybody they qualify for the federal tax credit and that ... uh that's that's that's shady right it is and it's one of those things you know it's happened to us in the past we've had a rap who really just didn't get the fact that not everyone qualifies\nSo than trying to say that you bring up shady that like a scam or is that than just not knowing\nIt's just I'm a well sometimes it can be them not knowing but I'd say Ninety percent of the time they're blatantly lying and\nIt's a combination of both you know we we've we've let somebody go ... or maybe they they they clearly listen to everybody in our company knows how it works and if we literally that a training on it a couple of days before and you're going out and given the wrong information that's not a lack of knowledge that are on live solar cautions though that that person we got rid of right away but\nAnd I didn't that goes to show about what your team is obviously you guys are a family but you also stressed accountability and the guys who didn't know what they're talking about guys or girls need to know what they're talking about so accountability is important\nYou know we haven't fired a sales rep probably in the last year yeah I'll be honest with you I mean that just shows our culture and and kind of how we do things as we have we haven't had to get rid of anybody\nWell we got we got a really good group though and we're we're definitely not going to let one bad apple spoil it for everybody\nElse is getting a little guys listen if somebody here's okay if you guys are close knit group somebody gets like go because they don't have any idea what they're talking about when it comes to the federal tax credit they're lying or whatever it is and they don't know when they get caught you're all their employees are going to go well they got caught and canned for it I don't want her to ... to me and that's how good businesses are supposed to be retrained\nOn it so there's no risk you know excuse on any of the stuff that we roll out that if people are lying if it were under seizing systems if they're not being up front about the tax credit they don't have a place with you just\nChecking out on line solar experts of Florida dot com before we wrap it up any final thoughts before we wrap it up for the week a final thoughts\nUm one thing I did want to actually touch on is I Do want to let people know what the federal tax credit\nIt is an income based tax credits so what that means is if you pay income tax\nThan you are eligible for the tax credit that is super important and I hate to ended on that but people need to know that if you're paying a tax for making money you qualify for this tax credit or what's ended on how much is the evaluation\nOh the evaluation I got caught my calculator real quick actually hold on one second oh wait a minute it's free\nIt's free ... check them out solar experts a Florida dot com will not cost you anything just to reach out to them and by the way it makes sure of course as I said earlier download that podcast so you always have us that's it for us Eric Jacobson ... have yourself a great week\nThe proceeding was a paint program paid for by efficient home services or Florida El Al see\nBenefits some of the changes that you've experienced by going through our forty day life changing process\nYeah there are a thing that I think somebody asked me what was the big us than it was like all equal I hit the period of time you ask me about\nFor slate lost the primary reason for going on and I found out that that's more of a side benefit because at the cellular level it sounds a little crazy but\nAt the cellular level I can call my body has changed the things that I used to\nLike go crazy for it's like what I don't even want it anymore and they're you know al ... thing that I was taught and how have things I'm able to do now that I wasn't physically capable of because at the cellular level and at the Oregon level my body wasn't able\nWasn't able to I was trying to get to do what I was asking him to lose weight\nYeah and I love how you speak on that theme ... patients want to know what is the program and it's so unique froze Ryan and we're in the studio a couple of weeks away in a medical doctor that was on a radio program but he's been through a forty they process here he is a year or two later he's locked into his brand new waits a point\nBut Julie he said the exact same thing that you said he said only cellular level it has such a beautiful way of transforming how your body works how your body functions how you sleep\nAt night how you rest how you move how you breed but it's kind of getting your body into the optimal state of healing\nAnd then it doesn't have a beautiful way of bringing down your level of information and so Julie I Want to ask you how are you resting at night and what is your level of energy like\nAll of that is going on you know really really good at the ... the part in haircut people late understand a little bit of a spiritual transformation and I'll explain that\nReal quick before answer your question that when I asked rounding work I thought you know and I have a lightning Raj things on my porch and all that and I didn't make any sense to me and then after understanding what are the counselor that where they're like oh okay\nI understand that and an artistic experience so I can tell you that he can't take anyone can and can't going to have all\nGotten together and it all works or just stick clay a which is extraordinarily point\nPort sleeping I sleep now [laughter] I don't have a lot of energy I a workout pool and granted it's an older person workout group I'm keeping up with the all male instructor\nOr hadn't been able to do that before because of the ... so bad that\nEven in the pool at just one\nThat wasn't able to keep up not only that I made a little shy and I'm able to do a lot of things that I hadn't been able to do for a long time a man Lincoln into our adoption and financial and proudly they were kind enough to wear a smaller ... blood pressure cup at the doctor's\nOffice right\nYeah yeah yeah so I'm thrilled to say that anger right medical doctors don't understand\nAt all hero\nAaron ... understand a little bit better with that because it gave her the same\nThing here she had to understand that it was a center just experience you can't take a singular piece of it and expect it tore um it's very cool and out of the body are you know what we're trying not that track that negative train of thought anymore it's\nStarting to work better and better and better and better\nI Love a lot of what you're saying 'cause a lot of it goes back to nurturing the cell nursing the Oregon but providing your system your body and\nYou know that descriptive term that you're using Julie but synergistic ally but providing your body with the proper nutrients the proper trace minerals\nThe proper nutritional support and that's what's sneaks your system out of fat storage you know our culture today or community where all locked into fat storage Julie because we're all burning sugar\nThat's the premise behind this program not dieting not weight loss but fat metabolism it's health restoration and it's kind of a beautiful process because we're not using drugs and shots and pharmaceutical pills and\nAppetite suppressant but it's nutrition and health transformation and you've done such an amazing job and I want to ask you what are some of your friends and individuals that exercise with you you talked about the pool but what they said about some of your changes\nOh the people that I may have had a thirty thousand twenty something down ... different show it on a person I had a lot of muscle but they are caught and can I have to tell you I think I Would add ... wedding\n[laughter]\nWell I uh\nBoyfriend proposed over weight and then I I have a feeling that some of the weight loss ... lotion on transformation that his notice has also made it you know has contributed to that proposal show\nYeah sometimes sometimes that you know the physical affects that you feel from getting healthier and of course losing weight eat eat changes how you act like you know about changes your personality it brings you back to the person and a lot of times you'll hear people say I went back to the person that I remember you know ... or I have these health problems\nAnd mind your own little different I buy a ... some kind of thing to go down but when you put that bar in front of me just like if you put a bar and a twenty or in the future or whatever any good if you're out wearing become a better plan right now\nThat are shown program actually had done\nAnd I didn't want to go back to being whatever I Want to go back in high school and so on and so and I saw it but I wanted to be very very best that I see now and how I\nFeel physically and mentally spiritually um the whole nine yards and little did I realize that spiritual transformation going the way like I think are important for

Medicare if you're turning sixty five\nUm and you want information about Medicare supplements give us a call we can do a free comparison there's so much out there right now people get inundated

help so of course those are important things you know Medicare\nI'm a federal employees that we do and then you know a lot of things coming up now about ... and again we talked about before about income planning how do we get more money how do we preserve all money the Maggie plan which is a tax plan and insurance plan\nAnd income planned an investment plan if your advisors not talking about these issues we just gave you a reason to give us a call eight one three nine zero nine zero zero two two we have offices in St Pete we have an office in palm harbor in an office includes so look folks you can get to us anyway or wherever you live it's real simple\nUp to you pick up the phone and give us a call it's that simple\nAnd this is talk about the importance of that or getting a second opinion first advisor can't give you a second opinion ... you know most time what we see it as people come in they have these these these statements needs throwing her desk when at three them and at five and I just have a whole pile\nAnd they just don't know what it does or when they were doing and what they're doing or what it what it is doing right now but when people need money they just kind of get to state and then they say I'll just withdraw the money from there\nBut what if they knew that they can take it from a ... tax free account as opposed to a taxable account would they\nWould they want to know and most advisors don't tell them they just sell them something and as if a new show with the we put together a plan you know every account that you have has a specific purpose and designed for it so if you're looking for income will show you how to take the income from that\nBucket or if you need more you know income or a for a large purchases if you want to go on a cruise or travel around the world whatever it is you can take it from another bucket but it's going to be in the most tax efficient way\nThat's what we're talking about strategically putting together a plant and you don't have to have a lot of money to do this is just knowing what you want to accomplish either it's more income more growth of leave a legacy or reduce your taxes what is it\nSo here's the other question if you have an advisor or you don't have an advisor than we can help you in any way in other words if you have an advisor and you're not sure what he's doing\nCome in and let's do a comparison for you will do a free comparison and this is the best thing we've told many people that came in bringing your plan and will tell you if it's good or if it's bad now couple of things happen if it's good\nAs ... we're going to tell you it's good because that's the responsibility we have but for someone to tell you if it's bad where you need improvement and we give these strategies and
