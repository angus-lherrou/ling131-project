always coming here looking great smelling great and then you just got one up I had not smell Tyler yet but I'm sure it's fantastic as well so Tyler tell us about why you love these guys that the fishing home\nServices really just ... talking and whenever he's talking about the the business it's all about the customer the customer experience\nWhat we can do to help people et cetera and there's a lot of businesses out there that look solar is incredibly lucrative right and it it's blowing up but they're all about the bottom line and how many customers can we get and how much revenue can we do\nAnd and literally in the last three to four years that I've known these guys had never been about that it's how can we make this better for our customer how can we have a better back then how can we make sure that we know they're being taken care of and then their vision is is incredible\nSo they're really liked that because I've gotten to know them and I'm like trying to look for flaws and this is how you know they can be themselves and I understand you know how they portray themselves as well and that is who they are\nYeah but you walk into the office and you feel that immediately right it's not just in data lead this group that culture is that matched I've never been in an office full of ... truly believe in helping people right and they make great money doing it that's the benefit of solar but\nThat the number one goal is to help people help customers you know what I mean bill the value and it'd be good at what you do if you don't believe in it true you know just like you said you you went on vacation couldn't wait to get back right that's how we feel we all kind of have the same thing that we can't shut it off\nRight this is you know it doesn't it can seem our lives we have the whole like we love what we do we love our rats we love our customers and I think that shows in the house we go it mhm\nNow you guys got involved or how long ago how long you know when were you name the president of sales how long has that been going on and what's the future like what are you what do you see here with this\nPartnership guys got going on here so so me and Sean of if we wanted to go national for quite some time we we know it's something that that needed to happen that these products and services that we offer too great to just kind of limited to\nTo one city or one state so it was definitely something we wanted to do as Sean was saying Tyler I mean this guy's given us so much information he's helped us out take our company from literally nothing to 'em what it is today\nAnd it's something that I think he was wanting to do it himself he wanted to be a part of something bigger and something that could really grow and expand so um as far as the national side of things I mean that's exactly where Tyler comes and he he knows the solar industry better than probably anybody\nUm he is absolutely a solar expert not just a Florida but of tax is of the of the United states of the world this guy knows this industry so um he fits in great with yeah he's a\nGreat guy he's a great character um and he's fits into our culture perfectly\nYeah it's it's like he's been here the whole time and speaking of timeline that was basically I'm just yeah yes yesterday at our our company meeting is when we actually introduced him um as the president of sales and came and our teams are actually looked into it they they got to spend a little bit of time with him and\nI've honestly never seen our team more pumped up ... they get it they know what he's bringing to the table they they immediately look at him like okay that is our leader and we trust this guy and you know he he's got the history and and the knowledge and the experience to really lock up what he's all about and what he's here for so immediate credibility with our team and\nIs it seems like Tibet expansion but what does it mean for like you guys get it's only going to help them\nRow yeah I mean there were going to create more jobs more positions with yeah you know means more money from them and more homeowners helped\nSolar experts of Florida show check them out solar experts of Florida dot com of course\nAs always Shawn Henry and Wylie fan here but they brought in their new president of sales Tyler Tucker who's going to be on with us the entire show now of course you originally from Oklahoma but uh did some work in Texas as well what's it like from state to state how does it differ as far to solar goes if it does at all from state to state\n... it depends on what part of the country you're an right it is a lot of it has to do with utility rates things like that but solar has become\nSo efficient and so cheap that it really doesn't matter what state you're in it's becoming cheaper than electricity right everybody has an electricity bill\nHey so it ... it used to be the conversation of well it's got to pay off in ten Fifteen Twenty years it doesn't make sense now that makes sense from day one and and literally forty eight out of the fifty states which is ...\nAnd that's what I kind of you know stress here and we we all we all try to do because what I Do in the mornings or nine Seventy WFL a when we come and do this show during the weekend on Saturday we talk about you know what is the impact\nFor the listener and like it it always goes back to one big thing uh saving money and a lot of it you just have a lot of money when you do this and also what you guys do at efficient on services\nFree energy ... so it doesn't cost anything to just find out the information we talked about this on previous shows we talked about it a lot last week that if people just want to give you a call ... reach out check out solar experts Florida dot com and then they can call you guys you guys are always on speed dial for them\nAbsolutely oh ... yeah they're going to do yeah they they for the longest they've been getting me and Sean's number now they're also going to have Tyler's number as well so um as I said it or I spent an hour on the phone with the customer the other day just answering questions helping out and that's where you're going to get from all of us and everybody else that's on our team here for you\nWe want to answer your questions it's great that everything's free but they're still information that people want to know and we've got the answers for him so I'm\nThirty minutes ... you know thirty thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars absolutely\nA lifetime of saving really or is it something long term to really think about what is the future I'm Sorry that you're going to lose you just\nTouched on that a little bit more part of the value of that energy audit\nRight solar may not make sense for them right and when our reps are really good about going in in and letting them know look carrier options here was what we can do\nThat there's going to be a lot of free information little things they can do themselves right to thirty minutes they may be able to save you know five five hundred bucks a thousand bucks Fifteen hundred bucks without moving forward but I Would say eighty to Ninety percent of the people we see\nSolar is cheaper than electricity frightened by us doing that on it were truly identifying the problem we're not just putting solar on we're figuring out where the the home is losing losing energy\nFixing the problem putting a solution together and and giving them a bill that's cheaper than what they're currently\nPaying this is why I can see how you guys get along the three of you and why Sean Wiley are connected with you I Know obviously they've looked known him for a long time Sean mentioned how long he's known you but\nUm you know you mentioned one thing I caught from that little nugget his if solar is not right for them to ... not right for all of them you know one thing I've learned about ... they're going to be honest with you\nThey're not going to try to do just to take your money that's not going to help you that's not going to help them so clearly just from that little nugget of information you get you see eye to eye with them on that\nAnd that's honestly why from your listeners out there if you guys have already got a solar quote give us a call and give us an opportunity to come out and give you another quote don't just rely on one company or to give you a quote in trust what they're saying let us come out and let us let us be the ones that actually show you the right way to do\nHonestly we want to see the solar industry succeed as a whole so even if it's one of our competitors if if that's what we want to call them um if you just want to send us what they showed you and have us verify that it's okay and that you're not going to be in a bad situation will do that for you just kind of help out obviously we're going to want the opportunity to earn your business but\nUm we have no problem just kind of taking care of protecting not only the homeowners but the name of the solar industry because\nWe've talked about it before you know a couple of bad apple\nThese guys we got to start doing Facebook lives in here so you can see the tongue foolery going on in the studio\nEvery Saturday here on nine Seventy WFL a of course you can check out the solar experts of Florida on the podcast when you go download the podcast on ... radio downloaded I aren't radioactive alive at all the time check them out on line solar experts of Florida dot com but only one more segment of and they have a special guest and today\nAnd I really think and and they want to highlight him and I think it's important\nFor Tyler talk or the new president of sales who is in Studio today just to kind of talk a little bit about himself in what he does and how he got involved with them and efficient home services so it's a Tyler the floors yours Tyler talker how do you know once again getting involved with them what it means to you what the team is like and what's the future look like for you and everyone else there the\nFuture's bright that's that's for sure but you know going back to the last segment or maybe one of the first segments how we met was\nUs just you know really getting on the phone calls I I had been in this industry a little bit longer so I knew a lot of business owners people in different states and I would set up these somewhat mastermind right and get everybody involved and we'd go over things that work things that didn't work\nAnd then it just became to where we would find ourselves just the three of us talking almost daily right outside of though it wasn't just that\nAnd you know Wylie said it best we want the good guys to win right even even in the markets were in it's not just about all we want to be\nBetter than all the competition we want everybody that's doing the right thing that's helping homeowners to truly do that because of the day it promotes solar promotes us makes everyone better ... absolutely right so these guys have laid and incredible foundation\nRight they have a business model that scalable right they have a culture that is again I'll say at its unmatched\nTo be honest that's my favorite part of this I Love first of all while it I Love making money I Love saving money it's one of my favorite things to do I cannot work in an environment where it is negative it is somewhere where it's not going to be conducive to a positive impact on what's going on in front of you on a day to day basis and they have nailed it yep\nOh I absolutely and you know with the foundation the culture with everything they've done they've set this up to to where we can go state to state this exact same model\nThey these exact same five things we can instill in every route that comes to workforce and and that's important right character you know people hadn't good morals people truly want to help people versus just make money or or put solar on home and move on that that's not what we're looking for\nThat expansion is is where we're headed I think that's a big reason why I'm I'm here now radio next where's the expansion so uh it always talked about yeah we are starting to learn about it I got into it yes they're Texas will be an act of or we're going to do Houston where we're going to be in Dallas Fort Worth area and then it looks like the Carolina shortly after that\nNo we've we've talked guys about the referrals and how that can make money just by referring let's say\nI have a cousin in Texas right and I know you guys are expanding out to Texas I'm here in Florida will I be able to refer my cousin to say hey\nThey're moving over there they're expanding this is the time to get ahead of the game will I still get that five hundred dollars for wherever you're expanding do not so we're way I Love this game\nAnd we're looking at more officers in Florida as well we're looking to Jacksonville and I'm over on the east coast somewhere ports port St Lucie or St\nLucie down to West Palm beach area that in mind if you have family or friends out there that aren't Ross country keep that in mind you might be telling people here but you can also be spreading the word because you guys are expanding will throw it on law for sure yeah yeah what we were to do\nAnd what else I mean what what what do you see with these guys I mean what the future and and kind of where this has gone I mean solar obviously is and we've talked about this before I mean solar is now and if you're not getting into it and you're you're behind the eight ball so it's not too late you could still get involved but you don't wanna waiting longer\nYeah I I I feel like we are definitely a part of something that that is much bigger now so we probably don't even understand the magnitude of it right now right forty fifty years from now I think solar is going to be like electricity is a day at home right so we get to be a part of something special but\nYou know with the growth with the business model with everything we have a I think the sky's the limit and and these guys you've known them you've talked to a week after week that big goals right which is something I Love about um something I respect but after looking at everything they've done truly getting to see the model that the culture\nI don't think they even understand their own ceiling mhm right I truly feel like this is something that they can go state to state that we can touch and help thousands upon thousands of families truly go green save money eliminate that build that it's only going to ... year after year\nI didn't go green park for a lot of people like that is nice I think it's good I mean for you guys it's important for a lot of people that want to speak and generalize for everyone but that's one thing I mean you hit on the going green and the environmental issues which is a big deal but like the money I mean when I hear the money that is see these thousands of dollars\nThat people save the free energy ought to just by calling efficient home services check them out solar experts a Florida dot com I mean to me that's where it's like the no brainer comes in\nMost people don't understand they pay a bill Marr the month right so here in in Florida if your electricity bill is two hundred and fifty dollars\nWith with no inflation and and minimal increases each year that the electricity companies do it at two hundred and fifty dollar bill over the next Twenty years it's sixty to sixty five thousand dollars you've spent on electric bill is that people view it as a select ... have\nI have to pay its two fifty and if it only goes up ten bucks next year nobody's going to notice that right I think maybe I use a little more electricity whatever it is they don't notice that the two to four percent increase every single year\nAnd then you look back and there's no benefit to paying that sixty five thousand other than keeping your lights on right idea with solar is essentially eliminate that and put Fifteen twenty twenty five thousand dollars back in your pocket which is incredible\nYou hear about investments and people are as I Want to invest for the future I mean what better investment than this if you're a homeowner Fiona residents and you want to invest in the future I mean you're looking at stocks are looking at this might not invest in years\nSelf invest in something you know is foolproof it is for\nSure yet that the return on investment and solar right now is normally ten to twelve percent on average there's very few things in the stock market right or returning every single year ten to twelve presented it it's big right so people that truly understand that and think\nThat I Want to spend sixty five thousand for no benefit or do I want to turn this debt into an asset it it's it's crazy and we can figure that out in twenty or thirty minutes if it's something the benefits you if there's other things we can do and again with the model they had the culture the foundation we can take this anywhere and helped\nMe a little less than a minute left what do people need to know and anyone jumping shot and while you hire the guy is your body so or Tyler just speak for yourself\nFinal words what do they need to know about you and ... with a future for you guys what school about this he loves helping homeowners just like we do yeah I was going to say he's you know we talked about how ... spent hours on phones with homeowners and and clients\nWell a march of last year um uh I lost fired mom to I'm\nA heart attack and she was a bit of your beside and my father who is and really have to be kept their shoes for a lot of medications and I'm kind of invention them out as much so\nUm between those two and I've got a Fifteen year old soccer player that I Want to walk down the aisle saw as he refers\nSo it was family health issues and and just in general a sense that you needed to get on the right track that made you choose the program that's correct [noise]\nAll right Paul let's fast forward Dr Sean here and thank you for participating with our radio program here today you've lost\nHere we go Ryan you ready for this he's

this with your neighbors I Want all the diabetes patients\nIn our community and it's kind of along the lines of what you experience but we do\nWe have diabetics almost every single week that really in essence come out of every single\nThe last one of their diabetes medications per their medical provider and then I Love it that your level of hypertension or high blood pressure is really starting to normalize itself but I like it that you're starting to come off one are approaching maybe potentially to if you're a high blood pressure medications but\nLet me ask you this how were you resting at night how were you sleeping and then your level of energy Paul\nWhy sleep much much better and um I don't you the levels are all going to learn and assume that our energy ah it's just I'm fearful or a

is I'm not good at math but forty thousand days yes signed me up for that program right Paul hey what are some of the people you're family members around your Fifteen year old soccer player or do they
