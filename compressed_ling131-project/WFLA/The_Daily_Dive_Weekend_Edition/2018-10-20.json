{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "We're speaking today with nine time New York times best selling author David Baake well known financial educator about the recent market dropped I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is this the beginning of a market correction\n[noise] so I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter] right it's funny 'cause because here's nobody knows right ... ... what I what I what I Know and we've been talking about\nThis and maybe you know I've done other interviews on this um I Know that we're live we we've just had the greatest bull market of our lifetime I I Know that if you've been in the markets even after the recession hit and even after the markets pulled down if you just stayed the course\nAre more wealth than you've ever had and at the same standpoint the last two months I've been telling people don't get it right like I don't know it's not time to get greedy now is not the time to get complacent so it's\nVery important if you are about to retire or you're already retired it's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money because if you're in your fifties in the markets pull back you can afford to take time to let the markets recover but if you're tired your\nYour comfort level with your money drops significantly is gonna be lower so it's really important I I just can't stress enough that when you're approaching retirement or you're already retired I talked with the financial work with a financial adviser if\nThat if you have a financial was right now that you pick up the phone and paying attention to the news which I don't recommend you do all your financial go back into their office sit down with them have them walk you through what you're invested\nA lot of people who are retired that might be fearful the stock market today actually have a very what we call very low exposure to the stock like army people who are retired and they're worried about the stock market and\nHalf of their money in an annuity aiming the guaranteed rate half of their money and bond and they've got a small percentage of the stock market under so uh but they read the news and they're very fearful\nSo don't be fearful find out find out how much money you actually have how much risk are you taking and again or what your financial advisor I just a big believer that a\nA working with a professional for which is what we recommend people were registered investment advisor when you work with a financial wise or the most important part is that they do a financial plan for you that they they get to understand what your comfort level with risk is\nThen they help you build an investment portfolio based\nOn your goals and your comfort level with risk if you have a very low comfort level would it take any risk well then you should have less money in the ... but the key right now it's no this one markets are going back like they have been the last couple of the most important you can you\nCan just call your visor don't panic sits still don't do anything every market pullback ultimately has had I Can't promise I Will always out but I can tell you it's always had a recovery right every single major market pull back\n... is that a recovery and so I'm just a big long term believer that you wanted diversified portfolio high quality investments\nBuilt up a financial plan working with a financial wise you can trust that they're old your hand when it gets like this right now which is this is a rocky part\nDavid fantastic insights on this market drop what the silver lining here and all of this\nWell I think the silver lining is how incredible when economy we have right now like let's not leave side of that you know look at some of the numbers right now the lowest unemployment\nIn America in forty nine years unemployment is at three point seven percent right now\nWhat is that why is that because we have an incredibly strong economy right now so GDP which you know two years ago no what do you believe the GDP cricket three well most people certainly GDP right now oh first half of the year\n... percent there are predictions that the third quarter could be as high as four percent so the economy in the U.S super strong and\nThings really are very very positive which is why by the way also we'd had stock markets hitting\nAll time high so just notice things the economy are strong this was a very normal time to see a pull back in the market if anything is probably very healthy that we're seeing a pulled back in the market right now and just notice the economy is doing really well the tax cuts that a huge impact\nAnd for the foreseeable future we seen economy that's continuing to grow\nDavid Baake always a pleasure thank you for your insights today begging my pleasure thank you [noise]\nWow that was fantastic I Want to personally thank David Box that was a fantastic interview Megan thank you so much against David ... author of smart couples finish rich Tampa Bay we are out of time thank you so much for listening to the show and we'll see you all again next [noise]\nThe proceeding program was paid for by the ... group retirement wealth advisor\nKnives seventies WFL age [noise] I Know when you went to the two Clearwater\nI'm On the question our top story at ten o'clock shooting a shoplift or it gets a leg lawmaker murder charge [noise]\nYou know the you've got to use it wisely but you've got to have one I mean I I think it's much smarter to carry a credit card and pay it off every month than it is to use a debit card or a check card where you're giving the world direct access to your bank account which can destroy other parts of your finances\nSo use the saving thousands rule number six and spread your newfound knowledge about the dangers of those debit cards and ask your bank for an old fashioned ATM card for withdrawing cash when you need it and of course\nThat card requires a PIN number at the terminal so it's much more secure hey there's Robert should use real number four don't abuse credit but don't fear it either get yourself a credit card or two for reward purchases but make sure that you make the payments\nOn time and again the saving thousands rules to success can be found at saving thousands dot com okay Robert we've got a question for you how long does negative information like late payments and all that how long will be left on the credit report\nAnd so what will happen is if if it just happened right so if if you got a collection yesterday they've got the records right they're they're heightened ready and you know but if you catch them three four or five years from now and maybe they've they've upgraded their computer software and not all the data carried over\nMaybe they transferred that from one company to a different company and some records got lost in the mix\nA things happened that companies are not perfect and so when they lose the data lose part of the data right so maybe they can see you had an account\nBut the software no longer tells them what the balances or wasn't the payment is because you got to take one one this this works particularly well with like charge us or old closed accounts right because as long as you owe them money they will keep good records\nWell if you if you owe me money then you're going to stay kind of at the top of the list now once you have paid me off as a as a creditor your importance diminishes and when I'm looking at how many gigabytes and terabytes of data I have and it's time to archive and flushed and upgrade and whatever they do\nOr the people who don't owe me money any more\nI don't really care right and so the idea is if you pay to collect it off a couple of years ago and you dispute it today they may just not have the data anymore right because they got paid they're done it's over now they're going to keep it for a little while you can't pay it off and disputed a week later and think it's going to\nVote off I mean it would take a pretty enough company to lose the data that quickly but as time goes on and so this is where\nSome of these companies have had success they will dispute everything\nOn your credit which I Am not advocating I don't know just to see everything on your credit use some rhyme or reason to it like\nLook at when it was what it is whatever but these companies will just dispute everything on your credit which you can do all by yourself\nAnd then they will get lucky because that's all you're doing is you're getting lucky and some of the companies will lose the data fail to respond on time it gets again if you ... so if you owe me money\nAnd and I see your disputing it on the credit I'm thinking oh well\nMaybe they're trying to buy a house maybe they're trying to buy a car let me get the collection bulldog back after him and see if I can get my money if you've already paid me I don't care so what motivates it really what motivation does this credit collection company have to respond to the credit bureaus now if they never respond\nThey'll get in trouble the fast changing Experian expect them to maintain a certain level of integrity what they're reporting and not just let it not just lose every battle on purpose but if you catch 'em right and you don't owe them any money there is a good chance to delete and if you owe them money they will they will produce the records they will go to great lengths\nBecause they want their money and they know the best chance they have of getting their money is staying on your credit report\nRight once they're paid their motivation is gone you now as a consumer have a better chance of this company failing to respond failing to have kept the records and this is where that is the process can work so in today's world there are two ways you can despair you can use the old fashion male method\nAnd support the United States Postal service everybody does they need all the help they can get you know I I support him I spent a ton of direct mail but but the ... I mean the Internet's killing 'em anyway so or you can just read it online so like at my psycho dot com I pulled that sixty dollar credit report yesterday to go over with everybody on line\nAt the bottom of each bureau was started as a button said start dispute\nA and in some cases you can so I guess let's roll back to the other thing you can get a free credit report or Rio and not the guy singing the song\nWhere you have ... up for twelve months of advantage whatever blah blah blah but you can get a real free credit report if you have in most states if you have been denied for credit so the idea is if I call and try to get a mortgage or I Try to get a credit card or whatever I get denied\nI should then get to know why it was denied and what's on my credit report and so if if the if the U.S governments that everybody gets free credit reports all the time people would abuse it so what they said is if you are denied for credit\nThen you can go get a free credit for it to find out what's in your file so if you've recently been denied for credit\nYou can go on to each other three bureaus and apply to get your free credit report and then you can use that to start the dispute process completely free online now that you have to do at Equifax trend union and experience I always found it was easier just to pay the the sixty bucks or the thirty bucks or whatever it is um but anyway but you can do the free rat as well\nAnd so now when we talk about disputes\nRight we're talking about the type and so I'm actually going to try this Rob oh I'm going to run an experiment a boy and so I uh I I have a thirty day late on my credit report from discover All right this happened or\nSomething like five or six years ago and it was because I didn't have the money it was like I was I got an a three dollar [noise] so what happened is I paid\nI paid the card in full but I missed it by a couple of whatever happened there and so there was like a couple of bucks in interest that went on there and then I didn't use the car and so I didn't think to go back on and check by the payment and so I owed like a three dollar minimum payment on a three dollar balance and I missed it but I don't I don't check my mail very regularly um\nThis was in the early days of starting the mortgage out early and then I was distracted so I have this very day late on my credit this was like five years ago five six years ago so what I did is and this is what I recommend anyone to do if you do accidentally get a thirty day late immediately pay the cardio full and close it cancel it\nBe done with it right because we want to get out of their system as quickly as possible\nKeeping on top of our credit standing is something most of us just don't do let's admit it you know usually happens is we fall in love with the car we fall in love with a boat or better yet we pull him over the house and we really want it but we get denied\nNow that comes as a total surprise if where you're taking time on a regular basis to check on her credit reports we could have been pro active and improve the situation so nowhere surprises now that makes for a competent consumer\nThis all ties in directly with the saving thousands rule number eleven\nDon't gamble with your son Joel's you know retirement accounts savings accounts interest rate locks these essential should be safe guarded so you don't get taken\nAgain your copy of the saving thousands rules is it's saving thousands dot com it's saving thousands dot com now another a central part of buying a home was the appraisal Robert what in the world who's the appraisal\nOf the things we do what are the funding is we don't use what's called an appraisal management company we work directly with the appraisers some companies out there because their mortgage brokers or because the way they're structured they cannot work directly with the appraisal appraiser they have to go through a middleman an appraisal management company we find is this raises cost to consumers\nAnd lowers quality of the report\nBecause an appraisal management company will bear that report out and say who will do it for the cheapest\nSo they're going to charge the customer way of here and then go try to find that appraiser who will do it for way cheaper and then they get to pocket the difference\nThat's their business model so all of a sudden there's an appraiser two hundred miles away who's down his luck and really needs to work that day he'll he'll bed super low income do that are presently doesn't really understand the area so we work directly with our appraisers\nWe've got great relationships most of the appraisers we work with were their largest client because we go directly to them and we use them over and over again so we've got a great relationship so we get faster service and I believe a higher quality of work from those appraisers\nSo the appraiser job is to go out there and give us the value of the home now a lotta people get concerned oh if I got to clean up the house I Need to make the house look as good as possible\nI mean I think it's nice if the appraisers and walk into a disaster but cleaning house is not gonna affect its value okay the appraisers there to look at square footage\nBedrooms and bathrooms overall quality of construction and quality of amenities you know one house has linoleum ... Illinois employing throughout another has very nice hardwood floors in tiles that will make an impact a Korean countertops verse Formica it's not a dollar for dollar impact but it will cause them to compare you two other similar houses\nSo half the houses in your neighborhood are really nice counter tops and really nice cabinets and flooring and half or not so nice years we'll be compared to whichever set your closest to mhm so what they do is the appraiser comes out and he looks at the house\nThey'll measure the rooms to verify the square footage he'll look for a very very glaring defects owned the roof broken windows missing kitchen missing toilets he's not a home inspector he's not there to give you that checklist long term inspection he just there to make sure the lender we're not getting into something we don't want to get involved in the home is really damaged\nWhatever it is this is what we deal with and so I Want everyone to understand the documentation face\nBut on the flip side for some people would super easy you know if you've been on the same job for a couple of years and now that he's got just pop up and you can give me your documentation one time and never come back you had a document mhm so what we're talking about here today it's kind of a worst case scenario because my hope is everyone listening picks up on one little thing and says oh\nI just got hit with child support and make sure I tell my lender about that oh my down payments coming from my aunt she keeps your money in a safe that may be a problem let me talk about that now you know by knowing what these worst case scenarios are\nBecause all mortgages or not this stuff to document right only the ones that have the gotcha something goes wrong\nI'd say maybe five percent of our mortgages have this kind of excessive documentation Ninety five percent of people it's ever it's clean the two by Mr Perfect their names right there at the bank names right there the account numbers right there the average balance is there the money's been in their savings account for both months it's no problem\nThere W. two at a job there forty hours a week their tax returns or ten forty easy they've been inside with the IRS everything is perfect\nYou will have an easy time of documentation stage ... if you haven't file tax returns you follow kind of crazy business returns you know you have a ... income varies all over the place you have weird large deposits where you move money from account to account to account all this is going to cause problems during the documentation states has something to think about as you do look to buying a house\nAs Robert said for most people the processes nearly seamless but in some cases things in your life that complicated and communication has got to be the key with the mortgage company just remember nobody's picking on you\nThey're not trying to make things difficult\nThey are simply documents by law must be reviewed to get that mortgage\nLet's talk about affordability Robert you know what happens so often a couple of fall in love with the house and later they'll have a conversation and they'll say well we know the payments to stretch but we can trim a thing or two we can make their payments\nWhat what has been the verbally volunteer to go back on goal for tickets to the game\nAnd the white may say okay I'll cut down on pedicures\nBut you know what so often the sacrifices are never made and Robert people become a prisoner of the house payment\nYeah we we try to have a lot of conversations about budgeting and just because you can qualify for it doesn't mean that is what we are going to put on your qualification letter because again that's exactly what happens you know it's it's with the first thing we're going to talk about is what are you comfortable with you know before we talk about what we think you qualify for how much of a house payment do you think you'd be comfortable with\nOur Robert I think we'd be recoverable at twelve or fourteen hundred\nWill because you may qualify for Eighteen hundred or two thousand but let's start with what you're comfortable with because again we don't know your habits you know how often do you eat out\nDo you pay for daycare and so when when you're being qualified for a mortgage we only look at your debt\nYou know because you can't handle you can't stop that\nThe idea is anything you could turn off\nYou know well if your wife lose their job or if it has been losing his job then you can pull the kid at a daycare and take care of yourself you could have half the cable you know you you can quit eating out\nAnd so we don't we don't factor those into qualification because we know if you cut your lifestyle back the basics you can make the payment but is that what you want in life you know you want to be in a situation\nYou know where all your income is going into your house and you can't afford to do things you like to do so I always like to start the conversation with you know with how much can you afford\nAnd a lot of home builders hate this you know they they want their preferred mortgage company to tweak you up as high as you can cause they want to sell you every option and everything they can or you know we really liked to understand what our client what's going to make you comfortable and then again watch out for the gotcha is like higher taxes higher because if you tell me what twelve hundred dollar payment\nAnd all of a sudden the taxes are three hundred a month instead of two hundred a month well guess what your payments going up by a hundred bucks yep and even though you still qualify for it and it can be a trap because\nSo if you only qualify for twelve hundred a month and you fall in love with a house is Thirteen you come back to me we have to say no 'cause you just don't qualify yeah but if you do qualify for the more money but you were just trying to stay conservative now you have a harder time trying to convince your family and everybody else well\nWell honey the mortgage company will give us the loan for Thirteen hundred a month why aren't you comfortable with it will dear I think we should really stick around twelve hundred well we can get approved for Thirteen hundred though in the house we love is Thirteen hundred and we see a lot of people fall into this trap and they end up buying more house than they are comfortable with they can afford it\nBut now they have to make lifestyle changes and not everyone's willing to make those lifestyle changes which is how people can get in trouble with owning a home\nBack to basics Robert when we go to secure alone the word wop comes up and many people are totally familiar with the process but if they make the wrong choice it could cost them right the first thing that you hear from the loan company is oh you should never walk\nSo they tell you this and they convinced you to float and as soon as you agree to float you've not lost all your power or because so still getting the coach of this great right up front they convinced you to float right route put yourself in a situation right you're a homebuyer you listen to rule number one you shop around you're doing good\nBut then you let the mortgage guy convinced you to float\nOkay so now thirty days go by and this time to go to closing on your new home and they say okay Rob\n... floating any more time to go to closing you have to lock the rate and before you can go to closing a and you know what my sisters brothers best friend was wrong oh rates did not get better and in fact they're much much worse\nAnd I'm not going to give you a nine percent interest rate what are you going to end you're going to ask me to bring more money to ... what are you gonna do rap I mean are you going to do with him are you going to walk away from the dream home are you going to walk away from the home that you're in love with that your wife's in love with that you showed\nThe kids and you put the pictures on Facebook and you've been rolled the kids in school and everything\nOr you're going to take their ridiculous nine percent right now that's obviously a very uh outlandish example no one's going to raise the rate that much they could what would you do I mean what do they raise their eight to four or five six seven eight nine ten twenty\nIf it's the day before closing what are you going to do stuff your stock or you have two choices take the higher rates or walk away from our house and the industry knows that most people will take the higher\nRate and if you work their way they attached ... if I Walk away there's also penalties faster I don't want to lose my astro yeah absolutely you could even get sued by the seller at that point because see the thing is you have financing in place now some real estate contracts are written\nThat your financing has to be below a certain rate routes that doesn't qualify but even that expires with a finance contingency so it's just a bad situation\nTo the way to protect yourself from this\nIs simple make sure you get the ... the rate lock lock the rate it up front do not let them convinced you to play the float game the only person who benefits from you playing the game is the mortgage company okay because remember it cost us money to lock your rate it right so by locking your writing upfront\nWe take more risk in the market because I have to lock your eight and then if the inspection comes back batter the appraisal comes in lower the things I could potentially have losses in the market and we have really complex formula as I wrote for our hedging software that\nThat I wrote that that does all this here at our piece funding and and I think we do it better than most people so we don't take as much risk but some lenders have a really high risk especially when when you're dealing with a mortgage broker because the mortgage broker the lender does even know if they're actually going to get the loan\nThe mortgage broker asked a locked along with the lender and then the limit is even if the mortgage broker really has a file they'd ever met you\nAnd so there's all this cost built in the race around locking so mortgage guys as they can make more money if they convinced you to float to the end and then on top of that they can bait and switch you because they can quote you are really low rate today oh ... we've got the best right in the country today let me give you a to point two percent interest rate\nAnd you say okay great let me like that and went on overall we shouldn't lock it in which should lock that it and we want to let that float\nI don't ever float right there I force every customer lock and that's my personal belief I that that is one thing I Am so\nPassionate about right and and it's just such a core part of my beliefs\nThat you do not gamble with this you do not floats your eight nothing good can come for the consumer out of floating the rate and that's why we force everyone to lock it even if it cost me business even if it costs me a customer I'm going to force you to do what I Know is best for you which is ... and on your mortgage\nUp front that initial time of application because what happens a lot of time did you say well well if I float and the market gets better I Will get a lower rate in theory yes but what most mortgage companies do is they float you and if the market gets better they don't tell you about it and they just keep the extra money I had this happen every day\nWhen I was in wholesale so before the funding I actually bought loans for mortgage brokers as a part of what we did ... we bought loans from mortgage brokers we bought loans from other correspondent lenders so we would see how they did business and how they took advantage of their clients and what they did and and and this whole floating thing\nThe customer almost never got the benefit of it\nThey would always leave the customer at the same rate and they would pocket the difference if their market got better if the market got worse than they would ... the customer up higher if the market stayed the same they would usually jak because rap and lie to them and tell them to market got worse\nSo the simple way to avoid all this and this is a key part of shopping for a mortgage rule number one is shop around and then a sub rule of that is if you're shopping for a mortgage make sure you can get a written rate lot commitment up friday it's the only way to protect yourself\nFrom a bait and switch from a bad situation down the road is to have that written rate lock agreement up front\nAnd so if a company has some kind of crazy rule\nLike you can't lock the rate until the third Thursday of every leap year you can't lock the rate until the appraisal comes back or you can't lock the rate until the senior vice president gets back from Hawaii and reviews your file personally but I don't know what kind of crazy stuff they come up with but you want a company that can lock your rate in\nFollowing tonight's game stay up with me and air curling as we discussed a nice game then we get ready for Mars battles the black box on the last call

Stevens damn cos are on either the face off circles they're trying to really thread\nThat threaten the steam and just get some of those type passes that that second unit they're really just firing it than that they're moving to walk really fast they're moving at well and then they have Yani Gordon front and he was just looking to bury those rebounds and he's one of the best at it so they have to really good looks on that first and second unit and they're very confident in them well\nAnd you're absolutely right and you know search that we've seen him getting some shots through which I think is one of his great strengths than I'm having somebody in front to get it", "show_name": "The Daily Dive Weekend Edition", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "20"}
