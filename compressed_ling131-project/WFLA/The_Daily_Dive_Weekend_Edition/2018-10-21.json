score yellow severe that other Gene Kelly you almost don't want to take not only is against that ... knowing that you have so much still out there you can't take a breather with a second again you\nKnow I think your head probably goes down a little bit after you've taken all day when you look at who's on their first and second unit and you mentioned the penalty gal too I mean they're just really rolling on special teams so I think the lightning Dave you know they want to focus on taking less penalties than stay out of the box and take them to the pressure off that the last ...\nNot only have they taken probably more penalties than they would have liked to this point twenty three time short handed them the first five games but it also seems that\nIn the context if each game the penalties are coming one right after the other like I've had some periods where they've had to kill for families in one period and it's hard to generate an attack even though they're short handed work has been good they've scored a couple of short handed goals you know it's hard to generate\nWindy your back when you're constantly killing penalty so I think it's kind of a two fold thing take your penalties and if you do up and to take apparently what's not ticket nother pedal away like within a couple of minutes of getting through that first kill but\nIn the big picture right obviously it hasn't hurt them and they are pouring walk through the first five games so I think that those are things kind of\nCause medically they want to work on moving forward here they're not going to go the whole season without allowing a power ... certainly but they can help their cause if they keep a number down to one or two pills again rather that four or five guys before\nWe get into some more

continues with Dave Michigan and Kaylee Chely us we'll be calling the game tonight\nI'm Caitlin let's start with you again the the goal Stevens damn cuss word in the last game I've got to think\nLike a a shooter who's struggling in basketball um after you see a couple of shots go through the hook you gain some confidence I've got to think for staff because even though he's in a legal score to get that first one and for it to be a game winner against Detroit that has to\nGet him going a little bit here moving forward because we saw him have a a shooters mentality don't you think in that last game\nYeah absolutely I mean I think it was just a matter of time before he got on the board I mean there's just so much talent up front on this team and I think the fact that they split up Nikita Khrushchev Robin Stevens Sam ... on that first and second line I think those top two lines are equally as dangerous now you might not get as much individual scoring from let's say\nOne player on the top line a second but now you have two lines that are really hard to shut down and brother team does a lot easier to try to just worried about one\nSo yeah I think we're Stevens damn cars to get his first and get on to score sheet of course that's got to be a bit of a relief but I don't think that he's holding himself to\nYou know I think he's holding themselves to a much higher standard and he wants to get more goals he wants to shoot more\nUh last year he obviously some orange that plane making ability and when you you can see when you watch him he's always looking at the next movie is looking to see\nGreeted point ... view on this route to the left the state of walk [noise]\n\n\nBoy goes with it Ryan Souter behind that that's about the right side details ran when conscious of that
