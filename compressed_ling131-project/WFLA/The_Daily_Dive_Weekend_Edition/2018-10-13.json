the quest in our top story at ten o'clock Seventy two hours after landfall people still need rescue from the storm [noise]\nYou know we we all have the best intentions we all sit there in line and say oh we're going to\nWe're going to pay this off as soon as we get on her head and let me say his second day you know they say Vegas wasn't built time winners and you know a credit card companies were not built on winters\nAnd you know we all have that intention I'll I'll get to twenty percent off of the ten percent off and it might go home and I'm going to pay this off so it's not going to matter all wrong you know most people don't and and the other funny thing is if you look at the bank that actually issues that department store card right because that's the thing\nAt the other day the department store is not the one giving you the money they've hooked up with a bank and what the bank has figured out as they can charge you and agree just interest rate\nIf they give you the card in line while you're at the store because people are less likely to shop around you know when they mail you a credit card offer in the mail and now you're at home you're in your own element you know maybe you're going to go on line and do some research and some ... comparison shopping and\nAnd so they got to be competitive and so what you'll see is the same banks will offer you\nA ten to Fifteen Percent lower I'm fucking ten to Fifteen points so like if it's ... percent at the department store you could probably get it for Fifteen Percent interest just by calling that same credit card company directly mhm oh they know what happens you know you run that charge up and your intention is you're going to go home and paid off and then guess what life happens right\nAlways happens all the sudden your car needs new tires all of a sudden your air conditioner goes out the house you know whatever it is and now that money that you put aside to pay off that credit card\nOf a sudden it's going to something else it's going to something that popped up you're going out to dinner that night with your friends and end up spending a little more than you thought you were whatever happens and now that purchase\nCredit card and your mail and the minimum payments\nAnd all of a sudden you wake up in that T shirt that costs Fifteen bucks that you saved twenty percent on ended up costing you a hundred and fifty because it makes you Twenty years to pay it off you know and and how many of us can how many of us really afford to continually pay that kind of money but it's it's what happens in it it's how they build a trap\nYou know they want to get you and then get you hooked it's almost like a drug dealer and this is how big financial services companies works or you know a homeowner's insurance car insurance same way you know they get itchy and they get you hooked\nThe most terrible thing they ever did was come up with auto built right here you know we think auto bill is this great convenience and life right you know like oh this is great I just they just take the money out of my checking account every month I don't even notice it right\nWell yeah and then when they increase your premium next year you don't even notice that either and then when they increase your premium again a year after that you don't even notice that you know so there's all these things that that they are doing to stack the deck against us as consumers\nAnd so I felt like it was my duty my responsibility to come out here and get on the radio and tell people how this stuff works and and try to educate them and a lot of stuff it's it's common sense but it's it's definitely just don't think about you know it it because again it's designed for us not to think about it you know it's they spend a lotta money\nHiring really really expensive consultants and marketers to\nCome in here and figure out ways to confuse the crap out of the consumer\nSo they can get marchers they can make more money and and that's what I'm here to change raw that's why I'm On the radio to try to open people's eyes to it and in keeping with while they're in the media\nYou know what's what's the new big thing we've got to watch out for what the new big tactic they're trying to use to to take advantage of people and we're we're not going to stand for it man 'cause ... simple all you got to do is take the time to shop around you know if you're standing in line and this is my favorite things and I'm On the on the jerk that does this when I'm In line at at the department store\nAnd they're like you know sorry would you like to open up whatever credit card today\nAnd like well that depends you know what the annual percentage rate and then you'll see they have no idea what she has no clue me she's sitting here you know just supposed to be checking out and bring it up you know whatever I'm buying that day and all of a sudden you know she throws in which I one of the credit card I'm asking her for details so it never fails they they go digging through the cash register right because somewhere very deep\nIs like the the brochure for the credit card and write a little pamphlet right so I I Am sure maybe I'll get that you know what's the PR which the the annual fee and said that they ended the search ensues rice and now they're looking at all the drawers looking for the little pamphlet and finally they dig it up and now we're all looking to the fine print together and trying to figure out what it is and and then the funny thing is\nI Would say half the time they are actually embarrassed when they find the the annual percentage rate to have to tell you\nBecause they're all my God it's twenty nine percent like ... like they had no idea like well you work here you just try to sell me this credit card twenty nine percent interest rate and now it's like you're embarrassed by the fact that the interest rates twenty nine percent\nYou know they don't even know what they're selling you because again it's just somebody figured out let's have the cashier asked the question would you like to say ... percent today by opening a whatever account and they have no idea how much it costs they have no idea what the annual fee is they have no idea what the percentage rate is\nAnd when they see their even ashamed\nTo to try to tell you that credit card yeah so it just\nIt amazes me that you know but that that's how it works now mortgages were one of the worst back in the day you know still are you know we've you know I came out it are the funding and I decided we weren't gonna charge lender fees\nAnd the rest of the industry that I was an idiot you know I think they want to have him wanting me to fail and half of one murder me and my sleep [laughter] um you know they went out on the radio started talking about it and telling people how this stuff works\nUh yeah 'cause the funny thing is in the mortgage business those those Linder fees they actually we call them junk these you know that's what they're called in the industry anybody who's ever been in the mortgage business knows that the underwriting fees and the processing fees and the origin Asian fees they're called junk fees now if the industry itself calls them junk\nFees how important can they really be\nRule number five of the Fifteen saving thousands rules to success created by Robert Palmer says who you know their tricks you won't fall for them so what did you get your family and friends any time you hear of a scam and don't make snap decisions yourself\nTake time the three day rule take time to totally inlaws offers and in the long run you'll keep more of your heart or in cash and you'll get a better product for it at Robert let's talk about the actual cost of a home\nAnd expand on the all important premise that just because two houses are price the same\nThat doesn't mean that the bottom line cost of ownership per month leaving because\nHere's the thing we don't we don't really care how much the house cause right I mean when we make you a mortgage we will loan you\nWe don't care how much we're loaning you what we care about is how much the monthly payment is right that's what your income we don't have a formula to say well John you only make sixty thousand dollars a year so you can only afford a hundred and twenty thousand our house\nOr what happens is with John you make sixty thousand already or you can only afford a a Thirteen hundred dollar a month mortgage payments and then we tell you that roughly a X amount of house\nRight but the key is for qualifications that monthly payment and so there are things you can do to screw that up right and their houses they are too expensive in other ways beyond the sales price\nOr they can make it to where you don't qualify for them so that payment on to you can have two houses\nThat both costs the same thing right so let's say we have two houses and they both cost two hundred thousand dollars right you may be able to afford wiping out the other end here is why maybe one of those houses\nIs in an area where the property taxes are much higher so maybe I'm One of the houses the property taxes are two thousand dollars a year let's say twenty four hundred dollars a year ... dollars a year or two hundred bucks a month in one house\nAnd let's say the other house the taxes are forty eight hundred dollars a year\nBecause it's got a CD and it was built during the boom and and there's all this stuff built into the taxes and it's in it's in an area where you're paying city tax and county tax but the other houses just county tax so one house that taxes are two hundred a month and the other house the taxes are four hundred a month\nSo the monthly payment will clearly not be the same the monthly payment will be two hundred dollars higher\nOn the house with the forty and all your taxes just how it works so you may not qualify for that house because the taxes are so much above average sea when we're telling you you can afford a two hundred thousand dollar\nHouse we're using kind of a general average of property taxes and this is why we when we work with our clients when they do start to look at houses we asked and let us know which ones they are and to look at the property\nTaxes and see to make sure they still qualify so let's say it gets even worse because that house it's got the forty hundred our taxes it's also in a gated community with a twenty four hour guard out front\nAnd Seventeen Olympic size swimming pools six movie theaters I mean this this place in the streets are actually brick in gold\nRight and so so there's homeowners' association dues you got to pay your homeowner's association dues they are going to yell at you when you try to put your boat in the driveway if they're going to yell at you if you have cars parked on the street overnight but they're gonna give you access to the Olympic swimming pools in the theater and the the guard at the gate\nAnd for that privilege you're going to pay them\n... what do we say Rob let's say we're going to pay them six hundred dollars a quarter of grow them does that sound reasonable for gold streets and maybe not\nOh ... what what you've you've lived in some\nLive in a gated community right now I I pay right now a quarter about five hundred guys so we'll we'll say five hundred a quarter\nSo that there's more money going out the door right so all these things so now the payments even higher if she gets lower qualifying because as long as you live in that house you have to pay the association if you don't they put a lean on your house ... and his lenders we do not like the idea of someone putting a lean on your house so when we look at your qualifying payment\nWe'd have to look at your principal and interest that the easy one right principal interest at the same for every house in America that cost two hundred thousand dollars\nThe principal in the interest are going to be the same and we got to look at the taxes\nTaxes can vary wildly if the person's telling you the house didn't have homestead exemption maybe they you know there may be used in an area this is more expensive whatever it is you've got to look at his property taxes ... H O away dues right if you're paying crazy homeowners' association does because house aides in the gated community with the guard and\nAgainst oh I lost my job I Can't make my payment you had to go on the radio and explain that the PM I did not uh it didn't protect the borrower it protects the or the the lender\nYet only protects the letters and the only to protect the lender in case of a default the idea is if you put less than twenty percent down and you don't make your payments on time the pie and my company will then reimbursed the lender not you running losses they have by you to fall on that loan or there is no no consumer benefit whatsoever except for having a lower down payment to PM I\nThere is no better time and right now to get out your paperwork and look at your annual property taxes look at your homeowner's insurance rates\nAnd see if in fact you're paying ... is part of your monthly payment\nOdds are you'll be shocked to see how much your homeowner's insurance has gone up over the years auto pay pick up the phone and compare coverages and prices available to you you can cancel and get a new policies anytime\nAnd with very little effort you can have a new insurance company would better coverage and better rates\nAt your money they've called the finance company and ask about them I Believe me when I say this that circled they don't want to get and then check out your property taxes\nCompare for years with your neighbors you should also called accounting and make sure that the information they have on your home is accurate\nPeriodic checks on these three cost alone can save you major dollars a year after year Robert on last week's show we talked about finding mistakes on our credit report and we talked a little bit about disputing those errors we have a listener who wants to know more about the process\nWe got we got another text and Rob that they they want me to go over the detailed process of how to do the disputes so okay I'm going to do that um so what I Will tell you is a\nA we'll start with experience since I'm On their website and so when you go to Experian or go to their home page and saving for how to get this so you got to experience and\nYeah I don't like the fact I'm going to Google experience dispute so I'm going to go to the little dot com experience E. X. P. E. R. I. in\nDispute put that in and the first the first thing that comes up is dispute credit bureau which is an ad or one of these companies who wants to my money may click on it and see how much does it cost I'm just curious so when you put an experience dispute the first thing you see is going to be someone trying to get your money to do it for you\nI've noticed on Google lately there's a lot of people you know bouncing up to the top of drought exactly what you're looking for\nYeah so we want we want to go past the paid ad right there's like a ... it says you know add in little yellow kind of hidden we go to the next went down to the next one that actually at Experian dot com and\nThe the URL is Experian dot com slash disputes slash Maine dot H. T. M. L. the headline is dispute credit report information at Experian dot com\nAnd then there's I had a dispute credit report frequently asked questions and instructions for disputing by mail right so I'm gonna click on this and it says disputing your credit report information online how would you like to begin\nAnd the first things start a new dispute online than excellent says check the status of an existing dispute a view the results of the completed dispute or verify the accuracy of my credit history I don't even know what that means or I'm going to go with starting a new online dispute I'm

may find it useful to first obtain your personal credit report now I Will tell you to dispute on line you have to have a personal credit report\nOr to dispute by mail you don't necessarily have to go up please include the following information when requesting your dispute full name including middle initial I'm Robert W Palmer junior\n... date of birth Social Security number\nAll addresses where

specific reason you feel the information is incorrect so this is where you want to say something like this account is not mine or this account was never delinquent\nOr this account should've never gone to collection is one of the things I find useful or is what a collection there are certain rules they have to follow it\nThey have to notify you within a certain timeframe they have to notify you X number of times and so I Would put all that in there you know I I that was never I was never properly notified they did not follow the the collection laws rules correctly they never contacted every notified me this was paid before it ever went to collection all of these wonderful things you can put in there\nAnd now they have to ah I get I don't I don't think that really matters but we might as well put it in there because we're writing a letter writer ... it's not good at what do you put that in there you just say\nThis is wrong they're going to go to the same process right but maybe spice it up a little bit maybe the guy on the other end of the side it's not worth if you sound a little more like I was talking about lot worth fighting I don't think it matters I think is that the data is there are the data is not there right so that's where the dispute by mail\nRight for the online dispute that finally loaded she wants to report number\nAnd so there are important number is unique number a side of your personal credit for so because I don't have a report number I cannot do this on line so I Would have to go back and get a report number which is either free if I had been denied for credit recently which I have not that I Would have to buy a report single report from experience in order to do it on line\nBy mail completely free right but on the bottom line you have to have a credit report first and so let me see like figure out how much a credit report costs here\nSo let's see a credit reports how they're going to try to sell me a daily credit monitoring acts the moms lie
