bro crashed\nA nation is not our best friend when we talk about our finances\nSo knowing that the where do we go from here\nWell I think one one thing that we haven't discussed is having a life insurance policy\nAnd many times this makes a very good sense for a lot of people especially those who have dependence\nYou know just about anyone in their fifties sixties even seventies or older\nCould consider having a policy it allows for a tax efficient transfer of income to your named beneficiaries in this way an insurance policy can be part of your legacy planning as well so you can take care of the others after you're gone\nAnd then there are those different writers that are now inside of insurance policies we call them living benefit riders we\nMentioned them earlier I for an additional costs you can purchase a feature that provides access to the funds to cover the cost of long term care\nIn case you're you have a serious illness in retirement so\nThis is pretty important stuff Megan that we talk about here we've been talking today a lot about the what ifs in retirement and how you can plan to day to make sure\nThat you're going to be rock solid with your

having fun Megan it it always does if that [laughter] you know this next one is is probably the one that we hear the most what if I run out of money in retirement or\nWhat if my advisor has never had the discussion with me about all of this stuff that we're talking about I think it's so important that you always use a special is a specialist when it comes to your health\nA specialist when it comes

advise the [noise]\nNews radio I Seventy ... valley [noise] and so when you ... to clear water\nOn the question our top story at ten o'clock charges pile up against the mail bomb suspected\nBut you've got the call and apply if there are problems you can discuss ways to improve your credit and then you can buy later Robert I've got some of feedback I've been getting out there about the show and the social site on our show there are so many people will say the information they get from here\nIs literally saved them real money and kept them from getting into jams\nAnd with the knowledge of credit and finance they suddenly feel like they're in charge when it comes to their money\nYou know rabbit my goal with this show and we talked about this law you know what what was the goal and and I will tell you the goal has\nChanged you know I mean in the beginning I I really just wanted to come out here and I guess expose everything that was wrong with our industry mhm and and now it's really more about empowering consumers and I really want to give\nPeople a framework and give people you know a good set of rules and\nGuidelines that they can use to be smarter consumers and they can make sure they always shop around and to not be afraid of credit you I think that's one of the that's one of the I guess the the kind of missing messages is as I've as I've exposed the secrets a lot of people say well my God this is so terrible I should just stay I should just stay away from credit I should be afraid of credit ... and ... and that that's not it and so\nYeah I can tell us a story personally of I personally was a lot of credit you know I I use\nIt when I say use I mean you like I use them you know it it it's not it's not because I Need the credits because I Want to take advantage of the credit you know I Want to take advantage of the bank because a lot of things you can you can do and so to give you an example you know I I got married last November right and I got engaged a year ago or in may\nAnd uh and so when I bought my wife's engagement ring I financed it\nBecause they offered me twelve months no interest right or wrong with that so you know an engagement ring as a decent little purchase it what what are they say ... supposed to spend like two months of your salary on the gays or do you believe is two months three months to two to three months of your salary alright so we'll we'll say to the average person out there you know making sixty Seventy thousand dollars a year\nIs is putting Fifteen and twenty thousand dollars into an engagement ring yeah I mean that's\nSo if you take so so if you take that Fifteen or twenty thousand and let's say you're afraid of credit you know there's people say you know what I'm just not going to have any credit\nI'm not going to borrow maybe have bad Credit Suisse force you down that path but uh let's say you're going to buy a a twenty thousand dollar engagement ring three months of your salary and you make you know right at Seventy thousand dollars a year or whatever like as an example\nAnd so you take that twenty thousand dollars and if the the jewelry companies willing to give you twelve months of no interest right\nWell that means that twenty thousand dollars is free to you for the next twelve months mhm right so what I Want people to to think about it is so person a walks into jewelry store\nAnd they take twenty thousand dollars out of their savings account and they buy their in cash and they walk out and they're done gay\nPerson be walks in takes advantage of the twin is what I did takes advantage of the the credit from the store with twelve months a no interest mhm and then they take that twenty thousand dollars for a savings account Rob and they invested in the stock market\nRight I'm not saying you crazy I'm not saying pick stocks like just put into it and I saw a mutual funds and their return you would have seen is going to be around three to four thousand dollars over the last twelve months\nAnd and so then at the end it's time we got to pay off our our thing so we we sell those twenty thousand dollars with stocks and now the twelve months adventurous freeze up so we want to pay this thing on ...\nBut there was an opportunity to make money there and if you're afraid of credit\nYou know if you take up a monitor in life that you're never going to use credit you can't take advantage of those types opportunities he was an opportunity to make two or three thousand dollars maybe four thousand hours depending on which stocks you invested in with mutual funds you pick the market did really grave last twelve months or do I mean it did you know ... it was there was a great time\nAnd so having that twenty thousand dollars for an engagement ring interest free\nMeant that twenty thousand with our freedom to do something else\nBut to take advantage of these types of situations you've got to have good credit you've got to understand credit\nYou've got to know how the system works and this is what I Want to empower people to do this is what I Want to teach our listeners how to do so they can identify these types of opportunities identify the opportunities where credit is a good idea not and not be afraid of it you know or most of our findings bills I put on my American Express\nAnd I mean we obviously spend a lot more than the average person would\nBecause all of our a lot of our advertising a lot of our bills go on American Express but\nI mean any small business owner you one of their life\nYou can build up pretty quick points you know in those points turn into a nice vacation or do so just by by you know cruises around here big cruise or I Do ... and and and you can definitely you can get a couple\nOf free cruises a year by using credit correctly that's right you know get the points pay this thing off and so that's really what I'm here to do I want to teach people how to utilize leverage and utilize credit because a lot of ways credit is what built this country\nYou know if you look at why we grew as fast as we did and you look at some other countries and how they do not go as quickly as a lot of it has to do with the credit mentality and while the financial services industries have taken advantage of this\nAnd they've turned into a bad thing and they're so bent on taking advantage of people if we as consumers are educated enough and strong enough and dedicated enough and committed enough to a plan to use credit correctly we can really take advantage of the system\nAnd we can pick up a lotta nice perks and a lot of opportunities to make money a lot of opportunity to save money while using credit to our benefit instead of letting the big credit companies use credit to their benefit at our expense\nHow can you get even more empowered will first don't miss talk shows every week and visits saving thousands dot com you'll pick up on new articles in audio features about your money and the site is updated every few days\nIt Robert we've got a listener who says they've been offered a deal from a company I see a grim there will set them up on twice monthly payments on their mortgage to make things easier to pay off their house pastor now the company wants five hundred dollars to do this\nWhat are your thoughts on the bi weekly payment plan\nIt really is a cool concept right because most people budget based on their paycheck\nAnd so if you do get paid twenty six times a year instead of twenty four because you're bi weekly\nIt's a cool little kinda I caught a life heck you know it's a cool little hack where you can say you know what I'm gonna\nI'm gonna take my mortgage payments a thousand dollars I'm going to take five hundred dollars out of every paycheck and I'm going to do that twenty six times a year instead of twenty four within the bank Thirteen payments and yes you pay your mortgage out faster but you don't have to have anyone help you do that St Pete people cause and say oh these are the funding offer bi weekly mortgage but no we don't have\nTo anybody can pay you could pay whenever you want as long as it's before the payment date right you could pay whenever you want as long as it's early and so that's where I'm telling you make that extra payment first month ahead because you don't want to get hit with a late fee\nBecause the taxes what'll happen is if if you're a second so\nLet's say that you know the first the first page for you is on the second and then the second pay they will be fourteen days later on the sixteenth\nWell if you make the second half of your payment on the sixteenth it's after the fifteenth\nSo you'll be paid a late fee because you would not have paid the entire thing right by the fifteenth which is a requirement this is why we make one extra payment upfront but that's it and that one extra payment you make your money because it's going to your balance in your interest so that's my vice mayors to the CFPB is suing these guys raise significant sum if by ... percent if it on money I don't know the top of my head\nBut you know and now they're coming back and claiming that you know some of their earliest adopters did save money will obviously they saved money they pay their mortgage out faster the real question is why do they need to pay fees to a company to do by weekly payment so again and you know I'm going to a producer Dave\nRemind me we're going to post a quick little detour you'll on bi weekly payments\nOn saving thousands dot com after the show today or put all five steps right there for you pretty step why make extra payments step to make a payment every time you get paid step three pay off mortgage Vassar three steps they've radio darned easy for you know and I really ... know costs for those three steps\nYou're not going to charge anything I mean if you guys want to be in a check I mean what about your family member attack a couple of thousand bucks for that piece of advice\nI was with you the day that you first introduced that agency and I remember how charged up you worry about it and I was thinking you mean all these years we've never had anybody looking after us you know the consumer but no one\nTheir financial guys on the radio were cheering it on them that nobody else was either credit card companies weren't you know the the pay here pay pay day long people certainly weren't you know there was nobody and have district journey on except you and they are saying we need to protect the consumer\nI think the other day if you do what's right for the consumer you're cool with it if you are out there taking advantage of consumers are probably a little scared and so again at the mortgage bankers conference I just got back from\nA there's a lot of people that are that were Larry yeah they're they're nervous about this they don't like the idea of the consumer financial Protection Bureau they want it back to the old way\nAh yeah I'm personally a fan there were a lot of 'cause a CF PBS consumer financial Protection Bureau people they're running around the conference a I'm a fan I like what they're doing I think it's good yeah I think I think things like this need to come to light and I think you know pay who would've punish pay pal\nHe'll get pay pal and pay pal admitted like yeah we screwed up you know we're going to pay the twenty five million dollars who would have made that happened before\nAnd that's that's the big problem um you know so I think it's a good thing I think I think we need consumer protections I think the number one protection is is us being smarter and us being educated in shopping around which is what this radio shows all about\nUh you know real number one shop around that's the rule the biggest rule the biggest thing I could teach you here to shop around\nOn and to know your numbers I mean all this Vinton together and if you do these things are you really can't protect yourself\nObviously the the best thing is to put twenty percent down so that you can eliminate the mortgage insurance that would be a thirty thousand dollar down payment and again that's a question here coming out of Jacksonville\nA couple of things to follow up on first when you heard Robert refer to a VA long if you're a veteran that's where you you need to check it out a lot of advantages their\nNoses zero down type of loan very attractive rates and it's just robots now another loan product that is zero down is the USDA ... in the U. S. T. A. loan is available in many rural areas around the country one thing is\nUrban sprawl is getting out there and yet ... properties still rated USDA alright let's get back to the phones Tom is on the line and Tom as I understand it you're already in order to be funding plant\nRobert is working on it for me um we had a little bit of working which we greatly appreciate I just had a quick question had mentioned during this process we're not supposed to make any kind of changes gorgeous and we're going through this\nI'm but I'm In I'm In the middle of having to ensure my\nPrice for the insurance now is almost double what it was last year I can get it through a different companies are almost if price that one of the things you're talking about this you know in the interim\nNighttime here first let me let me applaud you for asking you know I I again I think that is that the key here you know in that that is simply what we want you to do you know as a customer during this mortgage process I mean we can't give you that that end all list of of what you can and can't do and what we really we just want to do is call us and asking in your case\nOr changing the insurance on your boat is not going to affect the mortgage process\nUm you know we do not count that in your debt to income ratio that's not one of the qualifying things we have to count against you because it's not a debt\nOr you're the debt on the boat we would have to count those types of things but the insurance we do not so you are good to go ahead and take that insurance policy but again and to anyone listening no matter what mortgage company you're working with if you were in the process of buying a home or refinancing and you are making any changes to your finances is Tom just said\nA simple phone call to the mortgage company to ask the question will save you a lot of heartache because if you are changing one of the things you know Tom if you'd call to say hey I'm I'm refinancing my boat to a shorter term and the payments gonna triple\nYou know that's a different story so the boat insurance is not a big deal yeah I'm Glad I could step to step in and help you guys out you know unfortunately you know we started this process with Tom the appraisal came in shorter than what we expected or\nYou know there's nothing we can do really to to change the appraisal I did talk to a couple appraisers to get their opinion we did some review appraisals and and then they came back accurate so in the end\nTo help Tom out we we altered our guidelines to do a higher loan to value so we can still make the the refinance work and it's still you know deliver on the property initially discussed yeah appraisals are a big point of contention right now it it's a hard spot for all lenders and\nWe really just try to do what we can to accommodate when we can win an appraisal comes in low because it can be very frustrating so yeah I'm Glad you're stuck in there with us Tom and I think we're getting pretty close to the finish line with you but I\nYou're good to go with changing that insurance over\nAll right very good let's go to a friend in Polk County Florida what's your question\nI didn't know any kind of way I could say bankruptcy\nAnd it was too much for it because I didn't have a job and now that I got a job I'm trying to come out of\nHey that's interesting question fat I you know not being an attorney I'm not really familiar there's some very particular laws and rules when it comes to a bankruptcy and I'm not sure exactly from the bankruptcy court side you know how that's going to work\nUm I Do know that there are options to reaffirmed the home as a part of a bankruptcy I'm not sure legally when you have to do that\nUm you know I I think your best bet would be to reach back out to the attorney who filed for bankruptcy let them know what the situation is let them know what the circumstances are and let them know what you're trying to accomplish\nAnd they should be able to guide you know based on how your bankruptcy was filed a what the best course of action is to make sure you can keep your home and begin making payments again and now there's that property\nHave a great weekend actually the cough red blue waters your question\nMy question is whether you you have a lousy credit but all of a sudden you came in to a lot of cash and you would like to buy a house\nIn ... when you encounter because if you want to buy a house and\nIn fact a couple of issues you know for the main part as long as you're not borrowing any part of the the purchase price and you're paying a hundred percent cashier credit you shouldn't come into much play a couple of things to watch out for is if if you've ever had a judgment and filed against you you know as a part of having a bad credit if there's ever been a creditor\nWho was able to sue you and have a judgment placed on you that judgment can attached to their property automatically\nUm other than that you may have some issues getting insurance you may pay slightly higher insurance rates are but when you're paying all cash there's really nothing anybody can do to stop you from buying a house regardless of how bad your credit is so that that shouldn't create any issues for you\nOh have you been told their issues are you just said you know trying to be proactive and find out before you get in the process\nI haven't bought a house yet okay All right I just want to find out what problems I Would have counter I bought a house and\nYeah you wouldn't have any issues at all you know as a cash by or no one has a right to even ready to look at your credit\nThe only people like I said that might would be the uh the insurance company might take a look at your credit and bad credit may affect your homeowner's insurance rates\nBut again when you pay all cash it's even your option whether you want to have insurance or not I would personally recommended in case a disaster strikes but that your call when you pay cash because there are no mortgage company involved to pull your credit or to dictate the rules to you so you know feel feel comfortable to go out there with your cash and buy whatever home you'd like\nAgain you'll find similar questions on credit and articles my visiting saving thousands a job and there is a feature on that site this up these weekly called money minute\nBesides this radio show Robert appears on top radio stations across the country every morning during drive time with them money minutes\nThe ... minutes or yours to play back on demand at saving thousands died out\nAll right Robert let's stay on ... ... there's a lot of creditors are out there that are offering their version of our credit score and credit standing but you went on in our audience knows that is the white to score the jumps right\nIf someone is giving you a psycho score it's the real one they can't make up a fake psycho score right what they have to do is when it's not the psycho score they have to call it something else they have to give it some other name so the key is when you're tracking your credit score and make sure you're getting the psycho score and really what that means is that the scoring model\nThat was developed by their eyes at corporation the original company they've not changed their name to fight go because I Do yes they they changed the psycho because that's what everybody knew him as like a ... corporation like so they're not just caused by too\nAnd that they changed their name but they invented this they built of her scoring model there the model that we use lenders trust and what this model does that looks at it looks at late payments it looks at on time payments it looks at how old your credit is how new your credit is yeah I watch how old is your oldest to count how new is your newest to count\nHow many late payments have you had how recent or those low late payments right late payment last month\nIs a red flag late payments six years ago not so much and right and you know do you have any collections do you have any charge off you know what's going on in your credit file that they need to be concerned about and they built this model looks at your balances\nThat the percentage you owe on your credit cards compared to your limits so let's say the limit is ten thousand dollars and you oh ten thousand one hundred year over limit on my credit card\nThat's a big negative factor if you owe one hundred dollars on my credit card in the balance is ten thousand that's a positive factor because what it says is\nIt says hey he has the ability to go charge ten thousand dollars and he's not doing it right you know someone with maxed out credit cards who's heavily using their credit is a bigger risk than someone who has all these available credit cards and doesn't use them\nBecause they have sufficient money in the bank and they have savings and they're they're more conscious with how they spend money all those things are reflected in fair Isaac psycho\nBuilt a model that looks always argue shopping for a new credit if all of a sudden if you know so right now Rob let's say I pay my bills on time or if tomorrow I go out and buy a Lamborghini three boats six houses and the airplane\nWill I be able to make my payments anymore probably not I'd write will bankrupt\nAnd so that's what they look at when you're opening new accounts when you're opening new debts it's all about tracking how you can build a handle this and so when you do open new accounts\nThey kind of put you in the doghouse for the next six months because they want to make sure you're going to be able to handle the new liability you went from this set of bills and now you added some new bills\nAnd so you have new payments to make let's see if you can absorb them do you make enough money and this is why they don't even care about your your income anymore because what what fair Isaac and fight those figure it out if you're paying off your bills on time and you're not mixing out your credit cards then you have plenty of income\nIf your credit card draw maxed out and you're struggling to pay your bills then you probably don't have enough income\nRight and if you're responsible if you've been responsible for the last five years why age of credit is important Rob so if you if you've been responsible your credit for the last five years right so every time you get a new account you pay it on time and you never miss a lick and you're not for five years or seven years or ten years or Fifteen Years", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Daily Dive Weekend Edition",
