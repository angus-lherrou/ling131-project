talk about the impact of disorganization makes that the sixty percent appliance or service members are veterans thirty two percent are a military family members talk a little bit about that aspect of the work you do\nSure I mean obviously they're they're a part of our overall mission but the importance of that is often times and I'm sure that Rachel can relate to this\nIs it's a family member who may be concerned for and may be willing to reach out where you know their loved ones for whatever reason um you know just as a willing or able to do that and so you know even though\nYou know the you know the love when they're calling about may technically be are quiet you know often times we we work through in with the family members to try to provide that um\nYou know their military spouse or son or or even father or mother depending ah you know gets to help that they have\nRacial talk a little bit about the family aspect of all of this you know obviously as a spouse and then uh you know the family and how they're affected by both the the the PBS the issue and then obviously after\nA suicide takes place\nOf course I'm well of course without saying much is that there's a lot of grief yes there's a lot of grief also before suicide whereas with the DSD it kind of makes the withdrawn it you're\nYou're in with yourself you know some things that you've done before that you absolutely

know again that must be hard for you to relate to what they're going through just like anybody else who hasn't been through what a veteran has has been through so that's got to be\nI'm sure you want to help and you want to understand but it could be difficult\nVery very and I think that's why ... suicide is a great outlet because it's an organization that you know you can speak to another military wife that is going through the same thing you can connect you with these resources that they that worked for them or their husband or their ... or\n... one of their loved ones what works for them it's it's just like a community and you're helping each other out which is really really special\nAnd and when did you really discover stop soldiers who was how long was it after a uh the suicide
