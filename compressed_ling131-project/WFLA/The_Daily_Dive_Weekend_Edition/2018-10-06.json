H essays are funded with pre tax dollars so what does that mean that means\nYou're putting money into an H I say you haven't paid any taxes on this money just like you're doing with your four one K. or your IRA\nI'm not only do they allow you to invest this way but the assets are going to grow tax free they're going to be built up for distribution and you're going to withdraw the this distribution out some day for a qualified medical costs\nBut here's the good news so your money went in pre tax it grew tax free and that's right you guessed it when the money comes out for a medical distribution it's tax free as well\nSo pre tax gross tax free and it comes out tax free plus age essays they don't go away they are not tied to the use it or lose that rule\nAt the end of the year and if that wasn't good enough when you wind up moving to say a a\nHealthcare plan that doesn't qualify for in nature say your existing HSBC balance still doesn't go away\nBut you can't contribute unfortunately too and they just say if you aren't collecting a paycheck or if you're sixty five years or older or if you're enrolled and Medicare but um you know I think this is a great way to wrap\nUp the shell nagging because we've been talking about the five major risks or to your retirement and how to avoid them and right now we're talking about a a medical costs and we talked about reducing taxes we talked about diversification\nAnd we talked about having an emergency find I but I really like this topic because it's so important to remember one thing all of this stuff\nIs basically ... together and it has a very very strong net effect\nTo helping you sure the fact of going into an HR say may only said you to three hundred dollars here and there but I can tell you when you mix this H Sai idea with some of our other strategies is a cumulative effect\nAnd it works very well so if you don't come in and sit down with me I Would suggest that you talk with a financial professional that\nHas an expertise in tax planning tax reduction planning you know it's kind of funny is um several months ago\nI sat down with a gentleman and that it was his second session we went through everything and he said this looks really good and then he had a bunch of questions nagging and one of his questions was a little bit bizarre I said All right Steve my final question\nFor whatever reason if I didn't do business with you\nWho would you recommend I Do business when so he thought I Would recommend like another competitor or somebody else in the area\nAnd I looked at him and I smile and I said well then you should do business with somebody exactly like me [laughter]\nAnd he laughed you have good answer um yeah you have to work with an advisor that has\nA tax planning tax reduction strategies in house to implement\nThis idea of an age I say let me ask you do you have a financial advisor that has educated you on a health savings account or other strategies to help reduce your taxes very very important so\nWe're wrapping up the show today thank you so much for listening Tampa Bay um I'm going to leave you with one small piece of advice this small piece of advice this actually comes from Albert Einstein\nAnd I think it's very important if you hire an advisor make sure you hire an advisor who has plenty of experience because Albert Einstein once said\nThe only source of true knowledge is experience I'm I've been out there is now Thirty years and I would love to have the opportunity to meet you I Would love\nTo have the opportunity to help you\nBut I Can't do that I Can't call you you've got to take that first step give me a call for your free consultation seven to seven seven to for thirty three thirty four seven to seven\nSeven to for thirty three thirty four thank you so much Tampa Bay for listening to the show once again and we'll see you next week\nYou've been listening to the steam hall and retirement well show on the retirement\nProceeding program was paid for by the ... group retirement wealth advisor\nNews radio I Seventy ballet ... two Clearwater\nUm yeah it's one of things you could probably get away with but it's really not truthful and in compliance with the language on the VA more here so I I Would definitely discouraged that I'm sure there's some mortgage companies out there that would happily help him do that but at the end today really doesn't meet the language in the VA mortgage and and it's really gets down to the issue on both sides are you know on the other home\nYou know in the mortgage and says that if if if RJ is no longer living in that home that\nAnd so if he moves out in the wife is there and the wife named on the mortgage so only only RJ as I'm Alone they're both obviously entitled because they're married so far today moves out a there is a clause in the mortgage that says that if you know if if you leave that house and indeed it to someone else that the the bank has the right to call the new do\nSo far today takes himself off the deed as a part of the the the divorce and gives it over to the ex wife and she didn't continue to make payments on our ... mortgage the bank technically has the right to come in and and call that mortgage do because the the the ... loan holder has de to their interest to a third party who they're no longer married to\nAnd they're now making the payments now the likelihood of that happening is very low you know I mean legally and technically it can happen I've never seen it happen or you know we see this in cases where someone passes away\nAnd that the air's continue to make payments on the loan again technically the bank has the right to call that loan do a very you know I guess I've never seen it happen I'm sure it has happened somewhere somewhere along the line\nBut as long as the payments are being made a chance to the bank to come in and called the new do are slim but legally based on language in the mortgage that is a possibility and that's really would try to get people to understand is it a lot of things you agree to that mortgage document\nThere's them hard and fast rules out there when it comes to offers out of the blue we'll promise you some sort of settlement first stop was Robert should use rule number will inject that company out sixteen ways to Sunday\nAnother rule that we'd be rule number five says if you know their tricks you all fall for them\nAs you listen to Robert bummer you'll be educated more and more on scams and tricks and what not to fall prey to\nWhere these rules well they're part of the genes saving thousands rules to success see Robert created these guidelines based on many many years in the financial industry\nAnd the thousands of credit reports he reviewed ... Fifteen saving thousands rules to success\nSimply logo under saving thousands dot com and click on the tab labeled the rules\nGetting back to rule number five if you know they're tricked you won't fall for them one of the worst smoke and mirrors examples zoos\nAuto pay and the fans are everything their financial services industry has put together was built to turn you into a financial zombie\nWho just meanders around and you bump into a fence and your bum go the other way or\nYou hear noise over there and used turning manner that way and and you're not paying attention to anything there is no higher reasoning there's no conscious thinking when it comes to personal finance oh we're going to turn them on the financial zombies and then we're going to take advantage of them make a whole bunch of money\nOr that stops here and now on the saving thousands radio network I'm going to turn you all into financial ninjas and we're going to follow the rules are going to make better decisions were going to save a bunch of money more importantly we are not going to be taken advantage of\nAnd we're going to make a difference because trust me when they realized this stuff isn't working anymore\nThey'll stop doing it it's that simple how do we fight back and when we follow the rules we take back power as consumers and we force an industry who has been going down a really bad path for probably the last forty years to reverse course and start putting us versus consumers again\nOne of the things that came up the other day that I Hope we have a chance to discuss on a late fee basis is a lot of the commercials now come on and they offer you a bottle of some kind of energy bill or diet pills or live better pill and they say the first one hundred capsules are free to the first thousand collars\nThe problem is they still ask for your credit card Robert and then they've the thirty days after you've got the first bottle it shows up on your credit card statement because your nose bottle number two here comes bottle number three and when you try to cancel that it's almost impossible you have to cancel\nOn the third day of the week of the fourth moon or something and you never get it off your credit sound like the problem you had with a credit card companies so many years ago\nYeah let me tell you a convenience is code for we're going to screw you and I mean I maybe I'll make that a rule or you know you know and honestly look that they don't care about your convenience All right but what they know is Otto pay you know ... they call those\nContinuity programs by the way raw I didn't know what it was called ... it's a huge I mean in the marketing world is called continuity programs I Know that if the huge way for companies to make money I mean the auto bill died it's the auto pay with a product attached to it but uh anything that that you think makes your life more convenient right\nOr we've talked about a online bill payer on online statements right why are the credit card companies push you so hard toward on line statements they claim\nIt's to save the environmental yes staked claim is for your own convenience but in reality it's to hide a bunch of disclaimer is from you that were made a requirement under the card act that was passed a couple of years ago where they have to put in big bold print how much you're spending an interest and\nHow much faster you could pay that card off if you just send a couple of extra dollars and that's required to be in big bold print on the PDF or the downloaded statement so what are they going to do they're going to drive your little snapshot screen on your mobile phone that doesn't have that information in the name of convenience and the name of the environment\nThey don't care about the environment they don't care about your personal convenience they care about making money off of you All right let's not confused any of that so\nUh this is all about financial zombie a yeah give me your credit card and just let me bill you whenever I Want give me your bank account let me drafted payment whenever I Want car insurance homeowner's insurance\nAll of these things because what they know and they test this how much can we charge 'em\nBefore they realize it and get wise right so let's let's bump on five bucks that's mumble may bug such ... three bucks let's try to figure out how much we can get away with before somebody wakes up and says\nOh it's just too expensive I didn't agree to pay this right but they know with auto pay your financial zombie you're just out there meandering around looking for the next brain to chew on and not paying attention to wear your money's going\nI figured out another thing after we had that discussion the other day if you simply get it on your your smartphone\nYou only look it up when you're thinking about it but you know if that bill arrives in the mail and you put it in your hot little hands\nYou're going to probably pay at the right time or you've taught him to pay it but if it's just it was just somewhere out there in the cloud and you've got to go find it what about my first Omaha bank account yep when does it do well I haven't thought about that because it's not in my hand\nYeah it's a technology has made us lazy and and financial services companies credit card companies banks have realized that they can capitalize on our laziness right I mean why do people in our shop around laziness ... that's it you know\nEven worse they think their shopping around but they're using websites that are on the take and it only showing the the courage of the items that pay a money you know like ... you know bank rate dot com right sure so it's supposed to be a huge so resource where you can find the best mortgage\nGuesses mortgage you won't find on their mind you won't find our findings rates on there you won't find a zero closing costs refinance Murphy funding on their why because I have to pay them a ton of money to be listed there\nAnd I can pay them and give you a great deal is right and so this whole shopping portal thing again it it it's smoke and mirrors to confuse you it's tricks and so you got to do it yourself or you've got to do it with a trusted resource right\nThat brings us again to rule number twelve urging us to check out companies before doing business with them\nAnd after that rule number one always shop around\nYou know what you're saying much better chance of not being ripped off\nWell last week we talked about items on her credit report good items in bed items and we have a question from a listener who wants to know if I pay off and closing down through the previously been reported as delinquent will it be removed from my credit report faster\nOr or just stay there to haunt me\nKind of reminds me either three dollar pass do on your discovery card years ago you close that as soon as you found out\nI and so one I Will tell you and he I don't have heart prove this but from my experimenting and tinkering with credit reporting\nOr it once you closed an account the fact that it was previously delinquent hurts you less\nOkay so if I kept that discover card open and kept using and carry to balance on it\nUh one I Believe that the the late would have had a a more lasting negative impact on my credit score that paid off in full and closed it and my score bounce back almost completely in two months right and he had I not paid it off and close it had to continue to carry a balance I left it out there I think the score calculation would've put my weight on it uh-huh\nBut now here I Am so I paid it off immediately I closed it I have not been a customer of discover\nAnd five years and I will never be a customer service cover again because they didn't call me or anything they just let me go thirties late on three dollars which I understand was my responsibility to no\nIt's that trick and and that's why it's so important that consumers understand you know real number five at once you know their tricks they don't work anymore and\nSo the whole purpose of the show the whole reason I come on here every day if they try to expose those tricks\nAnd to try to give people right information and and sometimes it is a trick and sometimes it's just misinformation like still is not trying to trick anybody you know that with with that they just are they're they're they're just they're spreading misinformation they're not trying to trick you they have no benefit from giving you a wrong home valuation they can't give you are right when so it's their only choice\nYou know ... they crunched this data and all of a sudden it gets picked up and get smaller listening I mean look at clearly work\nBecause I'm Talking about um well they're talking about here I'm saving thousands radio network in you know because they put out a bogus report everybody else is talking about how great it is and how wonderful it is for people in Orlando and Tampa in Miami I yeah I'm Talking about how crazy they are and how wrong they are but they they that's the whole thing there is no bad publicity so that's why they do it\nThey're not trying to trick you they're just trying to do grow their business and grow their stock price but others the financial services companies are trying to trick us they try to trick is every day and I'm here to expose that because once you know the trick it doesn't work\nOr you know what they guy is millions of dollars worth of free publicity and they got some ... which I don't think they deserve personally but they were quoted in Wall Street journal quoted money their quota Bloomberg soul of a sudden they're in a sorority well that's what they sold the bill of goods Syria\nIt is and now now getting we're going to have local homebuyers making bad decisions and guess when the home buyers and realize they were wrong when they get out bit\nHome buyers they lose their houses if they listen to this\nSo you know where it went in the home when a homeowner Caesar wrong value for their house because they use the the the estimates they now make wrong decisions right ... you know they may make the wrong decision to stay the wrong decision to sell the wrong decision to refinance not refinance getting ... don't sell stay move\nAll these decisions are based on home value and so they're misinformation is causing people to make wrong decisions you can't make the right decision that right information and now this article has the potential to get home buyers to low ball offers and lose at home all because of misinformation and and nothing upsets me more\nIf you go out there and hold yourself out as an authority you've got to spread information that is accurate and that is beneficial for the consumer and beneficial for us and that is not what they do\nYou've heard Robert refer to the fifteens saving thousands rules to success\nYou'll see the complete listed are companion website saving thousands dot com what else was there you'll find articles audio features\nPast the ... of this show and replays of the popular radio show money minutes Robert we kicked off the show at the top of the hour with financial advice based on the Fifteen saving thousands rules to excess I Love those rules\nWhere do you say we review some of the actual rules themselves and have you explain them\nRecap the rules Rob we've we've talked about these are real number one always shop around all purchases banks ATM fees credit cards mortgages life insurance car insurance I could go on and on rule number one here on saving thousands of always shop around\nRule number two is no your numbers I Know your numbers this is your credit score we've talked a lot about that that this week how to distribute items\nOr the balances on your cars the interest rates on your cards car loans mortgages everything\nUh so you've got to know your numbers I rule number three is the three day rule uh this is the pledge that all of us financial and then just here on the saving thousands radio network before we take on any type of major purchase\nOr before we apply for any type of credits or take out any type of new loan we're going to think about it for three days I this was a it seems to be a rule that was used in dating\nAnd one that I I've inaccurately tried to use on my now wife uh and uh but it's much better when applied to finance not so good when applied the romance so three day rule right away three days before we make any decisions on a large purchase and it really doesn't empower you when you're sitting there with that pushy sales guy\nAnd he's like you know when he leans in any he offers you the Penn\nRight you know like like these these Nineteen sixties closing techniques like oh would you like to use my pin or your opinion\nI don't need a pen at all thank you I'm going to wait three days before I make a decision\nYou know well what can we do to get you to commit today you can't do anything to get me to commit today because I'm going to wait three days because I listen to Robert Palmer on the saving thousands radio network\nAnd I'm their father three day rule so it's a good way for you to push off that pushy sales guy it's a good way to push off that that clerk in line at the department store is trying to sell you a high interest rate credit card would you like to sign up for your whatever car today to save twenty percent\nWould love to but I have to take that pamphlet go home and read it and wait three days and make a decision and if I still think it's a good idea I Will come back here and buy more of your glass or whatever it is I'm buying and I just can't then so that's the that's the three day rule that the the first three rules we talk about a lot\nA so moving on maybe some new territory from our listeners are real number for\nA is we're not going to abuse credits but we're not going to fear it either\nRight Syrian or don't abuse credit this big you know but don't fear it either that the solution is not to just have no credit the solution is not to bury your head in the sand and be afraid of credit\nAnd and think that you can get through life with nothing and no credit score because let me tell you where where maybe ten or Fifteen Years ago you could ... uh we're moving more and more and more toward a society where the credit score is used in so many parts of your life\nFrom insurance to any type of business financing I mean there's just so many ways that score is being used or that you can't ignore it and and you know we we we we maybe had a chance of consumers to fight this trend that ship has sailed\nA it is getting more and more mass appeal to businesses into all aspects of our life so we can't be afraid of credit the other reason is there's ways you can take advantage of credit and you can make money you can ... you can uh\nYou know you can take advantage of that six months interest free and invest your money in in a mutual fund in and make some cash you can you can take advantage of that that car deal where it's six months interest free and put your money to work somewhere else\nOr there or you can take advantage of airline miles you know I get a couple of nice vacations a year off of my American Express points\nAnd if I was afraid of credits yeah I've got the money I don't have to use credit I could pay cash for everything I could use a debit card for everything that's another issue we've talked about is a waste of using a ... I may have to make that rule robbed ... and he's with financial and then just don't use debit cards I think I may jump out there and be that bold with it\nUm so all these things you can't be afraid of credit I just it doesn't work and so what I'm going to do here on the show was going to teach you how to use credit to your advantage that's what we do but you've got to have it you can't ah life with zero debt\nOr with zero credit just doesn't work in today's society now I'm not saying be a slave to not saying Barry yourself\nBut you know there's some great tax benefits to having a mortgage\nThere's a lot of benefits to using credit cards and then just paying them off every month if you pay 'em and full every month during the grace period you gotta costs herself in the interest which are able to take advantage of the miles or the the rebates that the protections there's all these great things there that's real number four don't abuse credit but don't fear it either\nA real number five is if you know their tricks they won't work right and so for this you know I I\nI really do believe and I know from experience that big financial services companies absolutely use tricks\nOr to try to confuse us and get us to overspend get us to not pay our bills on time or you know we talked about the trick of trying to get consumers to go paperless\nYou know they want you to to give up getting paper statements\nAnd deliver them ... trying to say because then they can hide all the disclosures that's the trick because then you don't know how much money you could say by paying it off\nIn three years instead of Twenty years by only sending an extra ten dollars a month you know these these are the tricks they want you to sign up for that credit card in line when you're not paying attention when you're not asking questions like what the annual the what's the a PR\nThey want you to float that mortgage rate they want you to not lock and they want to let you float around out there and\nLap around as a floater you know has no control their destiny and give them all the power back that's one of the tricks and as a consumer if we know the tricks they don't work anymore they they can't trick us if we know what they're trying to do so will number five if you know their tricks they don't work\nIf you're new to the show you might be wondering where did the Fifteen saving thousands rules to success come from anyway well Robert Palmer rooms of very successful mortgage company and before starting a company he had spent years in the mortgage industry\nNow imagine the tens of thousands of reading reports credited applications and actual potential borrowers that he's studied Robert found that there were stark differences between the people who have good credit\nAnd those with low scores\nHe saw trends in financial habits and from that he was compelled to create the ... the easy you understand easy to follow guidelines about money error go the Fifteen saving thousands rules already Robert speaking of those rules let's get back to them\nWill number six or you've got to spread your knowledge you've got to educate your friends and family for so long money and finance and credit scores was this taboo and and nobody wanted to talk about it\nThese Reich water which does better luck on my heart\nAnd is there a John Deere chicken McDonnell yet this first NHL goal is percentage all pointed one of the Panthers\nCharge check and Hoover do and that was scoring in the first period they Michigan obviously on the call and\nSay no doubt had some work to

Central Park that's what it was pretty clear that it was a hand related injury there and you hope it's not serious as you thought they having to reach shoveled someone we know they're in depth on the

feel bad for him because you know he had a really good pre season I thought I'm really solidified his spot on on on this team or maybe this time last year you weren't sure what the future we started
