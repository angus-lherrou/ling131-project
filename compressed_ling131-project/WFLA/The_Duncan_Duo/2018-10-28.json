had made an investment with us so he climbed all the way up to the twenty six thousand but guess what happened to his portfolio when it went down nothing all of his money was locked in he couldn't lose a dime\nSo he calls me that I Can't believe what a relief it is to see all this volatility going on and I know I'm safe and that's what we do I mean that's what we do every day of the

to see David this weekend David builder\nOut of the one who I'm miserable\n... she was well what David five years and shooting and make a penny\nYeah that was sad but there's an example of something look variable annuities I say this it was right on the cover of Forbes magazine it's the ruins suitable for retirement purposes because you have a death benefit your insurance with annual increasing term insurance right so do you want insurance or do you want income\nYou can justifiably offer someone ozone advisor or you could add if they're younger but see need death benefit because you have kids but after that now for retirement and gosh and you're absolutely correct\nI mean she was not making anything and the last ... euro kinds of fees for four percent or the hitter in the wrong sectors\nThat are money grew nowhere in the last four or five years and the markets doubled and she made nothing ship so all this money lost money or the guy that sold it to her gets the trailer commissions intervene or remember this is why again if you go to someone that represents a big company\nIn her case it was a major insurance company you know major they have the big banks\nThe brokerage houses they will always so you products products us we'll do therefore you have to sell your products you don't want products she wants to reduce your advice and at our company we can show

website schedule appointment is Graham capital advisors dot com\nWas David you know when when I meet with clients you know many of them want to know how much risk should I be taking with my money\nAnd there's there's a twofold answer that question one as we say all the time please don't take risk with your retirement money because if you lose it you may not be able to earn enough back to replace what you lost you don't have enough time is true\nAnd to if you have non retirement money than invest that money wisely now what does that mean\nI don't know you tell me why why's wisely just make sure they should get it back you know people should be that old more Mark Twain a cliche quote that he had a more concerned about the return of my money than to return on my money and I'm telling ya\nPeople today that are all year or two away from retirement or thinking of making money and don't think about making money in this space and time to make money next year Graham capitalize as we're going to be buying stock sixty cents on the dollar and they're out of here and ... got to be patient now\nLet's just say a person's working with a broker you know and love brokers earn their money by making commissions and man oh man they just love it when you buy it use cell and the best way to get you to do this is to convince you to buy this doctor that mutual fund\nBut you could be very well much better off by\nPutting your money into an investment it is guaranteed rather than making needed very expensive in the intensive changes all the time\nLike when you talk we talk about guaranteed besides death and taxes what do you have you have banks you know and you have insurance companies and what we could do is show you the most newest innovative\nWays that they're recommending to their clients\nTo keep something guaranteed and get the highest guaranteed rate of return and that that ... that if you truly want a guaranteed again there's different ways of doing it you have to tell us really where you fit in the grand scheme of things and we'll tell you we don't have any specific relationships with some certain companies there are\nA lot of other guys on the radio that actually have their their shows paid for by insurance companies are always telling life insurance or knew what he is or what have you we don't have anything like that we use computers\nI don't care who the

wondering what to do with this pile of retirement money you've got so okay you don't need the new you know that you don't need the money for a year so let's say you go ask your broker what to do with that cash I guarantee you one thing the last thing they are going to tell you to do is to put it into any type of an investment that is guaranteed\nBecause those types of investments don't pay them the big commission if\nSo they're going to steer you towards more risky investments and that is not investing your money wisely\nWell you're not getting through producer advise Roger absolutely correct look grab capital visors we can help you do it the right way go to our website schedule appointment it's grim capital advisors dot com you ought to be really lucky on life go help someone and godson a smile on yet you're going to get to be incredibly lucky\nThat was going to wrap it up for us rules the next week for guaranteeing your retirement\nThe proceeding program was paid for by Graham capital\nNews radio nice Seventy ballet when you went to the two Clearwater\nUm it is really a catch twenty two it's that tore still really low so then prices go up because in the tourist solo but at the same time prices are going up interest rates are going up\nI'm there's buyers out there but prices just get to the point where there are too high for buyers to want to buy so eventually what we see is prices levels level out and then the price of fall but you would think that if buyers um\nWanted newness in a home and didn't want to spend twenty or thirty thousand or more on renovations that new construction sales would actually be up but I think what's happening is\nBecause of the labor shortage which again of affects everything with ... ... homes\nUm buyers turn around and they you know they can't they can't get good prices on a lot of the new construction homes because a lot of things like labor shortages\nMarket tightened this land prices I mean all these things\nDrive up prices um especially supplies stuff like that that becomes also in short supply so all those things turn around and they affect the prices the builders can get four new properties which again prices a lot of buyers out I mean are you kind of seeing the same thing with existing homes parents\nOh absolutely I and you know I I think why they're looking for more at a resale home that's newly mandated because a lot of the homes that new bills are having aren't ready yet and they know that interest rates are rising every single week and they're ready to put their responded by now\nI Do find a and it does this isn't just with new construction but also stuff as simple as furniture purchases and you know anything that goes into a home I Do think that the desire for millennials as more they want to buy right now they don't want to turn around and wait\nNine months or a year for these things to be ready a lot of\nThe younger buyers that we work with\nA millennials even Gen x or sometimes um and then the younger millennials they want to go home or go out and they want to find a house which they go towards existing homes and really established neighborhoods that are good\nBut in New construction a lot of times they want to go for an inventory home they don't want to wait for the building process to go through they don't want to wait wait wait I mean\nThis is a a consumer sex\nThat is that is finding things and purchasing number right now they don't want to wait until even tomorrow for so yeah\nAnd I think it also depends on area and price point because I agree with you know for homes I guess you'd say more in the price point of like a first time homebuyer to three hundred thousand dollars\nYes absolutely people want to be able to move in the next day but me personally I'm seeing a lot of these bigger build homes over half a million dollars that are ... meaning the by you know there's a certain a soldier for a buyer to go in and pick out their counter tops and they're flooring\nThese all these new construction homes are finished and it's\nPeople or you know I think they're being a little bit more hesitant you know like I like I if I'm paying all this money I Know it's brand new but it's not the perfect flooring or non life ... ... it's not like exact countertop or lay out I Would want so I think that is also you know probably\nBut do you think that's a large part of the market segment or do you think what you're talking about is a small part of the market segment who's also owned homes before because they're out there buying move up property is what you're talking about spec homes or Mm yeah property is during the ...\nYeah no I think that's a smaller portion of the market so\nI I personally think that a lot of things could be affecting new builders better\nAlmost outside of the bubble of what they're thinking um I also don't think that a lot of people want to move way out where a lot of new builders are building and we're not talking that they're building two hundred thousand dollar or even two hundred and fifty thousand dollar homes I mean these builders are far out but they're building four and five hundred thousand dollar properties you know\nIt used to be one thing to move far out and have a hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand dollar property and that's your starter home but what these builders\nAnd not all of them but one of a lot of builders are doing is they're buying the cheaper land but then they're also building four and five ... up to eight nine hundred thousand dollar homes or they want to make a large profit and the amount of buyers that seemed to want that just\nThat is the metal is small yeah I just they'll pay that much for a property but will they pay for that much for a property in the middle of a county that pass the ... location [laughter] than what I mean what are your thoughts on that\nI think you're absolutely right and I think you know they're not a fabulous like you know Tampa Bay or west chase or ... or or or those type areas where it's family friendly there's lots of things to do they have great school districts you know things like that I think that you know when you're targeting people\nWhen when when builders are targeting people let's just say why am I I mean look how why I'm On a has just blown up in the last year they're targeting buyers who are you know retirees people moving from up north stuff like\nThat yeah I think that it depends on the market area\nIn general um but I Do think that you know you hear all these articles oh the suburbs are back all this kind of stuff well they are back but I'm now with with new home sales following I don't know how long that that's going to go on I'm not sure builders will be able to keep up with the labor supply shortage\nUm some of the increasing tariffs which will of theoretically\nIncrease the prices of building materials yet um you know again supply and demand so who knows but then also the price of lands going up a large tracks of land are harder to find I mean\nA whole bunch of stuff is going into\nUm the idea of this of this new construction slow down that we're seeing this is just the beginning of usually what happens in a larger slow down um existing home sales\nAnd prices tend to lag this a little bit but we are seeing at least from what we look at that you have to be priced really really competitively 'em and you need to be in great condition which is what you guys mentioned\nIs a lot of people decide they want to wait until after the holidays and the spring to list and an armed market we really don't see a slow down we actually a lot of times the uh bumping sales before the end of the year\nAnd you have a lot of people that don't want to put their home on the market so you have a lot less competition so again it goes back to supply and demand um people\nDon't want people traipsing through their home or during the holidays but if you can put up with that generally the people that are out looking are very serious buyers and they really want to find at all\nI can tell you a funny story last year\nAnd I was negotiating a very high price home on Christmas Eve right\nNow this is the time of year if you are looking to buy this is the kind of year if you're looking to buy\nContact that we had the and then tore we're telling our sellers you know this is the this is the time of year to pay your house on the market are second biggest causing ninth as December always always December and you know you have a higher chance of selling for more money because when when the beginning of the year starts\nYou will see and then tore rise in prices always will go down a little\nThat he had dreams in January is always our busiest month of taking listings where we actually go out and we we get a lot of people who are like okay the holidays are over I'm ready to list come out and meet with me let's go\nIf you can get a jump on that by a couple of months and you can you put yourself through a little bit of you know ...\nYeah of of being on the market over the holidays\nYou generally end up with um a better price and you end up with you know more money in your pocket you walk away with a better deal and the buyer that they're excited because there's not a lot of him and tore out there and they feel like they found a great property and they want to close by the end of your life has for tax purposes you know everybody ones\nPlus like everything we're also seeing interest rates are still going up absolutely interest rates are so you can you know ... are very motivated they're almost probably a little scared like who knows how much more they're going to go up versus you know we really need to wait and find that great house and you said earlier that people who are looking at this time of year are very very serious buyer\nYeah absolutely I think for a thanks for joining us during the segment we'll be back right

its Mariner dry this resort south ... beautiful Gulf views and beautiful beautiful renovated condo\nAnd there's also a boat slips for two hundred and fifty dollars a quarter which I don't know your belt lovers out there now that that if a deal\nAnd check out this kind of it's located in ... springs\nAwesome when things were talking about during the break that we also think are starting to affect sales is um the rising mortgage rates that we're seeing out there\nI Know Mike Gates who's from Atlanta gray mortgage and usually on the show with us talks about that he's also out this week but rates have been continuing to rise and it is starting to affect\nUm some affordability on some homes you know a couple of years ago um you know I I purchased my property and I got four point two five percent and I was thrilled about that well then rates went down to about three and a half percent\nAnd I was really mad [laughter] to five percent but now that four point two five percent starting to look really good with rates approaching five percent and again raised on a five percent yet but um they're they're heading that way a lot of economists feel like\nThey will get their um we just don't know when\nA and it will that major really affect the real estate market and it it is kind of funny that we're talking about five percent rates like it's just the absolute worst thing in the highest\nYou know interest rates ever but I mean there was a lot of people in the real estate industry that Twenty years ago or so that threw a party when rates went below ten percent and exactly and that was really low um back then I mean there was times in the eighties that you were in a team\nTo almost twenty percent rates which is obviously very insanely high\nBut you know five percent interest rates still historically is very low but it does get to a point where people do remember the times of you know three and a quarter three and a half four percent five percent you know you're paying more for the same property and it's hard to justify that with yourself where\nWhile I could have bought the same house a year ago or two years ago a and I'm I'm paying more now for the same exact thing it in just a higher rate not even higher price but you know just like higher prices I mean rates effect during\n... but right now we're also seeing higher prices and higher rates\nYou know and that's why when you're in it goes shading inspections you know that's really something that buyers need to be aware of that you can cancel and go to another property back the interest rates could rise next week and now you can no longer afford a home like\nThat yeah and I would say for the virus you aren't you know very familiar with the mortgage process and how everything works because the numbers just may mean nothing to them speak to your lender have them break down what that looks like over life your payments versus now because usually you'd be very surprised how much more\nYou're going to pay if that interest rates keep going up versus paying a little bit more for a house now\nYeah and the thing about interest rates that usually um\nIs a good thing as interest rates usually mean that the economy is doing really well you know the economy's doing so well they have to make money\nMore expensive to borrow because so many people are borrowing money so many people are using money so many ... so much money is on the economy", "show_name": "The Duncan Duo", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "28"}
