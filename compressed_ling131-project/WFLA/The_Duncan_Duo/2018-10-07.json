{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "Now it's down to two point eight are and that's something we want to keep an eye on going into the winter months because if you're worried about inflation which is certainly a narrative that is taking hold this week due to interest rates\nDue to the jobs report a I think certainly one of the big focuses again is which way is the average hourly earnings trending because of consumers have more money than they're willing to spend it on goods and that's that's good for the economy\nOne asset benefits are from rising interest rates\nWell the U.S dollar benefits from rising interest rates that certainly won a in a new really teddy it depends on which particular assets\nOr at least generate the most interest and I and I know that might be a very a confusing the answer but for example for the better part last six or seven months we've seen a lot of foreign buyers we seen a lot of large cash inflow does come into the country\nAre in that certainly very important when you are determining which way interest rates are going to go special us treasuries\nAre just in the last thirty days\nWe've seen the influence we seem to growth rate of in flows shrink\nUh and so from that we're not having the same amount of foreign buyers and so that doesn't help US dollar a but to answer your question directly at least right now a stronger US dollar\nIs helping people who are uh buying foreign goods for example now some of that\nWill be counterbalance by some of these terrorists is especially if you're importing goods from China or the terrorists are you're having to pay on those goods are ... are being balanced out by your purchasing power being stronger\nBut as of right now the U.S dollar or or or higher interest rates are are are are benefiting very little there's generally not a good benefits across all asset classes by higher interest\nRates well it's going to be interesting to see how this thing washes out across the board stuff you know there's so much going on now and uh hey what's sectors you think are going to benefit from our interest rates\nWell sector in particular financial in particular banks\nOf banks make their money on spread that in particular the metric is called net interest income uh in sometimes if it's a if it's not a bank but it's another type of financial ... will be called net investment income\nUp but companies that lend money are generally do well during periods where the long in the curve when long term interest rates rise more so than short term interest rates and that's what we've seen this week we've seen the long in your curve really ...\nThe move higher the ten year in the thirty year have moved very materially much more so than what we've seen over the last few years and that's caused\nA sense of panic for maybe long term debt owners are long a long term bondholders a but with that being said banks benefit the most because they can buy or they could borrow she can bar on the short end\nAnd they could borrow at lower rates are and then let land on the longer and so if you're forecasting deal currently gets deep and or or to get a more normal I guess you could say with long in the curve is much higher than the short in the old curve\nIf you believe that's going to continue and this trend just started this week if you believe that's going to continue banks you wrote a benefit that's certainly one of the major reasons why when you look back at this past week banks and financial institutions were the biggest out performer with the energy markets\nIn about a minute here you know the ten year treasuries went up again explain to listeners do inverted reverted yield curve and what that means\nWell with the ten year going higher ah it makes the chances of a number to your curve lower the burden your courage when short term interest rates\nA move higher the long term interest rates and that's generally seen as a very bearish pattern and it causes a bottleneck and credit markets and in which and we said this again on the show\nA credit markets or is the blood line it's the blood of our American economy if you don't have credit or than economy freezes we saw that first hand and the great recession we saw that in the great depression when credit markets and banks don't lend then companies have to lay people off because they rely on commercial paper which is credit\nUh but all in all the tenure rising certainly puts a the banks and the driver seat and encourages them to lend it makes them more profitable however they get more expensive right if you were planning on buying a home or any time in the near term future you want to start getting you want to start moving on that\nInterest rates are only going to go higher the mortgage is typically get price on the tenor thirty year treasury write us all in all interest rates are going to go higher and that's going to put more long term pressure or on all asset prices\nRight such as always we appreciate your sage advice let's see what happens this week we'll be talking to next week take care now figures dashed by by uh did you know that there was a way of investing that could give you a growth in the stock markets and at the same time protecting him a market down during her crash\nYou know it sounds too good to be true well it's not because in the last

their their intentions accomplished well\nProceeding program was paid for by Graham capital\nRadio knives seventies WFL a W ... two Clearwater\nI'm John the question our top story at ten o'clock hurricane season has not finished with us here\nAnd you said a visit right recently to China or says well we did last weekend yeah one of the best things about China is is that not only are we getting to them but they also do absolutely everything that they can to help us with our event so last weekend we had about twenty about committee members\nKick it toward the trainers hospitals for children Tampa not the international had guys which is off the ... Campbell yet but we went to the U. S.\nUSF location which is the location that we don't eat too and so we had ... we spend a groups and then they took us around the hospital tour and I mean they explained absolutely everything to us from the money that\nWe had raised our freshman year we got to go when we got to physically see touch\nAnd like we didn't get to see how it works but we got to see the machine called the EL asked\nThat we helped raise money for [noise]\nAnd so what that machine does some kids have to have X rays like once twice three times a week to see as their prosthetics are working at their whatever it may be their treatment plans are working\nAnd so when a body is exposed to that much radiation you can get back you can not feel good and on a little body that's a lot of radiation to be exposed to and so that machine cuts\nRadiation by I think one wealth of normal radiation stuff so I mean it's just great to be able to go and see what we've actually been raising money for and then currently we're raising money to help pay for the motion analysis lab which is something that helped art teacher are advisor Mr than of all was well he went to China is can\nHe grew and grew up with a condition of of all the other leg he went he went through some treatment with them and they helped him obviously a lot and you know the the the ... especially a lot of organizations like trainers they do need a lot of help from the community to be able to raise funds to be able to do these types of things and\nSo you know you are obviously having you know we wanted to have you guys on the show today but there's some other great community partners that you guys have\nBasically like you name all my favorite restaurants in Tampa [laughter]\nAre supporting a dance for a chance you got daily eats a green lemon for rivers Olive Garden and Hungary highway so I'm I might even show up just just to eat all the leftovers\nYeah I don't know if they're it allows ... hours them having to like absolutely everybody's well of course we want to marry or daughter [laughter]\nActually we are going to that's great [laughter] is where it will be there\nSo but the the other thing that I think um\nYou know a lot of people don't know is is how successful uh this has been so you know there there's a lot of people out there that will do charity work angels or you know on a couple of boards um we've been involved in fundraising and when you sell it told me like what you you know what you guys go for fundraising was I was I was pretty blown away I was like ... the race and how much\nSo what are you guys talk about that a little bit because I think that's something that um I think is really cool to have\nYou know a group of ... of high schoolers that are doing something like this and then the amount of true impact that you guys really are going to make\n[noise] so our freshman year when we started we um it was just regular night and we found is that and we only raised three thousand dollars and then the next year we like established a committee of about ten of our friends we planned a little ahead and we raised eight thousand and then last year it kind of it really grew with like doubled in size or committee was like twenty people\nUm we had a lot of corporate sponsorships people donating food D jays and we were able to raise twenty six thousand year it was fantastic I had to end this year we want to keep the growth I mean we've doubled and triple every year so this year we want to keep that up even though it's obviously much deeper so\nOur goal is fifty thousand dollars off of um we've partnered with many many more corporations um all those restaurants you named are donating their food does one hundred percent we have no operations budget so everything at our event is completely donated like all the food DJ's um services so this year is it's an upward\nBut that's a big wrote in and I you know we're kind of relating to charity aspect of what you guys are doing to our business um we we had years where we doubled tripled in size and growth it gets hard the bigger as you get the harder that gets to sustain that to get enough people on board and and so regardless\nI'm you know just having a goal of raising fifty thousand dollars is pretty incredible the fact that you guys tripled the year before last from eight to twenty six is just incredible\nYeah it's a great inspirational story especially I mean you guys are kids right you know to the rest of the world and for you guys to do that I think I'm just inspiring other kids to do the same within their schools you know finding a charity that's meaningful for them and then figuring out you know obviously there's lots of parents at the school so just reaching out and raising more awareness to them to sponsor that's awesome\nAnd I think on the same token obviously a this can be a great\nA jumping board for you guys in terms of what you do after Tampa ... you know going going to college it's ... if you'd look incredible on a resume but you may find a passion within the charity give back to where you get involved and nonprofits you know whether to try it out of college or whether it's later on in life\nUm you know I think in our experience getting exposed to that and and being able to see the impact of it and meet the kids and meet the people that they have the impact\nUm you know you guys getting exposed to this is an early age is is incredible I I don't think there's enough um you know organizations are schools out there that that do things like that to get kids involved in a charity give back\nBecause the more that they do that the more humble they are by their experiences and the more they get to see and experience um you know some of these things so that later on in life they're they're more focused on helping others and instead of just themselves and and so I think that's pretty cool\nSo far listeners want to get involved and donate either many or services how do they get involved with the eyes\nOf sonar social media we have a link at our bio that um they can donate to are registered to come to the event it also had you condemn our social media and I'll probably answer it and I'm On the website it lessens recognized contact information and we're a pretty much twenty four hours [laughter] um [noise] to respond to anyone else in India\nThat dance for chance TPA yeah so at dance for chance TPA on either Facebook or Instagram so basically here's what that means a younger people go to Instagram and go to a dance for chance the ten year old like\nAn old woman you're older ... book and looking at ... hey there how can we do have Instagram come on I'm joking it's\nThings of Snapchat though because you have to be able to like every time you fellas that now the explains mapped out to me I'm like I'm In it for a lot and then if I'm just like this sucks I'm able to do this [laughter] I mean\nLike the message disappears it can be a great message and poof it's gone now I Can't do that like I like to say I'm the guy that doesn't delete like any emails like every emails in a folder I'd I don't delete and I you know so I'm not like\nThat bad about it but nonetheless I get a message like I'm going to keep it or or the other thing that she said was a you know and you have like all these pages where these photos and these are photos I sent that this person this I mean that's confusing when [noise] [noise] no I I don't I don't want to learn now\nUh consequently we do have is Snapchat a page we've used it a couple of times uh but I ... I think I'm going to delegate that to someone else in the company you know what why don't you take over the snapped and 'cause it's not it's not a national with me\nSo so at dance for chance TPA so if you're a business owner um and you want to get involved maybe either a given something back to them or making charitable contributions um it looks like as far as uh the dancers themselves I Would assume it's obviously a lot of uh Tampa prep students but but if someone wants to be one of the dancers are what are the options for that\n[noise] um they can come from any school we actually have six different schools locally in more coming that are participating in the event so anyone is free to participate\nThat's awesome and so um some of the schools obviously on here are you know schools that\nEvery year I'm rooting for example breath to be in more of your head [laughter] so you know we we don't want any of these schools get more kids there than you guys you know but\nBut nonetheless I assume the more dancers and you know the more opportunity for those people to get involved and and to give back so is there anything specific any other um charities are outreach or companies that that you're looking for a that you love to just you know put out there on the air if there's someone that does this or that\nYou can think of anything specifically just in general community involvement\nWell we're always open to new ideas and some people just come up to us and they have these wonderful ideas that we've never thought of and then somebody said a couple of years ago George ... get back night and made us very significant amount of our fundraising call it\n... and ... and things like that always works hard to get me to go ... times I mean what\nI saw like oh well we're going to different ... and I don't really go through but if it's your bowl and it sounded good\nSays something that like reaches out to the community is just like if you'd be interested in our event like here's a brief rundown of where he has people finish writers that come to speak we have this runners had typically that comes in speaks to us\nExplain to her dancers what they're raising money for where their money is going to a hundred percent of the funds that we raise go directly to try and our hospital for children\nWe have kids that China has helped to come through like Jessica ...\nI think we have like two others probably coming this year and then like max had said earlier we like ask everybody to stand for four hours were kind of mean we don't give people chairs\nLike even if they're eating I like that though even if they're eating like\nWe only get the shrine is kids chairs because all they are allowed to say they've they've been through it like everybody else is raising money we ask people to take a need when we speak at school um other than that there's always food there's tons and tons and tons\nFood or doing like a competition between the other schools to see who can raise the most money no they they are doing a competition internally though okay I I maybe I'm wrong but I think it I don't I think you guys do you guys do a competition with like\n... absolutely you know not only the rates going up and the affordability but our housing market with the appreciation homes have gotten more expensive so it's made it harder for people to afford some things I think a lot of time to it's always equate it to like sticker shock\nYou know rates have been so low so long that just that five percent threshold for instance really freaks people out yeah you know you know like you said it it's still not bad\nAnd hit the five percent I mean it's kind of by the national ... of the national average hasn't but writes a regional to\nGhetto you know I'm just because the average or is there that doesn't mean that that rates haven't broached five there's a lot of stuff out there that's\nThat's five percent but there's still some government stuff in the force yeah which can can kind of changes averages um you know the article also a was dated and that information came out before\nWednesday which was another bad day for rights as well so yeah um you know I Would be willing to bet that whenever just come out again next week there'll\nBe even higher yet the other thing you know so obviously that impacts affordability that impacts people's ability to buy 'em it impacts the impacts people's ability to revise well you know because obviously so many people you know refined to that rate is is just not very likely so you're not going to see a lot of ... activity when rates are hitting those kind of high\nExactly the the refinance market is it's practically did I mean that's\nYour head and you're doing it right now by it it's likely to cash some money out or to get rid of ... and they still make or do us harm reduction right you know the adults quicker than the other part about it that in an angel talks a Angela teaches financial peace university or with Dave Ramsey I should do in a class right now it's obviously the\nThe debt and the mortgage rates and all that kind of ... you know touch into some of the stuff that you do on on that front um but the the fear about rates going up as it'll it'll dig people into bigger you know financial hole where they they're not able to make their payments and could the increase of race be the beginning of\nYou know some some downward pressure not Dahmer pressure some downward you know trends in real estate\nReally stabilization said that leader who can you know we can come in last week and they were talking about how the cost of living for seniors are people on fixed income\nIt's really difficult for them because the price of as rentals and housing continues to collapse and maybe this interest rate increase will help stabilize that a little bit and we won't see the increases that we have an ...\nAnd here's the thing people see this and sometimes they look at it and they think oh man that's bad for the real estate market but mean reality sometimes it's not like we said you max and people often speakers would also needs to happen we've had so little and mentor a homes for so long part of the reason we've had so little lemon to raise because sellers are afraid to put their home on the markets mind something to buy\nBecause it it isn't and affordability issue for them if they can't find a house to buy so they don't want to put their house in the market because they don't want to go homeless\nWill just car company 'cause I've never had anyone go homeless\nUm but but the reality is that uh that pressure on race could then increase inventory a little bit to where more and more sellers are comfortable saying okay six and seven months on the market I'm seeing enough options and I'm not seeing as many ... and now I'm OK but in my house on the market so it could have\nA really great benefit of of bringing some more listening so\nYeah and I've even seen some forecasts that you know by the spring of next year it might flip from that seller's market to a buyer's market so actually\nYou know and I think it's the stabilization like Angela said you know for us it's not always fun because the market tends to slow a little bit yeah and that's how we make a living sure but at the end of the day it's great for the housing economy yeah it has to switch around\nPoints so the the shift in rates in some of this affordability issue causes some other problems we're gonna talk after the break room talking about mortgage fraud and unfortunately it rears its ugly head when you have situations happen like this and when real estate market start to show little signs of of of some shifting are changing and I talk about shifting and changing I'm not\nPeople don't get all freaked out I think the whole world is going to end because house prices are going to drop tomorrow it's such a long cycle we're not going to see and even like we saw before this is more of a potential stabilization that this data's coming out and point science to sort of talk about mortgage fraud how it relates to that after a quick break here I'm not going to show\n[noise] traffic and whether by

charity group of kids raising money to it a dance a fund dance event\nHum and raising money for trainers children's hospital you can get more information at dance for chance TPA on social media um and then just before the break we we were talking about interest rates and the shifting real estate market and and I'm going to move next and talk to you guys about a mortgage fraud and the\nUm you know the challenges that come along with mortgage fraud when the market starts to shift like this so I'm the first part about mortgage fraud is winning when real estate becomes a less affordable or unaffordable um and it gets harder for people to get loans or do they do\nCheat regime [laughter] that's what they do they live and they cheat right so they they they live out their income to qualify for loans and um you know interestingly enough\nThat is possible because there are some loans and lenders out there that are accepting not quite like the no dock loan type stuff we used to do before\nBut if someone's creditor so good and they've got enough downpayment um that you know there there's not as much checking on some of those things with certain lenders and programs as was maybe a couple of years ago and so\nI Do get a hand ... says unsubscribe like a million times and the topic on that the emails usually state income right you know and that's\nThe so regardless so so basically what ends up happening when it gets a little harder for them to qualify they you know fudge the numbers a little bit they create some income that maybe isn't there um you know they they may be a little bit over ambitious about the bonus money they earned commissions or whatever it is\nAnd and so a Mike obviously that's something that land a bay and your underwriters provider always wanting to prevent always wanting to document but it's something you you you you get more likely to see when rates rise like if someone prices rise and affordability becomes a little bit more of a challenge\nRight yeah you know as a lender you have to especially on the underwriting side you have to do your best to kind of document and verify everything to the best of your ability um you know\nBut like you mentioned there are some places that have some of these alternative programs um and it's easy to to sometimes make mistakes I guess um you know for example when you talked about bonus income for instance if someone has a base salary of sixty\nBut they get bonuses of thirty they might tell somebody they make Ninety thousand dollars but that thirty may or may not be guaranteed so you know that could affect affordability big time one that ah is always difficult to to get approved or like your bartenders and service because they have a lotta tip income\nWe talked about that a couple of weeks ago the workers to super lift driver that was because of all of that but there is a mortgage there is a bill in legislation now though to help with that right um I don't know if that are really help because I tend to think that\nSometimes legislation that's meant to help ends up doing the exact opposite right away and I said it it remains to be seen\nBut that is that is something that that happens all documented that income yeah it's a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Duncan Duo", "city": "Tampa", "day": "07"}
