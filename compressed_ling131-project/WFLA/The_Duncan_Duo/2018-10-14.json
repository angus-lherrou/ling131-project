stash grim chief investment officer managing director of ram capital wolf management stash let me ask you something you just had you were quoted in Forbes magazine this past week\nAnd you were talking about qualified dip it in income cutie eyes why don't you just explained a briefly to our to our listeners\nRight well in this case for looking for comment on how a investors and maximize their wealth and we took that answer from a from a different angle because usually when you get that type of question you think of okay well how do you maximize gross\nBut for a lot of people approaching retirement and are in retirement which I imagine are a lot of your listeners are we think well how can you maximize your income without shaky unnecessary rash\nWe know for the last eight to nine years you're largely quantitative easing interest rates have been historically low if people relied on it in income or just income in general from investments are to maintain their living to provide a supplemental income but what are the counter or one of the major weakness is\nAbout the quantitative easing again has has forced a lot of people maybe under unknowingly to take more rich or to be able to try to get that interest rate to ...\nA warning or looking for and that would be consistent with the last thirty or forty years simply put there was no quantitative easing through this\nThrough the eighties and nineties early the\nTwo thousand this is a reason an awful lot\nAnd so qualify dip it in just one way that we like to or especially for after tax income this really in particular to money that are not in retirement accounts\nBut after tax income because we feel this is one way or where gestures especially high net worth investors investors that are really than the twenty five percent tax bracket or higher\nWhere they're able to cheat more their money or that have to pay taxes and so basically qualified dividends are it's a flat tax ... capital gains so for the vast majority of Americans at the flat it's ... percent act that wants or a capital gains for twenty Eighteen\nAnd if you're in thirty nine point six percent tax bracket the highest taxed practically have it's a twenty percent tax\nFor a lot of investors that is a national ...\nAh that again you get cheap and it helps the Josh what your equivalent after tax or you would be so for example if you're someone in the highest tax bracket\nAnd you're invested in say maybe a five point five or five twenty four percent or ... or as opposed to a maybe a seven percent invested all your after tax field if you have a qualified or limited for that five point fortified like five is a corporate ... almost ... actually a little bit more than a set\nOf that is about a thirty five percent return more\nWhite from uh from your perspective but you're not having to take the same about a risk because you're investing on a lower ... but it has a benefit attack status and so you're able to invest at a higher quality company the navy if you're going to and that's\nJust a regular ... investment producing kneeled right again because the companies balance sheets weaker\nThat's it ... always we appreciate your sage advice and we'll be talking to your next week take care now ... ... if you're a high net worth individual give him a ring and he will save your money and make your money is all about what you get to keep\nThe train is leaving the station you're getting ready for retirement don't lose it now\nGo to our website schedule appointment is Graham capital advisors dot com want to be really looking let go help someone and guts and a smile on you you're going to get to be incredibly lucky\nOn behalf of the grams andme\nRoger Bonner I'm dead webs saying we'll see you next week at nine o'clock for guaranteeing your retirement right here on news radio nine Seventy WFL a limited up\nThe proceeding program was paid for by Graham capital [noise]\nUm to me and they're they're just a little more just interested in having to spend more time outdoors maintenance and having that larger yard and you know it it can consume quite a bit of your your free\nTime yeah I mean when you think about um either the upkeep that you have to pay somebody to pay a excuse me to keep up the yard or you think about what people want to do on the weekends I mean it's either a lot of time or it's a lot of money because it's going to cost you in one of those two things\nAre a lot of people that you know from up north for instance aren't really aware of when you come to Florida and move you know we have to mow grass year round for a job as seasonal right\nAnd it's not just ... we are not dying on that I'm ... I mean\nIt is a year round thing where you are not having cold weather come in and kind of\nClear everything out I mean you're out there all the time I spend and we have our people\nMind you but I spend probably half my time on the weekends in the yard keeping up the flower beds and other things and we have yard people um but people want to travel now people want to eat a lot of times I live in a walkable area so they're out doing other things\nA lot of people don't want to take care of large yards large yards do not give the money\nThat people think that they do and that's just the way that is if you have a large yard somebody will love it but it's not going to add a significant portion of value to your home\nCorrect don't shoot the messenger says number two a short commute that you won't use 'em if you work from home commuted off hours work in the suburbs or retire don't pay extra to buy a house near mass transit rice um [noise]\nUh it's not that I disagree with this one because I don't and we don't have mass transit I'm a Santa like a value here like other places do so I I almost can't even speak to this that accurately but\nUm especially with the large amount of people that can work for home from home certain number of days a week or maybe all week I'm commuting into and out of city centers isn't as important as it once was and again this is just about how many people find that\nThat a little that amenity appealing and it's not that nobody finds that appealing 'cause they do but\nIt's just not as appealing is maybe it was ten to Fifteen Years ago and she was at the market\nPeople are willing to drive now you know they want more bang for their buck than they're willing to move further outside or further away from their jobs because they can find more home for what they're willing to spend so I I agree\nWith you there where it's it's not as appealing is that used ...\nAnd it's even interesting because a lot of articles now are coming out that say that millennials are actually now moving back to suburbs you know a lot a lot of um articles for forever was oh they're moving into cities and suburbs are going to die they're moving to cities and suburbs are gonna die house are getting smaller people are going into the cities they're not buying in the suburbs anymore\nWell people are still moving into the cities that a larger percentage than they were for a long long time and it is a mix of millennials but also people downsizing snow what's happened is as the population of people has aged as far as millennials they start to have kids\nAnd they need larger homes it's not that they necessarily need them but guess what they're wanting them again they're they're the number one buyers of SUVs now\nThey're buying larger homes in the suburbs and they're leaving the cities again so it's really interesting how now that that demographic has aged now they're going back to what they find familiar in the suburbs and what they grow up with so\nI'm number three a top school district when you don't have kids now we actually talked about this on the show before I've I'm as something that you always look for I Will flat out almost disagree with this because especially here locally you know you look at South Hampton you off\nThe plant school district and buying in that plant school district even if you don't have kids a drastically increase of the value of those homes\nUm and people even that don't have kids still want to be in the plant school district because it's the most desirable area the homes still go up in value um comparative to other areas around them and it it's just a very desired\nArea for the school district in particular\nAnd I used to be of the the thought that it didn't really matter like for me because I don't have children but after talking with you about it you know now my mind has totally changed too I totally think it's\nIt's a great idea to still live in a school just a a good school district for that particular reason you know odds are you're not going to live in your home for the rest of your life I'm so being in that good school district is going to help your property values and things that uh neighborhoods are generally nicer not always but well a lot of advantages\nSays in the article that I'm ... homes in good school districts are always going to command top dollar which I agree with what it says in the article is actually a good point says if you don't have kids\nYou can get as close to that school district as you can enjoy the kind of the high value of those homes and how they affect the area around it but you're living just on the periphery of it and just outside so you're getting home much cheaper and\nYou're not having to kind of pay the prices but even one or two streets over would come in and you are starting to see them south Tampa where areas that plant is not in\nUm they're kind of really turning around and a lot of people are really building in those areas\nTo add to that I I think that they appeal is still there to be in that school district because you're also appealing to a larger audience of our larger pool of buyers\nUm who wants to be in that school district when you're not in a nicer school district some some buyers little turned away from that and uh when you're not looking into those\nBest school district so you know you kind of short in that audience um when when you ... you're not in the right school district\nNumber for a single story house when you're fine with stairs again we're in Florida so this doesn't necessarily affect us\nYou know those actually will benefit you if you have to use it whereas ...\nThere's a benefit to the consumer their zero benefit to it as a consumer now you know you can talk to your tax adviser about this um and I don't know I haven't looked at all the tax laws to see if there's change but for the longest time you could write off the ... as a tax deduction um so I don't I don't know if that\nHas changed her and still I think you can yeah I'm here I you know I always left model my house for the longest time I've done some crazy first time homebuyer program it was only three dollars a month so I didn't care\nSo um but yeah there you know ... is is something that's out there you know it it has gotten a lot better it's a lot more affordable now\nUm but if you have any questions on that feel free to give me a call ... or follow up with me on line it at my case radio dot com or we do have to take a quick break and we'll be back in just a moment\n[noise] traffic

Johnson\nWith the doesn't do a real estate team and my four as a also from the duck and do a real estate team wanted to to kind of spent some time talking about a topic that we we cover a lot on the show um but it it's always a very important topic\nEspecially in our current market um and it's the the dreaded interest rates oh\nAnd I think interest rates I mean they affect everything in the housing market you know I mean when you're talking about learning that amount of money I mean even a small right change makes a big difference in a payment and that can create lots of issues\nRight and that's um you know one of the things too and this has ties to the interest rates but it seems that we've seen 'em a little bit of slow down a ... across across the board and the real estate market\nUm and I I personally think it it's a couple of factors kind of going together\nYou know we've we've been fortunate that our property values have continued to appreciate um I think that's slowed down a little bit but they are still appreciating month over a month but I think that coupled with the fact of rising interest rates it's making 'em\nAffordability harder and harder for some people especially your first time homebuyers\nYeah and what you usually see happen in this scenario is that as interest rates go up prices cannot continue to go up and of course uh you know there's been some things in the economy that haven't went\nAlong with the typical thought patterns so that might necessarily not be true in a large scale out right now but over time what you see is as interest rates go up prices cannot also continue to rise to his wages don't keep up with everything they actually you know you're going to have higher\nPayments monthly payments for some for most people can only get so high before um you know their lender says hey you just can't afford this and that typically is what we're seeing right now because rates have been going going up I mean you've got somebody that's been looking for a home for\nSix months let's say it might be people that look for homes for six months or a ... for like two years so that was something but\nLet's take that person that's been looking over the past six months if they're looking and a three hundred thousand dollar range you know average price point in our markets about two sixty", "year": "2018",
