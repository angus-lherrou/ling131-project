F. LA [noise]\nYou're listening to guarantee they're retiring at your house David Graham Graham capital planning an investment management firm right here in Florida in your daily Graham [noise]\n\nCars will I buy a house\nIs right by\nDave grab the retirement guy\nEnjoy a nice Sunday Morning here that haven't been here Roger monitor had Web here\nI may ask you this you know what the word volatility means yeah vision merge berries sing it rained out through new to the definition for volatility is the liability to change rapidly and unpredictably especially for the worse\nSo let me ask you doesn't that sound like the stock market right now and the down down down down down down that's why they call it the wall street roller coaster Monday it's October the most vulnerable month of the year so how old are your nerves taking it\nRemember if you keep doing the same thing you're going to get the same result and if you expect something different to happen that's what they call the definition of insanity so especially if you're getting close to retirement so let me ask you\nIf this is really starting to bother you then you're probably doing the wrong thing and the first place\nIf you feel you need protection guidance on his producer a direction and go to our website scheduling appointments which Graham capital advisors dot com and while you're at it get a complementary copy of Patrick Kelley stress free retirement take distress out of her life\nGraham capital advisors dot com\nExactly no end with that Mr ...\nWell you know Dave over the years I've had a lot of clients tell me their experiences with previous financial advisors or broker so I just think\nWhen you think about your broker your financial advisor are they more reactive to what happens or would you say they're more proactive because you really need to think about that because of good financial advisor is going to have a plan for every meeting\nA plan for every phone call and especially right now every market event okay\nNow some brokers as they are going to adjust your portfolio on the fly but these brokers don't have an investment management plan in place they can take advantage of the market going up\nAnd a way to protect your nest egg if the market goes down yeah\nExactly look right now we're getting we're inundated with new calls come out sure okay it's just amazing we actually had to hire someone to answer the backup calls were\nOne of them as my girlfriend we have an appointment with the Thursday no you go well the good and even though she as she is the following up on what Rogers said she had a a variable annuity so variable annuity with this company and I showed her so the five years ago he was rich Jew deposited years would you got an hour thousand dollars less as as\nIn five years the market has been scores screeching making all kinds of profits and you you lost money\nOr what is what does that tell somebody made money but it does well yeah sure one of her way her and that's that's the problem with verbal and she's seen you Thursday well good I'm Glad I'm ... come on and we'll have lunch or something but you know look\nWe're getting swamped with new clients and they ... on the verge of getting killed sure we have a correction and they didn't even know it you know usually they're advisor is some kid at the bank right there was a scary thought half of all advisors out there and finance had been in business less than ten years mhm they've never experienced a major correction\nSo that any advisor that works for a bank brokerage house insurance company they don't work for you\nThey work for the name on the business card and we we know Raj we've had clients coming in loaded was mutual funds oh guaranteed to go down and one more thing have you heard from your advisor late then have you heard from right that would come on and if you haven't that's a very very serious problem\nAnd will you know I'm proud to say everything that we're talking about that's not true at Grand capital I mean every one of our clients are investing for their retirement they've seen their nest egg increase in value when the market's going up\nAnd they have never lost a penny when the market goes down I mean and to me that's peace of mind having to worry about it that I mean I actually I actually had a client who was watching as a portfolio every day and just drove him crazy\nHe came in we put a plan together and now he called me and he says I got to find a hobby because I don't have to watch my my portfolio stock market any ... that was a good feeling you know\nBut you know and then also another thing that's important to find out if your advisor has any legitimate initials behind their name I mean we're certified as state planners here Graham capital and were a member of the national Institute of certified to stay planners and were part of the American Institute of ... now these in it\nTo you know they show that we and your advisor has made a troop commitment to this industry and please also please do a background check on your broker it's so easy just go to ... dot org that's F. I. N. R. A. dot org\nClick on the tablet says broker check and put in their name and their address and you may be surprised by the information you're going to see there\nYou know it's we just had someone come in that\nJust yesterday that ... percent of friday that came in that had gone to somebody else on the radio and oh yeah see that and then there was astounded oh exactly you know but look\nAre we going to have a correction absolutely and if you're invested in equities and you still have stocks get now might be the time to lighten up on what you have\nPolice take the risk of losing more money and if you've made money you know you know it's natural and you've had it for a while there's no short term capital gains you know it's a long term pay the taxes and protect what you have\nYour that will be much cheaper to you than taking a twenty to forty percent hit again and if you're close to retirement\nYou know preparing for a stock melt down ... is is the smart thing to do\nAnd remember if you lose your principal you're losing your monthly check ... ... it's always that way if you lose assets you're going to lose that check people really kind of underestimate the power winding down when we're going to have a big correction if you are forced to sell but think about this\nWouldn't it be great not to lose anything this time around and be able to be in a position to still have your money and then start buying goods stocks at sixty cents on the dollar\nYou know like I look at this point in my career nothing really surprises me anymore I've seen enough of this but seriously be aware that there are very serious risk out there that you don't need to be taking\nYou know financial planning it's not just about investments it's really about putting together a complete picture that help you realize your hopes and dreams for your future\nNow look getting ready to retire you want to do with the right way we have offices a main street in Sarasota Kennedy boulevard in Tampa, Florida right by the ... mall K Street in Washington DC we love what we do there's nothing we can do for you [noise]\nBy I feel like it could take some liability at least away from the building\nWhen it does and I said they they're having a hard time doing all these different things themselves\nThey see us as just another quality control level for them um I a lot of it has to do with the individual inspector and how knowledgeable you are and if you were reporting on things properly but [noise]\nYou know I Know for me when I document things and I provide the pictures and the verbiage in the report it's I I Know this is all the stuff that needs to be done because I Know the standards and the codes and and everything that needs to be done so\nThere's not much pushback uh it's okay I see what you're talking about will get it taken care of 'em so I haven't had real good responses from all the local builders on on getting things corrected wants that\nComes up on my list so\nAnd we can even go back and check it once they've corrected it to the home buyers you know uncomfortable they a lot of this is is great to them a construction terminology and hurricane straps and hold down protection and\nLike I have no idea what all this means that just sounds really important and I don't know if they're that fixture not once the builder says it's taken care of so we can go back and do a a re inspection on that even to make sure it's all done\nAnd then the last phase we would typically do is right before the house has completed um basically the electricity is on the air conditioning is running people are getting ready to close and move in we go through and and check the house for functionality of everything that's been installed to that point a lotta times will find that\nThroughout the stages of production especially on a two story house guys will come to do work on upper level portions of the house and ladders scaffolding might damage the lower level shingles\nUm that's pretty frequent finding um inflation in the attic um may not have been installed properly that again is pretty typical thing that I find that\nIt just didn't get insult deep enough or\nPerhaps they put it in and then they realize that a light fixture was missing or something was wrong and somebody had to go up in the attic and they moved to a bunch of insulation out of the way to to get in there and fix something and I didn't really put it back where it needed to be a so that's uh\nIs is there a spot in the process that usually and I know everyone's different but has the most issues or something that you're seeing the most often with new builds or is it just a variety of different things\nIt's a variety of different things those couple of things right there I mentioned on the final those are probably Ninety percent of the houses that I expect to have those things going on and then there's other miscellaneous like the hot and cold being reversed it faucets or showers and bribery down in the drains and stuff that\nAn almost can count on existing in every house and then we'll go through at the final in and look at a lot of the cosmetic things whereas on a resale house you know that somebody's already lived in we're not going to look at the Nixon dense and and paint and things like that but on a new construction final\nOr we're going to pay attention to the way the term was installed in the cabinet and make sure everything's functional and looks proper too\nSo that you know when the buyer moves in they're not going to have a whole laundry list of things they want to go back to the builder to get fixed in in this\nScenario where construction is is so busy\nBuilders tensions wants to houses clothes gets moved to the next house in the next people that have already sold their house they're in an apartment there banging on the builders hey I Need to move in please get my house done so you know once the house has done it does go over to usually the warranty department but you know that's not things you want to deal with once you're moving into your brand new houses having to\nHave them come back out to fix things it's easier to get it all done before it's closed because then people will have to make appointments they're not in your house you know and having to you know you take days off of work to meet them to get things ...\nNow are very cost differential between a normal inspection new construction inspection 'cause there's more than one five of\nRights also uh the pricing set up\nPretty much at the same price level per stage as a resale house okay but the prescribed a little cheaper it's a little quicker inspection\nBut an average two thousand square foot house is going to cost about a thousand dollars to have to do it from beginning to end all the difference phased inspections of so and I and I would argue that by that seems like a lot of money but I Would be glad for anybody to call me and I will give them my clients names and numbers and they said was the best money to ever spent\nI'm sure the person with a foot or something and I would probably lose or other I'm assuming those are spread out it's not or is it an upfront fee of the spread out\nThey pay as they go down so they can any or all of those faces okay so if they are hearing this and they're like oh they are already poured my slab or on I'm already past that stage it doesn't matter we can come in and do any of them even if it's just the final before closing\nAnd it wants to drywall up a lot of things we're not gonna be able to see at that point but it's still um it doesn't hurt to go back in and check those things through and then\nIf they've missed all those things we can always do what we call it a builder one year warranty inspection so the builders going to give a a you know a hundred percent warranty on on everything in the house for the first year\nSo when you come to the eleventh month we can come out at that point if they've not done the inspections throughout the phases of construction and at least check it over at that time\nTo CNN and I've done many of those where I came in and found that insulation was missing in the Arctic or they had some roof damage um that didn't really leak but it may have in the future or there was something actually\nLeaking already in a house um that we were able to find that didn't turn into something much worse because years and years went by afterwards\nYeah but one thing that I I've heard a lot to on the mortgage that\nWith a with buyers is you know I'm buying a new construction house I don't even need a home inspection 'em to which you know in my opinion and and it's kind of what you hit on as well a lot of these voters especially the the bigger home builders with you know two hundred homes\nThey're building them as fast as they can there's a lot of people in and out some mistakes can be made so traveling a good idea to have that home and\nStuff and I would say from the realtor standpoint yeah I've sold existing homes I've shown I've sold new construction I've never walked into a perfect home rat in it need anything\nThere's like as like you just have especially in the market that rain where they're pumping these things out as fast as possible some things get overlooked or they're not done properly so inspections are always needed\nRight and so in Twenty years in ten thousand inspections and probably fifty percent of my inspections or some sort of phase new construction inspections a big portion of my business yeah there's never won I mean sometimes on ... I'll actually say okay this is well prepared is ready for the concrete to poor\nBut the other phased inspections there's always the last ... it's just how long the list is going to be so it's never a hey we're just going to come in and stamp and say hey this is great their ... their stuff at\nAnd before you know it there you know they've given some fake application and some deposits of this person and the person runs off with their money and there's nothing that we can do about it because we didn't know and there's nothing that that person can do about it I mean they just stole a whole bunch of money from them and this happens all the time\nAll the time and it was on and it's a significant amount of money too 'cause what I've seen the way they do it is it's a large upfront deposit but then you have the low monthly rent ... or like\nYou know people who are in desperate need of housing or just you know we just seemed like such a good deal it's perfect there will they don't want to believe it's too good to be true right and then there you know they they take it and it's just it's hard\nThat's a tough one too because you know how to you know I guess the only way really is to maybe research that property as well you know on line and I like if it's listed for rent elsewhere or if it's actually listed for sale it's just it's tough\nYeah and I would also you know if you decided to call that number I mean if I Would think if they're legit operation they probably have a website they probably have an office get all the information you can you know instead of just calling this one phone number this person who shows up to do your research don't bring cash deposit right here I Am\nThe for cash that I mean they were were laughing\nAbout it but a lot of people get scammed on yes and we get calls a weekly on people that think they're going to be moving into one of our listings that's for rent and they cannot get in touch with the person that they were supposed to get in touch with what they call us ... there's nothing that we can do it and there's no cell or can do about it because\nYou know the I mean if someone's I don't know of any whether it's a rental company or even you know small investors who have rental that don't require a credit check or you know a background check and they don't need any of that from you that's also probably a red flag\nRight and um you know one one last one that I wanted to hit on and we don't have a lot of time left in the segment but I read an article this week where\nThere's someone posing as a real estate board and sending out past due bills to real estate agents um you know in the article saying there's not even a real estate board out there so yeah that was the same deal just they'll send money without reader I get for if it's something that that like you said earlier Lewis if it looks like a scam it probably\nYes and in that instance you know you just if you're the realtor who's you know almost a victim he's got to know your boards right now your love the real estate market exactly a little more attention they're\nRight we'll be back to discuss uh a few other topics after a quick break\nTraffic whether by heart radio ... got on your Web ballet [noise]\nFrom the train tracks and are powered by millionaire we have a very serious accident blocking things up and and now it's counting on Seventy five north bound traffic at a standstill\nNorth than right before twenty Second Avenue north at three right lanes are blonde hair expect big delays it's therefore it's sponsored by ... range looking to say about Medicare part D switching to Walgreens may help save on your Medicare part D prescription ... thank you know one talked to the pharmacists to learn more gay long ago right ninth Saturday W.

on the real estate [noise]\nWe're joined again Robert\nJohnson and Louis seven Eddie from the Duncan do a real estate team and rainy noon from the I'm not from BP G A saw an article this week it was you know ten items that could be real estate deal breakers but ended up being a good by a for us the buyer you know this kind of goes opposite\nOf what we were talking about earlier when new construction I mean new construction fantastic if that's what you want you know you're going and you're getting a brand new house but you're also paying top dollar for it so you're not going to go in and get some great deal\nOn new construction but um there's a lot of things out there that people consider deal breakers on homes\nThat actually aren't deal breakers at all or they don't have to deal breakers they can actually be money in disguise you know when you hear people going out and they're wanting a fixer upper or they're wanting to go in and they're wanting to have equity in home after they do some improvements some of these things in this list\nUm the average person might not want to take on but in the long run they can be really great for you so\nI'm number one is an outdated kitchen\nYou know what they say in real estate world is kitchens bathrooms kitchen the master baths sell houses and the reason why that is is because those things [noise] um they cost a lot of money usually to have the MRI done\nYou know a a good kitchen remodel can cost over thirty thousand dollars easily depending on the property in the house so if you can go in and you can get a house that maybe doesn't have those updated features\nUm the houses priced appropriately for not having the updates you can turn around and do those updates and all of a sudden you're inside the equity in the home\nUh so don't let that scare you not every kitchen is going to cost that much money you can go out there and you can find deals on cabinets appliances and everything else if you have patients and if you have the patience to live through that kind of renovation a lot of people don't but if you can you have you know you have some money sitting there\nWaiting for ... um with kitchen renovations to you can do a lot like you said very inexpensive I'm resigning cabinet sometimes in changing the hard work and can make a huge difference for a little bit of of money\nYeah and you know sometimes if the cabinets are good you can just do what you just mentioned you can you know upgrade the counter tops you can put in some new appliances and especially if you can find some deals out there um but you know a kitchen renovation isn't going to be that much money\nYeah a lot of things you know something as simple as changing the hardware like the handle on a cabinet you wouldn't believe how much of a difference that can make it can change the whole the whole entire look I think a lot of people get very intimidated by the thought of you know redoing kitchen or they think it's going to be too much and it's it's really not\nNumber two on the list and some of these I Can't speak to as well but some are too is\nUm asbestos and\nThat makes a lot of people want to freak out um I've actually represented some homes where um the house actually did test positive for his best us in the cellar or excuse me the buyer actually\nUm didn't care he was going to have it re mediated or whatever he needed to do here is an investor [noise] um I mean Randy do you see that really alone out there you know not as much down here a spouse just wasn't it\nPrevalent in this area that was up in the northeast where they had the old oil heating systems and they ran more of the pipes with that kind of product or so in Tampa I not reported on his best is and can ease home is\nA it was about eight years ago they were in St Petersburg right and there was two of them and they were near each other it could have been able to be out somewhere is I I it's\nGoing to be an older house in this area and a lot of that as at this point has already been re mediated it's been discovered and taking care of because we've known as best has been a problem for quite a while now so it's kinda like not into wiring we just randomly find it but it's it's not as big a deal as it used to be so I Know that's low on our list here in Tampa that's probably a nationalist\nYeah a number three unpaid ... condo fees\nSo this can get a little tricky because a lot of times um well every time that I can think of the title company or the attorney who's going to verify that there is no um over a two way or or any kind of back fees on our property especially before you can get a mortgage for it I'm assuming like\nYeah yeah we um you know and a\nAnd a sample letter right now is I ordered on every transaction um you know I don't know if they do them on cash well so in the medical data but\nI Believe what this where your deal is hiding here is if you have an ACOA that over takes a property because of overdo fees and they turn around and the auction off the property riding there's investors out there that look for those properties they search court records for them when they're going to go to auction and
