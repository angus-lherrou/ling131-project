I Want to be real clear on the record news junkie\nLaunched shaming though was a problem in many different cities across the country I could never understand why they did this but this was when like a kid had a a launch that they deemed not nutritionally\nImpressive enough men do take the kids want you away from them that's right and then give them some garbage launches a back up\nAnd it finally said that they can't do this here's one child's experience Giovanni in second grade son came home from school and told his daddy was hungry so and says what did you guys have for lunch he's at a piece of bread in a carton of milk\nThey took my lunch away I guess you guys didn't pay this is another way that they would shame these kids he went and saw schools once you count had run out and in added

shirt accent a little kid\nAlong that I didn't have today super poor kid that's like a little bit of bullying this go\nBowling the kids which is the strangest way you could be in a bullying situation\nThe parents got mad they said enough is enough and a state representative by the name of strong strong Peterson sponsored a bill and said they were going to end once and for all lunch shaming at schools in their state\nOr Washington state is where this happened but I'm sure this will catch on his parents are not big fans\nOf that and the whole like scarlet letter ring of these kids
