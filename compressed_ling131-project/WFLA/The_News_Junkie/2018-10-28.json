I. P. that word that's done with\nWe're not using that any more what it is let the other game\nBut I'm saying you know how it gets when when when the news media starts talking about it that like when we

kick out is going to be like nine hundred million and that's ... number thirty seven percent of that so\nYou know what though I think you'd be okay Rob the challenge of talking about the media absolutely has destroyed here it's called the hard hat challenge the heart that challenge is at least three years old\nYou've seen these stupid videos where it's like somebody on a construction site and they put their hard hat down into the flip it up with a shovel or something and they try to catch it on their head\nAnd here's what happened here I'm telling you somebody in the news room at Katy

myriad of videos of people who are stepping on the shovel the flip the hat up and then the handle the shovel hits them in the nuts or right in the face right on the bridge or the nose\nWas that even a trend I feel like I saw that in America's funniest home videos\n... it's it's some of that and then around is not new is not new and they tell you somebody at the TV station found this and they go let's make it a new store\nActually catch it the right way that's not why these posted videos get many viewers\nAs more times than not they don't catch it the right way and an extrovert\nWhat we're saying is a hard hats hitting them in the head\nAnd really hurt it may not be right but it is far [laughter]\nHard hats weigh about a pound that can of soup my there are only about ... like that on
