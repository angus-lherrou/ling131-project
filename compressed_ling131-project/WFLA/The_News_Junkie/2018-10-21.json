{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "Is that the rates on your money market and your checking account and CDs and\nAgain treasuries are going higher\nIf in most retirees live off of the income\nThat their retirement money produces so the good news and I think they're actually a lot of good and I think before you know we will see tenure treasuries 'em over three and a quarter to even three and a half percent and there's talk that the ten year treasuries could eventually get to four percent in the next Eighteen months and all of a sudden\nWe have rates again that retirees will be able to look out and go wow you know that's pretty good I can I can live off of those those income checks and so I think it is for retirees it can actually be a very positive thing\nAnd today with nine time New York times best selling author David Baake well known financial educator about the recent market drop I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is this the beginning of a market correction\n[noise] so I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter] it's funny 'cause\nBecause nobody knows right what I what I what I Know and we've been talking about this maybe you know I've done other interviews on\nI Know that we're we've we've just had the greatest bull market of our life I I Know that have you been in the markets even after the recession hit and even after the markets pulled down if you just stayed the course of more wealth than you've ever had\nAnd at the same standpoint the last two months I've been telling people don't get like don't now it's not time to get greedy now is not the time to get complacent so it's very important if you are about to retire or you're already retired\nIt's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money because if you're in your fifties in the markets pull back you can't afford it time to let the markets recover but if you're tired [noise] your\nYour comfort level with seeing your money drop significantly is going to be lower so it's really important I I just can't stress enough that\nWhen you're approaching retirement or you're already retired talked with a financial you work with a financial wise or if that if you have a financial was right now that you\nPick up the phone and paying attention to the news which I don't recommend you do all your financial go back into their office sit down with them how they will walk you through what you're invested a lot of people who are retired that might be fearful the stock market today\nActually have a very what we call very low exposure to talk like army people who are retired and they're worried about the stock market and\nHalf of their money in an annuity gave him a guaranteed rate half of their money in bonds and they've got a small percentage of the stock market under so they read the news and they're very fearful\nSo don't be fearful find out find out how much money you actually have how much risk are you taking and again I\nWork with your financial wise or I just a big believer that a a working with a professional ... which is what we recommend people work with the register investment advisor when you work with a finance was the most important part is that they will financial plans or you\nThat they they get to understand what your\nComfort level with risk is and\nThen they help you build an investment portfolio based on your goals and\nYour comfort level with risk if you have a very low comfort level with any risk well then you should have less money in the market um but the key right now it's no this one markets are pulling back like it had been the last couple of the most important you can you\nCan just call your visor don't panic sits still don't do anything every market pullback ultimately has had I Can't promise you always out but I can tell you it's always had a recovery right\nEvery single major market pullback ultra point is that a recovery and so I'm just a big long term believer that you want a diversified portfolio high quality investment\nOff of financial plan working with a financial watch that you can trust that they're old your hand when it gets like this right now which is this is a rocky part\nDavid fantastic insights on this market drop what the silver lining here and all of this\n[noise] well I think the silver lining is how incredible when the economy we have right now like let's not lose sight of that you know look at some of the numbers right now the lowest\nUnemployment in America in forty nine years unemployment is at three point seven percent right now what is that why is that because we have an incredibly strong economy right now so GDP which you know two years ago nobody believed that you could get to three percent well most\nPeople certainly GDP right now the first half of the year three point ... percent there are projects shows the third quarter\nCould be as high as four percent so the economy in the U.S super strong and\nThings really are very very positive which is why by the way also we've had stock markets hitting all time not so just notice things they economy are strong this was a very normal\nTime to see a pull back in the market if anything is probably very healthy that we're seeing pulled back in the market right now and just notice the economy's doing really well the tax cuts that huge impact and for the foreseeable future we seen economy to continuing to grow\nAnd this was at a high school and a lunch at school is usually an interesting time to get your socialization on hang out with people and you always focused on hey what's on the menu today I Know pizza day was always very popular I I Know people that to this day still have\nAn affinity for that little rectangle school pizza that was good that we give out I mean\nWe had big slices we had rectangles uh when I was in middle school elementary school when I go to high school we got the big boy pizzas like\nFrom a pizza chain or from the ...\nStill frozen I'm sure yeah from whatever bulk company they order from but big day for us was Mongolian beef barbecue\nWhy man a nice place where I grew up uh we had pizza I think every day and the bread sticks were an option to I mean the probably the number one consumer of Pizza Hut in the area was my middle school\nBut friday or on the hot lunch line was nachos with cheese ... day now we're talking and I I say meets\n'cause it's just like a very generic a chili kind of saw we\nDidn't know exactly what it was I didn't care me ... ... something comes up and goes that's leading me perfectly into this story actually because students that Potter Dix high school and junior high a reportedly fell ill after the school's head cook\nAdded something special to the chili without a telling anybody about this\nHe added the kangaroo meat to the chili and they said that the school was upset by this this these students the parents were upset by that I I don't know exactly why some of the kids so they got sick from this which I\n... how are you gonna get sick just cause kangaroo me doesn't mean you get sad isn't that supposed to be sort of like a delicacy in fact they stay in the report that kangaroo me is like a really good lean meat and its USDA certified so there's nothing wrong with what the guy did unless he himself\nKilled the kangaroo and just did a piss poor job\nOf a butchering it where's he going to get the kangaroo to kill it from Australia he's in the ... they're not kangaroo just jumping around out there for like a it's not that I Know of ...\nDid he say it was it like this latest kangaroo meat Chile\nI I don't know if we had anything up I my ... my ... says these kids when they figure it out it was kangaroo me they were like oh God yeah like be just a mental reaction of it and they couldn't have really gotten sick unless there was something wrong with the way you prepare to which is totally separate from the kangaroo part I just\nDon't see it it's like the old argument of like you know the drug dealers gonna lace your drugs was something more expensive no they're not do a money making business yeah uh so I don't see why you would take\nA school chili which is usually crafted to be a very cheaply made you know a lot of people are in a in a school sized yeah and you would put\nDelicate meet their kangaroo cannot be cheaper to exotic oh and it's got to be expensive to get this stuff well there's one more about what happened here at Potter Dix high schools cannot\nMake this stuff up a school superintendent in Nebraska is al ... the parents after school chef added and exotic me to the chili he was serving up for lunch\nLessons for this he added that kangaroo meet some of the district leader and he did not hesitate to learn parenting ... edition he\nFast the Hancock added tank because it was a very lean meat on the superintendent apologized and said it will never happen in ... there was no threat to the children because kangaroo me apparently Jasmine USDA standards either way parents they're just not happy\nThey all got bother I'm On the chef side I'm Sorry I mean plus each different palette you know let them introduce introducing something like ... room mate there I like to try\nAnd he's still and like banter that means you get your opinion tell the kids to suck it up\nLike others even give it as hot take on the kangaroo chili like All right I'll put it out there I'm not afraid to say I'm siding with the shepherd put the kangaroo made in the chili\n\nDishes over once I was reading\nWeekend edition [noise] your direct line to the heroes that saved Canada that one time\nYou know I've never been up all the places that I have been to Nebraska and honestly I think
