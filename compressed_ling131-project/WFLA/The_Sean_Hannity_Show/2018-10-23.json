D thank you so much and that's why we were able to get to that story fairly early but you know in that same type of a spirit here you've got Mitch McConnell now the other side of the aisle and on the Senate side versus pillows sleeping\nOn the the house sign obviously and apparently Mitch McConnell was heckled\nBy this man he was angry about health care he was pissed off about Social Security\nThe man allegedly slammed his fifth down on Mitch McConnell's table\nAnd grabbed his doggy bag and for the food out of the front door of the restaurant so clearly there was no Capitol Hill security with Mitch McConnell of this restaurant which I Believe was him and all over\nI mean he just trying to have to have\nThe other one is is lovely Taiwanese wife Elaine Chao Ivy League leave them alone they find a chow down with one child\nSo I was just curious you know there's no local boy he was on his own I mean I guess someone could you could have just taken the guy out you have a guy gets closed armies banging his hands on your table and he grabs your leftover bag and throws in the front door the restaurant\n[noise] I mean that's rude I mean one myth wanted whenever he was eating I I didn't see the name of the restaurant or I didn't see what Mitch an author or what was in his doggy bag but I Would imagine that which was probably going to go home and you know maybe a late night snack you know watching some Netflix him\nHey I'm going to go to the fringe and grab my leftovers and the guy from about the front door\nTry it out that's not nice\nAn eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of the nation wide number here on Smith eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine I go back to the phones here and just a bit or so a standby if you want to get on any aspect\nOf whatever we talked about ... just see the the ground rules for our phone calls to this program a very simple\nLiterally declared a national emergency that would unleash a whole host of additional lessons but at this point it is unclear whether that's an actual declaration or just rhetoric or the president angry as I Am\nAnd if we need to protect the borders to prevent the onslaught of Seventy five hundred ... that's what CNN is saying that I I'm not no issue with the declaration of a national emergency and I would support the president\nIn that declaration for preventing Seventy five hundred people or so from busting into the United states so I I Would give a thumbs up on that\nUh you know last week the president warned that he may take military action if the onslaught doesn't stop on\nA so far the Pentagon incidentally the Pentagon says that has not been requested to provide any additional support\nAt the border or even after the president's tweets from this morning so less than the president has\nA wide uh ability for executive orders so I have to wait and see exactly what the president of the sides to do here we had a charity questioner\nCuster so the latest on Jamal ... year Jared Kushner was believe it or not this is incredible Jared Kushner was that a political event this CNN citizen event\nUh being hosted or moderated or being interviewed by none other than Van Jones\nI got again I'm not a huge Jared Kushner fan I'm not a fan of ah the even the appearance of any ... protesting behavior in of all good Trump and Jared the son in law as a senior advisor out is not a fan of that I I I I Wish that they weren't there [noise]\nI mean they can visit but I I don't think Jared Kushner centers they need a weird dude little ... burgee actually but uh Jerry ... you know let me let me praise Jared Kushner or even though he's a lifelong Democrat is\nYou know as a Democrat when Trump was a Democrat but of course I mean literally a lifelong Democrat and you know suddenly kind of flip the switch so our question I give him credit though Koester I sat down and CNN event with Van Jones I mean that takes some balls I began to SERE\nSo on\nAnd you know I assume reminds me that a Van Jones and cost or they've been chatting or working together on a prisoner you're going to try to a lesser Giuliani or if you don't want you to listen to this\nAnd listen to what question there's just a couple of observations you're about questionnaires words on the show the and the whole Saudi mess so less than\nThey're going to try to get to the fact do you trust the Saudis to investigate themselves I mean it seems like NBS is like the prime suspect he's also the prime investigator and do you trust the Saudis to sort this out and like I said I mean we're\nGetting facts and for multiple places and then once those facts come in um the secretary of state will will will work with our national security team to help us determine what we want to believe in in what we think is credible on what we think is is not credible [noise]\nEven even Trump's it as like deception their lives I mean do you I mean you do do you see anything that same deceptive\nI see things that are deceptive every day I see in the middle east I see him in Washington and uh so that I think that we we have our eyes wide open I think that\nAgain the president is focused on what's good for America what are our strategic interests\nUh you know where we share interests with other countries let's work towards those but uh yeah every day we deal with people who are trying to Deceive Us in different ways but our job is to see through it but also to to stay focused on what's best for the American people and the president's fully committed\nTo wash why is he sounded like the ... you notice he's he's got his vocal fry thing going on\nMean if it was a little more high pitched and he is kind of high pitch or if he was a little more high pitched I Would have thought maybe that was Dr Christine Blasey Ford I you know I [laughter]\nHello how you look in the car dashes that vocal creaky noise it it's called vocal fry and I don't know why charity at least to okay life is like the ... the way they ... the\nGas to Deceive Us in different ways but our job is to see through it but also to to stay focused on what's best for the American people and the president's fully committed to doing that\nI give them credit fell for him sitting down with Van Jones a that takes a little bit of ... I I Want to get into the latest on this show the mess if you're not up to speed on what reads like like a bad comedy script I mean is laughable\nSub with all the latest list of claims on the the ... of the Saudis story on ...\nAnd then\nIt's so Keystone cop event to think that they weren't going to try to use a heavy you do that\n... might of body shape wise had some similarity to show the folks do you know that the Saudis apparently took the clothes off or ... dead body put her on a body double and had to walk out of the at the embassy the conflict hold on the way\nThat\nYou sent us this\nNews radio values WFL a [noise]\n\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nIf you're in depth and you need help coal trinity at one eight hundred three six three five one three seven to talk to a certified counselor and\nThey were able to take all of my different payments and put them altogether\nCould he will consolidate your accounts into one easy to manage monthly payment put a stop to late fees and over limit charges reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nAnd they were actually able to work with my creditors or being able to pay off close to Fifteen thousand dollars in the last Eighteen months\nIf your dad has your down coal trinity one eight hundred three six three five one three seven\nMy name is Stephanie and I'm debt free for keep one\nEight hundred three six three fifty one thirty seventh [noise]\nExciting new levy motors now they've been over thirty ... who don't even want to avoid when you're doing things for sale sign up with a twenty five dollar known as the charged ... he's tired to rent them ten percent black and reward them how to find me the credit card purchases men in February ... year\nKind that you can use on anything you may have had the dot com slash or is it that it's during the day the fighter or the prejudice groove and this is does it mean the dot com gosh\nThis is John Green and if your teeth are staying from coffee tea or smoking power swabs with the answer in five minutes you'll see two shades wider teeth and in seven days six shapes even better there is no messy strips are trace that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just swap your teeth for five minutes and you're done to try parents rubs call one eight hundred six seven eight\nNine ... nine six night you're white white smile will have your friends talking about how great you look try at risk\nFree one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night\nThat's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night\nUp the aggressive collection actions and fights that get you the best possible tax settlement they have an a plus rating with a bb called optimum out for your free consultation\nGoal eight hundred Ninety six zero Fifteen Seventy five eight hundred nine six zero Fifteen Seventy five\nOf them actually\nHave to pay a day Hanson\nAnd brought them up to speed on this and I'm sure John Bolton was a humongous part of this because this guy eats lives you know sleeps breeze and you know watch this stuff are So Russia they've been completely violating and a boy letter writing\nThe tenets of this treaty for years\nAnd the granted there's now\nA putting a stop the agreement as it stands is putting a block essentially if we decide to follow the training it puts a block on us placing weapons\nOr in parts of the world to essentially answer the chain knees\nPacific build up with a they're out of control arms race ah in their fear\nSo why shouldn't we allow the of the Russians that have violated this treaty the Russians have cheated yes the Chinese which are becoming increasingly daily military threat with new technologies new role Louds a new areas of of military\nI'm a first shows of force so why should we be handcuffed bottom line is we shouldn't be freaking handcuffed\nThat's the bottom line here\nSo we're pulling out so what happens next one of the ... I mean are we going to get into a new arms raised we have a new Cold War breaking out what was the thing is I've been pretty damn chili anyway\nAh they should be a little more chilling because Trump should have been more forceful of putting in Helsinki but that's a whole different story so a bulletin is in Russia because this is a a a continuation of\n... was started in Helsinki at the summit you know a couple of months back\nSo we'll see what happens but we are pulling we made the announcement that were pulling out of this this Nineteen eighty six treaty this I N F treaty\nWhich I think it's the right thing to do now I I mentioned this a cursory fashion last week I didn't get a chance to get full more into it and we just manage just ... every day is just crazy you don't even know what's coming down the pike\nWhenever I planned for half the time he gets the rail with with a new crazy breaking news so vitally important\nAnd I saw this story last week that a vitamin poop poop and it said that the Russians will go to heaven as martyrs in the event of a nuclear war\nThat's his conferences you know certainly nice to think about so vitamin ... and this was at a meeting a conference he was at in Sochi in Russia where the Winter Olympics were held so Russians will will go to heaven as martyrs in the event of nuclear war because Moscow\nWill only ever use nuclear weapons in retaliation vats what ... said this was last week we have no concept of a preemptive strike\nWell that's that's not that's not true they have all the contingencies for all types of strikes including a first strike just as we do as well\nI you know it's not our intention that it would be essentially mad or mutually assured destruction in that uh if somebody did for a strike us that while they would be completely obliterated 'cause we have the response capabilities but\nYou know for for ... say we have no concept of a preemptive strike that's just a flat out lie so this was this this a forum\nThat ... was that last week\nAnd it was a question that came in from the audience he said in such a situation we expect to be struck by nuclear weapons but we will not use them first he said\nThe aggressor will have to understand that retaliation is inevitable that it will be destroyed and that we as victims of aggression as martyrs we'll go to heaven\nThey will simply die because they won't even have time to repent\nOh he's getting all religious ... really this is is ah Mr KGB ice in the veins he sees a preacher religious stuff you know really\n\nI don't remember it was one last year that the Russians in ... was that that animation of a PowerPoint presentation with with multiple warheads deploying over Florida member of the graphic on that and then he also said they they have this new invincible weapon\nThat us the fences had no chance of stopping\n\nHe's called for a rebuilding of their nuclear forces modernization with new technologies\n\nYeah but I'll tell you right now that law to report and saying that you know they have no concept of a preemptive strike is absolute crap that's crap on a stick crowds crap in a bucket [noise] because a Russian war games\nConstantly are ah\nTackled from the angle of a ... of a of a first strike\nSo his his own war games\nMany times include a first strike or a preemptive strike on the enemy and of course those games are absolutely fully going to include on so what we'll see what develops here but certainly things continue to shield between us\nAnd that's not chill and the good sense of a sudden the the Russians there's no doubt about it\nAt yeah putting also went on to say that you know that the Soviet republics are those break a ways that they regret the end of the USSR\nAnd we know potent would love to at least trying to he's trying to put the iron curtain back he wants to bring mother Russia back\nMother Russia is ... ... you're right we got we got our eyes on you've led yeah we do on on too and I got a lot of ground to cover here but\nWe've got Trump whose changing his position on ... on ... or not to show he here um [noise] you know folks this to show you situation is an absolute mess and the president\nIs also in this mess or because of the president has been he's been darting all over the place\nYou know believing the Saudis not believing the Saudis are finding their description plausible you know I I even sweet it out on one of the iterations of President Trump's\nAnd listen I I just wish she wouldn't give his his detractors an enemies ammunition here I just don't know why you know just stay quiet\nJust say hey listen there's a full investigation will bring you details or when we know them commentary once the investigation is done but to suggest that

communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and past and what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of an Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics\nWith with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs the caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on\nParallel economic success fourteen state record states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever\nI I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly decided to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for a better job they can see the orchestra now some people are going to vote the party regard list but others say listen I'm tired of this\nBecause all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and emulate it so you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you\nSay they have it to another level and you'll you'll propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in and we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture\nOver there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty

starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN the politics from CNN MSNBC that's starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on how's it going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular thought he was going to get on the ... the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this day but if if we all\nBelieve in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do\nIf we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment\nWhere that that talent that natural talent flourishes\nThe word or education from the Latin is didn't do good eye to bring forth from within that tells you the God put their our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing\nAnd it and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's the great story of the two years of Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the left as authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics dividing people on the basis of race and gender is\nEvery four to four years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white a write up a good race sex as massage in this Tacoma ... Islamic foe but they weren't dirty air water and they want to kill children and grandma throw over the cliff\nBut also they also hold eyes up to ... yeah and then one of the polar ice cap to melt [laughter]\n... and final thoughts here from pastor Darrell Scott also agreements with and what is you have a last name right ... ... ... okay and David Limbaugh oh David will give you thirty seconds by the last word thoughts today what's gonna happen and fourteen days\nI I actually think that we stayed off the um the so called blue what blue way that we might even retain the house\nAnd we're certainly going to pick up seats in the Senate We're gonna come close we don't win that need to keep it and I think as the pastor Scott ... said well there's so many a minority voters out there who are going to come around the Trump expand that opportunity he's not a racist he's opening opportunities for all people including black\nAnd I'm telling you liberals can't stand this Kanye and the other people who were defecting from their plantation can't stand it this is exciting stuff it's uplifting we need to go on a positive message nationalize that these last two week how\nHow great would it be weaker transform cities like Detroit Cleveland elsewhere where every person that lives in this country\nHas a nice beautiful house in a safe neighborhood a nice car truck that they could afford to vacations take the kids the Disney when they're seven and be miserable uh but but they want to take their kids go out to eat and not have to worry about a pastor I mean we all want the same things that this is universal listed humanity\nMissed it is I really believe who's next fourteen days is going to be critical for messaging as long as I'm missing stays consistent also up to the you know they're the script in the Bible says this is no weapon formed against the self prosper\nI Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation I'm not going to be able to possibly even with this caravan I think is back firing I think that a lot of Americans share the same concerns about those caravans regardless of political party this year the same concerns that the Republican Party shares\nAre good to see a both curry and we've got to let you go to thank you so much for being with us pastor or you could assume when you were in New York my British or you're being here David as always congrats another New York times best seller Sean Hannity dot com\nAmazon dot com uh when we come back a tight race for congressman Ted Budd we'll check in with him than your calls eight hundred dying for one Sean as a number of an awesome Hannity tonight at nine hope you'll join us as we continue [noise]\n\nWhen you want me to\nBuy our radio nine WFL a\nGood afternoon I'm Dina males are top story at five thirty once again lottery machines are cranking out the tickets in Florida and across the country as players take their two dollar shot at one point six billion in tonight's mega millions jackpot\nFrom asking people buy one hundred two hundred five hundred dollars I don't have that kind of money to ah you know pay for it but you get a feeling for the vast\nTonight's jackpot is the largest in lottery history with the cash option for one winner at nine hundred for a million dollars but you don't have to hit the big one to be a big winner Seventy year old Alberto ... of Hudson bought a Powerball tickets for Saturday nights drawing and she hit all the numbers except the Powerball and she won two million bucks\nThat jackpot rolled over as well and tomorrow night's Powerball drawing will be worth at least six hundred and twenty million ...
