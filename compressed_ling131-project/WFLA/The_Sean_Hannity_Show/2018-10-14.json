even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility for barbarism\nAnd I'd see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the farmers\nJust wanted to get your thoughts are ... the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward\nA barber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism or civilly were trending one way or not in the middle exhort eater trending towards the middle of the barbarism off the clocks and the oh it's a constant blocks and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working\nUh you know towards law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh anti\nA violent shooting\nThere's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so

well we've got thirty seconds I don't have time to get into it\nAnother subject here Mr I'm Mr Horwitz on I appreciate that but I Do think it's interesting that you had it you discovered it and we

be a part of the program what we played their Rod Rosenstein you know for people that did wrong in the D. O. J. face consequences\nRegarding fights that well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details\nAbout what went on in the meeting with Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell for FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember McCain and Lisa Page both took notes of the meaty and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this anyway now James Baker is saying\nAnd Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with McCain\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a cave and that's Lisa Page about the issue\nSo Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed that a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI or member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency this is just before the appointment of the special counsel\nThat says just in that timeframe around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed him private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office\nOf making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates that already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon member twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon is an investigative reporter is what the hell\nRag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst and of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax thank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe've got a first start with the ... and the timeline is may have twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... Lisa Page and and Peter Struck talking about uh media leaks strategy\nThat had to do with the dusty a while it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes and they got rid of all it was was the dot CA recycled and different news outlets\nFor the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah petitions least taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nWell if there's one other event that occurs and that may timeframe that rarely I think it's the shock wave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director if it's allowed all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from refrigerators testimony that in may they still have no evidence from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's led to agents who have an anti Trump or fire read that investigation he gets fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that roses have a a Cape and a stroke page\nHey maybe we can remove this guy you'd rather eat can't prove that he's got something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove easily confident and will will record him\nAnd uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment this is not what the FBI with ... through I'm Greg you're talking about the history his book lays out a real possibility that this was a soft crew right look at this we have after I had access to a crime here that\nIn fact they can't find a crime by a page\nHas all these well at least two pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them through other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nIt says that job for the FBI the twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it she got the FBI and the deputy attorney general\nOr allegedly our conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and it no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counterintelligence\nAnd again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is a group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials or the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to do pose the sitting president United States\nIs the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using in misusing their power in the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious

information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to seek ... secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the hope she'd say something that they could use and then and vote the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power\nAndrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page and go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker's set it\nBaker and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWhen he was pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department and the FBI officials have set in sworn testimony but\nJames Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funneled money so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS and research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... same dusty a that was never corroborated uh verify but used as a\nBuys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate and it gets worse than that was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government\nTo propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used what now understanding to bludgeon then president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office\nAnd creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a ... coup either lawyers who die by the name of Michael ... Smith directly handing documents Baker told Congress\nTo Michael suspend handy to Baker documents\nAbout Russia's attempts of meddling in the twenty sixteen election other words he was a cut out a go between for Hillary Clinton at\nThe FBI knew he was a go between in this particular instance how the question is why did the FBI knowing all of this not stop it why did they lie about it in effect the application for the Pfizer warrant\nWiretap on the Trump campaign was done at the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous officials that the deal Jay and the FBI have sworn under oath that nobody at the FBI or D O D J knew anything\nAbout the Democratic party being\nBehind the Clinton dirt house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the FBI and the Justice Department we're all doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for Pfizer warrants\nAnd permission to snoop on the Trump campaign communications Sean Solomon and Greg Jared continue with us or anything I'm saying here that is wrong right Garrett\nYou've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian\nCollusion two people are on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who compose is a totally fabricated phony document\nBased on suppose Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch any investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now\nA second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Sussman or who is passing along computer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection\nAnd in fact the same day that James Comey cleared Hillary Clinton twisting the long could towards the facts his FBI was meeting for the first time in Europe in a building with Christopher Steele\nWho had compose this phony ... that the FBI was never able to verify and yet they ran with this Diaa lady an investigation to damage Trump and then\nThey violated other federal regulations that say you may never use\nOn verified information to gain a fight so wiretap
