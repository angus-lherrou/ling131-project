radio\nKnives seventies got when you\nCompany ... TV she chews Clearwater [noise]\n\nMr when Eli this is a tough one to swap\nOh because the lightning did a lot of good things I was looking a little closer at some of the stops sort of lightning got shot after the first period twenty three to Seventeen but I think that\nThat number the six shot advantage for the ... can be attributed to two things number one they had\nA number of power plays on which they're able to generate a lot of shock sure where it's lightning did their damage and the power play for shots in the first period they were less yeah prolific and the second they didn't get any of the third and the other with a block shots for the ... the conduct blocked\nTwenty two shots tonight so why that's important I think it speaks to\nIt speaks to ... to some extent flow of play like I did not feel that the ... took over this game in the second and the third I think the level play well any weren't able to dominate like they did in the first making excuses for the lady I'm just saying that's hockey like\nSure they were unable to build the lady were unable to build on the one that ... I think of this game becomes to nothing in the first period it's probably lights out\nAnd even if it comes to nothing in the second period it may be lights out but it didn't become to nothing like Phil talked about Nielsen and their own ability to score on those power plays where they had a chance to stretch the lead ... around made a couple of places in the third and that was all she wrote\nGive credit to the other team as we always say Nielsen was the difference maker and looking back on it now the first period\nWas the difference right I mean you get Seventeen shots on goal Vancouver gets five Tampa they all week and talked about coming out with more intensity harder on the poverty rate you oughta ... talked about that and they did they just couldn't score and Dave\nThrough two games they score two goals yeah we just talked yeah I mean that's I think that's the story that's fluffy is like really really well right I don't think anybody would have thought there were two games they were to go\nI guess what I wanted to say was sometimes you see a team come out like gangbusters\nA shooter team Seventeen to five they only get one goal and then in the second period the script is completely ... and you're unable to plain not even close to as well as you did in the first time I really don't think that happen tonight I think that their play did kind of\nRevert to the mean [laughter] whereas I mean it's hard to play as well as they get ... like they did they were still ... they were still competitive and I think you still need to give credit to Nielsen and I think the conduct defended really well\nFrom the beginning of the second period on where it is evident yeah those blocks\nAnd as you said too young players may place yeah ... ... followed him he wanted the fuck you kind of city brought it in fell down got the puck back to the point ... much maligned defensive throughout his career gets it through the ... elections were all they\nKnow that he may in Vancouver I got it they might be in Vancouver but they they you know the bats are made a really good a really good place so tough loss for sure I think yeah they're going to want to stay up in bed and they have to be ready for Columbus you and I were talking about this for Columbus plays them really really well and they're going to be a well coached him as we know\nIt's tough to leave points on the ... if you look at the first two games\nYou know the lightning don't want to say the stole the first game of basketball as he was a big reason why they get points out of this game\nAgainst Florida and Nielsen was a big reason why they don't get points out of tonight so it's even after the first two but they just need to get back to work and you know continue to grind away now that we're kind of passed opening night and\nTry and get as many points as they can before they had on on the road\nGood goal tending ... send it can be the great neutralize or in this game you know so that's an I\nYup absolutely All right Greg I'm an aside off you all the rest of our post game show coming up thanks to everyone involved in tonight's broadcast ready Davis back of a lightning radio network studios diverse Nicholas ... and the radio booth\nFor Eric ruins and Greg when Eli in ...

together in ... was there and we'll start decent finished today it's a good start decent and [noise] power play was probably the worst I've seen in a long time in a good thing is we we get a chance to improve it 'cause\nCosts us again we've got to be accountable because he's been outstanding starts a year and I'm keeping was has been the total opposite and we've got a lot of chances tonight not just not good enough in this link to score for you and you don't want to overreact\nTo just two games but tools and two games that are concerning for the you\nKnow lead lead Ingles last year so I'm\nThis one was a tough one to lose was the lightning was clinging to a one nothing lead going into the third period\nA little talents and little luck and plenty of rubber on the net for the ... they get too hard earned goals ... there so it's tough when you see that lead slip away here but uh overall I don't think the lightning played poorly tonight I think it's one of those situations where\nThe opportunities that they had to build on that lead specifically in the first period with some a power play opportunities didn't materialize tonight and there's only so many one nothing leads are going to be able to to protect here in the ... able to find a way to get a couple of back here and end up with the two points\nYeah it was strange game in some ways I mean it's essentially a two to one game because there are two empty nesters for Vancouver um [noise] I wasn't worried about this game at all I'm getting one you know we we talked about it they didn't play very well they just never really got to the game and they want\nThis one they play way better and are they lose a gold standard was really good you got to give ... Nielsen some credit he was like ... last game he he won this game for them he was terrific he made a lot of really really good saves\nI'm delighted get a lot of pressure and the first period that a lot of really good things off ... the power play housing collect yet we're over eight now over the course of two games no we're not used to seeing that so I don't know if that at a you know a psychological effect on the players [noise]\nIt it shouldn't but uh the bottom line is they had some ... and they didn't score I'm five on five yet you got a pretty much every line had a couple of good scoring chances but again nothing went in so\nAnd it's not like they stack then gave up a ton Vancouver just kind of hung around and hung around at hung around and then they got your chance rock Vassar at a heck of a shot I mean he proved out last year getting twenty nine goals for the last year in sixty two games before he got hurt [noise]\nAnd then the second goal for them was fortunate as a fortunate reader Russian on a shocking to point so all of a sudden bang there during the lead and uh they never gave it up so\nYou know I I certainly wouldn't you don't panic here I don't think it's a it's a huge problem um you know it's just sort of on word and awkward and uh hopefully pox will go in or when they play a game three\nAnd they will play that game on Saturday Night against Columbus we'll talk a little more about that but first right on cue our guest tonight Anthony ... joining us here\n\nFrom Anthony we were just talking about the you know it's never a good thing when you lose an is a tough way that one nothing lead going into the third and it's slips away but uh overall we didn't think it was a bad performance by any stretch of the imagination what's the thought from the locker room tonight after this one\nYeah I'm a I thought we did some things well I'm obviously we came up pretty hard it's on the first period there hum I died down a bit in the second and third in a you know stopped getting a bit but uh I guess that's how it is some good things in a house he some things on your work on\nOne of the things you worked on heart and it is really shown through two games but a particularly again tonight in key situations the penalty killed that we talked a lot about last year that just would have had so much trouble um you guys of you know been great so far this year even perfect um\nWhat's different you've been part of it uh from your standpoint what are you guys doing differently on the penalty killed this year that maybe you weren't last year [noise]\nUm I'm not too sure I think we're just kind of thing as a unit um maybe a little more aggressive if it's you know a place or a little bit of his own there um you know about who made some key says froze obviously down the stretch so um we're just kinda you know I guess that's it plays a union and you know talk to each other and help each other out\nYou know the power play gets all the glory and why not because that's where all fences generated people get excited I Know you you had some power play experiences Syracuse but what the penalty killed just that that's not the funding one because you're trying to keep the puck out of your net there are so being on the PKK unit you guys take a lot of pride in keeping these little shutout streaks going for a little bit\nYeah for sure um you know we take a lot of pride and being on the ... to kill and you know uh getting out there and you know I'm not coaches trust to throw you out there and you know defend\n'em you know when you're a man down enough obviously every one that's on the unit you know we have a lot of guys that are a sacrifice their body and you know getting in ... and stuff like that so um you know we take pride in and try and be really good at\nWhat to talk about your line a little bit let's do it in two parts you played a lot with Alex galore now ever since you came to the team last year and starting up again this year\nWhat do you like about playing with Alex and what is it about the chemistry between you to that as work so well\nNo I just think you know we're talking a lot I'm a bit too there on the ice or you know on the bench you always try to help me and try and figure out where to be and and and what to do um you know he's a really smart player he's got you know make scrape place so I think I just kind of given the puck and and get open and he would try and find me\nI talked to him about you this morning and he had a lot of great things to say and well he should he said he really enjoyed playing with you\n... your reliable or your your position but he also said the skill level so we talk about a lot of things but he said the kids got a lot of skill and he said that makes it a lot of fun for me so having said that now let's add in the third element that you had today and that was Mathew Joseph so how does the line feel as a trio now and the way you guys\nPlay today yeah I think we you know we played some games go down to pre season and I'm Joel on down in Syracuse so I think we've got some a\nPretty good chemistry you know Joe's really fast he you know he's very skillfully makes place he's you know back chicken and ah you know there too you know he's making pay more than that he's he's talking all over the ice so I think we just confidential there while I'm like I said we talk a lot out there so I'm\nA try what we're going to try and get a little couple of more goals here and there but uh I think we're we're doing okay job so far\nAnd uh Brian Burns of Tampa Bay lightning dot com actually wrote an interesting article about you and Matthew Joseph I it it's kind of funny because you do have that chemistry in Syracuse from your experience a last season but you also played a couple of months up here in the playoffs as well so now you're the grizzled veteran\nSo Matthew makes the team out of camp you're showing him the way so of course you're completely capable that job but I'm sure you you didn't imagine that was what you were going to be doing at the started this season\nYeah um you know made yogurt buddies off the ice I'm you know on the ice or in the room you know we like uh having fun and talking with each other so uh it's just great for him to me here you know especially playing with them um you know it's been it's been a lot of fun\nAnd how much closer can you get to getting that first\nSchool because he he's quite a few ... to the game yeah he's a he's\nDefinitely had a lot of chances I'm no more than that is shooting pod she's making place so um I I feel it coming fairly soon\nSpeaking of goal scoring confidence wise\nYou came into the team scored right away and in the first game that you play that was in Dallas than it was a terrific cool um you've scored since certainly coming into this season\nHow did you feel about scoring the NHL American Juniors wanting\nThe American legs another step off the gold standard that much better the systems of players are bigger etcetera DNA Charles and now they're jumps forward how would you describe your confidence level when it comes to what you think about ... and your ability to score um this year compared to last year [noise]\nUm you know death is a little more comfortable this year coming in this year um ... there's a lot of really good goes up here you know there's a lot of good teams that play play well defensively so um you know it's hard to get goals so you know I just try to stick to my game can get to the net um he'll get the ... you know just just like a a two hundred okay mom\nObviously work and she'll be a little bit more officers this year but um main thing is is keeping the puck other than that\nAnd it's well documented your story of going from Syracuse to here in in staying for good for the rest of the season in the playoffs so you're just kind of thrown in ... and it's really dependent on just your skill your talent just go out there and do your thing then when the season ends at already Anthony you want to come back here you've got to do this this this so in the offseason\nWhat was this this and this what did you do off the ice to get you ready\nFor the season it yeah I just trained 'em you know to get a little bit stronger I tried getting stronger or tried to getting a little bit faster um you know it just helps Marlboro game you know if it's you know battling in the corner for pucker are trying to have a harder shot so I definitely weren't trying the gym to to try and get to\nWhere I Want to be um you know and they said you know a couple of things that I got to work on if I wanted to say this year\nYou worked a lot with Barbara Underhill to ensure the off season who's the the power skating coach he shows up here in in uh Tampa Bay a couple of times a year but you had the benefit of working with her or him several times over the summer I understand\nYeah um she's she's at my home town trying to they're so working with or at least once a week\nOr for the summer so she told me work and I try to work on you know my crossovers trying to get a quick or few steps off the hop so I'll get a lot of credit to her she is she has helped me every single year since I've been with the lightning when I got drafted so uh she told me a lot and and definitely worked on my skin ...\nYup yup keep up the good work and I was a tough lost tonight but we'll go get them on Saturday against Columbus Anthony earlier and got here on the laugh\nWhen we come back we'll talk more about tonight's game we will hear from head\nCoach John Cooper as well and we'll take a look ahead to that game against Columbus on Saturday Night when the last call present about Jack Daniels continues in just a moment a nine Seventy WFL\nA lightning how can you hear\nUs F sports they're\nGet twenty four seven coverage of Tampa Bay is home team with us a bulls unlimited search us up on your eye hard radio [laughter] forms\nAnd he was down to the fourth line\nNow junk Cooper didn't say anything that I heard\nAnd I I my opinion I didn't take it that he was terrible and it's a huge demotion to go to the fourth line\nThe first line wasn't that great overall in in game one\nAnd so he's obviously looking for a different look he puts polite out there where's he going to put you know where's it going to put ... Miller again it goes back to having you know a an abundance of riches\nHighly Johnson comes back and say go okay we liked that combination now we're not going to put Miller there the third line we've already talked about this rally life so that means okay\nThis is a good thing because we could we can change and put a guy like Jay Z Miller down on the fourth line which they've always talked about trying to get more often it's the fourth line so for Jaycee to play their against ... with ... and Adam Ernie that a lot of good shifts game too and they generate it's a really good scoring chances as well so um\nThat you know I I think people can middle misinterpret that sometimes 'cause I didn't think Jay ... my own opinion I don't think he played badly um like worse than anybody else maybe that's the best way to put it so if you thought he was being punished for the fourth line\nI didn't see it that way I guess that's the point I'm trying to make and I thought the lightning de had good gaps tonight they were good and the neutral zone they were aggressive defense when got up on the play and created a lot of scoring chances they got I didn't see the final shots from defense but but they got ... through to them that it didn't go in\nSo you know let's go wrap up this game put it behind them and uh see what happens against Columbus on Saturday yeah I actually\nLike Miller on the fourth line I think it gives a very interesting look to that fourth line not only because you've got the physicality there and you've got the defense of responsibility but [noise] you know you're looking for office from Fort lines to Miller with with his big frame and speed you know he's a little bit of a whirling ... there on the left wing you we know what's said he probably ...\nTo ... and the fourth line needs the guy like that that's what I like the last year with coon it's in Cali they'd be dumped ... pretty much all the time right get in there and bang around any cause turnovers math but when you get a Miller on on whatever line drawn\nInto a crowd he makes really good players I mentioned this I don't know how many times since you know he came to the lightning last year\nUm so that gives the fourth lined a different look it gives them a chance for more sustain action and and pressure and then of course Miller still on the power play too there's always going to get his wraps and he's going to get his ice time on the power play with the rest of the fourth line won't so\nI I didn't look at his final minutes or for tonight but I I Will later and we can talk about that in future games but again just interesting scenarios for Miller and for the lightning\nJeff Miller tonight with a C. Fifteen fifty two of total lifetime tonight [noise] um but yeah ... adding an interest not terrible no adding an interesting element like I said you know what you're going to get ... cat in in an upcoming power for ... and I I actually liked that\nWere blind to buy a bunch of junk Cooper like about the game will hear from that in our next segment and if you were bored out of your mind the last

arena\nAnd welcome back to the last call for example by Jack Daniels nine Seventy WFL a lightning\nSmarting from a for one last of the Vancouver Canucks tonight and by the way to answer the question how many shots came from lightning defense nine of the thirty for coming from the blue line tonight those are the ones that got through and we'll we'll get to the difficult massive shot attempt some other time\nBut first let's listen in to head coach John Cooper's post game press conference presented by WMU Cooley law school the Tampa campus give them a call at eight one three\nFor one nine fifty one hundred here is junk Cooper\n[noise] that it was stated federal\nIs or is there any level of concern I Know it's just your games you know\nIt's tough it's a we've gotta finish we're not finishing I mean we're shooting some ... than that but we're we're not going there was a desire to score\nAnd that's where you have to do and asleep especially with the goal tending the way it is a these are NHL goalie goal is you've got to go in there and get dirty ones and they're all not going to be pretty in a you know we're probably resorting a little bit to the trying to get the political\nPower play right now are probably yeah like it's a\nGood power play scores one out a very for\nWould that have helped tonight I'm sure it would have but they didn't have power play go either so special teams as in significant tonight with a five on five game and we lost and most of the games played five on five so cat sitting resort to say\nUm you know you're special teams has got to bail you out or there's some games of course it does but that should be the least of our concerns is trying to you know depend always on the special teams I'm\nYou know we lost five on five game and I was at\nA party\nMentioned it to them it was\nOf awkward start with so many days ... are you looking forward to going back and just seeing the grind show I\nCame to I can nobody nobody needs a grind you know [noise]\nAh I don't know\nJust be honest we were when I looked up one time and I think shots were twenty to date so kept sit here and say the time off this anything bad one nothing weight and I thought we were had really good control the game\nSecond half the game I'm One team\nAnd we let them hang around and one team kept playing to the end and all of a sudden you look it's not the next thing you look it's two one were down\nAnd uh you know we just couldn't pull it out so it's just it's a really really tough week to win and then you just can't take teams for granted or situations for granted you got to play it out and\nYou know the ... played it out and we didn't\nGet to play the messages of again\nThere is a is using his uh his biggest asset to speed to his advantage and he always drawn penalties and he's getting chances um he's been a definitely an abrasive ... their team\nMentioned I'm finishing you're not finishing it out it was it was the execution more so there are like\nThe guys are trying I don't I Would never sit here and say our guys are trying their work and\nI don't know how\nIt gets to a point where you have to do you got to get to the inside you have to get to those areas that you know why you're going to get hit going there you are [noise] um but the more you go there\nYou are going to break a team down and um [noise] he would just [noise]\nWe stopped doing it and we had you know we really had a shot volume mentality in the first half the game that we did not have it after that\nAnd it was just you know as pass pass pass out of his owner pass pass pass turning in a chance into it'd be chats into a C. plus chance and it was off or stick and so um\nAnd you know ... though the ... but now the sudden ... because he put on a ... hats\nAnd he's an attention war like the president he's all of a sudden now that that the model spokes person he is he's the token negro of that of the Trump Administration so Tara had explain\nOkay a couple things here\nUm I I've been a conservative my entire adult life I worked in conservative politics and that was Eighteen years old so I'm not one to disparage people of color decided they no longer want to be Democrats I'm not a Democrat I don't agree with the Democrat world view especially when it comes to issues in the black community\nHowever where you draw the line is with people who are now praising Kanye West as some kind of light ... because he put on a Mac a hat\nYou can't really even cogent we put together the reasons why it's more about\nDonald Trump that it is necessarily about conservative principles are more public and principal at this point and so people are claiming I've been falsely accused that I you know I I just started in ... because he left the Democratic plantation and all kinds of crazy thing no that's not my issue with habits issue with him is that\nThis guy is clearly not stable\nAnd he's being exploited not all five by Donald Trump and his and his supporters because he knows that he's not\nStable it's ... ... ... there's no question about Connie emotional stability for years now and it's kind of come to a head in the last year or so so he goes on these rats and he's been doing that\nNot making sense and then saying things about slavery is a choice and he did a rambling interview with Charlene the God who is a well known a morning show ... nationally\nOr listen to I I Do the W all our morning show for three years uh right down the hall from Charlotte and so you know I Know I Know Charlotte I mean we had him on the show on several occasions so yeah so\nHe's yeah he's a well known 'em you know I'm a black morning show host he did a hundred minutes interview with\nKanye over the summer it was a rambling mess from ... and so he said things like there were only eight hundred slaves in the Eighteen hundreds like he's he just ignorant about a lot of historical things\nBut I take issue with now a lot of these Trump supporters who or disparaging Kanye not too long ago because of the comments he made about George W. Bush not caring about black people oh no and then ... music he uses the N. word and all kinds of stuff in his music though he was no good then\nBut now all of a sudden he's embraced and I just think that it's ridiculous and he is being treated as a token so that Donald Trump can say oh look I have\nThis guy this last guy who is supposed to be very popular in the black community which he's not as popular as it used to be because of these rats and he's been going on the strengthening thanks um and so we can point\nTo him so so there are\n... in and get vocally participating\nOh so you're saying it's sort of tantamount to or the white guy that says hey you know I've got a black friend is that what you're saying\nOkay a thousand percent I mean the president went on Fox and friends this morning and basically said he just wide and said that his\nHis popularity in the black community went up twenty five percent one tiny endorse them that's not true but I Do that's not even measurable and this is the guy that was on Saturday Night live a couple of weeks ago dressed in a Perrier outfit\nOn anything come on on ice oh let me ask you a question you as\nA conservative your entire adult life or a black female or working in geopolitics uh and you've been outspoken against the many policies of Trump for his behavior or it'll what we've seen\nHas has proper the White House have they ever reached out to you have they ever they will try to have a conversation with you and what's your issue what's your problem we try to bring you into the fold or have they ever tried to have a conversation\nNo but I Do know um I you know folks in the White House I mean like I said I I've been in Republican politics or twenty five years liberal Washington or twenty or you know a lot of people in the White House and have friends that work there but they know repair the way that this White House ... through the functional\nIt there is no room for any difference of opinion it's all about blind loyalty I mean my very good French or Michael single and moved to a young black Republicans smart as a whip you went over to a hut with a with Ben Carson who needed that needed to help lead me\nAnd um they removed him from his position because they went back and discovered he wrote a critical article about Donald Trump during the during the campaign\nThey literally escorted him out with the security because of that despite the fact that he was confident smart and desert his position [laughter] this is not a this is not an administration that welcomes any kind of difference of opinion or even confidence necessarily in in in in there who they choose for a certain position [noise]\nTo just say one other thing really ... out this about that the attacks that\nI've been eating are people feeling uncomfortable with the word negro on I set a tongue in cheek to make a ... a strong point about kind of the hypocrisy of people in the way that they're treating ... versus other um in in the past\nI mean no one was upset with Rush Limbaugh when he for eight years this respectfully if this is respectfully in my opinion used to play a parity called rock the Magic Negro\nAnd that was unacceptable now we're talking about the president the United states I wasn't a ... than I didn't vote for him I was against it policy that's what he did an awful thing for this country but you don't disrespect I don't care what the parity or not\nHe called ... it was called ...\nThe Magic Negro where all these people who are attacking me for making the point I made about ... what have you like that um\nWhen with with that I think that that's hip hop or see also the word negro in the black community is not like the N word it's different you have still have United negro college fund you let the national council of negro women but it is a colloquial term that's used in the black community\nA little bit differently not like the N word I I don't justify that but so everyone needs to really does take a step back and think about the point that I was making and and look at the way the economy the haves and hypocrisy and look at what he did today in the oval office\nThat was so disrespectful so demeaning and and and just not what the Oval Office she'd be I remember when Republicans freaked out when Brock Obama invited common\nTo the White House who's actually an old guy may disagree with some of his rap lyrics yup but he's a very talented intellectual actually does do good work and his community and Republicans were excoriated the president for that\nBut they're okay with this clown ... clowning himself and disrespecting York office this way and the president inviting him to do it today\nSo Terry you subscribe to the ... only in it for Kanye West\nA hundred percent you know\nAnd I don't think we can help it I mean we're not looking at any one is looking at this guy he clearly needs\nHelp and I was not by any means mocking people with mental illness either that somehow that got thrown out there which is not the case at all I was simply pointing out of material fact\nThat he had been hospitalized for emotional issues and that he's he claimed he was diagnosed bipolar but then he himself today dismissed that and said you know he he just missed\nEven his own diagnosis and talk some jumbled mess about that so but this has nothing to do with that he's not actively seeking help to it you know to get that are like a lot of people who do struggle with this issue and they shouldn't be elevated exploited if they're having an episode I just don't think that that's healthy\n... lawyer a former GOP communications director or does a commentary on CNN and you're still doing ABC is well correct\nI but I also have a new podcast although honestly speaking with Derek though I gotta get while I'm not\nYou will have me on anytime you want and let me ask you one as a black female on a conservative\nAh when I hear the argument really 'cause I I despise the N. word and when I hear black people try to justify that no black people when they use the N word it ends in an a a versus when white people use it it ends in ... or earlier and it's different your thoughts\n[noise] so I agree with you I mean that that term is so violent and what's associated with that term is beyond the pale and I agree there is a complete double standard when it comes to that and then you can and then when white people turned around and use the term thinking it's a term of Germans\nIt's a little confusing so no I don't subscribe to that the issue with the negro were and the reason why I say it doesn't quite have that same thing yes it's associated with Jim Crow and there were negative connotations with the term negro but there's also a like I said a historic\nI'm value to that word that different than the N. word that still uses\nLike I said with organization stay in the ... like the United negro college on like the national council of negro women you had any organization just looking at the national now that the colored people journals you know\nThere there is a different there that and I think that distinction important when we're having a conversation if you want to talk about outrage\nWell parents certainly interesting day or I'm not a fan of ah the media covering all kinds of profanity and the oval office today I either it's well below I don't care who the present whether it was Obama whether it's Trump\nGeorge W.

Bush didn't care about black people because of the way he handled Hurricane Katrina\nNow the left hates him because he is embracing\nThe president and saying to black people take a look at this guy substantively rather than automatically being always on the side of the Democrats I spoke with the president and a couple of weeks ago and suggested he talked to kind of a gym round the football great and Tiger Woods the great\nSo that's why it or don't told Trump to bring these guys in the eyes shut unknown I should've known Geraldo told Trump to get Kanye\nWest in there and Joe Brown\nAnd tiger tiger hasn't been yet but you know what that Geraldo did bring up a a ... I forgot it\nWas Kanye West who told George W.

James O'Keefe is going to join us and a Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit there\nHim and his campaign in his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people at Tennessee but the very purpose of getting elected and they say it not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't play view\nLater in the program today but I mean it is in his mind numbing that people have zero truth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe\nAnd the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them all oh why do we get to the tape on cinema today\nOr you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester is they can't be honest with who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington\nBut go when they get their here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that sort of first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer\nThe eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is\nNo voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party I got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nFrankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea what Republicans also offering solutions and answers and solving problems\nAnd the numbers beret out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up\nAll of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy and you're gonna get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes\nWell that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty\nAnd he became the only president in history ever to never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs up post jobs are never coming back well in less than two years Trump's brought back more than four hundred thousand of them half the time he brings it back not only by\nEnding burdensome regulation and asking businesses\nWell what we what can we do to help facilitate you working here in building here in grading factories manufacturing centers ear and\nWell they tell them well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... that because of that regulation\nOr the president's wiping those regulations off the books and then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just well humiliate publicly any company\nThat is not building in America and then on top of that each challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them\nHey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out and we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with\nFor example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing I Know everybody's been all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what country was saying and I'm like\nWell I Do think we need some prison reform I'll give you an example when the president ... commuted the sentence of ... marine Johnson remember the woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug offense\nA grandmother apparently should run in a horrible economic difficulties is like ... there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system\nAnyway spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her\nRight into the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen\nAnd then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you thank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down well I Want to find all the hours Murray Johnson's in prison that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance\nAnd you know that would that maybe a bit given heavy sentences\nFor reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people you also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York well I've been here under Rudy Giuliani went from about\nTwenty five hundred a year down to three hundred\nThree or four hundred Bernie ... was a big part of the success of that program it just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed where the shots being fired wherever it happens to be\nAnd you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night and not worry the bullets they're going to be flying through their windows and the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to fix Chicago I mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary ... our our human\nOur human family and talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice it's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better\nAnd then he's talking about bringing jobs making with things in America and creating jobs in America you know they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed\nAnd we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing as white as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that his downright\nRacist and disgusting why is it matter if somebody happens to be\nAfrican American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness it's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious viral thing you can listen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when negroes don't read flat phone\nTurns out to train tiny west and the race on draft now all of a sudden ... because he put on a mat hats and he's an attention more like the president have all of a sudden now that the the model folks person he's he's the token negro of the of the Trump administration's\nThis was an embarrassment ... mother is rolling over in her grave\nI think you had there a man who's clearly not okay to president who's willing to point that\nWas a combination of fame of consciousness I felt like I sit in on a psychiatric ...\nAnd a commercial for Donald Trump on the question of of of mental health on the question of other calling him I felt very pointed to me\nI never something very fragile valid and sad about tiny pulling out of the song and frankly in Taipei comes out side I think for their own from falling out somewhere picture of a ... I mean just found out it seems like an important point I haven't heard anyone else on television make at that but I Can't think of all I\nWas at a thoughtful play by play and political and now you're not thinking is that with ... on our White House\nI'm just going to be honest I may get a lot of trouble for it I feel actually feel bad for him what I saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself\n[laughter] this is white supremacy by ... of course I'm a black mouth is moving but white racist ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smile\nKanye West is engaging in one of the most nefarious practices and yet of black ... body and brain power the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of anti black sentiments that have been ... by people with far more rigorous credentials\nIt is so vicious and viable I don't even know where to begin how was that acceptable to anybody this I\nDon't know Kanye except I talked to him twice in my life and we talked about safer cities like the city of Chicago we talked about economic empowerment and opportunity for people for everybody in this country he's a billionaire\nAnd ... is a pack on that vicious horrible level I don't even know what to say my friend Heisman Trophy winning football great Herschel Walker\nHe's called out CNN's Don Lemon for allowing all all of those insults to go out against Kanye West than\nHe questions is on their behavior and as a guest or a referring to them as quote the oh leave all want to repeat what you just heard I don't even want to repeat it\nBy the time actually reached which is a western most part of our service area Mexico beach that damage there with extensive homes there had completely wiped away there are no longer existed and other homes had been lifted off of their foundation and moved to let her property\nGibbs says power poles are completely destroyed and much of the power infrastructure will have to be rebuilt the death toll has risen to at least Thirteen and FEMA director Brock Long says he expects that arise [noise]\nFrom the Florida central credit union free checking traffic center avoid south on travel on forty ninth street north we're looking at a crash approaching almost ten is taken up the left and center lanes\nThey supported sponsored by max and the smart security lied to Cosco imagine getting to the video of I'll activity at your door from your smartphone that's what Maxwell smart security life do plus much more talk life with visitors from anywhere better than a video store balance so easy to install get maximum security lights at your local Cosco page current news radio nine Seventy W.
