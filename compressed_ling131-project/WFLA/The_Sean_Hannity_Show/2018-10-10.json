{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "Our weekly tech segment sponsored by connect ones would seem that senior editor Bridget Kerry who you can follow on Twitter at Brigitte carry Bridget thank you so much rule I talk to you again next week\nCatch it later things\nComing up in the final segment of the show we have a few up on those stories to get through including a today being the last day to register to vote here instead of Florida will tell you all about that and the latest on hurricane Michael plus uh the phone number of course if you want to give us a call eight hundred nine six nine Ninety three fifty two more PM Tampa Bay\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technicians we are the aviation Institute of maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight\nBut that's all sixteen ... day from ... am to ... your next chance to win a thousand bucks coming up at six pass the top of the hour on nine Seventy WFL law\nInformation and discussion for the Tampa Bay area nine Seventy W west LA is live in ... right now with Brian Gorman on ... and so I just\nSaw a tweet from ... over ... gene he tweeted out might do return data latest pass nine forty eight point five and be extrapolated one thirty Katie light level wins\nCat for to me\nSo I don't really know what any of that means aside from the fact that sounds like he thinks it's a category or if you take a look at some of the data they got from\nA a return mission\nYou literally lost me up until right for adults\nThat we ought to know that one of the wall\nWill ... the general theory is here that the storm is strengthening the hurricane Michael's continuing to strengthen its a strong category three now and it might be near a category for by the time and makes landfall\nA on in the panhandle but it sounds like according to Paul do a God oh there's a chance that that you know it could reach the category for level and it might potentially already be there\nUm right now so we'll have to keep an eye on the eleven PM advisory and the two AM advisory some of the overnight advisories\nTo see how this storm continues to strengthen and move out there in the Gulf of Mexico Hillsborough County schools are going to be open tomorrow so you're going to get a day off from school not happening not yet no we're not happen unless there's some big change and let's hope there's not to over the course of the next\nCouple of hours or we're going to be doing live updates you know all through nights all day tomorrow on hurricane Michael to to give me a heads up on on what's happening with that storm on the website\nWe have a this is what I think is a great a funny Facebook post from the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office\nAll know that when a storm approaches the last place you want to be\nThe same place says Jim can tore from the weather channel so they put out a fake trust a ... big trespassing notice for Jim can't tore\nA basically telling them stay away we we we don't want you to come here uh don't even think about it because we all know and again when Jim can't story shows up\nThat that you know that is\nBad news for you and your community\nOr today is the last day to register to vote in the state of Florida you've got until eleven fifty nine pm tonight to do so on line and again you've got to be Eighteen going to be a Florida resident and you have to be US citizen\nAnd look this is one of those states where if for some reason you think your vote doesn't matter you're out of your mind I mean the two thousand presidential election\nFive hundred thirty seven votes separate Bush from Gore\nOr twenty sixteen election you are nine million Floridians cast ballots\nA Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by a hundred twelve almost a hundred Thirteen thousand votes which is not a lot in a in a state were that many ballots are being cast the twenty four teen\nElection for governor six million people voted Scott be crushed by a little over sixty four thousand boats so votes matter here in the swing state of Florida where the elections are always\nReally really close to ... percent as one or two most of the time\nI'm right now or at least as of August thirty first\nFlorida had more than Thirteen million registered voters\nThirty seven percent were Democrats thirty five percent were Republicans\nAnd almost twenty seven and a half percent war independence registered with no party affiliation or with a minor party majority of that that percentage though is is NPA independent so it's kind of the break down the party break down here in the state of Florida\nA Tom stiers group he is the liberal billionaire activists to you see on TV talking about impeaching the president and all that\nHis uh his group next Gen America or announced today that its Florida offshoot next Gen Florida registered over fifty thousand flirting in the boat had to be a general election\nGroup said it knocked on ... eighty thousand doors and sent over twenty three thousand text to voters they did a lot of work especially trying to get young people or to register but again you know all these registration numbers it's great but it's turned out that matters in the mid term turnouts usually lower\nAnd if there's going to be a substantial shift in terms of Democrats winning big time it's going to be because it turned out\nThe their registration numbers are therefore I'm\nUh it's the turn out that that matters and usually in midterms Republicans turnout have been more than Democrats\nAre ... there is a little bit of an issue here with the voter registration deadline Democrats are trying to urge um the secretary of state and the governor here in the state of Florida\nTo um push back the deadline for ah this this voter registration deadline or a week until October sixteenth because you know a lot of people in the state are going to be affected by hurricane Michael\n... to me I don't think you push back a week for people in in Tampa Bay\n... it's not really necessary now everybody in a place like that you don't want people trying to strengthen worry about voter registration on a night they should be making sure they're prepared for a category three potentially for hurricane exactly\nTo me it seems reasonable if you're in the panhandle area or you know six county north uh and you could potentially really get affected by the storm if you can give them an extra week I don't see why that is a big deal but but for people in Orlando or Fort Lauderdale or Miami\nOr Naples there's no reason\nYou don't need extra time now now you're done you got a couple of hours people\nExactly but plenty of time you can jump on line right now registered to vote Florida a duck of and if you can get in there before eleven fifty nine pm tonight then you'll be able to vote the final story they don't want to touch on is a Halloween\nRelated story I Love Halloween stories\nHave you seen the Stormy Daniels inspired Halloween car have I have seen it\nI saw this ah today\nAnd there's this online retailer that's focused on women's apparel it's called the Andy I've never heard\nIt was like yeah costumes from there really are at every year and all the way and I always take him out\nSo this is a legit site that does the Halloween costumes and they have a Stormy Daniels inspired outfit which is basically like a red dress with what does that look like like a plastic thing should ask plastic\nFake ... yeah yeah uh because stormy you know yeah [noise]\nWell on down the example of it that we have a family and what we know what I mean I Am [laughter]\nOr Florida will get hit by a a major hurricane in the month of October which is our our month we October is a form a month for for her land falling hurricanes\nNow poll we saw that ... D intensification of Florence Florence was supposed to smash the Carolina coast and a cat for it ended up as a cat one you're not seeing those factors which could mitigate the intensity\nWell I really don't I mean the difference here is is that it's gonna make landfall in about twenty four hours and right now it's in a it's an intensification stage\nSo even if nothing happened and made landfall as a hundred and ten mile an hour hurricane that's still a pretty big deal I'm you know I I I Would think there's a higher chance of it being a three or four than it is one or two but you know we've learned over the years the intensity forecasting is not perfect\nAnd I think regardless of the cat and number two three four it's going to be a really big deal for the pan handle potentially catastrophic and or if you're familiar with kind of the vegetation up and that part of the state it's a lot different than it is here in Tampa Bay is just a lot more trees\nA it's a different climate and there's going to be just widespread power outages the could last days weeks maybe a month or so in some places and then\nIt's not just gonna be a coastal for the thing is going to move into Georgia and the Carolinas and bring some wind issues and power outages this was not going to be just the state of Florida storm it'll continue moving northeast up towards North Carolina\nI'm Paul I know you're in a tight schedule doing whether the graphics for your for five and six PM a cast a storm surge now if you couldn't let let's direct this directly in my listeners that are on the the the Florida Gulf Coast in the pan handle the Panama City listeners those to the east those or to the west\nA let's talk storm surge productions are potentially eight to twelve feet of storm surge and of course that can be deadly\nYeah and that's always an eight to twelve feet ... Indian past his to cedar key\nUm even here even here we've had we've had high water around Tampa Bay and has been some flooding are way down towards Naples or what some high water she got to think of of the Gulf of Mexico as being like a big bathtub\nBecause it's almost close to close circle and that water when it began slashing along our coast really piles up though it's a whole different set up here on the Gulf of Mexico than it is on the Atlantic\nOn the water is deeper into the water off the coast of the panhandle in off our west coast is pretty shallow and it really piles up quickly so on our west coast storm surge is the big problem up in the big band and the panhandle storm surge it's wind and it's and it's rained so that's that's how that's\nGoing to play out yeah I saw in the Tampa Bay area which is my back yard 'cause my home is you know is right on Tampa Bay a two to four feet I I don't know if we'll see much really that'll affect us but\nI you know I just I feel for the people in the panhandle right now if you want to do as as a a well trained a meteorologist who's dealt with the hurricane activity for decades Paul what do you say to my listeners that are in this path\nOr to the east and west the Panama City beach\nOr the water always wins don't don't ever try to fight the water because the water will end up in places you never think the water is going to go if you're told to evacuate\nGet out I mean there's always the chance and it happens a lot you can leave and the next day and says you know I probably should have stayed but trust me it's it's not worth\nA try to ride out a storm on the coast especially a storm of this magnitude if your soul to leave just find someplace away from a water again you're evacuating from water you're not evacuating from when\nYou got to get away from the water the only time you evacuated from wind is if you live in a mobile home and there's a chance to your mobile home can be compromised you've just gotta get away from the water the water by far is the number one killer when it comes\nTo hurricanes and Paul last thing here I'm timeline we're looking at about this time tomorrow yeah to\nGet bad late tonight and then tomorrow will make landfall ah and then we'll move inland but it's not going to be just a quick deal it's going to the impacts are going to be far ranging and we'll be doing stories of storm damage in Georgia South Carolina North Carolina but obviously\nA it'll be worse where the storm does make landfall in Panama City beach is pretty built up now there's a lot of lot of stuff up there that wasn't there ten Fifteen Years ago and a lot of stuff literally sits on the Gulf of Mexico\nI've driven right by so I've seen all the buildings on the construction on the high rises though the ... the hotels and and the condo so I'm driven right along\nThe road there right adjacent to the beach and um if we can call this a lighter note did you see that the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office issued a press pass warning to Jim ... of the\nWeather I I saw that tweet that's kinda funny or you know they yeah he's yeah he does\nA great job and and you know the thing is you know you when he when he shows up your your town you know the stuff getting real\nYeah and and that's the point is it's it's ingested was more of a a joke from the Santa Rosa accounting for the sheriff's office they don't want Jim can't totally their own when Jim shows up it's it's going to be banned typically\nCome down in the summer just don't come down in September and October\n... that's that's what they said Paul Paul ... chief meteorologist a Fox Thirteen and Tampa Bay Florida Paula thanks we'll talk to you soon\nOK buddy have a good thanks [noise]\nAll right so there we have it again I Want to take this time out on my national program\nAnd also let's keep in mind that a lot of the oil platforms have a shutdown and evacuated in the Gulf of Mexico so you're saying you know if you're in Las Vegas our why does this concern me or if you're up in the Pacific northwest you know one or or Minnesota ... why why should I care about this well one of the reasons\nIs this does have the potential to push up\nA gas prices because you've had a whole series of the oil and gas so natural gas and oil producing platforms in the Gulf of Mexico\nI have been evacuated so a lot of\nThe production staff have been taken off of these platforms in production has been shut down and over the years we've seen that that has had an effect on oil prices which in turn will ah Jack up the prices at the pump and of course we know that\nThe market looked for any reason to raise prices whether it's a Texas crude whether it's you know a gasoline futures whatever\nI'm sure the the prices are already rising it at the pump so that's why the whole country you know needs to be aware that it's not just you know the impact of the storm itself but there is an economic impact in many cases for the whole country when we have these storms because of\nThe oil production in the Gulf of Mexico so again or to my floor of the listeners\nOn the the northern ah a part of the Gulf of Mexico in the Florida Panhandle please heed all warnings were going to follow this we have a lot of ground to cover today or next I Want to get into Nikki Haley so why did Nikki Haley\nResigned as you know if you're a regular listener I I have a a great affection for Nikki Haley I thought she did a wonderful job as the south Carolina Governor I've got a lot of friends in the low country and and uh and upstate in South Carolina and everyone I Know I really love Nikki Haley\nAnd then as UN ambassador\nShe's done a fantastic job again uh another thing that Trump is done right is\nIs you know now it seems pretty seriously hey there's a new sheriff in town here and we the United states we're not going to get beaten up any longer by the United nations and the bulk of the countries in the UN that that hate us\nOr it's America first I'm had no issue with that that's not code for anything America ... at first than white supremacy you know someone's going to say America First that's that's code for white supremacy that is that's BS\nI don't care what color you are I don't care what religion you are I don't care what floats your boat in this country if you're an American citizen you oughta want America First and this country first so why did Nikki Haley\nAnnounced her resignation or for the end of the year here\nOr there is some speculation and well let's drill end will also grab your phone calls coming up on ... if you want to get an eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine the nationwide number eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine a just a little more on that trust passwords Jim can't tore of course from the weather channel\nAnd again the\nRead here from the police in Santa Rosa County Florida is yeah of Jim can't tore a showing up well that means we probably have a bad hurricane so let's give them a press pass warning so he doesn't come here and therefore maybe the hurricane won't you know it's it's more ingest obviously that's gonna have no effect on the path of the hurricane\nBut from when I get this this is from\nA a\n... pie and Jay dot com and the and the Florida Panhandle the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office is a playful message for the weather channel Jim can't tore stay away from here\nAs the panhandle braces for a serious stormed with hurricane Michael the law enforcement agency took a friendly jab at the meteorologist they actually did a poster like a wanted poster or with the press pass warning and a push push this out on their Facebook page to issue a fake trespass warning to can tore\nComplete with photos that have physical description of the weatherman identify kids' toys a person of interest\nAnd adds up the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office in Florida\nWould prefer he make non business related visits only and winter months preferred so you know even at a time where there's a lot of seriousness\nNorth bound us Gina pass go head marine parkway still getting reports of a loose from an earlier craft that is now moving off the shoulder steep foster news radio nine Seventy dealt with you with LA [noise]\nWindy conditions expected on Wednesday as hurricane Michael passes off to our west out in the Gulf will see the potential for some coastal flooding with higher than normal high tide cycles expected for the next couple of days both Wednesday and Thursday fast moving showers and thunderstorms expected on Wednesday it's about a fifty percent rain chance\nWindy conditions with high temperatures in the upper eighties still breezy on Thursday of forty percent rain chance those high temperatures back in the upper eighties I knew she had a late meteorologist ... a news radio nine Seventy WFL a [noise]\nNews I'm rich Dennison hurricane Michael now a category ... storm expected to make landfall along the Florida Panhandle around noon tomorrow ... says residents should respond to evacuation order\nHe asked if you do not put the our first responders in harm's way ah if they have to come and try to rescue ... and you've been asked to evacuate\nForecasters say when the storm surge rain and flooding are among the dangers in the storm President Trump was in South west Iowa tonight for a GOP campaign rallies or president announcing his uh\nMinister rations plan to allow year round sales of gas was higher ethanol ... minutes ... wrote to acting as a president says it will lower gas prices and help farmers critics say non switching to summer blends will harm the environment\nThe president says he's narrowed down the list to replace US ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley to five people Haley announced her resignation earlier today this\nIs a move\nAnywhere from the auto about hearing aids studios Ninety six seven FM Pascoal went up to nine FM south Tampa nine Seventy telling you eh ballet all over Tampa Bay\n\nOn [laughter] for\nChildren to news [laughter] we're\nAn eight hundred zero one eighty nine Ninety nine nationwide number here on ... you want to get in\nRegarding the breaking Nikki Haley news from earlier today eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine we will if you're on hold about Nikki Haley will get to your calls here in just a moment so why then is there more\nThan the story on why she resigned yeah many people think that\nThere are couple of factors that potentially are at play here or one of the factors is she wants to make some money\nYou know you look at what she's made as far as uh in in South Carolina politics or them as the south Carolina Governor and now as the U.S ambassador to the United nations uh Nikki Haley has earning potential\nUh clearly foreign greater or in the private sector than she does in in public service and you know looking at some of the research that's available online\nI if you look at her a twenty Eighteen financial information that was officially disclosed\nShe has a you know outstanding debt\nA credit card debt between twenty five thousand in sixty five thousand dollars there is a mortgage a of more than a million dollars\nAnd there's also a line of credit between two hundred and fifty and five hundred thousand dollars and with kids college age going you know the question is is Nikki Haley\nAre energized to hop into the private sector and\nMake a big score I mean she a clearly will have any number of options available to her in any variety of fortune five hundred companies or a board seeds I mean she has a chance to make a lot of money and certainly clear all that debt\nAnd and have a whole lot more additional income so is that the reason is Nikki Haley\nReady to parlay her experience you know prior to running for president on the Republican ticket in twenty twenty four which I think will happen or is she ready to take the next let's say five or six years\nAnd try to rack up some coinage I I think that\nThat does make sense to me uh some of the other possibilities are some of the other rumblings on wind Nikki Haley is calling it quits that it might be some pressure from within\nI don't know if this is as likely as the monetary suggestion but some are suggesting and floating that I'm hard liners inside the administration like a Mike Pompeo secretary of State John Bolton national security advisor\nThat well they don't see her as enough of a hard line or could there have been a push again we don't know the whole story well there will be leaks or will there be additional information surfaces on why did Nikki Haley really live and who knows\nBut these are the the ideas that are being a rumbled about being talked about and uh\nThen you know of course you know running for president in twenty twenty four ah if she's not going to challenge from those that say oh she's going to try to primary Trump in twenty twenty I don't see that happening I think twenty twenty four is likely and\nWould believe that she'd want to maintain the visibility inside the administration for as long as possible uh on the national stage if she wanted to go ahead and try to parlay that into a potential run and twenty twenty four I for me\nFor me the the most likely scenario is trying to use the next five plus years to make some serious calling to make a over seven figures a year which I think she can easily make\nFrom basically come back here asking me for whatever you want and you're going to get it and they you know of course they had a live laughed together but I really think he means it and the bottom line is the Taliban's kind of get the eight years she'll be back eventually you working on something very well\nAnd then Trump can come out and understand with her and he goes out with her and without her she'll become president and then he'll take credit [laughter] I Know\nJust out of curiosity interesting\nEr ... when you say you of interference what what what do I don't hear you lined sounds\nNot only hung on my mind on my line for some reason it was found it sounded like you aren't a water and then coming back up again and under what are coming back to apple now I I ...

Laurie thanks for the call I appreciate it\nLike some of the audio here this is the president earlier today the press spray which was then turned around and broadcast\nWhere the president made the announcement\nWanted to do this because Nikki Haley vessel to the United nations has been very special to me she's done an incredible job [noise] she's a fantastic person very importantly but she also is somebody that gets it she has\n[noise] at the United nations from the beginning with us from the beginning and work with us on the campaign it's been really a long time very intense and she told me

successful you know governor of South Carolina\nFor years and then she uh she did this and this is possibly even more in tune with what's going on\nVery dangerous [laughter] what she's doing a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together\nAnyway you know great accolades from the president it seems very cordial do I have an audio of Nikki Haley I Want to play we'll get to that and

any of that no matter what the Saudi disappeared\n[noise] didn't hear\nThe question was\nPresident ah answering questions just moments ago the papers now been turned around outside of the White House\nOne which is like you were born in March so by the\nPresident's wrap it up and it gives me that they hope to graduate I Love and I hope is ah I'm real proud of her and\nI'm very happy very happy for you right was that announced officially now and I'm very happy for yeah was\nIt a shot singer that Hope Hicks is now a man named as a communications vice president for Fox News\nFrom birth name that was a small group and a number brought her home and ... somebody who is really great\nOn I'm On my\nShow or listening to a little bit here the president taking questions at an answering questions from the press or on the White House lawn as he is getting ready to depart now is it tonight you'll he teased earlier today that he's got a big announcement\nI think that's tonight as he as soon as he headed to Iowa tonight is that what is going\nYeah the president heading out I I thought that I heard and I made a note I've got to find my note a yes or purpose counting that there's a a big announcement coming tonight\nI any he made that that quip earlier today so I don't know I I thought he might be heading to Iowa or he's hiding somewhere I'm more of these uh you know campaign stops you know helping candidates with the uh the mid term elections so\nWhat is this big announcement that's coming he's still alive taking questions\nBack there were those the day you do that and the air is cleaner I agree with that but they do you go well bunches of age you're going well run and the air is actually cleaner\nA\nMedia asking questions you can't you can't hear\n\nCan't hear the question but what was the only answer and try to figure it out uh so where where do you say is the head of the Iowa\nA is heading Council Bluffs or to the president is heading to Council Bluffs Iowa tonight that's where he's headed right now and [noise]\nRight okay so the question here is about the the the ban on summers sales of by a Fifteen of salt water ethanol I guess is what they're talking about anyway so the\nPresident of talent earlier today big announcement coming in Iowa tonight so what could that big enough will be\nNow as far as ... to crush gr and a bucket truck that was also before we were able to listen in on the president of the if the president this or this tape started rolling on the networks I before we started our number two and the president was asked about\nA bucket proper apparently or or Jared or because apparently he did say that is vodka would make a great to US ambassador to the United nations up I Believe that he brought up\nA you know any you know some some nepotism issues that of course it'd be a cute yeah I don't think the optics would be great\nEven you know Jared Kushner who for whatever reason Nikki Haley\nWould did he praised Jared Kushner was that unilateral or was there some discussion that hey could you give a juror to a nice little uh embrace on the way out I I don't know\nNot not quite sure what the detail is there but let's listen to some of Nikki Haley or at the White House the oval office spray where it was officially announced that she was leaving\n[noise] well I Want to say on that first of all I Want to thank\nFor just [noise] you know allowing us to come out and talk to you this way and it has been an honor and all I I you know I said I'm such a lucky girl says ... believe that they have raised me and to serve our country I Love very\nHas really been a blessing and I want to thank you for that matter most excited to hear what happened is here with the United states on foreign policy [noise] now\nThe United states has really changed my life but they were that's what we\nDo know that if we say we're going to do something we follow through and the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons this area whether it was NATO saying that on our country has to pay their share and whether the ... which is an amazing they get the business and they\nThrough with that but then if you look at these years of the last one point three billion and the un I made it on her we made it more [laughter]\nSouth Sudan we got an arms embargo which was a long time coming green North Korean sanctions passages which are the largest and generation done in a way that we didn't really work\nOn the Iran deal bringing attention to the world that every country any center than you can't overlook\nThings are doing do you have to see them for the ... they are I think you look at the anti Israel violence and the strength\nAnd courage that the president shown in moving the embassy and showing the rest of the world we are and where we want to put our and [noise] you know all of those things have made a huge difference and the U.S but I can tell you that um [noise]\nUs is wrong again and the U.S is strong in a way that should make all American very proud and [noise]\nI didn't want to say that it's not as if I Want to let some of them have family in general the first lady has been nothing but very very kind to me I Can't say enough good things about Jared and off the air and it is I\nHave no one understands\nCharities such a hidden genius that no one understands why now\nI mean to redo the NAFTA deal to weigh in on what I've done working with him on the middle east peace by it is so unbelievably that\nNow is that from Nikki Haley's hard I mean or was there any property I mean it just it sounds like there is a a a sort of up a push here or there laying the groundwork as well it sounds like\nFor new expanded roles for Jared Kushner\nIs is that where this is headed charity cushion or a hidden genius that nobody under ... no one understands is what she said\nThat's quite incredible you know listen real wrapping up on Nikki Haley here I mean she's one of the few traditional Republicans\nWho has thrived inside this White House she's a hawk\nProbably more so than the president you know Nikki Haley all you know really kind of comes out of the neo cons school and that's that's not an insult 'cause I think she she does it very very well but Nikki Haley's her hawkish instincts absurd or a server very well\nThey serve the president very well her hawkish instincts I have served you and me this country very well during her tenure at the United nations\n[noise] she took Trump's mandates she made them her own she boosted Trump's credibility on the world stage in the process\nBut we've all seen a deliberate tough much needed speeches that marching Russia even when the president would not a modern Russia which has always bothered me\nYou know her biggest success was essentially largely unseen\nNikki Haley literally wrestle the other members of the Security Council to get them on board with President Trump's demand for three separate rounds of sanctions against North Korea last year\n[noise] and those sanctions were the centerpiece of Trump's maximum pressure campaign now without the sanctions folks I don't think there would have been any progress in all\nOn at least even the talks of denuclearization with Kim Jong alone now bottom line yours I remain ultimately very skeptical of the the North Koreans and Kim Jong going they rope a dope dubbed they they run us in circles for decades here\nWhether Kim Jong on his father prior to that and the ... the Clinton Administration you know through the Bush administration so I I I don't

out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you pack the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh they don't have thoughts and prayers are with everybody in harm's way today this was this was the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's going to be this was one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's going to be the worst the worst hurricane ever\nFor the panhandle in Florida that's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth would the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends in Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein oh this is really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim told me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew the fourth Pfizer application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now or the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian ... that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by\nAnd of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legally expense now\nHe was now are supposed to testify because three people now Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week James Baker now the third person\nAre all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office\nTaping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant and then hoping he can get some information\nSomething from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it\nBut the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying well Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse\nAnd the impasse over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional taskforce interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath he's refusing to do so\nAnd those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aides said\nOn Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein\nAnd have him testify under oath did he or did he not as Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying\nDiddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he sign off on a document himself talked about well with regards to find a civil warrants you know that it was an affidavit and career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nIf there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it\nThey knew the DNC paid for it they knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the the us ca was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents when questioned in in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true it's just raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit ... the law especially advise application Pfizer warrant and protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton\nBought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win them\nA hundred million is zero and then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... operation of what the insurance policy was\nInsurance policy is that you have people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation Lisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tax confirmed that there's no there there\nBut anyway then they start ... media league strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for it that's the way\nThey get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA and it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen and then they appoint rod a Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy\nRobert Mueller but there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those sailing school is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak\nTo the Senate or judiciary committee's outside of the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why Whitey especially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath\nYou know and people worry about that just asked Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power in twenty seven days we have in Arizona making Sally thankfully has taken the lead in that close Senate race out there she's really an American war hero\nAnd ah anyway I think we're seeing a lot of moving in Missouri in favor of the Republican candidates a lot of movement Heidi Heitkamp is in trouble in North Dakota Joe Donnelly is in trouble in Indiana Bill Nelson needs to be defeated by Rick Scott who I Love in Florida but Rick Scott can't be campaigning is now taking care of the people in the pan handle\nInnocently a week ago it was just full storm in an area that episode this and it grew into a monster\nAnd that monster is

Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the phone eight Clinton bought and paid for ... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day\nAnd that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller and now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse\nOver the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional task force interviews\nAnd those close to Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also of Freedom Caucus member a end by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nI'll interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow\nUnder oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes of of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte do indicated that he would do that so now with your time obviously to get that done in which there Mr Rosenstein gets in there to answer these\nImportant questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may ninth and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got to subpoena we've got to bring him into the gas the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions
