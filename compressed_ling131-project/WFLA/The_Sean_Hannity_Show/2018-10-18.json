{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "A book that when I read it probably when I was in middle school or something I had to put the book down at one point 'cause it scared me so that the night\nIn the Nineteen sixty three movie that's ... that the black and white film that is the most faithful to the source material is an absolute horror classic I Love the original hunting they remade it in the nineties and it was terrible and this version is just using the title to tell a story about a family that\nHad an experience with a haunted house on how this experience haunts the kids into their adult young adulthood and something keeps drawing them back to the house I found it I really I haven't got to the end of it yet I'm I was a review of the magazine on trying to fit in with everything else I'm watching\nAnd the episodes are so long and there's an episode in the middle of it's an hour and ten minutes long\nAnd they just don't need to be that uh and it didn't need to be ten episodes I think that they could have told a story in a more compact and scary way but it's the whole Netflix method that they want you to just watch nothing else and it was the only thing I was watching maybe I'd be into it but and they use some of the some of the same tricks on the story from the original story\nAnd some of the things are just absolute terrified terrified if you're if you're in a bedroom and the walls just begin to pound around you that is scary has always been scary um and the fact that little kids are being put into the storyline here it was always a story about adults going into a house\nAnd trying to investigate the paranormal this time it's about a family\nThat goes into a house to sort of flip but you know to to renovate and flip it right and then of course it's ... it's on it and there are some scary moments but the scary wants to happen like toward the beginning and end of an episode and then you've got all this family drama in between and I just don't think the episodes only to be an hour I have a real bone to pick about that with\nNetflix and now it's not ... you're not a big fan of the of the episodes of go a little bit too long when you when they had kind of have the freelance ability to make them as long as they want\n[noise] exactly there are some times you know I keep thinking about the western mini series from a year or so ago called ...\nYeah and some of those episodes are almost like movie land but the but there was enough content to them and the pace with such the pace here I just wanted to be kind of plotting I'm from episode episode although there are a ... and I'm a big fan of haunted house um storytelling so I I Am I'm the target audience for this but I'll tell you what I just got kind of like\nA tire by the middle and when I saw how long the fifth episode was I said I just have to pause I'll come back to it later I ever have time but if I could just annoys me that they feel like it could just get away with anything cause or Netflix\nLast year I Want to ask you about I don't even know if we've talked about this before and I don't know if you consider it like a in this horror genre or what you would consider it but black mirror for people who I haven't seen that I I mean a lot of people talk about it it's a big hit on social media\nIs this show that good\nOh it's really really good yeah [noise] it began in England before Netflix ever picked it up and the early seasons are also really strong and then the Netflix seasons which have a bit more of an American tone but there are still some British elements to it still produced by British folks\nIt's kinda like the British twilight zone episode like twilight zone in the age of technology and twilight zone is like one of my all time favorite series in any kind of an anthology that can tell very inventive\nStories that are self contained and a few of them go on really long to but for the most part the episodes are really tight and their\nTheir Erie and their twisted and some of them are just absolutely almost um you know metaphysical in terms of just how interesting they are about are really man's relationship with a machine or how it sort of affects our life it's really provocative and usually most of the episodes there's a really strong and it is just a proven to be\nUm a it's a phenomenon for good reason but that one you know some of them are scary too so I mean it is it is like twilight zone sometimes they're scary sometimes they're just like\nYou know like oh here who are the twist endings at the end or something like that so I highly recommend black mirror I'm sure there's a new season in production but the ones that they filmed for Netflix and of course they have the early seasons as well because you know everything's a library\nYeah for the library of Netflix thing doing exactly\nBut yeah I definitely recommend that and if you haven't watched it maybe that's something you do for Halloween I don't know that'd be good for me\nYeah I've got a lot to why you've given me a lot to think about and a lot to watch it's tough on the weekends now with football in full gear I lose a little bit of that binge watching\nTime that I had been a a using over the past couple of months so a black mirror though it sounds like that one and God list I have to get to that one I definitely want to watch them there is

B. S. that's a Mohammad bin ... he's the crown prince\nThat his goon squad and we even have names and faces attached to him and his top level security that flew in\nAh folks I don't think trust me it's a much better bet than these losing mega millions tickets that I have right here\nMuch better bet that the Saudis rubbed out ...\nAnd not even fathom may not even having a clue that it would explode into this international come full of grace in this incident of humongous proportions\nIn which of the world is horrified and what appears to be an official state sanctioned hit\nA nasty when you hear the details and we've been talking about this for a couple of days but my question to you is\nFor radio and TV viewers and listeners the question is what should the Trump Administration do if it is absolutely proved that our ally Saudi Arabia\nMurdered assassinated completely Rob without a U.S resident not a citizen but a resident alien or a permanent residents of the United states what should the Trump Administration do\nA eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine that's the nation wide number and as I told you yesterday I told her just a five minutes ago that cause show these kids are American his kids are U.

or hearing was going down before Kavanaugh's show strength and every time Trump shows during the game you gains momentum and we spend the military down there as a message and the military treats

makes you stronger\nIt makes the people that support him a digging their heels even even further down and it makes president more comfortable and confident because\nHe's used to being attacked and it

I don't want to talk about it\nJust don't say it they tell her and she says they told me not to say it but I'm gonna keep saying anyway so their agenda is impeachment and lists never ending investigations open borders eliminate ice sanctuary cities now we have a sanctuary state California\nThey want ... why do they want open borders to they calculated that is going to benefit them at the ballot box helping them retain power notice every decision\nAnd every agenda item is about them wanting to hold onto power period it doesn't matter the output or the the what the end result is doesn't matter\nObama wrecked the economy I won't give you the statistics again if you listen to this program regularly I Know you can recite them by rote as well\nThe only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can say they didn't know\nBut that's what they want to take us back to that but they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven by a borderline psychotic hatred of this president\nThey want to go back to what back to Obamacare they want open borders so that they think that their their party will remain in power forever if they get enough people crossing the border caravans of people\nAre going to talk about what the president's planning and it's like that's what they stand for this is what the Democratic Party take back the crumbs he pulled by my care open borders impeach Trump endless investigation\nWhat name one thing they're that they're doing to make your life better because after losing\nThirteen million Americans and and having them have to go through food stamps to survive and sustain themselves in eight years of a failed do Tommy of Obama the only president never to reach three percent GDP Growth in American history\nYou know they want to what we don't want to add more people why 'cause they're dependent on them the crumbs they're handing out the irony of that they're ... what what did the leftovers they have you know when they're done building their gyms their Senate gyms their house Kim's there\nYou know house barber shops there Senate barber shops the Senate dining rooms their house dining rooms or they treat themselves while they're not they're not on Obamacare they got to separate out system just for them very different [noise]\nSo that's what's at stake you know I'm going to tell you something about this border as I watch this care of it you've got to understand this is about national security this is personal security I think I'm the only person in the media that actually\nTook the time over the years and I've been down reporting from the border Thirteen times site antidote you've told us that before\nYeah I bet on horseback yeah Ben and helicopters yeah been out on boats yeah I've been on foot yeah I've been all terrain vehicles I've been on the border all the way from the Rio Grande straight on through San Diego in many stops in between\nI've seen gang members arrested drug warehouse the biggest warehouse I've ever seen in my life\nFloor to ceiling drugs confiscated guess where they were headed to Yorktown your city to your kids that they ingest them and now it's worse than ever because now a lot of the heroin that we have we have an opioid crisis in this country\nIs is one the one issue is oh kids go into grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet\nThey try a bike and then a Percocet anoxic ... and then they go back there got another one next thing you know they're addicted next thing you know they're buying them on the streets God Knows what those pills really are the drug dealers don't give a rip it these kids die\nThen when they find out that can't afford eighty bucks a pill well then some genius idiot friend or deal or friend quote of there's\nThere's while you're trying to heroin and it's much better ... totally ten dollars a bag and they'll start snorting heroin\nOr chasing the dragon as they call it new light it up in smoke it and then eventually you're going to remain lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave and a life of a living hell\nAnd that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the border where it's human trafficking happening right over the border\nWhat's happening all across the border there's a new thing it's called fat and all\nYou know talk to my buddy Eric Bowley his Nineteen year old son ... bought an than\nThat which is you know to relieve anxiety and and and it was laced if you have three grains of fat and all the size of three grain of salt\nIt will kill you and we have nearly a hundred thousand kids dying every single day one death every seven point five minutes\nYou know almost a hundred thousand deaths a year and we keep talking about opioid crisis left and right opioid we can stop it if we secure the border caravans now\nSo I think it's right I think Kavanaugh what do we see what's happening all the total total elimination of anything that we recognize as the U.S constitution\nThe rule of law equal justice under the law equal application of our laws or the presumption of innocence what presumption of innocence I Believe her never heard from a bribe believer you know that no corroborating evidence I still believe her\nYou know but then with no no no but but they were lined up almost on a weekend basis they line up and the whole first they spike the punch bowl and after they spike the punch bowl the boys would line up in the hall every weekend and then they rape the girls in the room they take turns\nAnd it happened almost every weekend and then the story evolved into\nWell I didn't see him spike the punch bowl but I saw a mirror punch bowl and I see I saw him give out a red solo cup that's what that became so and then Dianne Feinstein wants to bring that up again after eight FBI investigations\nWater they offering for you because since Trump spent president you got four million new jobs since Trump's been president four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs jobs that Obama said would never coming back\nSince he's been president we've gotten rid of more regulations that in the last five presidents are combined uh he's opened up the entire energy industry of which we have a flood literally of natural resources those are going to be career paying jobs\nHigh paying jobs for so many millions of Americans\nAre then we've got oh the president the grading ISIS nobody thought little rocket man would stop shooting is rockets\nNobody thought that you know being tough on the Iranians

worse before it gets better 'cause I think we're going to keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a new ... street violence\nA which in the end I think turns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because this is Steve college proved when he was shot um\nYou know if you're conservative when you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is it's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watch the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of\nVideotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of the conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a I it everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as attention his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think well I think he is the four o\nCycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and is often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society with so many good\nSolid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments oh and that that's just a huge advantage and they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to Goldwater or fifty four year movement\nUm but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with them and in the end I think are just further isolates from\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna teach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax
