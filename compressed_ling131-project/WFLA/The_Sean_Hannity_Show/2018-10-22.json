know Republican bad let's go after them throw the book it that much no due process for them no presumption of innocence for them and then you've got a case in allegation made about Cory Booker now over the weekend on top of statements that his own words that he had made some years ago when he was Fifteen\nOr apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of meat to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere I'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope\nUm and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this have you on a prediction it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida you'll do a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida's important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got it for whatever reason the media's fall in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida and in Iran to set this about a great debate last night and he's now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax the Gillum would support\nThe elements use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views\nIs trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected by being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe in what they really want to fight for\nWe saw that with Brett is it in the project birds as tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa season to fight for his life down in Florida\nWe got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but you know for whatever reason bred as it is out there trying to convince the people of Tennessee that is something that he is not that he's\nModerate and a liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position I'm Brett Kavanaugh is\nJust for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri Claire McCaskill you know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony she goes on to an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets hoops to Harvey tour with with wings unbelievable\nBut some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue and just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation\nOughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it isn't in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cos\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not gonna not take care of you we pay the healthcare costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody is against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process\nThat we have sovereignty and we're borders and they deserve to be respected and what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront at the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states\nAre wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry I mean the six hundred

banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing them throwing those out the\nThe door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you\nBut I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare\nTheir fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less\nMillions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory or coverage we have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it so it has not worked out well for the American people\nIt was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy\nTo buy plans they never want needed or desired\nAnd forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled or Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer's dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or a evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's gonna happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate\nHave faded in the final weeks of the twenty eight to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen competitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half hour we're going to we're going to take control the house in the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away it looks like it's going to be Republican pickup Martha ... going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha mix Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison so that we have a top Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about quote the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions amid fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom ... is still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi\nWho has her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami look I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is\nWinning everything is possible I can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black or ... Marshall mixed Martha ... Sally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller hold this seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly a problem for the Republican Braun in the state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian in the race\nAnd that means that the libertarian siphoning votes away from the Republican Ron Mike Braun is now claiming that you know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now has him leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this an app to all of this this is an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is that an all time high but\nYou know crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost Democratic Senate candidates according to the a P

this weekend and\nAnd doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and then we had four thousand people around there a moment at a huge crowd in Houston as well we're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie
