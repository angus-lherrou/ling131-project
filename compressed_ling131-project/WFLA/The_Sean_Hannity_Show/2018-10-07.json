I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed to speak to you again a great to have your back it\nIt can be out again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into abnormal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them who are coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know we had to draw on CNN while they are a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped her because he asked her for her phone number\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nTo get away ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman\nI Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine McCann and this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist\nBut it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her she made all literally believe\nThat men don't have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her that's my point she may really believe it\nGoes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about living rates are also the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um [noise] uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the white hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine [noise]\nHooked on it if not better ride by the way here's this you're also right of it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it the me too movement supposedly include all women women on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will it's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media\nOr making I think every time you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just get written permission for every move you might get it notarized after the dates\n[laughter] and you're listening to Rush Limbaugh big voice on the right time but he I read Mitt for\nYour listening\nSimply say there's another one of our great success stories fantastic protection simply safe system is easy to use it takes just minutes to set up\nAnd they're no contracts you know hitting the twenty four seven monitoring only fourteen Ninety nine a month visits simply safe usa dot com to order your is simply snakes system now my listeners get ten percent off just go to simply safe usa dot com\nFor ten percent off simply safe U. S. S. dot com\nHi Michele I'm often hear one of the biggest outrageous I reported on the trial of abortion doctor Kermit cause now now the woman goes into a clinic comes down and there's no police report and I helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions not affect abortion [noise] because now movie opens October twelfth amazing ... perhaps\nBy Dianne Feinstein this woman Debra cats for professional board member she was actually recommending Deborah cats while she was meeting privately with Brett Kavanaugh but not telling Brett Kavanaugh about any of these allegations whatsoever member that\nAnyway well Deborah Katz is the one that well she didn't really believe Paula Jones and she did take Al Franken side\nAnd you know it is [noise] you know you just got to watch this\nIt there's no end to this now they are not going to stop until they get a no vote on Brecht capital that's just this this should not surprise anybody and Jeff Flake is now in Massachusetts today trying to run for president thinking he's going to which by the way the way to do it you don't like Trump go beat him\nIn thirty six days Democrats they'll make their case\nAnd they're going to ask you to give the house of representatives to Nancy Pelosi and the Senate Democrats to Chuck Schumer if that's what you want on election night in thirty six days and you want to turn on the TV and find out the results it'd be a stay home well you'll get the government you deserve we always do\nYou want all progress that we have now\nAchieved in two years to stop that will happen too but all the senators saying well\nNo no no we got to limit the scope it it's got to be very quick expeditious and just have the FBI do this that's not what they ever intended they want this to drag on through the mid term elections in the hope that Donald Trump doesn't get to make is Supreme Court nomination\nAnyway joining us now is Carrie Severino she's the chief counsel policy director\nFor the Judicial Crisis network a welcome back to the program as well as predicted the bar has shifted and now the Democrats won an extensive FBI investigation but from my standpoint as it relates to professor Ford there's really only for people that need to be interviewed and I would assume by now all four of them probably work\nI'm sure they were it was in either find people because they already had been interviewed by the Senate Judiciary committee like the the the goalposts are moving faster than the speed of ...\nLight here it's it's very difficult to that to believe that any of these people um\nIt it can take themselves seriously they said\nIt's going to be four days a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she said that every Democrat that now they're going up but Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI they're actually going to be this horrible part is an organization you know it it it it\nIs and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's lifelong reputation here on the line\nTo hear your mind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on there is someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse to discount discount them because they disagree with them anyway\nAnd he is someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective\nOn that that judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge\nThe Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they fought to fourteen different times they found out they vindicate his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to be watching this\nWith the same knee jerk or part is in response is I Hope that that that we're seeing some\nHat but but it up you know the parents to draw to reputation now\nIf you read James ... New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's pack it in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her\nUm but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people in quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other towns and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but that would be I ages no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized I could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyers submitted statement on your habit very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them then there's what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because\nMy FBI friends\nMy friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI don't love the upper brass on the call me in the cave and struck and page but\nThe FBI is is ... ... people I Know the fault of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn\nGeneral Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them\nAnd you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says if you look hit companies coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and this is just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate as their with their debts get it it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not\nThey've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies of what the FBI guys to say that they somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the St Louis to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to\nThey're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same state 'cause the FBI can't as a as\nA cat person to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same exact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new here that there there's my prediction\nTurned it around the IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on against the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate her story and then saying that Mrs Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cab and all was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking other ... she's telling other people she doesn't know what are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer with telling people\nShe's not even sure it with him she said well how did he was in the room [laughter] I'm positive he adjusted his hands whatever that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain it hit as him so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or could they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I mean ... even counted as a credible allegations of the you know what\nFor the FBI could talk to her\nThey'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly going to hold on wins and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and maybe we'll get those thrilled to have been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele and and what was said and those conversations\nAre Carrie

fall state in the first and then just so much fake uh evidence everywhere\nListen she she identified and there's a there's a part of me that really sympathizes with this is such a serious issue and and I don't think we give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled us including the president they handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves\nShe gave the names of four people and none of the fork in corroborate her story including the guy that was supposed to be an eye witness to it at that point\nThey were really you can't go any further with it and he adamantly denies it so it's um it's a matter of just simple okay if somebody corroborated it we'd be in a very different position today I got to take a quick break final have power\nFree for all our Sean

those swamp Washington DC toll free our telephone number is eight hundred nine four one showing up you want to be a part of the program a obviously a lot happening here this week thirty six days until the all important midterm elections\nAre my friend and colleague from the Fox news channel is with those Tucker Carlson got a brand new book out by the way it's called ship a fool's how selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution\nUm are we really getting to the brink of a revolution in this sense I mean look it's only happened three times in the last hundred years where a party wins the White House power in the White House and they don't have losses in the next midterm election year the last time was right after nine eleven two thousand and one George Bush was president\nUm but I got to imagine people are pretty pissed off at the\nAt what's you know it was two weeks ago yesterday and nobody had heard one bad thing about Brecht capital until two weeks ago yesterday and look where we are getting Tucker welcome to the show\nThanks Sean well yeah I mean look\nCap now is being destroyed not because if anything he did or didn't do that because he's in the way of the Democrats retaining power I mean it's not personal\nIt's just the party wants with he's about to get and so they're crushing him and his family in order to get it\nAre we moving to revolution while I don't know look at the people in charge look at the Congress look at our media they're pushing conflict in division on us they're pushing racial division endlessly\nThey're pushing gender division they're claiming that the cap not soccer is a reason that women should have men and vice versa yeah I mean they're pushing this unity because this unified country it's easier for them to control that divide and conquer it's my oldest strategy there it\nWell you don't look I I've I've chronicled this historically over the course of my career and that is it's pretty predictable every two and four years every election cycle Republicans racist sexist I won't give the whole list but exactly they want to throw granting over the cliff and now with Supreme Court justices\nOr if they have an opening there seems to be no\nThere it's there there's nothing they won't say or do now I mean you have friends of the attorney for professor cats you know Dianne Feinstein recommended who herself was pretty radical left now soliciting people\nFrom the Georgetown Prep community whatever that is and asking if if they have information or they want to come forward their soliciting people\nAnd the FBI now is being told by Democrats well it's got to be white in scope and it's got to go on for as long as need be which is the opposite of the so called agreement between a senator Coons and not enough in honor of ... like last week\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they fall for this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to\nDebate the details of this or that case when actually there's nothing to do with the details with justice itself this is a tactic designed to hold on to power when\nRon ... is an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the census is going to be a race to watch this has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some use some harmless phrased next thing you know the lead of every show Ron to San Francisco racist unit was going to happen because it had to have\nWhy did Trump got elected ... who didn't get a black crow up what actually happened and what actually happened was the people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions\nAbout our culture our economy our foreign policy they never said sorry and they never learn anything and so ... got mad at punish them and good for them but why would so that's I that's what I think my job is is to explain what ... me and I think you know maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right now\nI think in the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it I don't it like for example there'll be days on his radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that have opinions\nAnd that's what it it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism it's part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway talk\nA little bit weird that all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed to silence why\nNot you know what I mean there are less than nine Tucker there's yeah I Know a handful of us Tucker there's not that many\nAnd by the way it is a orchestrated effort and millions of dollars being spent to shut down any anybody that dares\nTo not hold that prevailing left wing view but anyway we're putting it up on Hannity or on the website
