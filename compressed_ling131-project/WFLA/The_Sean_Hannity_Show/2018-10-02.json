I mean are you getting the same uh a vibe that I Am are you getting the same um you know suggestion I say you know again in\nHigh school we you know I tell you what I happen to know some of the United states senators I\nWho is on the other side\nSo I happened to him so he's talking about generally knowing United States senators and then a particularly one that's on the other side so is that Senate Judiciary is that the claim\nWho's pretty aggressive\nPretty aggressive [noise] I've seen that person in very bad situation I so Trump is suggesting that there is a Democrat\nSenator on the other side who is in very bad condition that or or has been a ... at some point so again I I like to know is that Senate Judiciary a\nMaterial here is a is it as a Democrat on the on the other side or is it just a a Democrat that's in the U.S Senate that's what\nWe don't know I I assume that I Know bad news bears assume they'll make you don't assume you make an asset a human being in that stuck with me since I was a lot like nine or ten or eleven years old a ... but I mean that's that's the way that I took it\nThat it so I'm looking at the list here this is fun it's like ... like delightful [laughter]\nDianne Feinstein is the ranking member from California\nPatrick Leahy from Vermont Dick Durban from Illinois Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island you have a mea culpa shore from Minnesota you've got Chris Coons from Delaware and he was the uh um the broker or die with with a\nJeff Flake to to work out this FBI deal\nRichard Blumenthal from Connecticut and you know again don't don't get me started on Richard Blumenthal I as I mentioned last week during this ah this unprecedented well I mentioned the during the the normal Kavanaugh hearings I mentioned that\nThat Blumenthal from Connecticut has some breaking nerve\nActing all high and mighty and he's the moral authority and oh his his highest nature is on match I mean here's the question the cabin on about anything to do with morality is a laugh and I brought this up\nLast uh was when the when the when the initial hearings happened you know the three days or so the initial hearings that I Can't take Richard Blumenthal a former attorney general in Connecticut now US Senator who can\nI Can't think of the guys seriously because he flat out blatantly lied for years about his Vietnam service\nAnd the fact is that he talked about his time in Vietnam and come back and he was he was not in Vietnam in combat so this guy the people of Connecticut put a lawyer I mean a stolen valor a story essentially put this guy in the U.S Senate\nA ... from Connecticut I mean if it's just it's unfathomable to me\nAnd then again I brought Blumenthal back up\nUh last week on Thursday when we have this uh this new round of a you know special questioning with a Ford and Ann Cavanaugh and again Richard Blumenthal in his his high and mighty ah Mr pious\nAnd I I I Can't take seriously I mean the people of Connecticut how the hell can you take Blumenthal serious one and then Trump tweeted about this over the weekend\nI think it was yesterday I think it was on was a Saturday Night or Sunday Morning I saw a tweet from President Trump where do you call that a Blumenthal eyes so we're we're still trying to figure out who\nIs the booze or Trump suggesting that there are some other it's pretty bad shape\nA Democrat on the other side was referring to the Senate Judiciary committee or or is it just the general democratic senator\nOr outside of the committee so we have Mazie Hirono from Hawaii Cory Booker from New Jersey and a camel or Harris from California and so those are the current members\nOf the Senate Judiciary committee to ten members on the Democratic side so [noise]\n\nOrange Trump sending amount of wild goose

allegations are made by\nI well you've got Dr Christine a lousy forward and of course this is Deborah Ramirez you know if there's nothing there to incriminate calving off then of course the Democrats are going to be fully exposed for the partisan hacks that we know that\nThey are and as we said last week the Democrats were weaponize ing Dr Ford because from the very beginning and listen if I've got time I can go back and and read you the Barney Frank a press release you know Barney Frank from um um\nOh not far what Barney Frank I'm Bernice [laughter] hey Barney\nCan I get you to weigh in on this point I'd like to see body fried way on this a Bernie [laughter] that's a Good Friday and flip a a Bernie Sanders I ... I can reduce the Bernie Sanders press release from I think it's July nine for ... I actually printed out\nBut I Want to get it to some other areas first and again it you know Bernie Sanders from the very beginning here we're talking July night talks about stopping cabinet without anything without any of these details so this has been job one\nFrom the beginning to stop the cameras on nomination and then of course all of these allegations come out and it does smell it's time for me it does not such a a pass the smell test here so I can get into that a little bit later on\nBut we know that a doctor for has been weaponized or you know and then we have given the sweat neck who hires ... an attorney or as I said last week yeah\nThat's a way to be taken seriously if you have a real a legal claim area hire the porn star attorney that's the way to\nTo really be taken seriously by by the country and and and by a Congress because it doesn't even appears at the FBI is even get to talk\nTo this a sweat Nick at this point but what we all know what the Democrats have done here there there's this was all for their political road block\nAll for their game they don't care you know they they put on this touchy feely a presentation this phony oh we care so much about Dr Ford no they don't\nThey care it is such a charade it is such a an acting job it's such a theater they\nJust care about stopping terminal and build utilize and they'll screw over whoever they have to to get to that and that's exactly what's going on here you know let's remember why why did Chuck Grassley and Mitch McConnell\nAnd the president ... why do they all agree essentially um for this background check\nYou know Chuck Grassley Mitch McConnell the president signed off on this extended FBI background check in the first place and of course uh as I discuss the ad nauseam at this point and a lot of people disagree with me and it's like 'cause I took a lot of calls on this on Fridays program\nFolks with out the agreement\nOr it was so it's Thursday and friday with without the agreement that uh or actually was friday it was friday because of the uh the vote a\nAnd we spent a lot of time on this on friday and I said with out this confession\nThat Kavanaugh would be toast and I I I got into an argument with a couple of callers because it just comes down to the mathematics that with out vis\nFBI investigation is if you want to call it a concession without this cabin all would have been toes so I had a couple of people call the show the guy she met your caving in you're giving in they just need to have a vote\nWhat part of yeah OK ramming bulldozer vote you're not going to have enough votes in the full Senate well first of all flake probably without this compromise for the week long FBI investigation flights\n... her Kavanaugh destroy your family they don't care that's lateral that's collateral damage that they think is part of the process here\nBut you know it's very difficult for a woman or a man I'm at some understand how how people can do this to other people were human beings I have this is why some horrible can happen to that man\nAnd his mouth during a you're correct\nThat you're right you're starting to get it they don't care\nIt doesn't matter who they have to destroy who they have to step over it doesn't matter what kind of\nA you know a skit march you leave on his face his family his wife is kids it doesn't matter whether Kavanaugh will ever be able to coach girls basketball again if they don't care whether he'll ever be able to teach again\nTeach law as well [noise]\nThey don't care it's all about I mean the Bernie Sanders is sums it up\nThey at all costs they will stop they will mobilize and do whatever they can and we've witnessed is we've seen what has been ruled out here to stop Kavanaugh thanks for the call and I have

Fox News President Trump standing by Supreme Court pay rent cabin on as the FBI investigate allegations of sexual assault against him Democrats\nAnd that I said last week the trust me Christopher Wray is going to be\nPersonally on top of this with his top deputies of the FBI to get this thing going and I don't think it's going to be a sham it's not going to be a half assed investigation they've gotten resources to get a lot done in a week would it be nicer to have more than a week of course but the Democrats agreed to await let's do a week\nTo see what they uncovered and certainly they have the resources they have the the ... the the field agents to conduct these investigations this is what they do\nAnd I don't think for a moment for Democrats that are complaining or those that don't like Trump don't like this administration suggesting that this is going to be just a a sham\nOf an investigation and it's just going to be a a a quick little sign off and it's going to be cursory I don't think the Christopher raised you know allow that his integrity issues would dictate that\nAnd the fact that people speak very highly of Christopher Wray and that it doesn't matter that he's a you know installed by Trump the fact that he would not allow his name to beat soil or be smart if this investigation was shown to be just cursory superficial and\nSham like so I don't think that's going to happen there's going to be no sham wow here okay no sample out\nAnd with that we do have at will grab some calls here in a moment eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine if you want to get in here on ships get on and let's talk eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine is how you get on this program\nRight now simple as that so then then we have the breaking news from earlier today\n[noise] that and I would I I I have the the print out here from various sources that the Trump Administration has given the FBI so essentially told the director re\nThat the Trump Administration according to reports is letting the FBI expand the Kavanaugh probe\nAnd Trump said as much\nA ... during the press today Trump said hey listen let the FBI go where they want to go\nI don't think there's any behind the scenes wink and a nod no I don't think Christopher Wray would want any part of that or be any part of that or allow his agency to be manipulated\nIn that fashion so the indications here are that President Trump\nAnd the White House is saying as much now the last couple of hours that they are allowing and authorizing the FBI to expand\nThe Kavanaugh investigation a witch means interviewing more people now I Know the Democrats so ... what is the number twenty four what does this worn out from earlier today that the Democrats\nAre handed over about twenty four yeah I just wanted to compromise is that ... that that the Democrats wanted a and they handed over a list of twenty four individuals they want the FBI to investigate\nAnd of course by tomorrow or you can add a hundred to that I'm sure if the Democrats are going to want a hundred and twenty four advanced and then the next day it'll be two twenty four because it does it a scape me\nI Know the school or I get it I Know that the Democrats are trying to just delayed the late ... run out the clock hopefully when the mid term elections in the house but more importantly the Senate since this is you know a confirmation as under the Senate purview obviously and they would love to stop Trump dead in his tracks\nThe house I'm scared of the house couldn't go Democrat and that that the oh my God but the Senate if that's a tougher climate\nBut it's not out of the question\nAnd then you want to talk about just nasty despicable payback against Trump or it it would be it would be on but it'd be like nothing we've ever seen where a president in power and his party or not faring well in the midterms are not historically it's happened as we know\nBought a if this happened now oh Mike ... it's going to be [noise] whenever you think it is exponentially Jack it up by a hundred\nBy grabbing calls here in a second but just the expanding on this or expanded Kavanaugh parole that the Trump Administration has told the FBI have added investigate whoever and whatever you want\nThe agreement was get it done in a week and of course we know what's going to happen to the Democrats are going to start belly aching or any time now oh we started off with the two weeks off with a three let's get it done in a week a lot can be done\nIn a week so the New York times earlier today reported that the Trump Administration is going to allow the FBI to go where they want to go investigate and interview who they want to they think is necessary\nIn order to him is timeframe investigates and the allegations against capital and\nWe do with the White House I agree the concessions well the White House then on friday 'cause the investigations supposed to be wrapped up by friday will the White House then on friday say okay we're going to give the FBI another week or maybe three or four days it'll it has to be concluded by Tuesday or Wednesday is that a possibility\nWell and the fact that the White House and the New York times is reporting that the White House has agreed to let the FBI go where they want to go\nAnd that Trump signed off on this I mean that shows All right either concessions\nSo yeah it ... will they conceded allow a little more time with the FBI at the end of the week\nWho knows a you know you don't McConnell is saying there's going to be a vote this week\nSo

every case there's no ... operation at all\nNone and and multiple changes in stories at least two of the three cases\nAnd yet this this goes on and this lander and the\nI mean I just described the story about what Julie sweat Nick was claiming and now she has backtracked I don't even know why NBC whatever run an interview like this but they did run it\nEven saying that while she gave U.S foreign names to investigate one's dead and the other one has no idea who she is and the other two people never got back to us so they can't corroborate any of this but they say they can and the

back or famously saying you know how does this go off a civil discourse in this country\n... ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump hers and\nAre these questions and then the entire democratic leftist apparatus had the audacity to make all these charges in slander and and destroy a Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd had the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand that independence cell and that his dealings with passion indicate\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court ... hair is righteous indignation is is to our a rant which was totally justifiable than necessary in fact to preserve his position\nRight to they compare that to the twelve years on the bench when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nAbsurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand judicial Deborah I Would hate to have that kind of\nGuy I how was somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapists who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response he's supposed to go there is that the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah Pete in ...\nWho were falsely accused react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did\nAh when you're agreed you sleep wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man\nUh but the most important thing he said was I don't question that ah Christine Blasey Ford was it some time and it some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what is essentially doing is saying she is mistaken for a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nUh individuals or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand\nA but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry is to ignore human emotion\nOver ... ... ... ... and contrast that with his response on the market in the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was very much to restrain and I said to myself and robotic if\nHe doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them and by coaching somebody told him quit holding back\nOr he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said why she was ... she was initially bleed well she was credible\nThey they believe that\nI can in multiples when he testified in he totally indicated itself it was a match or because I think it was thought that it\nBut what ... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up the Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said when Dianne Feinstein did is\nUnfair to everybody in the process and then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions\nYou know I to me there's only one answer and the answers thirty five days from now and that's when\nThe American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida or from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned this family has been bludgeoned and there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give a valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of cabinet but I find it amazing to me\nOr that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in high school and college as alleged\nI doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet that standard in some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement\nSaying that we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit or in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nDo you think of the view which again this statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points and when you think of the seriousness of

two seven five easy Wesley Chappelle's Show do you do for being a brand\nGood afternoon I'm Dana mills our top story at five major problem is I'm Seventy five is shut down in both directions near Fowler after a crash involving a semi let's get right to a page and the traffic Center for the latest thank\nI made that viral load of Lindsey Graham literally just shook the entire hearing as it relates to judge Kavanaugh\nAnd Senator Graham of South Carolina joins us right now he's on the Senate Judiciary committee\nA senator good to talk to you thank you for joining us there's a lot going on Mitch McConnell just earlier said that the FBI report will be finished and we will have a vote on Capitol and uh I assume it's going to happen at some point this week we have any any timetable idea\n... I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware a light Chris but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons she is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about it as drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the ...\nBut I'm really incredible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Jeff voted yes in committee\nWhen the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the\n... or your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants to men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway as senator her own out now is saying she wants in an F. FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we're our so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so a bottom line is that solve bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace\nA Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow them and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped a huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but we're supposed to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh we legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of these states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused on not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly ... he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact most Democrats will know no matter who Donald\nTrump ... they've already against ...\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha makes Sally is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... for its claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning death the Atta checked the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI don't agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you spoken to these red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter]\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary the states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know\nIt's about who would come forward after this debacle is about sending a tone and the standard that will destroy the ... and eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician\nThat he wouldn't let the system get off the hook\nThat if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days thirty five we can I find that extra vote\nThat way we would have a good nominee or have the lights salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here\nI think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nSaid if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of these states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nOh it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a Baptist I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you\nKnow if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh is highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it will change the face of the judiciary forever if we can do on it so it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nOr less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves a ...\n[noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but\nShe identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to re try this case I made a gun and you made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Cabot off\nThey have on them is that this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those audience on radio and TV\nThe every two and four years if you're a Republican or a conservative and you're running for office
