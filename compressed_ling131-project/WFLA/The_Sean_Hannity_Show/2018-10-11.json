F. L. A.\nTo join the conversation going down eight hundred nine six nine nine three times to and you are listening to be in Tampa Bay with Ryan gourmet nine Seventy WFL a\nTicket to look at some of the images coming out of Panama City right now just completely destroyed [noise] [noise]\nI mean we know Mexico beach got wiped out the brunt of it yeah I mean if you see some of the you mentioned there it's like a bomb went off and then all of a sudden water rushed in that that's basically what Mexico beach looks like a the Panama City there's a gym\nThat got completely destroyed I mean I'm looking at the image right now and CNN or the old rule the whole front and back side of the building completely ripped off a here's a um an update on the power outages\nNearly a half a million customers without power across three states so you've got Alabama reporting sixty thousand customers without power Georgia forty two thousand customers and Florida three hundred eighty eight thousand customers\nSo the the power outage numbers continue to go up and up and up they'd probably be worse if areas across the panhandle we're a more populated\nYou know I think the fact that some of those areas are so sparsely populated ah it leads to less people being without power obviously if the storm hit more populated area like the Tampa saint Pete Clearwater area you'd be talking about uh you know millions of people without power next\nYou've got a lot of forest in a marshlands up there and even looking at specifically from about wants town over to uh Pensacola got about a hundred and sixteen thousand people without power Tallahassee still continues to surprise me their numbers keep going up yeah they're up to Ninety six thousand people without power\nThose trees right now so much tree coverage in Tallahassee a you know some of those limbs and some of the entire trees were gonna fall on some of those power lines but the images and and we're just starting to get a an idea now we're just starting to get a picture of what took place throughout the day in the panhandle I think some of the images are going to see tomorrow we're going to be really really\nHeartbreaking as as a drones make their way through certain areas uh and as people start to try to make their way back to their homes and get a sense of the destruction\nOne thing that we didn't want to touch on Wall we have our legal analysts in the studio is this fight over voter registration Democrats here in Florida filed the lawsuit asking\nA court to extend a yesterday's deadline or for voters to register for the November election so so what exactly is going on here\nWell because we had on by Monday when really knew that this storm was really going to\nWhat it was a category two categories where they had to start making preparations that means evacuations had to go in effect emergency of orders went into effect and uh that were issued by the governor\nAnd the various counties so if county buildings accounting office to start a close that includes a surprise ... office you have people that may not have registered to vote yet and we're waiting the storm call them completely off guard they evacuated the area so\nThe night was the cause of stay why cut off so without being factor um this X factor the hurricane storm whatever was going to be what they want us to extend the Democrats want to extend the registration deadline now through the sixteenth as opposed to just denied the governor's office responded yesterday saying that they were going to extend\nIt it was a supervisor so elections in each county depending on when they closed in order to extend it day by day basis so for example the clothes on Monday and are closed or Tuesday\nAnd were able to reopen on you know today or tomorrow then they will get an additional three days or one day depending on how the different areas of the problem is is we we have not seen the extent of the devastation yeah yeah so you're going to have people that may not be able to get back to their counties get back to their homes right who even register to vote is probably not going to be on the top of their mind\nAnd the number of people that are going to be\nA court if they get this far with the case the German and they just decide to extend it be done with it I don't think he wants anymore election related you know issues or you know more wrong issues right hum to following him apparently you know as we've discussed about\nHe's about uh you know fell on voting rights and all these are things that are can become campaign issue is you don't want that\nThis close to the ... for the Senate so he can compromise and say okay I'll agree to do this let's move on we've got other more important things to do that's the best case scenario if the court has to get involved they are going to want numbers they're gonna want to know and look at how many people are potentially affected by this\nAnd this is just for counties that are directly affected from the storm and this this would not be like the Tampa\nArea this is also storm affected counties because if they went under either emerging emergency evacuation orders and they went under state of emergency where the county offices had to close and that that including surprise watch them they would affect those counties but too what effect that but we'll have in terms of the numbers where they can show an actual harm\nTo the people do not know Democrats are\nAmericans registered voters overall that's what they're going to show the corn how they do that is going to be in a ... kitten catastrophe situation of seen as happened with\nYou know smaller storms were you know government building closes for a day\nYou know him was a prosecutor during a Charlie in\nTwo thousand for all that storm season we were out of work in the courthouse was closed for nearly two weeks and so that affected speedy trial date so the Supreme Court remedies that by extending speedy trial how those criminal that's right there's different measures and habits are nine eleven\nUh because all the court had or those in the state of Florida we were under state of emergency so speedy trial was extended by a day until everything went back to normal operation so we see different different degrees but I think in a catastrophic\nEvent like this making a putting a hard number on it is going to be hard for Democrats do under this lawsuit and we don't know the extent of how long it's gonna be you know how finite this is going to be where people can say like well we know what's going to take them ten days do move back into their immigrants\nAre asking for a week but technically might be longer they would need in terms of mineral ranch in depending on the damage and the situation on the ground right\nAnd now we're also rowing in to the point where in the next couple of weeks you'll see the ballots go out and mailed out so you're a see a lot of sliding into scales essentially as a court gets involved they're gonna have to say\nThis is the cut off date you know this is what happened in an active guard force ... recall it in the law and that is going to be the determining factor but if you have you know hundreds of thousands of people that are displaced we don't know the numbers right now we're in the tens of thousands\nBut if they are going back to their homes where they have nothing then you know are they going to go back home or care about boating are registering so really kneeling down that number of people effective voters um or potential voters that's going to be the hard\nPart although just looking at it politically you could have a situation where somebody who's dealing with this storm and is in one of those affected areas maybe they really liked the way Rick Scott are Andrew Gillum handle things and now they want to vote for them or maybe they didn't like how to handle things and now they want to vote for the opponent so you could see it you know having an impact\nOn on the election or in those county\n... we've seen you know we've been monitoring every network most of the entire afternoon now we've seen\nRace Scott and Andrew Gillum out there in you know there are ... you know mayor and governor and they're in charge of emergency operations for the respect of the state for Governor Scott in for Tallahassee for a moment in our dorm so and they've been\nPretty much in line of as far as like they're focused on the ... the date or the storm talk to you know ... a little while ago so that could actually\nYou know affect you run to turn out to the ... yeah yeah exactly and it can make people want to register to vote a afterwards and then they're gonna have to be permitted us for that because of you know for example Gulf county has wiped out them where they go where they were ... reestablish resident that's true in order to register to vote because we're\nWhat what are we oh wow it's a ... so it's a hundred thousand want so that's going to be asking their class seem most likely right so ah\nThe feet or it's a thousand foot tower\nWow it's a a height above average terrain is nine hundred Ninety four feet for uh I I didn't know it was a hundred thousand water\nBut it looks like this tower close to a thousand feet the word is that the tower has fallen which that's a pretty big deal for a thousand foot radio tower and I'm guessing the tower probably belonged\nTo a a tower company I don't know if there's a TV station a lot of times with these big broadcast towers you'll have\nA local affiliates for a TV stations or ABC NBC CBS Fox or sometimes there'll be all these towers and you'll have a couple of radio stations sometimes there is to a radio there cellular communications so we're waiting to find some more information if by any chance a we have any of\nOur Florida\nPanhandle listeners that are able to still have a a TV signal and you're watching on Newsmax right now or if you're listening to my show streaming over the various apps\nAre which are all the waste electrons to the ... radio show or up on my Web site at ... dot com\nS. C. H. N. I. T. T. S. H. O. W. dot com you know the pod cast the live streaming all the ways to do that if we have anyone listening in the Florida Panhandle\nUh or anyone affected by this storm right now we'd love to grab your phone calls the eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine and a nationwide number eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine is how you get on a sue I Know we have a message\nFrom a listener or Ralph Ralph is not far from Panama City beach or if it we we have Ralph's number if you can try to get Ralph on the phone sue\nAnd then again anybody that's listening or watching a give us a buzz if you're in the Florida Panhandle you still have electricity or TV service\nOr you could be still listening to me screaming on radio or maybe TV I Would love to get some I Witness reports or some of those are the or or maybe you've got a\nRelatives who've contacted you you know my ... and the phone line is eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine I Know it might be a little tough to get the phone calls right now are from those in the middle of this path\nBut folks ah this\nThis storm hit the ... to the best we can tell here in according to the meteorologists a hurricane Michael hit\nOr close to Mexico beach so if you look at the map Mexico beach you've got Panama City and then just a to the uh kind of south east as the coast that bans in terms of their uh their is Mexico beach so as far as you're looking for a you know the best\nA geographical location even though this thing is huge ah as far as the best geographic location\nOr Mexico beach which uh again you've got Panama City beach you got Lynn have and you know you you you keep moving\nA little a little bit south east\nAnd you know you ain't got port saint Joe you got Appalachian cola\nAnd Mexico beach is in between Hindu air force base\nAnd port saint Joe and the word is is that where this uh landfall if you're gonna pick a spot Mexico beach between Kindle air force base which is you know just uh to the southeast of Panama City beach and in between the port saint Joe let me grab Morales\nAnd again if you're in the area where every you're listening along the Florida coast the Gulf Coast the panhandle area\nOr any reports you can give us on a hurricane Michael eight hundred\nEight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine is how you get on eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine Ralph is in Freeport, Florida or Ralph welcome to Schmidt how're you doing over there\nRight now you're breaking up really bad but uh oh hold on a pretty good on about thirty miles to the west of animosity beach no air force base or we're getting a lot of wind light rain\nOr they're expecting the heaviest stuff to come in and about the next hour hour and a half\nWell you're going to see these bans the bans just coral intern and you'll get laws you'll get you know these big wind gusts any damage to you know I'm looking at the map so I I Know where you are in the in Freeport, Florida\nAre you are not right on the coast or you're not on the Gulf but you've got a ... once the there's an inland than what is that the ah what what day is that is that uh\nThat's the that's the Chuck patchy\nOkay so you're you're on the bay there how far off the bay are you is your home\nAbout three blocks or\nWhat about water incursion what's the storm surge like ...\nWhere my when my daughter lives that she's got a some water and and are lower level about a foot in the house she's on the water\nSo she's right on the water in in Freeport or she is she more at a seaside or Miramar beach where where is she now\nKnows in Freeport\nAlso she's in Freeport so she's actually on the bay and she's got a foot of water in her house\nYes [noise]\nWho else do you know I mean were you were you technically or was she in an evacuation zone and did not evacuate what was\nI told her to get out I haven't told her to get out and they did how old's your daughter and my son in law how old's your daughter she's twenty eight or any kids ... yes I guess your grandchildren\nUh-huh how old are the kids 'cause obviously concerned about the kids\nOh yah yah yah sixteen and and\nUh and they decided to stay did a lot of their neighbors evacuate\nThat's while the neighbors evacuated\nSo why do they decide to say that\nBecause you know I I Can't get into that with him but yeah it's just not\nAs so it's it's your son is now so I so it's your son in law that says we're not going anywhere we're staying\nRight\nNow that's a shame and I don't know if there was any domestic issue or a fight between your daughter and your son in law\nBut you know I don't what what authorities say you know get out if you're in and out accusations zone you get out because what happens is uh in the event of an emergency with a you know falling trees or a storm surge you know in the midst of the event\nThere's gonna be no first responder available they're not putting that last fire rescue police they're not putting their assets on the road in the middle of the storm so you're on your own\nI Know I was a volunteer firefighter here for twenty five years and then uh I work for the county EMS or six feet\nIt's got to be a tough that your your daughter and grandchildren they they ... they wouldn't evacuate\nAh you know also I don't know Ralph if they were expecting the category too 'cause well look how this thing is progress you know it was a category two they thought it was going to be three\nAnd here we are landfall was made just two miles per hour sustained wind wise short of a category five what we're talking about strong category for\nThat I hit the Mexico beach area\nRight and they're talking about there might even up at four or five wants all the damage assessments done\n[noise] uh that's true I hearing the exact same thing Ralph thanks for the phone call I appreciate your checking in with us and I hope that you're in a lot of other outlets all the time and I'm hearing that Ninety four point for you to listen to Ninety four point five I added Panama City we're hearing there off the air that the tower fell oh yeah\nOh yeah they are all the radio and TV stations out of animosity or or off the air\nSo ever so every as you go up and down the am and FM dial just all the stations are off the air\nYes everything is ... that is incredible and then\nNow I'll be getting it from uh Pensacola or ... beach area\nWow so even all the local TV stations all the uh all the all I don't know do you use an off the air single or to use cable or satellite\nI use cable and uh we lost channels that and then the channel Thirteen which is ABC about the time it made landfall\nAnd so I Wonder I yeah 'cause those are still even if the power goes down the TV stations are able to transmit to the cable companies because typically you know then I take it off later there's a there's a direct fiber signaled that goes to the cable company for the local channels so that's interesting that they're all off it dealt with your cable hello up\nThere I just checked I just checked one now your producer called me on the air and channel seven which is a the NBC affiliate yup uh they were they're losing their roof and Panama City and they were saying that they were getting some water in fact the station that followed him on Twitter\nWild so they must have evacuated so they're probably totally shut down off the air if you're losing your roof and water is entering the TV station that was far as your cable service are you getting other cable channels still is your

Dennis uh we're hearing my my show my radio show or is heard on a affiliates nationwide one of my affiliates is in Panama City or Ninety four point five FM and we have heard that they're thousand foot tower\nWas toppled a thousand foot radio tower has come down and we're also hearing that most of the I Am and FM stations in Panama City or off the air right now that will not surprised\nIt's me remember and Hurricane Andrew came across South Florida back in Ninety two how many uh television or radio towers came down and those kind of wins that and Andrew was one fifty five one sixty one sixty five so you're in that neighborhood so I I'm not surprised that the towers would have come down\nA dentist what are you hearing as far as from people on the ground or what a huge gathering information was on the amount of damage that has occurred so far\nWe haven't had anything on that other than what we're seeing on television right now our focus continues to be not where the storms are already gone but where it's going this is still a category for hurricane which is going to be leaving the Florida Panhandle and going into south western Georgia south western Georgia southern Georgia is going to get a hurricane\nA full blown hurricane uh with all the impacts about wind and rain a going with it\nA dentist what area are we talking about dust ah we're talking about what what areas in southern Georgia you to get nailed\nWeren't talking to south western corner of Georgia that will be ... we're talking ah going up towards kept then we're making a God figure they're all in the path of the storm and I'm going to South Carolina probably right on top of Columbia tomorrow\nNow do you expect it to weaken to a category three uh two at at what timeframe you know right now we're ... we're still a category for when does that weekend and will it will it quickly we can\nAnd will spend down but they're remember the storm is so strong it's going to take a while for the winds to spend down so this'll be a good one are good too easily going into Georgia could still be a free uh and we expected to be a hurricane tracking all across Georgia and down to a tropical storm strength as it gets into South Carolina tomorrow\nI saw a dentist I Know we've got a role here but uh I Would imagine that a hurricane of this nature a category to potentially hitting a well inland in southern or south western Georgia have they ever seen that before\nA in ... we're going back to the records or which go back to Eighteen fifty won the Florida Panhandle has never had a category for hurricane hit them never sent Eighteen fifty one so I'd have to go back and see if southern Georgia has ever had anything that powerful I doubt it but I I Can't be sure\nUp right at landfall\nA couple

program\nHow you doing man just started going at all I Want to\nPreface says Oh thanks Burt phone engineer or living key Largo I'm a contractor\nI went through Hurricane Andrew several years ago which was a category ... storm right\nIn our cat I've actually it was a category ... that was one of the bar owners Nineteen Ninety two west\nOf ... which was ground zero or\nAnybody that stays in one of the things I mean we build up pretty significantly down here to accommodate the the when that we get we we're we're we're very frequented by by her ... um unfortunately nobody else in the country builds the way we do\nUm we use all concrete walls a matter of fact that's how I built was the concrete group as well\nI'm In I feel badly for anybody that would have stayed in this area I Know they're going through right now I've seen it\nA witness it myself this is a bad storm\nAnybody there's been a what a what brain building or art or for God's sake to a trailer\nBut they're done with this thing is the pet store\nYeah the only thing that we can hope for now is that uh most importantly that the loss of life is Neal or minimal or hopefully none\nBut with a category for a strong learned that almost a category five uh luckily hitting a little less of a populated area but again the breath the width of this storm is so large I'm\nJust hoping that the injury or death toll is extremely low but I I understand what you say about structures you know as a Florida resident myself you know I've been in Florida since Nineteen Ninety two\nAnd I built a ground up house beginning in two thousand three it took us a little over two years to build the house but I built a house or all concrete and steel I even poured a a second floor I've got a four inch ah you know porn deck\nA ... commercial construction on my house and I put in all Miami Dade hurricane windows the weakest point is you know do the weakest is the roof and that's always you know my concern is uh the roof\nI agree with you um\nAnd the way we are way we handle it down here is that we're we're built to um they cheat a hundred and Seventy or Maulana about\nOur wind shear with whatever we built here in South Florida I'm In um the way we do that with the U.S Rupert is um is that we we use Sanibel strapped everywhere and and obviously the trust us or beat up\nTo assess all the damage but the video and there's still shots the images that are coming in\nA lot of debris a roofing a roofing materials just seeing plywood and two by fours and and a looming aluminum garnering all over the place and again a lots of materials and debris\nIn the water and we're seeing some of the some of the uh as far as the storm surge and again some of the purchase of nine to Thirteen feet or in some of the images I'm seeing every bit of that because we're seeing water\nOr up to the rules of houses water up I mean extreme severe flooding with this storm surge in Mexico beach or Florida\nOr so again I I'm just hoping that we're not going to be dealing with the heavy death toll the damage toll is going to be high folks\nI'm just hoping that again the storm surge is a killer it will drown you water is like a wall of concrete coming at you and an amazing speed and people saying oh I'll I'll be a folks water will hit you like a ton of bricks listen\nFolks know it'll flash flooding I mean you know unless they're out in ah for instance of those that are out in the desert or the desert southwest you know those that are you are listening in Las Vegas right now when you when you hit outside of Vegas you know you you guys have seen even in Vegas ... some years ago the flash flooding that occurred there\nAnd the cars being swept off the roads and as you drive through the desert areas you'll you'll see some of the run all the areas where you have the flood zones you'll see the flood warnings and you'll see you know where where water can come in from the hills and and just completely annihilate\nAnd that's always a dangerous I think folks are hopefully have grass on the dangers of water now the other big story today is is Wall Street getting hammered\nOr the Dow fell even more uh we shot a our number one down about two minutes before the top of the hour or we are left with about a minute\nAnd a half left in the trading day\nOn Wall street and uh the numbers folks are they ain't pretty awful day on Wall street folks of the total is that we have s impede down Ninety five points\nThe Dow Jones industrial average down eight hundred and thirty one points\nAnd the NASDAQ down a looks like it's going to settle on two Seventy nine I'm Sorry three Fifteen so I I doubt down eight thirty one the\nNASDAQ down three Fifteen and the S. and P. down Ninety four point six these six almost\nNinety five so awful day on Wall street and and what caused that storm well that's a pretty much you know tech stocks getting hammered the fears of rising interest rates\nAnd uh we're essentially in a decline now this is the biggest decline in a well it's got to be what six months or so uh I think the last thing decline that we we saw I think you have to go back to march\n... so you know when I was leaving on a stock market role here\nAnd we're looking at some numbers\nThat certainly are are giving a traders and investors him and four one K. holders a little bit of a little kitten their stomach today\nBut a Wall Street journal reporting a biggest decline and more than six months yeah it is six months investors accelerated their retreat from fast growing technology stocks\nA major indexes have started the fourth quarter on their week is falling since the beginning of twenty six team\nOh is this just a little speed bump folks or is this indicative of\nThe stock market fears that the certainly exist or if the eyes being a you know opened up in October just because October\nUh is the month where we've seen the obviously the the most carnage on Wall street\nOr you know going back to the crash in twenty nine and in Nineteen eighty seven so I was ... October is certainly a month that that has a you know people always looking over their shoulders and October is not off to a great start here so uh I don't look at your four one K. today\n'cause you get to see the Dow down eight thirty one the NASDAQ down three Fifteen and he hasn't paid down\nNinety five point to sell reflected\nA once\nIn a ... with a suit my executive producer wants to know a a could investors have put the his the fed off until after the hurricane no I I don't think so I just hope this is not an indication of an extremely rough\nOctober I Know there have been multiple stories out there that the fears of a of massive correction of the fears of a crash a or a implanted and in some of the big wall street pros and experts a lesson ups and downs or you know healthy\nAnd you know pulled backs are natural in less than suddenly a you know people's eyes are open up here but the market has been on one hell of a role obviously uh I just hope that we're not dealing with with the beginnings of a nasty brutal October\nAs the month is known for nasty brutal months eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine a nationwide number here on Schmidt eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine again Amazon clocked today\nA Microsoft intel also clock today you at apple\nNetflix all also all getting hammered today Facebook getting hammered today\nSo tech stocks have a lead a big decline today with a worse decline of Wall Street since last spring or last march or actually\nHundred eight zero one eight nine nine nine gets you on ... again I Would love to get reports out of the Florida Panhandle or the eye and that is now fully a on a shore the eye of the hurricane looks to be\nA looks about forty miles or so thirty miles or so to the north west of Tallahassee right now about to get in to south western Georgia\nAnd south western Georgia hasn't seen as he liked his folks you've got a lot of timber you've got a lot\nWith the stomach problem\nMy fear of flying [noise] sound like you if it does you could be one of the many people with the digestive condition called ... efficiency or eat PI even if you don't know when he ... he is you might know the symptoms frequent diarrhea gas\nBloating stomach pain if you have even just one of these symptoms you could still have the piano because not everybody experiences he'd pee on the same way which is why it's so important to open up to your doctor about oh your symptoms and the good news is\n... manageable so we don't keep a lid on it good why Denis ...

FM south Tampa nine Seventy telling you eh ballet all over Tampa Bay [noise]\n\nOthers they talk about climate today and what what's going on with this this hurricane and it's just nasty some of the video that is beginning to come in\nYou know it's sort of a parallel here 'cause we're dealing with with the climate and the hurricanes a curve here in the United states they'd been happening since the beginning of time folks\nAnd yet this on record to be the strongest hurricane to hit the panhandle uh or at least since Eighteen fifty one but I'm pretty confident that prior to records being kept there have\nBeen many many years ago centuries ago hurricanes\nAs strong or stronger that have hit the coast because they've always been around\nHurricanes have always been a threat to the obvious areas in psych loans and and typhoons et cetera so the obvious areas on the planet but you know it's it you know we're talking about the climate to at least and the hurricane activity but also we have this political climate we have\nA torrential rain and wins in our political climate and\nSaw for instance a Rand Paul Rand Paul has said that in this political climate or somebody may get killed\nAnd I don't think Rand Paul is that far off let's look at the damages or his nut job neighbor did to him so I Want to get into that in just a bit but as far as the political climate\nAnd the fact that Democrats are vying they're making every possible uh attempt to take back the house of representatives and to make inroads or there is a pipe dream that the Democrats are hoping to take back\nThe Senate and of course was the house to the Senate in the hands of the Democrats would certainly cripple a good deal of what President Trump wants to accomplish those a good thing\nJust in case that he's gotten a lot of cup was including two Supreme Court nominations by talking and speaking of the political climate that exist right now and I told you about President Trump\nOr just a few minutes ago I I told you about his tweet that he is going to keep going to Pennsylvania for a rally in the Erie, Pennsylvania you're a area tonight or as to as he poured not disappoint the thousands of people that are already there and the thousands of people that will be coming\nBut the political climate\nWhen you look toward the U.S Senate\nOr there's something very important that we need to attach to this current hurricane\nAnd that is that there is a a a democratic seat in the Senate\nWhich is held by Senator Bill Nelson now and Bill Nelson is being challenged by the Florida governor Rick Scott now Rick Scott obviously leading up to this hurricane and in the aftermath\nHas been very visible he will be very visible he is in the past gotten very good marks or for some of the natural disasters in tropical activity and hurricanes in the state of Florida during his a two term tenure as Florida governor however let me be very clear here\nWhat could make or break a governor Rick Scott in his quest\nTo take this scene away from the Democrat Bill Nelson in Florida for the U.S Senate or is going to be I think viewed through the lens of how the aftermath of this hurricane goes listen we're we're a month shy year of the midterm elections\nWe're right around a month shy so Rick Scott as governor of Florida is going to be judged and he's going to be put under an extreme microscope right now and this could be the make or break\nSo the way the state of Florida under the direction of Governor Scott handles the aftermath of this hurricane I think it's going to have an amazing impact on weather and the polling has been a pretty close so if you're doing what's the latest a a real clear politics average getting given the latest\nI said no no recollection and then what what the her closest ally or the female this uh this legal in Kaiser she didn't even know Brett Kavanaugh\nNo recollection of this party or any event of this or so in the Kavanaugh accusation by foreign\nI mean he or she spelled out this story she's given names and no one could corroborate even the individual that would be the closest you would imagine to corroborate Leland Kaiser she had no idea\nSo I I feel the youngest is trying to you know how Milan ... here in the sense that uh you know you're going to be accused of not standing with women women so if an accusation is made\nYou just take that accusation that one hundred percent face value with out any type of proof\nI Want any molester I Want any sexual assault prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law\nBut again speaking of climate again you know here in this tough political climate and we know that it was already talked about to stop cabin on all costs\nAnd then we have this this uh this waterfall of accusations that come out and and a bunch of unsubstantiated claims\nOf course you need proof that's only fair that that that there's proof\nSo I thought the millennia hit the nail on my head I think I'm a lawyer Trump made a whole lot of sense so much sense that it's hard to figure out how anyone including the Democrats could argue any differently yes ah people should be heard\nBut if you make the accusation there needs to be some proof\nNow there have been some high profile claims in the past that were totally false you can look at the the uh the University of North Carolina lacrosse a story remember that\nOne propelled that embassy fill a Al Sharpton to prominence look to wanna Brawley story of the accusation made and completely false it was a total fabrication never happen\nThough of course there are many more examples of where things did happen and women were abused but you also have some of these high profile cases where it was complete fabrication and then there were lines\nSo I just don't know how you can [laughter] you'd be upset with the first lady\nAh in saying that hey you are one list all accuses you are but you you need them some proof\n\nSo I I I think she was spot on but you've got the first lady here coming under attack\n[noise] are you do that to me harm because sometimes I mean she's making a ton of sent me down gone too far\nSo unless there's a little more to this all want to

Hurricane Center in Miami\nA Eric welcome to ... we had your ah your Cold War we had a Dennis felt get on a couple of hours ago Eric I'm looking at the radar now I mean this thing is the is still a powerful hurricane as it's heading toward what Albany, Georgia\nThat's right it's moving in the south western Georgia the maximum winds are still a hundred and twenty five miles per hour a quite a powerful system for for that part of Georgia\nI so I mean I look at the rate on my wife lived for a time in Albany, Georgia she's a U.S marine brat and how far away from Albany is is the I right now\nIt looks like it's about uh about sixty miles away and they they can be expecting a hurricane force winds there certainly\n[noise] by Blake I'm seeing the video I'm sure you're seeing the the various ah a collection of network video and and still shots and and all the social media that's making the rounds from what you've seen all along the coast Mexico beach\nPanama City beach I tend to layer force base there and what have you seen so far that stands out\nWell I mean the tremendous storm surge of water up to the ... the tops of people's a roof I saw lots of trees snapped me it takes a lot of wind snapped pine trees or this was quite a powerful category for hurricane as it came ashore [noise]\nWell Eric what's amazing here is that it was just two miles per hour shy of becoming a category five so really and you know whether it was a four or five I mean the damage ... you know being that close I mean we really probably saw a category five damaging many spots\nOr it's you know it's impossible to know and I don't think you know looking at the damage so far it it's you know extensive and in many years looked like a tornado rolled through ... and uh that really speaks volumes all by itself [noise]\nEric are you hearing anything about fatalities or injuries at this point because there hasn't been a lot coming out of the local account the emergency center's at this point\nI haven't haven't heard of anyone a dying at this point\n[noise] I I Hope that's not the case of course we we always have people that refused to evacuate even when they're strongly urge to Eric ah\nWhat do you think uh has played into some people not evacuating you'd think it could have been that it was a project that as a category two then turning into a three but no one even expecting that it was

I Hope the people of Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close a we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort or with the Republican camp up by two\nSo we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well what fifty one percent and rest musician and so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana that can take back that state which is a red state then you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana\nI think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing and I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee should have been a longtime friend of this program in recent polls now how her up as well\nAnd then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are gonna make a difference\nOn election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives I mean because of gerrymandering up a big portion and percentage of seats I ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats\nSo we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and it's going to be campaigning for everybody in these tight races and an attempt to help them all out now um\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do the alternative health care solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts on health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country and and the more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the pure force of personality I mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know is an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nBut if he's not fighting then we're not winning and when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make\nRussia and Vladimir ... rich again while you're basically it's your counteracting everything that made I was trying to do which is prevent a hospital regime\nFrom ever having the power to turn off the picket and turn off the light blood of western Europe's economy\nIs a simple basic things nobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury\nApparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and that little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\nThe guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula\nYou look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there\nA nuclear armed North Korea is not something that the world needs if you care about human life and as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea that people of North Korea been suffering\nYou might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great would that be for the world\nAnd I got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nAnd on the on the tarmac for mullahs around that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either you know I Want to get in\nMichelle Obama

campaign if you can and we welcome both of you to the program a gym let me start with you is it is it three or four people now that say that Rod Rosenstein Rona how many have you been out\nThere there there are several and here's the bottom line when the when the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction\nAsk you to come in and testify in this case the chairman the Judiciary Committee you are obligated to do that remember Rod Rosenstein is Senate confirmed when he goes through the confirmation process you get asked that question will you come and testify under oath an answer Congress has question Wayne called his answer that is yes he is obligated to do it and for him not to come\nIs ridiculous particularly in light of what we now know where we have a ... ... actually\nA account of someone saying that he was serious about actually recording the commander in chief of this great country so yeah he should be in front of us and if he's not going to come in like he's supposed to like you said he was going through then there definitely should be a subpoena will bring him in her deposition\nWell there's a lot that Rod Rosenstein needs to explain and it should be under oath that's the normal procedures to end it right\nIt sure is it's just supposed to come in at Berkeley under oath or the ...\nMaybe he's the guy who even run the Justice Department\nAnd understand the timeline on may ninth\nKobe is fired based on the Rosenstein memo on may six hate this when he has his conversation with these the page and Andy McCabe where he said he was thinking about recording the president contemporaneous with that ... held the FBI chief counsel Jim Baker that Rod Rosenstein was serious about that this solemn ... and of course may seventeenth is when Bob Mueller's named special counsel\nAlso in San ... what else happened on the plane that today moment when Edward ... director\nThe same day just kind of interesting and then of course he doesn't get the job in the next day he named special counsel so this all happens and then as you pointed out in your intro a defies ever know the third Pfizer and no one gets signed one month later so that's sort of the timeline of what we want is all you want to bring him in and ask questions about all those it then\nThroughout that two month period\nAll right Dave Brat let's bring you into this eh well first of all how has your race going I you know I Know that you've been targeted now by by Nancy Pelosi and company and the thrown a ton of money in your district to get your defeated how's it going\n[noise] yeah it's

what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days Congressman John\nI think we're going to win I think we got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting the because of the American people elected us to fight for so I think we're going to win and I think the way you frame it up on his way you been doing it\nHow radical the left is I'd like to say it this way there there that that left today is that they apply ... when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never that great material and Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed anyone who supports the president and we saw that double down on that whole mindset doubled down on yesterday with what Clinton in older set about Republican\nWhat are you ... and ... they're going after terrorists Sanders I'm Pam Bondi in secretary Nielsen says\nYeah I it just it just how radical the leftist today's modern Democrat Party today's party of the lab\nHas taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish ice never secure the border continue to socialize medicine and impeach the president and you contrast that with what the president under his leadership we've accomplished\nList is phenomenal did this the other day some but they could buy the taxes cut regulations reduced economy going at what point two percent lowest unemployment fifty years out of the Iran deal the embassies in Jerusalem we've got a new NAFTA deal the hostage to come over North Korea and we got to get guys\nOn the United States Supreme court that's an amazing record and if we've

read understands that he's out campaigning on the good things that happen with conservative leadership and his leadership\nUh that's how we have to run these campaigns and if we do I think we keep the majority\nLet me ask you a question now Fox has confirmed\nThat the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein enacting FBI directed his after the firing a coma Andrew McCabe and Robert Mueller all met on a weekend day after Mueller's investigation started up\nAnd in that meeting Rosenstein and the and McCabe or or both detailing reasons why the other one needs to recuse themselves or the Russia investigation as as the caller is sitting there watching all this go on to knowing that well I guess I'm In charge of the whole thing what do you make of that uh they brought\nYou know I just go back to the way your frame that you only got ... dot com it's all dark like your um ...
