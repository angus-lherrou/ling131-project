out of the lightning that's now only eleven point two seconds left to the south will come back and the lady and the lady was saying went off the red wing player laugh but again they're going to lose that argument yeah or maybe they're not the lawyers in winning out of his own no he was pointing at someone else [noise]\n[noise]\nWell now time is very much an ally of the lightning based job\nThan a

[noise]\n\nSo really wins that lady from a big into the sub circle nearly nearing right on the dispelling the clock\nHe made some key saved at new or know rebound and might search star give to Stephen stem goes I thought this was the best game is played so far this year he scored a goal\nBut he had a lotta shot attempts and he was shooting a little bit more than they usually do yeah\n... overall attempts to the perfect or you get four or five shots every game you're going to score a goal [noise]\nWell my friend I Will see you\nIn late October I play the new five on the road and we'll see if they can do as well on the road as they did at home but I before I let you go I mean look ... you start this home stand five in a row in home I mean there's a little bit of pressure there to make sure that you don't squander this opportunity knowing you got a five game road trip\nComing at the end of the ... for them to go forward on it or they feel really happy about that you come back to return to be good to a road trip but I don't even know the old adage of great on\nThat yeah and the funny thing is um you're put in Minnesota which is not an easy game in ... I have no one there in a while and so that's right and then you go to Chicago which won't be ... to back back to back so it'll be interesting I Would probably take bacillus ... played Minnesota maybe Louis demeaning\nAnd I think dimming for sure is going to get the other one of those getting the fact that because there's a back to back at the end as well the dog in Arizona where they may give him

think the things that build I talked about you know the fact they're playing and inspired opponent we've got all that tonight ... nothing was gonna come easy Howard had a great game he really did but the way the lightning pushed back after really will was a tough second period\nFor about Thirteen fourteen minutes so I thought they had a good ... the second stamp scored\nThey were kind of pulling out of it but listen to these numbers and the third they shot the wings twelve six in the third\n... temps were twenty two to temp yeah and the sauce blading we're losing the face of battle twenty eight Nineteen after two periods and the third period they went sixteen and eight in the face off ... at all of those things that led to\nSound like a lightning at Fifteen scoring chances and the third period but they made the wings play defense for much of the period there were few isolated chances in the third for Detroit like Phil talked about the ... chance may not have had many of the ... off the rush but the lightning closed out this game\nIn a very impressive fashion and that was one of the things\nThat really stood I mean I agree with you and Dave I think that the story so far early on\nDefensively this lightning team when you look at the average in terms of ... loud nine now a lotta that his goal tending but at the heart going and then I'll get but that part in the Pentagon was a weakness last year but I think again tonight maybe the fence proved to be good defense\nYou kept the pressure on to your point yeah especially in the third period and Detroit had some looks but give credit to Tampa Bay for for pushing play\nYeah and it's not like the lady didn't have any you know they have our share of rave on he goes and the three on one no doubt there power play was again dangerous but that was great\nHe was you know when the lightning dipped and even when they didn't get when they gave up the isolated chance here and there are the two of those short handed the right in the first period jumps out so [noise]\nYeah the lady will take it I think we spoke after the Carolina game of blame if you go foreign one on the homes than they would take that every day of the week and uh they get it so\nNow the challenge is to go out on the road and habits accessible road trip jak Cooper's metric is usually and typically is bring home more points than game so let's see if they can bring home six or more points on the five game trip so he won't be easy\nI was going on with our ... and starting Saturday against a team and in a building where it's been difficult at times yeah and I think having a little bit um I'm at I'm feeling good about yourself stand cos getting a goal for his psyche has got to be good going into that\nBuilding so all in all all I could ask for I

last call presented by Jack Daniels here from head coach John Cooper lightning players and fans from rumble fish grill and family arena fewer your host Matt Salmon and Brian Anglo and welcome to the last\nSomebody WFL a is here once again broadcasting live from a very happy crowd here\nRun fish grilled behind section one oh six is the lightning defeat the Detroit Red Wings for the twelve consecutive time\nAnd for the ... consecutive time at home in the regular season for the longtime lightning fans your love exists because I think in the first Fifteen Years of this as a team history there might have been to the trees are three victories against Detroit\nTotal but uh it was a different type of game tonight a hard fought victory and new Detroit was going to put up a battle is they're off to their worst certain thirty three years they're trying to get that first win tonight\nBut uh the bounces and there were plenty of 'em did eventually go the lightning way tonight and they certainly work for them we will be joined in just a few minutes by Louis dumbing who uh had the best seat in the house well second to brining bond between inches but\nUh Louis of course had no standing start against Caroline on Tuesdays we'll talk a little bit about that but first Brian let's talk about this a game tonight I really thought the lightning\nHad they had some of the bounces earlier and I normally not wanting to go all the fucking bouncer way but tonight it really was the case that was kind of been a for nothing five nothing lightning game after a what twenty twenty five minutes but\nIt was one nothing in Detroit scratching and clawing back and it's back and forth year but as much of a valiant effort is the red wings put up trying to get that first win tonight against arrival\nThe lightning as you would expect more talented a little more battle tested this season and the just coming through and finding a way to get a win and to finish this opening five game home stand with the foreign one record\nThese kind of games I think make the players and coaches feel pretty good um because you have to battle all the way through we're gonna be a lot of twists and turns in a game like this\nUm Detroit came in pretty frustrated and pretty angry and a little embarrassed um after the last two games and people are all over them and\nIt's understandable because they don't have a wind yet I I get that but in talking to some of the people who follow the team they're saying look they could have one either or both of the games in California and their first trip\nSo they actually play pretty decent and the first three games came away with nothing but then they were lousy the next two games in Boston and in Montreal just smoked him so that you know that was the bad taste in their mouth that they had coming in here so you knew especially as\nPoorly as things have gone to eleven straight games before tonight that they've lost against the lightning you knew what was going to happen they were going to come out and and just hit the ground running and they did\nAn ice level I can tell you it was a very fast game and the turnovers from up in the defense is what really makes it whenever they play against Detroit um and that was true again tonight\nDetroit again made a very difficult through the neutral zone for the lightning forwards to get any um anything really rolling with any consistency\nUm but they generated quite a few shots they scored early that gave him some momentum even though the ... the power play didn't score it was pretty decent again with the penalty killing again continues not only to\nAll off power plays but also sport you know guess scoring chances short hand it's been a a big story is becoming a bigger story all the time [noise] excuse me [noise]\nAnd then that guy and goals pretty good yeah ... ...\nOr eighty eight was ... I I thought he was the first star of the game he made several just brilliant said it was the goal tending do I mean you gotta you gotta have at the Jimmy Howard at the other end of the ice to he made some darn good saves that one on stamp coast was unreal that one time or what the block or say\nI'm so it it was you know it was a really good game to watch was well played especially the way the game is played now you're going to give up chances you ... you can't limit everything and you can knit picking say well yeah they gave up this one and it was a two one one here and great scoring chance there and you should have had some coverage yeah\nBut that's today's NHL um there are going to be a lot of chances so they focus so much on the pocket on scoring chances every team does so the one who can pull it off the best and make the key defensive plays at the key times and I thought I was impressed away lightning played the two to one game\nYou have to get in a mentality in how to play without falling back all the time and still protect the lead and not do anything stupid um when you're ... winning a leading by one goal and I thought they did a pretty darn good job especially because it's October and doing that\nAnd something to keep in mind too with the defensive team is uh you know this is a new defensive scheme mud under Todd Richards it's going to take you know a few weeks and several games to to really buttoned up on but after a you know a little bit of\nToo much open ice and the first couple of games I think you've seen things get really simplified here in the last few games and that's a very positive sign that learning curve is this quickly and you can say after game five well we're not seeing those numerous breakaway sort of missed\nOpportunities that you saw so many scientists previous season that's a very positive things to discuss and we've also\nGot plenty of positive things to discuss with a very positive gentleman who brings a great crowd Louis I mean you really know how to pack the house here thank you for ah for getting the whole game together here as a [noise] we're gonna make sure he doesn't strength themselves in that area there\nHe's a pro and they have all behind them and he knows how to do it yeah or nothing about Raul Castro air for the lightning\nBut uh Louis uh I Know uh you you didn't plan tonight's game but certainly congratulations on the wind before we talk about your performance\nLet's talk a little bit about tonight's game this was a completely\nDifferent type of game than what you guys saw Tuesday against the hurricanes but uh this is one that the team had to grind out but in many ways it was a good way to to grind out a few things and ultimately end up with the the other winner the victory column here\nWhile I was really important for us to to come out of that when a ... to that owns than with a with four wins um I've been on the other side of the the metal like like Detroit did didn't win the game yet this year and I've been on this side a few times a an Arizona and it's not easy so [noise]\nYou know we were facing a hungry hungry teams tonight and uh they certainly ah gave it all the God and then at the end of the day we\nManaged to score a goal is at a at a big diamond and ... again was just sought spending like he usually is a is so [noise] ah that's pretty much what I saw there [noise]\n... playing behind this team ... what's your perspective what do you see from these guys every night what's it like being Louis dimming in the net playing\nFor the lightning or you know what you're going to get a chance to win you know we're going to score\nSome goals obviously would show that um you never know if it's going to happen when once you go into the game you know that uh\nYou know you almost give two goals are\nAre are less you're you're you know probably a good chance to win yeah it's like that in most teams but uh I really have the confidence that if I Do my job at the right time we're going to really have a good chance to win\nThe other guy in the tandem as you mentioned a lesson a worthy I certainly been in the discussion is only twenty three years old [noise]\nSitting next to him in the locker room watching him prepare on the ice off the eyes watching him perform to what are some of the things you've picked up working with him now as a team made for almost a year or two different guys totally we we prepare ourselves very\nDifferent needs that guy that likes to stay in this bubble and and be really focused throughout the day of a game [noise]\nI don't need that and I don't like doing that I I've I've you know Patrick why wanted me to do that and that's kind of how he was\nAlso but that's that's just not my personality I like to be outgoing and fun and play soccer before the game [noise] um\nAnd and that's just how how I like to do things but at the same time I can still or take a little bit of of his own page when I Need to narrow down my focus you know is is the guy that I can relate to him and he ah obviously the the biggest thing that I can take out of a virus is work ethic that defined match it every day and not just\nA few dozen games of what he does every day is what makes them I'm an elite schools than there\nAnd speaking of those pre games soccer warm up let's talk about Tuesday's game gets Carolina I didn't even get the soccer game\nWhat happened or what was that there was a scary moment you're you're about to get that first started hoops ... yeah ... yeah a little\n[noise] right [noise]\nNow you know demand so\n\nFor your guard down with my God [noise]\nSelling your youthful drone\n\nMade dot com [noise]\nLast call first he had his by Jack Daniels nice seventies WFL a here's more from ... arena\nAnd we'll come back to the last call presented by Jack Daniels for nine Seventy WFL lasers can your program from ... fish thrill the lightning\nVictorious over the Detroit Red Wings tonight three to one and thanks to our guest Louise ... who is a shaken hands are taken all sorts of\nPictures right that's a real that's a real look into a gold tenders life you know just a smidgen now that there and he made it real\nIt was that was great very much so I I always we we find out who the schedule guest is after the morning skate and I always look forward to speaking to whomever is scheduled but when I found out I was movie I went All right because he he was\nThe fun when we talk to them last year and a definitely\nThere is no guessing he will let you know or what is on his mind is right and I love it when you just kind of cut through all the smoke and and get to that messaging yeah\nUh we will get to a preview of the upcoming five game road trip and our final segment also a couple of their points from tonight's game but first let's catch the post game press conference from head coach John Hoover witches presented by WMU who law school the Tampa campus give them a call and he won three for one nine fifty one hundred and here is junk Cooper\nWas scheduled\nTo be a fight Hunger Games how important was it was for once while it's\nScheduled comes out\n... and you just kind of got to go\nBefore that so you gotta think training camp by having all those days before you play games and um it's\nThere was a lot of time to practice so we had to make sure we got off to a good start because you know the practice time starts going down a little bit as you start piling these games up [noise]\nUm [noise] but [noise]\nYou got to look at this trip and I don't care who your plan you get four to five you got to be really happy with that regardless of how things played out um but but for the most part these guys really worked hard on this trip and uh we've been home a long time we've enjoyed it we did what we had to do now where to go do it on her own\nShe thought it was a couple of good things for sure Kelly\nCame back way before we thought he could and um and did a great job for us and probably the other one is in you know stamper score that's a you know it's like when he gets on the board and get\nThese guys that are juice the scoring to get that first one of the way as big\nAs with those guys like him and gives you get the test and I I mean that's kind of a purchase I haven't seen him yeah\nThey were they were counting a bunch of the power play and a ferret product\nHardman unreal save coming across on on one of them um but that's the thing the more you shoot percentages of tell you a more pro success you and a half\nLeft the state really\n[noise]\nWell part of the score and Orlando was for that and um [noise]\nYou're there is something to be said about going down the road not only do you have to win games on the road a year to learn how to play on the road but part of it is now so there's less distractions team together and um [noise] I think this is one of the road we're go I think it was our longest trip\nProbably twice on the road so we'll definitely know each other by the time we get back\nThe game tonight could be a ... game final game before you go on a road and the guys cried out tonight [noise]\nUh yeah you look\nAt the end result and that's what we came here for [noise]\nAre there you know if there's one thing that's probably a little bit of a red flag right now is the alarming a lot of police were taking and when you're starting to take six a game [noise]\nIt's a you know our our ... done a phenomenal job this year but come on let's\n... you just can't keep putting him the test and set a time and time again guys are sitting now guys are getting cast and and you you kinda lose your rhythm and use your photo and he'll give Detroit credit\nAnd they had probably a little over seven minutes a power play time in the second we kill it off but it's hard to regain momentum and again when you're constantly on your end and and so we need a vast there in that period and in a big blocks\nBut then you know we got the third is that we manage a third really well\nMore vision for what point in going to be on the line that you use the coach even to even though you know the good players you know there is this as a play or in a way to get one school and yeah and\nThose guys do a lot of little things that you know don't always show up in the score sheet and um it's rewarding when they get to score and\nStuff like that but it's a you know guys it's got to be guys have to go get the puck and there's gotta be guys got put into that and uh\nThe bottom line out of all everybody you just you got to work and when the work ethic is exceeding um\nAre you if you try to exceed the work ethic of the other team usually gives yourself a really good chance and um [noise]\nYou know Detroit ... like they work their tails off and that's a ... you look at us in the second period that we are leaking oil or we have to match their work ethic and and I thought we did that in the third and uh but it's guys Gore and corner that you know drive the\nAre playing the physically as talking when ...\n...\nIn free played for Fifteen periods of hockey so uh if you take some of everything and say how we played defensively I'd give us a good writer not um\n[noise] it's part of that is getting big saves but you know just chats as as a whole a replay\nAll right John Cooper's comments following tonight's three one win over Detroit again presented by W. M. U. Cooley law school the Tampa campus uh Brian a couple of quick notes or to throw in before we look at the road trip in our final segment and a couple of minutes here\nUh won the return of Brian Callahan we've seen him in practice the last few weeks you could tell that he certainly was ready to go and that's certainly a good thing to see him two three weeks ahead of schedule in and playing like the Ryan Callahan we know and love and certainly didn't look like he missed a beat since the play offs\nBut the second part of this a discussion point is with Kelly coming back some of the roster moves that were made so Cory ... goes to Syracuse\nA Dominic Marcel is at a rehab a assignment with Syracuse so he is anticipated to play a couple of weekends therefore games total according to Julie breeze blocked\nAnd Matthew Joseph is still here and once again we're seeing the effects of Matthew Joseph\nGiving the lightning management every reason not to send him back now that's not to say is going to be here for eighty two games you know we'll see how the season plays out here but\nAfter five games we've seen the great scoring opportunities that he's had and he he's disclosed it's almost like breaking point to a couple of years ago he's this close to getting that first of all\nWe've seen his speed beat out several ... calls as well and date set up a hell of a goal in the Carolina game on Tuesday night here this is another\nExample of meritocracy here you knew that Callahan was coming back you knew that uh somebody was going to be losing a roster spot\nAnd it wasn't going to be mad you're Joseph the way he played for no fault of their own it's Cory ... and uh uh Demick Marcel who are just kind of dealing with the after effects of it here but\nYou know the the cast was set a long

I Believe that the Democratic leadership\nSpokespeople which only a small percentage of the party eight Trump so much so this role it's light that them to the fact that most Democrats are apathetic because they have jobs the economy doing well\nAnd they have to admit that the president doing a lot of great thing but the leadership of the Democratic party it's blinded by there are actually\nWell there's no question about that the Democratic party leadership including in the media are obsessed with their hatred for Trump and so you think they are so the wine\nDoing blindingly enraged by that they then assume everybody else is\nExactly and they think that's going to produce the voter turnout that they did it during the presidential election that would change the leadership of the out\nWhat yeah okay you're kind of on my same page here I'm you know I'm looking at what has changed it's going to reverse the fortunes of the Democrats have been losing elections who have not been turning out voters\nIt is an issue related because they're not proposing proposing any and they're certainly not advocating and they all they're doing is ripping the bullying and so\nSo your theory is that they are fooling themselves that they're they think they've got this massive hate Trump movement out there that they've created that is going to show up in droves and sweep Republicans out of office\nDown most Democrats are admitting that the economy doing well and they may not like the president techniques but they have to admit it\nWhy now wait a minute wait a minute what most Democrats where are you seeing most Democrats big grudgingly admit that the economy's doing well\nI unfortunately my entire family democratic that pre med I just don't show I took Democrats because they're nice people\nOkay what are you are including them that that that there's not just your your like your family that that has been grudgingly admitting things are getting better they do not blindly hate Trump\nDon't they don't widely a drop in it don't feel like they they're gonna matter\nWhat so you're telling me they're not all that exciting to show up and vote exactly [noise] so now you're you're calling from Tallahassee what are your what is your family's thoughts on Andrew Gillum\nI'm a danger in a good way are bad was\nIt not I'm not sure dangerous can ever be good but I'm like\nWell I'm the most dangerous man in America because it's good\nAt\nAny of that at work at it can be good dangerous on Andrew Gillum is a democratic candidate for governor here he's up against Ron\nThe Santa and I'm the guy the guy is a is\nIt dangerous is the right word but your family mostly Democrats are not into the guy is that what you're saying well\nMost of my family in the Midwest [noise]\nWhat about Democrats and you know Democrats nice people do\nThey are and and none of them support ill because they watched it back as mayor of happy it when you ask them about it they looked at their shoes shake your head\nRight so this does it look all of this is ... by the way the word is a\nAnd E. C. D. O. T. A. L. ethnic though some people think it's anti do all that would be against\nAdults will and there's no such thing as against ... there's no pro does all there is no ... this is an neck don't all and it just means it's unscientific here say it's just you know a person talking to four or five others\nAnd it's really dangerous to suck projecting you talk to four or five Democrats who think Trump's okay maybe not the best guy but the economy's going great but I I don't think I'm going to vote you can't take out those poor people\nAnd make it scientific that the Democrats are going to have a turnout problem even though that's what Mike is is ... hit his point is\nThat the Democrat leadership in the media and leadership is really kind of alone they are enraged they are blinded by their hatred\nSo much so that they think everybody like them and it's Trump and this is going to drive Democrats back to the polls more than anything has\nSince Obama in two thousand eight and it's the old it's the old negative there is such a thing as negative turnout but it's not meant as it's being the negative turnout is your turn out to oppose\nSomething that you are Michael e wary of or afraid of\nA the kind of negative turnout we're talking about here is Democrats turning out in droves be cause they\nUm despise tromp and and so forth and he's just say he doesn't think that exists all across and threw out the Democrat Party we will see time will tell you not too long [noise] celebrating\nThe American way [noise] [noise]\nI mean were\nMy friends I enjoy things that are well may take cigars for example the details are what matter same goes for simply say home security\nTheir attention to detail in craftsmanship makes simply say system truly different from everything else out there it's easy to set up and it's easy to use and it works in the event of power outages are downed wires 'cause there aren't any of those\nAnd there are no contracts get ten percent are simply say usa dot com that's simply safe usa dot com\nYour brain is an amazing thing but as you get older it naturally begins to change causing a lack of sharpness or even trouble with recall thankfully the breakthrough in privileges helps your brain\nAnd actually improve memory the secret is an ingredient originally discovered in jellyfish in clinical trials ... has been shown to improve short term memory ... healthier brain better life\nNow available in stores everywhere things up in the valley with anybody of this product is not intended to ... prevent any disease\nThen under the LA [noise]\nThe the ratings are in ...\nWere Rush Limbaugh on with me for the hour we're just shy of four million viewers\n... the big starting over the whole country doesn't want to seal nevermind Texas\nPretty unbelievable story and oil and fake news CNN he they fail to even call him out\nFor lying about fleeing the scene of an accident while he was wasted you know and or his legalizing narcotics view that was a genius for you don't believe he will be Chuck Schumer it is\nIt was an article written I don't know where I saw it\nUm I don't know who this person is Heather Wilhelm\nThe ... the embarrassment the embarrassing spectacle of paid oh mania you know they've sent nearly Seventy million dollars outside of the Texas money to unseat Ted Cruz it's unbelievable so I'm proud of them I'm going to be in Houston tomorrow we're going to be following the story\nIs going to be a town hall I get to participate by the way which was nice\nAnd a Rick Perry's going to be there on behalf of Ted and I'm going to be interview in both of them and uh it's gonna be in Houston all the details are on Hannity dot com I Hope that our friends Katie are Rachel hope that they can come on out we'd love to see out there\nIt's going to be at the double tree greenway plaza ... eleven AM greenway plaza Houston, Texas and we're going to be in Beaumont town hall there three thirty Edison plaza all details on Hannity dot com excited to be there\nYou know but there's one thing is true about this headline is it is an embarrassing spectacle you know and the ... I'm telling you I Am the people are Texans are not going to put up with this\nI Know the people attacks us they're not\nYou know what I think they start early voting on Monday in Texas um so that's coming to to a head\nI mean barring a disaster I mean it only is is it's like the winds me of Obama in the sense that he's cool obey the whole Rourke it's it it is they out\nSide taxes phenomenon not attacked it only by the way this is the New York DC think this is the San Francisco LA thing he gets a full hour\nOn fake news CNN he can't even gone to a million viewers that's all the ... not not just taxes that's the whole country you know we could have put it on short wave radio and TV\nHe could've done a Facebook wife short Twitter live show and done better than a million anyway so you know then you know Texas by the way we have some examples there\nOf people asking non citizens to register to vote that's now becoming a big problem down in Texas oh by the way even MSNBC held paid or rock is a rock star it can be the twenty twenty nominate\nA yeah try and get through Ted Cruz first good luck with that but we're following all these races let me tell you where I think we are right now I think the Republicans\nI think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us four thousand people strong\nThat want to get to the southern border or the United states from Central America I Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen I I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and get an update\nApparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government\nThat that's not gonna happen but four thousand people still four thousand people\nAnd what did Democrats what did they resist that they don't want a solution for the board our problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we they now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using and this is I\nCan't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above\nSo they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly drones with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's they're most likely to succeed\nIn bringing in their heroin and their fat and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities that's how evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are to be successful\nOr the president while he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that had been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny but we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done that in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor\nAnd any sense of constitutional or authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process\nThat would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh it wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his like well now they want a nine to one\nBut at the way I see it Eighteen days out is that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight lead now in Florida but it's not big enough\nDo you want if you want rex Rick Scott has killed himself\nAnd done such a great job for the state of Florida look at how this man is all hands on deck doesn't sleep every hurricane he's prepared to help out those that are victims amazing I'm maybe the most charisma in the world will be the first to tell you that but you know one thing I'm a little sick of\nA lot of politicians with a lot of hot air and be asked that talk a good game and just they're lying to us which is part of the whole democratic strategy that's why project very tossed catching Brett ascent on tape and his campaign saying oh yeah well he's just saying he'll support cow but he's not going to support cab and he's not going to\nBe [noise] [laughter]\n[noise] I Can't

libertarians I've libertarian physicians but the reality is it's the they're not drawing any votes away from Donnelly they're drawing them away from his republic Republican opponent\nI think Heidi

that is what eleven o'clock tomorrow morning and used it and then we'll be in Beaumont, Texas at three thirty tomorrow\nLooking forward to that and uh I'll be interviewing Ted Cruz and we'll be hearing a lot of this on a Monday obviously CNN as they made their decision or they're supporting which is pretty fascinating anyway we're just Eighteen days away from these all important midterm elections\nAnd what do we see we see that Brett ascend has now been exposed this week in Tennessee is somebody that has is purposely lying to the people of Tennessee the same with Claire McCaskill we say that Christian cinema is falling apart\nI mean literally ... you know she she says oh it's fine to be a sign that join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said well by the way this is the meth capital of the world Arizona oh by the way you're crazy and she has anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha mix Sally\nIs that we're fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you see that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people of North Dakota so it seems a lot of pickups in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida vote for governor in for Rick Scott is always does an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\nOf well the the houses are still in play and the Republicans are ah without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it would be to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats and what their agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi once she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about humor in the Senate\nAnd he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better in in a in the Senate polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona modalities now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a service so that\nThe the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate looked like they are going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nNow West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nOr just really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people of New Jersey of had it with him and you know now his association with this Chilean Epstein guy\nThat has now become an absolute verbal war between ... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up at the polls are dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell I think where America stands and John and you are right on fortunately I might add is if the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think that New Jersey will go all the way because of his eight operationally democratic state but the other states you cite Sean I think are moving in with I think are the wrong direction I\nStill have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those have deteriorated above it from my perspective and the last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell ... yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh\nUh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen\nSo if you can get to sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did\nAnd it appears to have backfired particularly on Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that van and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular\nFor let me tell you what I'm saying I'm ready on TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district you're in there for a hundred and thirty five congressional districts in this country in any of those districts\nIf you vote for any Democrat you're voting for ... if you stay home it's I have a vote for below sea and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for tester and McCaskill\nAnd send them on against Dean Heller and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know Brett us and it was just a phony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape the being it uh and and not put more Marsha Blackburn and you know you'll get the government you deserve but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're gonna they're gonna tow the line with pillows the in the house into the line with Schumer in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually paying that\nThey're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it any more John Podesta Center for American Progress and saying all Democrats should not talk about immigration for this they want to open borders sanctuary cities\nSanctuary states that elimination of ice and they want to keep a bomb of care that not that that didn't work for eight years dug and\nWhy why do we lose holding a bit of a leading Indiana is say keep ice you say go the wall and he's saying no impeachment which\nWhen he was the only reason he surviving and not down by five or six now is because you've got a libertarian in that race that is polling at nine percent you take a libertarian out Joe Donnelly is history in Indiana\nWell I wouldn't be so sure on but he is running where Democrats need to be in the center and if we were a centrist party rather than a leftist party with new leadership from top to bottom I think we could go in a lot better I think you're probably agree with that Sean\nHow is it possible that Democrats hold on to below sea and Schumer how was it ... it is a phenomenon to make\nThis a one word answers on that one is money\nFor us the machine constantly printing mega millions tickets send you got your lotto regulars here but
