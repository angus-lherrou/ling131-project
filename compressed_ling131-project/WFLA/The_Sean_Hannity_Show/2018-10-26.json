F. LA you're this new show added new time weak nice from nine to midnight on new radio nine Seventy WFL a\nFinal segment appear to have a ban on Thursday October twenty fifth on your host Ryan Gorman with me in Studio by producers Morgan lash and James Byrd lander [noise] ah it sounds like a ... at the time Warner center\nIn New York there was concern that a suspicious package was found and it can be linked to the other a package bombs that we've heard so much about over the past few days that is not the case uh they've given the all clear they're so are there is not another\nA package bomb a found in New York City or at the same building where CNN is located so there was some concern that that might be the case it is not\nYou know throughout the show today we we spend a lot of time talking about a rhetoric in this country and and it's not an effort to link\nThe president to what's happening here because we don't know who this person is or why they are decided to do what they did with these package bombs uh we spent time talking about Hillary Clinton's comments about Maxine Waters comments in the past\nAnd just about civility and the discourse and the debate in this country in general and I get a listener email from somebody who\nSaid\nAh if I think that simply saying all we need to do is get along will work I've apparently never met a democratic\nThat's not what I'm saying that's actually really don't take on what I've said throughout the show today ... I'm not saying we'll need to get along I'm saying that we need to have\nA real debates in this country substantive debates in this country and not be looking to destroy the other side over every little thing because going about things that way is not going to solve problems it's only gonna make things worse\nSo\nI I think this is a moment where we should be discussing how we all deal with politics in this country whether it's\nHow the president deals with his rhetoric and what he says the Democrats the media self reflecting on how they cover things and all of us and how we\nWhat is wrong with you I mean would always amazes me\nAbout that as these people like they they have real lives like they have kids and families and they drive and I go to work and somehow they're deranged enough to joke about what we're seeing package bombs sent to political figures across the country\nIt's not a joke\nSo this should be a moment for everybody to take a step back and say hey am I contributing in a positive way to the discourse ear\nOr my contributing in a negative way and far too often what I see are negative contributions right now\nAnd it's only two ways we go forward we either continue down that course road to the bottom race to the bottom or we start to turn things around\n\nThat was the majority of the discussion on the show today we won't have a show\nTomorrow at all because of lightning game will be back Monday with a whole lot more than if you missed or some of what was on the show tonight will have some stuff on line for you and nine Seventy W.

Fox News federal and local authorities now looking at Florida as an area of interest as they hunt for the person or persons responsible the series of suspected moms sent to several high profile Democrats and the other day one was down to address the actor Robert Deniro package\nBut the investigation into suspicious packages sent the Democratic figures prominent party supporters of CNN this week is focusing on leads in Florida a federal law enforcement source said the Thursday today [noise]\nSo Florida I'm Wondering if they've narrowed down I I was trying to think what what point does it I mean could it be post marks because some of the package as you could see a post mark or a partial post Mark I'm wondering if they have enough of a post Marc people to see the ZIP Code\nThe nation where it was canceled a et cetera but I'm Wondering if\n\nIf anything as far as the return address the Debbie Wasserman Schultz if that some kind of clue there on how quickly she got the package or where it was male for I don't know\nI I'm just wondering how they've decided on Florida is a potential lead on where these packages could have been male as it doesn't mean that the bombers from Florida bummer can be from\nSomewhere else build the bombs in driving and mail them from a location I mean all these are directs the trying to throw people off the trail\nI was there was a lot to talk about today eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine gets you on the program radio listeners TV viewers wherever you are would love to have you on the program eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine that we can talk about the conspiracy theories we can talk about you know the the false flag suggestions which again I'm not subscribing to any of this\nI'm going away for the investigation there is going to be a troll ... treasure trove of details and information and evidence you know we talked yesterday about as simple as\nThe scotch tape the scotch tape that was used to a fix these\nLaser printer or inject into jet print addresses and return addresses looked like it was printed on you know normal you know copy bond and then you know cut out and and to a rectangles and then placed on to the manila padded novel ups and then just\nTaped me any game a finger nail a skim pieces\nHair or you can be DNA\nEvidence under the tape or the forever stamps which I pointed out yesterday man does look like those American flag forever stamps or who knows fingerprints any kind of DNA um components I mean if if ten bombs were sent you've got for instance ten of these digital clock timers\nWhere does someone get ten of these are the all the same so all the components if there was repetition and components\nIs someone gonna be able to say Oh yes some guy bought nine of these are Kennedys or twelve of these clocks and at a hardware store electronics place or a ordered online yeah there's just so many avenues of investigation I Can't even think of all the possible avenues but I think that they're going to figure out\nWho this is\nFairly shortly that's my guess I see already on hold we have a caller that says that he thinks I'm wrong that the purpose is going to be found All right hey I I Want to get into all of this a lot of detail here I'll give you that the ten bombs now there are two new recipients\nAre confirmed today that receive these bomb packages I'll get to that momentarily I've got audio I Want to play President Trump at the rally last night is getting some attention speaking of the president\nThe president tweeted out\nOr not about the bombing something unrelated this is regarding the caravan and then I just want to give you a little breaking caravan news and then we'll go back to the the the package bombs being sent\nThe president tweeted out literally a forty minutes ago\nAt two thirty one pm eastern time today the twenty fifth of October\nOr from at real Donald Trump's Twitter account the president tweeted to voters in the caravan\nTurn around we are not letting people into the United states illegally go back to your country and if you want to apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing\nExclamation point\nI don't have a problem with this tweet this queen is\nOn the money what what is wrong with this to those are the caravan turnaround we're not letting you and you're not coming into the country illegally what is wrong with this week I Want any president\nObama well unless we played that Obama audio from when he was a senator\nTalking about we won't tolerate the illegal ah migrations into this country and you know come to this country the correct way we have the old bond and a Trump that rain tweeted this Obama audio from 'em before he was president so when he was a senator what oh six oh seven whatever was [noise]\nAnd ah the president's a hundred percent right [noise]\nWith this particular tweet also we have a\nDetails about James Mattis ah to send troops to Mexico border over immigrant the caravan\nOf the latest now on this from ah various wire services has at least eight hundred US troops\nWill be sent to the U.S Mexico border in response to this caravan which\nLets them some reports have the caravan of fourteen thousand now as it's it's like one of those cartoons snowballs going downhill we got all kinds of boulders and houses and arms and legs hanging out of this thing and the second migrant care of and that was over a thousand strong we heard about you know a traipsing through a a Guatemala\nSo took care of ads that they could emerge to make us so far caravan\nSo uh we'll get a tip more detail on this later on during the course of the program the bombs [noise]\nWe have ten devices at this point\nSo we know about the Clinton who's got a device in chapter ... in Westchester County New York and a\nFairly bill was home Hillary was not there I don't think they spend too much tied together a so one bomb to the Clintons the Obamas got the bomb and the device at the\nEnd of course the Clinton package was intercepted the Obamas a package was sent to the Washington home also intercepted so Clinton's Obama's Maxine Waters\nUh she received two packages or they were to address the her Maxine Waters one was intercepted at the Capitol Hill a congressional mail center a that was in Capitol heights Maryland so far ah off campus for them and also in Los Angeles oh Maxine Waters recipients of\nTwo we had of course the Eric Holder package which then was on deliverable and apparently I I think that was due to insufficient postage or miss addressed one of them met insufficient postage and I and I have a picture that\nAre so and that package to Eric Holder was then sent back to the center which the bogus a spoof a return to sender turned out to be a Debbie Wasserman Schultz I'm Sorry Schultz\nA and her sunrise Florida office we know that the original package went to George Soros his house they believe that was hand delivered and they find the courage to find out who drop this thing off a we have of course the John Brennan\nAddressed package which then there was delivered to CNN they also think that was courier over and then of course cause the evacuation of uh the CNN New York headquarters an old time Warner center and that was the big mess yesterday and then the two new packages are as follows Robert Deniro\nGot a package at his uh try Becca film productions office in fry back to lower Manhattan just you know below canal fried that can means to try and go below canal so that's where that package went and\nI'm One of his or security person a founded suspicious and I called NYPD early this morning like five AM and they responded and then a Joe Biden the recipient or addressed\nThe Joe Biden to packages and one package was intercepted in Wilmington, Delaware the other package in New castle Delaware so that makes a total of ten how many more are out there that's the question\nNow again there's just so many little details\nThat I find fascinating and interesting we'll get into those so why a\nRobert Deniro could be some of the nasty remarks that that Robert Deniro made regarding President Trump 'cause it appears that you have a lot of these people are critics were outspoken against the president and\nHowever if you're going to be in the palmetto area south bound to Seventy five is offering up to get

to express my appreciation to all the men and women and YPG who've done an outstanding job yesterday and today addressing this situation and to all of our partners federal and state partners everyone

proactively take steps to protect those who have come under attack\nBy listening to a little bit of the pressure I Want to grab some phone calls here at a moment's\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine if you're on hold hang on I'll get to momentarily eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine\nSo some are pointing fingers at President Trump that always his rhetoric gets his style as his bashing of the news media and a bashing of some of these critics of his that's a full meant to this uh this violence or the the mailing of these packages come on\nLike the first of all I Am I happy with all of a Trump's rhetoric and when he gets in to bully mode I'm not happy I I tell you about it on the program\nI'm happy with a lot of the components of the job he's doing but not always you know the the rally mentality and and uh you know the seeming to put a stamp of approval on the body slamming instead of a gene for the ... and the\nAnd the the reporter the the congressional I as a candidate ... up in Montana I I don't think that's helpful\nI Wish that the president I Wish Trump would refrain I'm Sorry I don't give a seal of approval to everything President Trump says it does\nI like a lot of what he's doing but I Will tell you when he's crossed the line here but let me be very clear even with his ramped up rhetoric\nThere is only one person to blame for these packages and is the bomber it is well practically no bombs exploded so are they a bomber or just the bomb manufacturing a a lame bomb manufacturer or is it intentional who knows there are so many questions to be answered but again\nThis is not Donald Trump's fault this is the bombers fall must be one hundred percent clear the only person responsible is whoever is assembling and mailing and targeting these individuals with these packages\nDone that's it with that said what I like the president to be more civil and delivery of course I Want but it's all the way around it is the president it's the pundits it's the rhetoric gets the media it's it's it's everything\nBut it doesn't justify somewhat mailing out ten packages at this point and the big question is how many more remain\nHow many more of these packages are still floating around\nSitting somewhere in a pile of male or\nA I Would imagine that the postal workers are now or I got to believe that there are pictures of what these packages it looks like and mail facilities all over the u._s. to alert people to look out for this particular package\nGum under there I'm I'm directed\nMake it seem like some crazy from supporting Republican come on war and that's that's come on that's that's for ...

any sense\nThat a Republican would do this because we're coming up in the polls were you know we're ... hadn't a lot of these races and it just doesn't make any sense from that point of view just for a talking point the second one is I'm thinking\nThat maybe is ISIS it's\nChina it's Iran nobody seemed to be giving that is thought or even\nA talking point about it and I want to know your thoughts on that\nWell you'll have fallen out and in fact I mentioned this yesterday is just throwing on possibilities I'm like hey I don't know what could be the Russians the Russians have you know proven they interfere in our elections you know the Chinese are also interfering as well\nOr hold on to be the the Chinese could be the Russians and you know trying to cause turmoil prior to our elections\nSounds more like a like an ISIS or Alibaba thing up here we're going to be anybody\nYeah there is some weird aspect and speaking of ISIS did you see that there was a kind of an ISIS flag spoof that was included or at least on one of the devices did did you see that\nYeah I did it was reported this morning and you know I don't know we're just going to have to wait and see but you know Democrats gotta stop throwing the mud at Trump you know I mean fix them when they're down ...\nCivil get in their faces soon as they hit the streets your theory\nOverlooked and yell at him yeah wouldn't be surprised if somebody finally got yelled at and went off\nBy but also I mean I think Trump on a tone it down as well I think that he ought to bang going some I think he ought to back off some of the rhetoric as well\nI think they ought to stand up all forum Schumer Nancy Trump and all of them should just ended up together on one stage and say enough is enough\nAh hey John in San Diego

the device sent to John Brennan\nThe former CIA director address care of CNN in Columbus Circle in Manhattan yesterday and\nApparently the ISIS flag was printed out on some printing device and then a fixed\nTo the bomb and it was an ISIS flag parity from a movie in Internet piece of artwork me that has been circulating for have you know three four years I think it goes back to a twenty four team\nAnd uh the instead of having the ISIS a print in Arabic or whatever language it is a it shows\nIn sort of a an Arabic looking font it says get her done like ... year to year dude like ... you know Larry the cable guy his act\nAnd then\nIt also had a the silhouette outline and you know you know the chrome truck mud flap lady\nYou know what I'm Talking about on the back of trucks you see them every once in a while I was probably not a very ah politically correct in the meat to generation here but the the trucker mud flaps with the the the hourglass figured book some woman with a very thin waist\nSitting down with her arms that are aside and it's the side profile\nAnd they're cut out of chrome and they they they made their their appearance I think back in the seventies historically\nAs as crook mug flap weights\nAnd you see them there there are a lot of times they're chrome and it's just the naked ladies city and there was also with this this ISIS flag looking replica get her done also had a three of these women\nAre two sitting down or you know back to back you left profile right profile and then there was um a one standing up you know different versions so [laughter]\nYou know here we we've got an I ... a flag parody we've got the return address being that I'm Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nYeah so let's get it done ISIS flag thing was done back apparently in twenty fourteen by a world news bureau which is described as a a right wing parity website and you know it wasn't very prevalent but that's where they think this thing came from\nA war

disavowed\nOr any of the right wing conspiracies so you've got left wing right wing all kinds of conspiracies of flying here and Newt Gingrich or was there was a panel discussion where he was a

conspiracy by the\nTo make us look quite the right wing did it agree with her\nAnd I don't think we know who's doing what and I think are only physician or the that are people who engage in acts which could lead possess should be caught tried the strictest possible penalties and preferably locked up for life and\nI feel you cannot tolerate a society you know you're not going to keep a free society if people believe they can get away with violence or just because they think there's a scene\nSo should these conservative hosting conservative commentators who we're talking about conspiracy theories should they put a psych and\nYeah I think one of the focus on is whoever did this however they were motivated whoever financed than a should in fact be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the

say this was a conspiracy 'cause it's October [noise] [laughter]\nWell there you go Newt Gingrich I Would just wait we don't know whoever it is whenever ... if they're on the political spectrum in which every direction they need to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law\nBut on this talk radio program I didn't jump to oh my God this is a false flag it's it's it's it's a a supporters of Hillary Clinton and all the Democrats who are hoping for a democratic blue wave they did this and they're trying to make it seem like\nIt's a horrific Trump supporters\nRepublicans conservatives that are mailing these packages the Democrats we don't know\nAnd it was refreshing to hear Newt Gingrich\nSay just knock it off with all of this conspiracy BS and that's what I did on the program\nI mean we talked about uh what's being discussed and there's some vowing all of that way for the damn investigation I got to believe what ten packages whoever put their stuff together\nHas slipped up and they left some fingerprint remnant DNA hair fiber ... traces of the electronics that are used that were apparently you know used at least ten times\nThey got to find something and there's going to be in a rest I'm guessing with days maybe a week ten days tops\nAnd then we'll find out who it is and then we'll talk about it and what the motivations were\nA eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine nationwide number here on Schmidt lumped heavy on on any of what's happening and there is no shortage folks every single day the other question is are there more devices out the undiscovered tend to vice I mean three more devices today\nThe two devices sent to Joe Biden incidentally one of his biting devices had posted you do because it costs more than three dollars the metal pipe bomb so yeah the the Joe ... one of the Joe Biden\nAddressed packages to went to Delaware and one of the packages obligates I got a picture of the image right now it was sent to\nA Joe civil Robyn at abiding junior and there's a postage due of Seventy five cents because there were a three forever stamps on there so that's three dollars right and I said yesterday they got these American flight ... those are the stands I use\nWhat I mail letters\nAnd yeah you still to mail letters from time to time folks got metal shack here and there are you know it's not always a wire transfer using vale or whatever\nUh [noise] three three Seventy five or six so there are there are six steps other so are there are there are six forever stamps so it's a it's three dollars\nAnd uh the postage due was a three Seventy five so there's a Seventy five cent balance on one of the bombs that the the Joe Biden ...\nUh well I'm looking at the right to sue maybe trying to find a link to the story and give up on the list at that show\nThat comes a point I ... and what about the president the president last night you know calling for unity this one is that the Trump rally last night\nLet's listen to a little bit of the president and the kind of backed off this in a tweet this morning I I think the president is probably best to stick with what he said last night [noise]\nThere is one way to serve the largest agreements it's called peacefully at the ballot box that's when we\n\nFar to the larger national effort to rejoice divides and bring people together the media also has a responsibility to set a civil town\nAs you stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do\nBut also in fairness here uh you know the president and I I Would be not worth\nEvery saltier if I didn't bring up the fact that the president himself can be vitriolic\nAnd he can be offensive and he can be a little bully from time to time and also I like many aspects of the president in your face and saying certain certain things but there are other items that we can make you know a catalog\nOr where it was in very presidential already ought to back off and I'm Sorry those that think that that uh because the Trump and the the the right or not the left rather is against them and then anything from does in says is the best and right on and and in their faces I mean that doesn't make it right\nAnd I know there were many conservatives many of my conservative friends or whether the needy or not they were in agreement with me and it's like when somebody like the bulk of the president's policies he's done a great job on many levels we support is immigration policy we want the migrants caravan stopped but you know some of the rhetoric\nAnd some of the vitriol and some of the president's ah you know bully is tendencies I ill parallel or rival what the media does in some will say oh he's just responding to the media not always\nHistorically look back\nSo it goes both ways\nI agree the president just said hey let's settle things at the ballot box let's have a degree you only here but also to be genuine awe is to also recognize that the president hasn't been the best in how he's presented things sometimes or threats\nOf political violence aren't attack on\nOur democracy itself\nEngaged in the political arena\nMust stop treating political opponents as being moral a defector no one should carelessly compare political opponents to historical villain we walk\nAll sides to come together in peace and harmony we can do and we can do\nWay you see how nice

over Tampa Bay\n[noise]\nThis is the show\nThat President not happy with the New York times today well what else is new obviously on the New York times is very critical they've gotten some things wrong on\nThat some things they don't write A M ms well let's discuss\nThe president with two tweets this morning one at six fifty for this morning and then another tweet\nAt nine fifty seven this morning and as long regarding a New York times report\nWhen Trump phones friends the Chinese and the Russians listen and learn and this was a new article written by a Matthew Rosenberg and Maggie Haberman over at\nThe New York times so I'll get into some of the nuts and bolts of this in just a moment first though the president tweeting and responding to this the first one\nThe so called experts on Trump over at the New York times wrote along and boring article on my cell phone usage that is so incorrect I Do not have time here to correct it I only use government phones and have only one seldom used government cell phone\n\nStory is so\nWrong S. oh oh oh oh it looks like the old ... owns ... story is so wrong and that was before seven o'clock then just before ten o'clock\nThis morning the president tweeted\nThe New York times has a new fake story\nThat now the Russians in Chinese in parentheses glad they finally had to China\nClosed parentheses are listening to all of my calls on cell phones except that I rarely use a cell phone and what I Do it's government authorized I like hard line just more made up fake news so that's the president responding to what\nWell do this and essentially the um the cliff notes version here\nThe claim is that Maggie Haberman from the New York times climbing the Trump has been repeatedly told and warned that the Chinese and the Russians are listening when he is on his cell phone\nAnd Chinese spies Russian Spies you know we've heard about these weird a cell phone tower or emulate patients that are occurring in Washington or the shark device and the shark too I think it is now\nAnd it's essentially the ability to in a vehicle or wherever you are to have this cell phone tower ...\nCater where cell phones think that they're connecting to a tower but they're actually connecting to a private device which intelligence agency or could operate they they they're not cheap they cost several hundred thousand dollars these devices\nAnd then you could intercept the data the texts intercept the voice ah transmissions\nAnd well if your a foreign government or foreign intelligence agency well could be a treasure trove and there's been a lot of concern that with members of Congress and senators and house of representatives members and and cabinet members all over D.C there have been that these reports are that there have been\nThese mysterious a essentially cell phone emulate is or replicate is\nThat had been discovered in in orbit around in their mobile and they can come and go and disappear I get I don't think we've heard everything I don't know if anything has been intercepted if there have been any confiscation or arrests or you know whether anything he's been kept secret but the technology is out there in order to intercept\nAnd according to the New York times piece or speaking of Trump he's been warned repeatedly that the Chinese and the Russians are listening\nWhen he is on a cell phone\nWhether it is a personal iPhone or a that he continue using until last year and has held onto primarily because it has phone numbers listed in it\nThe page disappeared [noise] ten minutes later surprised I didn't get back on it surprise it was ever up in the first place for me to\nWell he's got a bunch of uh what is that he follows a bunch of people like that too he he follows people that the ... on his Twitter page the people listed as nosy follows are a bunch of radical leftists\nHey look as I say I don't even want to I don't want to put forth even the theory here yet folks I mean it's it's enough either I'm I'm conjuring sum up but I don't want to I don't want to give voice to them yet until I get more\nData here\nBut I I Do not have any doubts about things I think are totally possible here\n\nAnd just going to have to stick with me here in trust my my instincts on on being patient is going to be all kinds of time next week or whatever when this stuff continues to break and\nWhatever all happens um I I I appreciate the call I Know what you're saying a Susan over half of America gets more in welfare than it pays in tax I should save this for next week you realize these this is the congressional budget office numbers more than half\nOf Americans receive more in some kind of government transfer payment Medicare Medicaid food stamp\nSocial Security then they pay in federal taxes more than half one thing that this explains why so many people don't think tax cuts are a big deal\nIf your life is dependent on all kinds of government transfer payments welfare whatever you want to call it and tax cuts you think are going to lead to the government having less money than you're not going to be in favor of tax cuts so we've got half over\nHalf of America gets more and welfare than they pay in taxes they're going to understand here that tax cuts and I remember all the news stories about how the Republican tax cut bill didn't end up being that big a boon\nFor the Republicans in polling that's a major shift just since the Nineteen eighties there was a huge win win for Republicans back in the eighties and I think it still is to a certain extent but\nNot as big Frank in not in New Baltimore Welcome sure your Nextel up\nA rash thanks for taking my call you about\nJust real short here I think Mr ... dupe number one\nNumber two the fan was set up period that I think if there's anybody\nWhat do you mean to do what do you mean to do\nThat he was shut up by other people and or he there's other people that are helping to ah do all send all those things across the country which would be my last point\nIs that if there's anybody that thinks that man could have been initiated and follow through with all those mail bombs across the country on his own I think are delusional\nAnd that that that ban was just just a a set up just to a so CNN and MS LSD could ah swallow it and they did hook line and sinker\nSo when you say when you said do do you mean that the Democrats or somebody found this guy and are setting him up and he doesn't have any idea what just happened to him or that he has been can convince to play along and be a part of it which do you mean\n[noise] a little bit of both um we'll find out in the future I'm sure it\nWill ... that we we will we will we find out you said I'm sure we'll find out if we'll wait hopefully uh hopefully\nNow and so this guy was a joke if he was minding his own business going to strip clubs and a number and all of a sudden finds himself in jail and came out of his house when they saw him man with all that stuff on it and now is in jail presenting pipe bombs\n[laughter] you'd think that's possible\nA little little but more than likely\nI think he was doing was in on it somehow but it's still being we're up to do that he was persuaded do you think he was persuaded to take the fall if he was a dupe\nMm yes okay All right well well I I I'm Sorry what was that what were you saying\nI think he just felt that just to get his name in the paper he had nothing else better to do with his wife and a figure hey I'm going to make a name for myself and be on the six o'clock news and ah

guys are amazing what they do every day you know the sad thing about all of this ... you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explained that the minute but\nYou don't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve ... says the fact is he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what it was really going through at the time it was far worse than was reported\nAnd uh people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders if you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I Am I'm not going to do what the left does here Bernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans\nAnd Bernie said he was sick and by the entire you know anti GOP massacre here I and I believe him\nAnd I said that\nAnd just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House when Obama was president\nAnd as it did they came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but\nProtecting our elected president is is job one for all of us as Americans is our elected leader whether you like it or not an is what I said Mr Speaker you're going to have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas that is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean what ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world\nSo they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because\nUm there's this idiot on fake news CNN his name I ... what's his name John Avalon somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the
