attack on the Jewish community in the United states\nIn our history\nWe've also been now made aware that Jeff Sessions the attorney general has directed his prosecutors in Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh to seek the death penalty so this is going to be a death penalty case\nI Can't imagine what it must have been like Saturday morning of the tree of life synagogue\nThere were three different

when in\nAnd what time of the actually engaged so here's the\nTimeline this happens to be published by CNN on their website nine forty nine AM and anti Jewish or Jewish messages posted on social media can for this Robert Bowers\nThe gun\nAnd this was on this ... Web site which will get into a little bit later on and he rode on this Web site\nSo about five minutes before he went in so we must have done this on a mobile device logged in and he left a message I\nCan't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw your optics I'm going in ... takes a genius to figure out that he was talking about going into the synagogue\nTo them shoot the Jewish people inside\nNine fifty for him as I mentioned the nine one one calls started rolling into the Allegheny county emergency operations center nine fifty five AM a minute later to police cars are dispatched according to radio traffic posted by broadcasts defy\nThey are told one caller reports twenty to thirty shots her from the lobby numerous other officers say that they are responding about four minutes after that nine fifty nine or ten o'clock officer identifies himself by number and says he's on the perimeter were under fire he's got an automatic weapon\nAnd firing at us from the synagogue\nThen a moment later another officer says the one of her colleagues who can be heard shouting shot in the hand another officer calls for a medic\nSo I mean within minutes are responding we already have a cop shot so I and you know some are trying to say they should have gone in sooner again I don't have a firm grasp of what has is verified reality on the timeline\nJust after ten am an officer says every unit in the city needs to get here now\nDispatcher relays request to all available units man that that will give you chills every unit in the city needs to get here now\nIs broadcast two minutes later about ten of two AM officers on the scene request city and county swat teams and again they're not just sitting around waiting at the swap members\nAre you know typically on cell phone twenty four seven and they were available some are already on patrol or they're doing other duties and then they quickly assemble\nAnd get to a scene as quickly as possible different swat teams weren't different ways but a lotta times SWAT Team the truck arrives uh whenever I can get there but other team members are typically in there whether it's a their city or county issued vehicle they have all their tactical gear and their trunk\nOr in the back of their a SUV the body armor their fatigues a they're a high powered rifle scopes what are they they typically have it all with them\nAnd they'll respond as quickly as they can\n\nTen eleven AM there's a discussion among officers about going into the synagogue one says there has been no gunfire since officers initially arrive\nOnce we have the resources here we should consider going in now this is what and again I don't want to jump down and he wants throat or I don't want to jump to any conclusions yet\nI Want to have\nAn absolute grasp of the time is a hundred percent right but this is an area where there could be some complaints but remember I mentioned that we already had a police officer shot\nAnd that could have been fired from the windows are out at the police are responding but they they've already an officer was already hit on the outside so ten eleven they're talking about\nGoing in\nOnce we have the resources here we should consider going in now that\nIs going to give some people some pause and should the officers have gone in and made entry into the building sooner did they wait too long\nOr were they waiting for those other resources or a swat and those with more protective armor to show up when they should have gone in and of course this is going to be reviewed it's going to be up for debate\nUltimately you did a four officers shot here and I'm just not going to arm share this right now\nA market a Monday morning quarterback this 'cause I don't have all the facts and I'm not going to go on just the uh CNN timeline here until I Know all the facts are operationally of things we're not done properly or if they should have been faster or there could have been lives saved if they would have a breach the buildings sooner\nOr without technically swat showing up\nWell that'll be determined but I Can't sit here in this chair behind this microphone and make definitive statements because I just don't know at this point but that's a potential area which is obviously going to be looked at ten Nineteen am [noise]\nA a worker at the emergency operations center said nine one one calls indicated the shooter came into the lobby and began firing\nA ten Twenty one am someone says an officer fired up the suspect during the initial gunfight and believes the gunman may have been hit\nSo again I'm trying to reconcile an earlier incident so before swat arrived it appears that swan or some members of swat and again it's not like the whole truck pulled up you know I end up back\nOpens up and the officers jumped out like in the movies are on TV officers they started arriving at the scene individually some reports have some of the swap members arriving at ten twelve\nAt ten twenty five officers says suspects wearing green vast green jacket weapons slung around his neck\nAbout ten thirty AM so ten twenty nine to ten thirty tactical teams enter the Senate gone so was that too long to go in\nOr should they have gone in sooner if that is accurate and why did some of the SWAT Team members why did they wait so long to go in but at that point at that point though it seems that\nThe shooting was already done or the the the ... the eleven that were murdered it seems that most were already killed\nBefore even police arrived on the scene so I don't know and again I'm I'm not covering for anyone I just don't know but there's a chance that both of these deaths were committed before the police are certainly some of the swap member showed up around\nTen twelve but should they have gone in sooner than ten twenty nine and ten thirty that's going to be open for debate and I would say if this is the only information I have yes SWAT Team members should have gone in sooner if that's how long\nIt took and again when the officers start roaming the building and they're trying to clear areas and they found for bodies in the atrium area there was another person that was hit but still alive then a few minutes later for more bodies are found\nAnd it seems like this damage this carnage was was\nDone and it occurred early on now almost an hour later ten fifty three\nOn the police radio you can hear contact contact shots fired shots fired officer shouts that into is a radio and says that a man is barricaded on the third floor firing at them it seems that\nThe gunshots stopped that he that the gunman had taken up a a defensive position was trying to hide and then once they finally ousted him and flush them then that's when he engaged the police by firing again\nBut it looks like the the murders of these ... these are the these are Jewish people have a synagogue that the these are more front loaded toward a nine fifty for when the early reports started coming in\nIs or what it looked like a eleven those three so over an hour after the incident police tell each other there are negotiations\nWith the gunman he's been given orders to crawl out is not has not done so yet police say isn't a are Fifteen and a handgun they later find two more handguns and then all of it all for suspect puts his hands in view a few minutes later he gives his name and his age two police officers\nAnd then eleven oh eight officer calls for radio silence because suspected surrendering and crawling out of the room he was hiding in a suspect was hit was injured obviously not fatally\nAnd according to the police radio that's when a according to police radio he tells police in all these Jews need to die so that's the timeline as we have it and of course this is going to be studied it does not appear

three minutes left will get to what you want to hear this and it's coming up momentarily here on ...\n... when you're the president\nEverything you say and do what you where the way you look at someone any everything is under the microscope\nWith Trump he is even more under the microscope\nCouple audio bikes that I wanted to play from me Sarah Huckabee Sanders press conference from earlier today on the first news or in a long time I think since early September\nIf I'm not mistaken so little um altercation with Jim Acosta there was an interesting episode was Sarah Sanders and Jonathan Karl from ABC News will get into that in a bit\nNow with the president when I just said about the president being under the microscope whoever the president isn't with Trump even more so because valley's a different kind of president you different kind of guy and he\nClearly handles the media much differently\nAnd he's a bulldozer\nAnd he does things different than other presidents have in the past the president and I'm not saying that a lot of these issues and similarities didn't occur behind the scenes of laws\nThat Obama's White House Obama's administration they had an adversarial position with the press the press were locked out of many events the difference is is that Obama would not have these temp sore spots in front of the media\nA subtle say hey it's better to have this uh out in the open it provides a or the ability for everyone to see what's happening it it it opens up a green pastures horn can\nView what's happening and see what's happening versus what happens secretly quietly behind closed doors and the Obama administration and his staff talking about the media who they like they don't like I had to keep the media away from certain events that Trump does it in public\nFor all of us to see and you got to ask also then if we're able to see all of their Senate if they get sunshine and sunlight that what the hell happens behind the ... that could be even crazier\nThe point I'm trying to make is the president's tweets from this morning\nI've been very clear\nI Do not like the enemy of the people I think it's destructive I don't think that it is any place for a president of the United states to call the media the enemy of the people or\nThe delineation of the fake news is the enemy of the people by them you know he'll call CNN and then and and the NBC and MSNBC the fake news so it's actually calling them the enemy of the people because you're qualifying so to tweets this morning and again\nI just I don't think that the president should be engaged\nIn this type of Twitter activity especially under the microscope especially since we've had the pipe bombs from last week the synagogue shooting from Saturday morning the president this morning\nIn his first tweet this was [noise] see what what time was this a while and he had actually three tweets don't want to go over because the one this morning rolled out at a nose three am about twelve hours earlier\nIn the eight o'clock hour last night so Sunday night the president tweeted the fake news is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our country\nFirst thing that the president didn't was condemned the attack sloth in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media\nGoes on and then they they tango little further down the road here locally\nMinistry patients that major news networks first public statement was to blame the president and myself included I mean that is outrageous that anybody other than the individual who carried out the crown would hold that responsibility they\nSo there we go and you can tell she's riled up I'm In and she's a mostly affected by what she just stopped by the end the conversation but listen it's her job to\nActually have the president's back in and for his position even if she doesn't always agree I don't think Sarah Huckabee Sanders always agrees and I I I'm pretty confident she would not officially endorse enemy of the people if you have the opportunity\nHonestly say whether she likes it or not so I promised this audio this is this is crazy a Latino mother or a Latina woman this isn't the Houston area was on our way to vote\nWhen she was a verbally abused by a apparently another motorist who was taking issue with her driving\nInto lanes or maybe straddling the woman's name is Janet Sybrina do with her two year old daughter when a car pulled alongside rolls down the window and has some words now\nLook listen to how this transpired because this is not a liberal language but it's okay we won't get booted off the air\n[noise] [laughter] have\nDrive in America hospital why because today\nShe says Trump is supporting your legal cousins today bitch bitch banned travel\n... miles was okay\nMy country yeah it's not mine\n[noise] yeah why not try lanes anyway missing\n[noise] it's all the pictures you like you're ugly you eat again when you make up as\n[noise]\nThe guy pulls away I think he might be a gay white male attacking this Latina who said that your cousins are going to be

Lederman she is the former president of the tree of life synagogue so we're we have the current leader saying the president is always welcome former president saying no we don't want the president here\n[noise] it just shows you know there's a split among those that belong to the synagogue I just don't think\nI I I just don't think that a position of saying the president's not welcome I don't think that's warranted\nAnd the price of the United states coming to help the community heal and try to use the cover all he's divisive views that terminology the words he uses a not help I I just don't think that that that has a place I think the president or the the the current head of the synagogue has the right\nThe rabbi Jeffrey mind he has a right at the prison United States is welcome any time and I think that's the right answer and not just a an answer I think it's the correct thing to want to end the correct thing to say\nYou know the president was it was some criticism that he did mention that hey this might not have happened if they had an armed guard and listen back to the fair comment just not immediately\nAnd I think that the Trump lacks that mechanism on sometimes timing of when to say what and I fundamentally agree with him I agree with that I guess what if they were armed parishioners or in this case the\nCongregants of the synagogue a that may be an armed or individual can stop this person or if there were security in the lobby or at the synagogue when you had three different congregations holding three different services\nI Do agree but I don't think I Would have ruled that out as one of the first things that I said in response to the massacre [noise] but I thought it was interesting to hear just two different takes on from coming to town I think it's the right thing to do and I I think the president first lady should make their way\nAnd try to help with the healing process in Pittsburgh eight hundred\nEight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine in the nation wide number eight hundred three eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine if you agree disagree want to get on brings something new to the table another area of agreement that I have with the president\nIs the sending in troops to the U.S border now it has been up uh\nI don't want any type of military confrontation and most likely troops are not going to be arm or if they are they will not be permitted to fire at migrants that try to break into the country and that shouldn't be the case we should not that I I\nI mean that an image of some kind of a you know I'm like I had a massive Kent State like massacre I I don't want to\nSee that but the president is a hundred percent right to protect the sovereignty and our borders and one was eight hundred troops last week now it looks like they're going to be\nA about fifty two hundred troops deploying to the southern border\nAs this migrant caravan keeps\nRolling north saying that they're coming in ...\nQuote will reinforce along priority points have been free so as to enhance border patrols ability to harden and securing the border\nThat's terrorists are shorter a that's Terence oh Shauna see who was an air force general and he's the head of the U.S northern command\nAnd this was at a press or in Washington\nAnd that's the deployment will be completed by\nThe end of this week\nI have no issue with is the president has all the right to protect our borders and the sovereignty of the United states of America\nWe want immigrants we're a nation of immigrants you'd do it the proper way you know form a mob chain and a caravan and say hey we're about seven thousand strong now or I saw numbers fourteen thousand for whatever the number is\nJust move your way to the southern border and say hey we're coming up like it or not no we don't like it and you're not permanent\nNot Xena phobia that is not anti immigrant low it's anti lawlessness and trying to smash your way through our border and the president has\nAll the rights to request troops improves and now we're up to apparently fifty two hundred troops and man is uh James Mattis the secretary of defense I'm also it said\nUh this was a this morning as well that ah the military has already started bringing in equipment and those Jersey barriers to assist the troops are to try to afford this caravan from trying to\nPush its way into the United states I us we have a couple of calls here eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine\nThat tell you get on any comments on Pittsburgh uh oh some new details on the pipe bomb or with the fifteenth bomb I Believe\nDiscovered and then you know those that are saying oh false flag oh the stamps won't even canceled walk as I said last week there's an explanation for that off and we'll get to that and just a bit how about we grab hurts in Danbury, Connecticut hurt your next on Schmidt welcome\nThank you and I appreciate your taking my call I also appreciate your attempt shut down all actual honesty uh as someone who's more on the progressive side I appreciate your loving to fetch the through the finest while your colleagues Maggie uncomfortable with that I'm having said that\nA\nCouple of things I just point so I wanted to make real quickly nope as far as the people who are coming to our border from Central America they're actually coming as refugees which means they're ... they're very claiming to be refugees\nSo that makes them entirely legally entitled by all of our treaty to add to the United states as refugees\nAnd what makes your argument about not coming in here illegally disingenuous does the administration of Justice Department have her first we reduce the number of judges to hear those refugee asylum cases legally\nWhich for these people to get back up at the illegal checkpoints and finally out of desperation a lot of them will come over the illegal checkpoints and immediately turn themselves in\nA while the current law I live in a car loan let ... let me let me let me ask you let let me let me take this step by step first of all I'm not being disingenuous I understand\nThe the right for someone to claim refugee status\nAnd the ability to a historically have a hearing the problem is we we usually you deal with a ones these Tuesdays fives these these okay a hundred or so this is a mob\nThis is a in many cases a scripted situation many of the individuals that are being interviewed they've got the same story claiming to be refugees well I'll tell you what if you feel unsafe in Honduras in water you apply for refugee status\nAnd try to move to Guatemala one country up or ... what about Mexico wanting to stay in Mexico than\nThe fact is is they're using in many cases and I truly believe there's\nThe guise of I'm In danger I'm a refugee please help me they're looking for that as a way to get into the United states just for economic betterment not necessarily because there weren't any type of danger for the most part current I I think I see and most of us see right through this\nThis organized a pilgrimage which is politically motivated\nOr economically motivated and I'm Sorry it's not like they're running to our back door because someone's chasing them through the woods with a knife\nIn the district agree to disagree on that one guard I don't think that are a bunch of stragglers mostly women and children to the mountain and nobody has been able to identify a single Middle Eastern or in this for for less than five thousand and they're still among\nThe ... I never said by the way I never said that and I'm not one of the\nConservative talk radio guys that you know foment did that story and I even called that out that wasn't I'm sure there might be a middle Easterner but there's it's not I mean there there could be but I'm not using that as a talking point to try to\nForce the caravan no I think the caravan she'll be four to because they're trying to enter the country illegally and they're trying to storm our border with our hey we're getting in come hell or high water but I've never been one to jump on the bandwagon and say oh a\nThere are middle Easterners in there they could be terrorists in their ... I've seen absolutely zero substantiate Asian that there's any Middle Eastern or or any organization will ever to bring middle Easterners and that might have the various purposes and I brought that up but last week I brought that up by numerous times\nI appreciate that and by the way they're attempting to come here legally as a violent shaking refugees they are not attempting to come here illegally\nBut on our side by reducing the number of judges to hear these cases we've created a at a crisis that didn't need to exist and they were coming in more than one reason jerseys for a long time now but that's actually if you are coming in now than there are\nNo I'm Talking about the ones that are trying to claim refugee status than current I'm just I'm ... I'm not buying I'm not buying the story on a mass wholesale level that they're all refugees they just looking to make more money there's a better life in America\nSays on all did you hear when I said I said well then if they're coming from Honduras why are they seeking asylum in Guatemala or Mexico on age you\nKnow the law according to the international law that they can pick and choose where they want to go\nThat the the country that helped them the first time that they cross through should've kept them there are sent them back\nWhere they have no right cause they thought about signing limits about they want to come to America because there is a better life better that my tax dollars when\nThey're ... they're looking for whatever the financial entitlements whether they're looking for handouts or welfare or whatever or they're looking for a better job that pays higher wages whatever the reason is that why they're coming to this country the bulk of them with the sobbing the cover story of\nOh I'm scared and I I'm a sympathetic I get I understand that there are legitimate reasons for asylum I'm just not buying a mob of whether it's Seventy five hundred now or fourteen thousand the second ... whatever the number is other stop buying you know all these stories\nAnd compassionate person if there really haven't ... you know that's legitimate but I Wish some of the other news outlets would explain that they don't have a right to come to this country they have a right to go to the first country they stepped in and figure it out from there\nThey don't want to do that they

it's an organized event essentially and it is not\nFilled with people I totally believe that are in fear for their lives that are fleeing a and if that's the case then like I said you go to Guatemala or you go to Mexico and then try to seek asylum in no this is about coming to the United states and you've got a massive caravan and ...\nUpset that the language that Trump and others are using that their invaders invading the country if you want folks if you have like a caravan that was four thousand then five thousand and Seventy five hundred now and again like late last week saw numbers

invaders and the the the the talk of invaders him is that insightful language and they're trying to say that Trump a is calling the migrant caravan and invasion\nAnd the synagogue shooter also said that uh he likes the fact that it's being called an invasion really\nI'm telling you there are many people like me that again are are just absolutely heartbroken what happened\nAnd I want the worst things to happen to that shooter but still just because he says he likes the term invasion I Can't also describe it as an invasion when you have all those people are trying to bust into the

... seventies WFL age ... to clear water\nAre going to tip the balance of power in the house we have been putting on some some key a congressional candidates and very important districts\nIt's interesting all up there were four hundred and thirty five so they're all important\nEvery ... every one of you listening to my vote I don't care if you think your congressmen as safe or not you better get out and vote because otherwise you don't vote that's pretty much a vote for Nancy Pelosi and if you have a Senate race going on in your state that's vote for Chuck Schumer\nThe second potential outcome is a split decision split decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate gain a couple seats\nAnd Nancy Pelosi them become speaker and Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam Schiff as a chairwoman\nAnd let's say Gerald ... chairman Elijah Cummings the chairman and it's endless investigations into one of the most unbelievable things that we're watching unfold here\nIs what we got this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think even when I warn you of what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides your nose Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic\nYou know dirty air dirty water kill children throw granny over the cliff\nWhen you think it can't get worse it gets worse and the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted\nWho the media in this country is pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox for thirty seconds because it's every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats\nAnd if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible for the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that while the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of\nTrump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel and the same people you know what I'm saying Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness\nBut it also does show a desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate you know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about polls a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand\nSeems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not I'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to keep the progress that we've had\nYou want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight and one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results\nIf you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it the worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home that the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls\nIs because they get it wrong so often just two years ago the exit poll showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan in Wisconsin anyone both of them\nAnd the media nobody there were candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else I remember my first break at\nAt the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls\nI said there's no way these polls are accurate\nAnd he goes why do you believe that and I told them the story about two thousand and four where the media again the polls came back and George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida\nOhio Pennsylvania and it was over and Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five\nAnd reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back in you know other polls where they've been wrong\nTwenty four team you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally\nInaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seed difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they call toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself and\nThe only thing that can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media and twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting well it's pretty clear Hillary I think it's going to the next president Frank Luntz who's reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen\nAnd I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening\nTurned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data I had read the same data so if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you\nBut the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen because they pay the Trump since the day walk down the escalator with lawyer\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about\nThe polls and don't let the polls influence\nYour motivation here but it's not only were they wrong in twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster\nOh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen one year before the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival\nBecause in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the get government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more the expert such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty four team Republicans are going to pay huge price\nWhen the twenty four team midterms rolled around Thirteen months later\nThe G O P not only won back the Senate they did it\nWith a nine state Senate landslide how remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but uh yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into a all out melt down depression collectively\nBy the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world all that but an old for it's happened in fourteen and it happened and sixteen\nNo reason it can happen in a tea you shouldn't do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on\nAnd maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it if the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six the this is a\nThis is a white latch CNN was reporting that night anyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty fourteen no very\nFew of us saw that we could wait I'll give you the let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had\nForty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now\nThe G O P claim they similar one point advantage lead in ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggest that narrow or advantage for Republicans

after the terrible shooting\nIn the synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday and no one in the media and all the people in the media there actually blaming Donald Trump for this it's outrageous it is ugly\nIt is twisted it is sick it is the family story and frankly the there's there's gotta be some legal standard at some point that you ought to be able to sue\nFor such slander and an libel those comments like this anyway Jeffrey Myers the pits Pittsburgh rabbi who watched eleven of his congregants gun down during their Saturday services saying he's now become the political targeted and\nHe's receiving hate mail for saying he would welcome the president to his place of prayer it's unbelievable anyway you had all these\nWonderful people they're going to praise God in a temple and their gun down\nAnyway the organization told reporters they now have received three phone calls today a loan from an identified man swearing and angry at them they wouldn't elaborate exactly what the caller said they did tell reporters that it was anti Semitic and\nPro Trump while the guy Bowers that was responsible for this murder and terror in the synagogue was anti Trump\nAnd his run derby or has said the ambassador to Israel as a Bebe Netanyahu has said you know they've never heard any one president ever say stand up that if you destroy our friends our allies\nIn Israel we will destroy you which by the way is the way it should be you don't get to kill innocent men women and children in a synagogue\nIt's unbelievable the ... the race the rushed to politicize pretty much anything and everything that is Donald Trump\nYou know the rabbi said on CNN Trump is my president he's always welcome to visit you know ever since yesterday morning the fake news fraud media's been circulating what is just the nation is why that somehow\nPittsburgh's rabbis didn't want the president to visit and pay his respects after the massacre\nRose tenant friend of this program she was on with those yesterday you know she exposed this is their hateful garbage a broad that it is and\nSaying those comments come from you know some fringe group but not from that not representative of anybody the mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community the Jerusalem Post today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever\nThey're not it's not mainstream it's a political group and they want to give them any attention and then anyway and it was so they invited a I guess and interviewed rabbi Jeffrey Myers he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful I mean how pastors and priests and\nYou know people the costs are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know it takes a very special anointed person to be that kind of person Donald Trump's my president the president of the United states\nYou know in uh Boulder thrown from Kevin McCarthy store you know you could see the hostility about all things conservative and Republican you know I call for security and peace and people do take out their differences at the ballot box\nBut that doesn't stop them they're so desperate to get noticed so desperate to help their democratic allies and friends when one week from today it's pathetic frankly it's slander and then of itself\nNow we've got to get to the point in this country if you get slandered you ought to be able to sue and I have a chance to win or you have to prove the absence of malice well how about an absence of research because if they ever listen to watch they see a very different Sean Hannity than the caricature that they paint\nWhen do you notice it was ... to us in the news media I could not believe I was on the front cover of the national Enquirer it's on stands all over the country they were fair to me they actually quoted me a hundred percent accurately which never happened\nUh because I think they realize that this is an important race for the future of Florida that's good news for a\nWhile but you got you running for Rick Scott's seat Rick Scott a would love to see him we did a great job as governor of Florida and I'd love to see him go to the U.S Senate that too is a tight race\nLet's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved\nWell this guy was posing as a developer or he went and he paid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that's an illegal gift and end up itself Andrew never ordered it\nThis developer wanted a zoning change in Tallahassee and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release were that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby a buddy of Andrew saying really appreciated mayor coming through ah why\nWasn't he got arrested isn't that buying influence and corruption\nWell there is an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's going to happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that arranged that New York job gets paid for for night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAnswered and pay a dime of that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under wrote a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaigned on twenty sixteen that was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you can't report after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks CYA so it only interested in a port\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas uh one of the lobbyist attorneys release that said the public so forty\nThree hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation but Sean you tell me what other reads and what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it snow out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew get one picked this guy knowing\nThat he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum he is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders which is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement\nTargeting Israel they actually say Israel the genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of Andrew strongest supporters Andrew to this day opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nAnd when a Israel fought back against the Moffett fats and may ah Gillum blamed Israeli said oh they just use those attacks as a free tax it'd be able to do a disproportionate response of\nWhat what is in a relief endurance organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida ah they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice\nAnd that the police needs to be funded they paid they said the U.S is the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor or replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their word with socialists principles that are so radical it'd make Nicolas Maduro wash\nSo he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifest there so that just to hear people leave and what they're doing is endorsed them personally and uh it would\nA tape of him I guess that was discovered it\nI'm John the costs than our top story at four thirty President Trump and first lady Melania Trump visited Pittsburgh hospital to meet survivors of the synagogue mass shooting\nBut White House hasn't released a whole lot of details in terms of exactly where the president will be going and what are we doing we do know is that he will be visiting with some of those who were injured in Saturday's attack including\nA couple of the police officers for individuals from that attack including two officers remain hospitalized two of them in critical condition so the president will likely be visiting then we also told that he would likely be meeting with local Jewish leaders to express his support and condolences on behalf of the entire nation\nAnd the president has a daughter and son in law bunker and Jared Kushner will also be joining the

see millions and millions of dollars coming from former New York city Mayor Bloomberg who is supporting all of the Democratic candidates in California and why not I mean Governor Brown is doing such a bang up job with the people that state\nAnyway he joins us now congressman how are you\nShone I'm doing well thanks for having me on\nI have identified myself about six seven races especially in Southern California Darryl ... old seat Dana Rohrabacher seat a Duncan Hunter see that really are seeing a fortune in your seat thrown at them in terms of\nThese are really being targeted at a tipping point races at in terms of the balance of power in Washington one week from today uh how much money is being thrown at against you and towards your opponent\nWell I think I'd go back to that old the old commercial for a kind of hot sauce in New York City because that's what's happening in my district a New Yorkers are throwing a ton of money out here I think we're now number one in California for most money being spent in a congressional district\nOr that's not something I Want it but uh that's what I got and ah but we're running well we're uh we're doing what we do\nAnd what do you think the ... what was in the bottom line is they're throwing money and they're running negative ads because negative ads work and money helps get out the vote you know they'll use that for you know people knocking on doors they'll use it to tax people they use it to reach out a hundred different ways\nAnd I put you at a decided disadvantage now\nI kind of believe in freedom of speech and spending ones money the way they want is freedom of speech but why Michael Bloomberg former New York city mayor is so obsessed with California's congressional races\nAre obviously he doesn't like Donald Trump\nI think that's probably the reason but he's also looking at districts that he thinks he can he can do something there uh this is this has been a held by Republicans for very long time and we're going to win the seat\nBut ah yeah there's a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's coming in here it's it's gotten to a saturation point now when people are just so upset\nI think people get wet up with it and they tune it out like I Do I mean they they're not going to listen to it any more\nThey go from their mailbox to the trash can and then they bring their at their bills and there are other male a male and it's it's just so much out here right now you can't turn on your TV or in your mailbox\nThey gained seats in the Senate they lose the house Nancy Pelosi speaker the worst case scenario it's Speaker Pelosi Senate majority leader Schumer\nSo you know we have the power to make that not happen right now the ... they it all matters whether or not you're going to motivate your friends\nWhether you're going to get to the polls whether you like the progress do you think you're better off than you or two years ago all the important issues we talk about you know what it matters or going to have two years of endless investigations possible impeachment we're going to have the rescinding of our tax cuts by the Democrats\nOr we're going to have open borders sanctuary cities eliminate ice a and keep Obamacare every everybody as I mentioned earlier is running against running on health care on the Democratic side I'm like\nYou're the same people that ruined the healthcare system with three big wise keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less\nSo my advice is you know let's go out there and everybody fight hard if everybody does their part if everybody listening to my voice goes out and vote and if you understand the vote for any House Democrats vote for ... polo see\nAny Democratic Senate vote as a boat for Schumer\nThen we should have a pretty good night a week from now but the
