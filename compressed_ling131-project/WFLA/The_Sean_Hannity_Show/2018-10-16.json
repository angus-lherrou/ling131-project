F. L. A. dot com and\nAmericans have more\nNative American DNA that Elizabeth Warren will be fine I mean I I saw this I saw this\nIt might've been on the Drudge Report but I saw this headline about two hours ago and I printed it out it's in my pile but let me see if it's on a [noise] okay see that's what I see this thing but it's it it was it was a piece that I was reading and I thought I highlighted I probably did but [laughter]\nAnd I'll find it a second but essentially it's that many other Americans who don't claim that they're Native American actually have more Native American in them a them Elizabeth Warren and I\nWitnessed something with a European European Americans were or Americans with the European descent actually many have more Native American DNA them a Senator Warren [laughter]\nSo my executive producer just said hey Schmitt you probably have more Native American I I don't know I've never done one of the twenty three and ...\nI Know vaguely or basically what my lineage is I Know that there is some German there's some Russian woman named Schmidt is German there's Russian is German is from Hungarians polish so I and I know that um\nMy mom's side of the family my dad's side of the family they rolled over around the Eighteen Seventy is Eighteen eighties or through Ellis Island so from from eastern\nEurope so there there's a chance maybe I could have more Native American [laughter] let's let's set this whole thing up and I I don't mean to make\nA mockery out of this yes I Do I don't mean to joke about this yes I Do but I mean if if if a less of a war and really thinks that\nVince DNA test which shows her\nAt best at best one thirty seconds the Native American but even the experts says that it goes back maybe six to ten generations so going with those mathematics\nSix to ten generations even the Boston Globe's peace said that a lens above Warren is\nOn the long way and only one [laughter] and one sounds in twenty fourth one slash one zero one or one zero two for one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American and by the way the Boston Globe Anna correct themselves then they had to issue a correction inhaling\nActually pretty embarrassing here but the the the original the original a percentage from the Boston Globe piece was that she was one and five hundred and twelve\nNative American and they had to do a correction here looking at a correction dude or math or a story about Elizabeth Warren miss staying the ancestry percentage of a potential tempt generation relative it shouldn't be one one thousand twenty fourth\nThey had it at one point five hundred twelve or ah yeah won five hundred and twelve so double it and they they were they ... they had a half wrong so I'd be folks [noise] the experts the expert\nThis bustamante guy he ports Elizabeth Warren's family tree lineage going back six to ten generations\nAnd if it's ten generations back it means that she's won and won sours in twenty four not a third not a half not an F not sixteenth no\nOne one thousand twenty fourth [noise] ah that's incredible\nThat she really she wants to hang our hat on that this is a proof I mean there is absolutely laughable fights ahead and we get here [noise]\nOh by the way of done some research on Native American DNA requirements which uh I have a whole little red dot CA than I Want to go over as well you know I'd love to grab phone calls if you are Native American\nAnd what are your thoughts that Elizabeth Warren might have Native American between six and ten generations back\nAnd then she claimed that she was Native American\nOn job obligations on job applications and and trying to get a professorship incidentally in this documentary them a whole host of law professor say oh she's the best use the greatest oh she didn't get the job because of this I mean this is such\nA P R missile that they're trying to write the listing ship on any doubt\nThat she overplay their hand or was fraudulent\nIn her description of her Native American heritage you do this folks when you plan on seeking a higher office was a she's a shoe in obviously from Massachusetts and her Senate seat continuing but this clearly is a rehab attempt at\nAny damage at all\nThat might be a swirling around because of her desire to run for the presidency and seek the Democratic nomination in twenty twenty there's no doubt about it now\nI said we have audio I Want to grab your phone calls as well so any thoughts on this Elizabeth Warren story the timing of this if you've seen the five\nAnd a half minute a documentary I Love to give your thoughts on that I've got a couple of audio bites from the documentary I Want to play here and just the bad ah if your Native American I mean any aspect to this happily take your calls eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine she has a T the whimsy Betty purple polka dot but TV and a little bitty tiny bit of Native American blonde according to the DNA tests which again really [laughter] ... it's\nA it's it's hardly the kinds of proportional blood on the line that you would use to try to qualify for everything in the affirmative action space I mean it's gotta be kidding me here\nI mean even the Boston Globe documented wars past controversial claims for their article now let me give me a couple of quotes a on a and from the Boston Globe piece which uh which broke this today ... this quote from the Boston Globe peace where Santa correct because their\nTheir numbers were were not uh astronomically high enough on how little potential Indian blood she has so that a correct story area quote questions over warns ethnicity have dogs her censor twenty twelve Senate campaign\nThat's one GOP operatives found archival stories in a Harvard Crimson\nOf Harvard law school or the the the the the newspaper a and it was the Harvard law school spokesperson ... Native American and the Harvard or crumbs the newspaper I as a way to show that the school had a diverse faculty\nDuring her academic career as a law professor she\nHad her ethnicity change from white Native American at the University of Pennsylvania law school where she taught from Nineteen eighty seven to Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd then a Harvard University law school where she was a tenured faculty member starting in Nineteen Ninety five she was visiting professor at Harvard during the Ninety to Ninety three academic year in an interview\nWith the gold published last month\nWarren explain that she identified herself as Native American in the late Nineteen eighties and early Nineteen nineties as many of the matriarch of her family were dying and she began to feel that her family stories in history or becoming lost folks that is a load of crap hold on a sec\nOld I was at DCA hear this sound right here\nAnd\nThat's the best detector going off that is the Elizabeth Warren BS detector so a couple of excellence she made those claims folks\nTo get hired at these prestige just schools that were under intense pressure to diversify the staff\nAnd faculty that's what's going on here and well [noise] didn't work I mean\nThey they didn't hire her but at the University of Pennsylvania had to go to great pains to explain why and hired a white woman over qualified minority candidates so obviously they didn't view her as part Native American it sounds like they weren't a you know falling for her her racket\nThe court and you can't build Howard Franklin and candy bridges are moving up to speed no so that is true for it on the ... are veterans expressway us Nineteen and a three and one remain problem free as well just remember that there is ongoing roadwork in Tampa and dandy boulevard between the east end of the guinea ...\nAt the candy news radio nine Seventy WFL a\nRecord warm temperatures this week both overnight and in the afternoon lots of sunshine Seventy six in the morning for Tuesday Ninety three for a high rate chances only ten percent\nRecord high of Ninety three for Wednesday be close to that in Ninety two with plenty of sunshine add some clouds in the afternoon safer Thursday Ninety two for high low Seventy six only a ten percent chance of a shower\nVoters overall easterly lower the northwest wind in the afternoon cannot sees one or two a light choppy waters I'm new to Italy cheaply they're all just deep derby British radio nine Seventy WFL a [noise]\nLose I'm rich Dennison President Trump toured storm ravaged areas of the Florida Panhandle in Georgia by air today\nI've seen pictures but it's hard to believe when you get above it in a plane ticket\nLast week's storms blamed on at least a Nineteen deaths one or two suspects who is now in custody after four men were killed in the town of ...

F. L. A. all over Tampa Bay\n[noise]\nUnless ... list every day at ... dot com\nFrom his little song here which might be politically incorrect but hold on I guess not in the second verse some news that has broken in the last ah\nHalf an hour or so here [noise] a CNN is reporting\nThey're claiming that there are two sources\nThat are claiming that and by the way this is a flashing on average now George was a little while ago I in big red letters a big red fought the reports are the Saudis are getting ready to admit\nThat Jamal ... the U.S permanent resident who\nFor the Washington Post at the Saudis are going to admit that he did die in their custody\nWell I mean the the salaries they lie to President Trump is President Trump was on the phone with the Saudi king and all we had nothing to do with this well then they uh initially like you know what's happened here folks\nIs the Saudis had no idea that this thing was going to explode into this kind of a story\nThe Saudis had no idea that this was going to be an international press conflagration of oh my God they killed vis vis a vis a Saudi national or who as permanent us resident status his kids are us citizens\nAnd he was just popping into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey to get papers for a marriage license to marry his fiance\nWho is waiting outside so here's the story according to what CNN is going to report the death was the result of an interrogation gone bad so they were planning on interrogating him\nAnd something happened now when they go\nA couple of other stories and sources that are popping up here\nAnd if you click on\nIf you go to the drudge link that takes you to Jake Tapper as\nA Twitter feed so top a drug right now in red font report Saudi to admit killing journalist during interrogation so again with the Saudis things have gotten so out of hand they had no idea of this thing was going to be this humongous of a story\nThe world stage and listen any journalistic organization worldwide they're not going to stand for this and they're going to make a big deal at one of their own was taken out by a a a government by a governmental entity\nSo that's going to be the claim and I'm sure they're going to try to paint it on one of the interrogation team members that it went too far it got out of hand this wasn't our intent but\nThey realize that they were backed into a corner that they couldn't deny this 'cause initially it was denied that I Know I we did nothing I he we didn't kill me didn't die ... this is there's no way of the Saudi king tells is the President Trump for the phone call my pump a on on the way to Saudi Arabia or secretary of state\nSo the Saudis realize oh my God what the hell of we've gotten ourselves into\nOh hang on to say oh my Allah or what the hell we've gotten ourselves into so they ... they clearly had to come clean and now if they're going to do is begin to\nThey're going to absolve themselves as a whole and they're probably going to put it on ah some of the interrogation team members and then they'll probably make that individual individual sacrificial lambs there'll be punished they'll probably be executed\nWhen in fact uh they probably were doing exactly what they were supposed to do\nMake him disappeared like a Roach Motel\nTo show each activity doesn't check out to the the Saudi conflict so that I'm telling you\nThey realized that oh we there's low we we are in deep all this we can't carry this charade and ms lie on any further we've got to just come clean [noise]\nAll right so I promise that I Would come back with a little music and of course we're talking about the whole list was Warren's situation and I've got the Trump audio from the rally back in July which is a key here and it really is fascinating audio to listen to\nEarly actually did say it but I just don't think that that little Biddy in the we'd see potential sliver\n[laughter] is worth a million dollars when all is with the war and wouldn't even qualify for Native American benefits in fact I have I have a whole listing here of Native American DNA requirements which this is fascinating\nAnd I'll get to that coming up it's probably going to be our number two and again we have got a lot of ground to cover we've got to talk to some folks who have their homes destroyed or in the panhandle we've got to deal with the latest on the show the situation has now the Saudis going to come clean first let me squeeze some coals em thanks for your patience on this\nLet's grab bud Jamie is in Huntsville, Alabama\nJamie around ... welcome to the program I\nI taught how

have to have an ancestor own that trouble role\nThe registry ... right and that's that's some of the woman to go over a year or next hour\nBecause it's really fascinating on the requirements and you know I've got a lot of information you know regarding Cherokee Nation\nOr and and ... there was talk about her being part Cherokee and also of Delaware Indian heritage so I Want to get into all that tell me I'm Jamie thanks for the call let me grab Deborah in Nevada a deadly urine\nHi Deb\nOh hi how are you going going well you're going to we'll get about forty seconds\nI just call and tell you

test and it shows you were named him well first of all the results which she fully controlled with this bustamante I wouldn't want independent analysis\nI think there ought to be a secondary and tertiary test just stop loss but getting a second opinion\nBut even if she is at best\nOne thirty second which that's a stretch because the expert says that there's some ... with his expertise he's claiming that there is an American Indian blood DNA going back somewhere between six and ten generations\nAnd if it's ten generation that's where you get that she's only one and one thousand\nPerceptive actually one and one thousand twenty four percent Native American which is\nAnd I'd probably far outskirts of the solar system folks I mean that's that's crazy and let's do this and every line is jammed here but the question is I think it's a very good question\n[noise] with that should Trump\nHave to pay the million dollars even if there was a tiny shred or or should the benchmark or the threshold be that she has to be at least recognized as a Native American all that tribe based on the percentage that they require\nNow all tribes are different folks\nI could do the whole damn show others threat because there's so much and this story is so fascinating and which made it even more fascinating is why the hell she thinks that this is a good thing when the evidence is so scared that it's a tiny little ... in the way the TPP would even ...\nWhy she thinks the ruling saying that the documentary the five and a half long documentary which I didn't even get to that audio yet\n[noise] a couple of things you and then when he was on a fault but the question is should Trump have to pay a million bucks for as I was pointing at all to grab a here we go I'm not making this up is not listen I'm just not a joke from pow wows dot com\nI Swear oh those are the power say Indian term so uh from Taos dot com which\nIs a it's a Native American website with a whole range of information so it's run its a Native American website and\nUh on the website Native Americans are the people will consist of one of the more than five hundred distinguish tribes that endured till date\nAs small sovereign states or with the United states present geographic boundaries and it was a whole history here a certificate of degrees of Indian blood CDI bees are issued by the bureau of Indian affairs the IRA an agency under the United States Department of the interior blah blah blah and then it just goes into\nA what is the tribal blood quantum requirements [noise]\nThey ... percent you have to be fifty percent\nIn order to uh be from the the mic his suitcase fry those are the the Florida or\nIndians are they run a lot of the casinos hard rocks for instance because silky a there's a Mississippi band of Chuck tall I was I'm not going down the whole list here but you've got a Indian or groups that require fifty percent one and a half blood caught the meaning one of your parents\nUh is is a Native American then you've got a twenty five percent\nSo I'm looking for the tribes of which Elizabeth Warren claims to be of dissent and she has said Cherokee and Delaware\nSo looking here are looking for Cherokee and\nSharing kink [noise] okay I found Delaware so the Delaware Nation\nA which is a Delaware Nation Oklahoma which is one of her claims you have to be twelve point five percent one a blood clot demeaning one great grandparent\nShe doesn't even remotely qualify for a fact twelve point five percent not even close\nSo then she also claims Cherokee now if I look down and I'm looking for Cherokee now for a Cherokee that for a living will descent I'm looking for Cherokee on my list and I thought I had a highlight here we go uh Cherokee\nNation is six point two five percent or one sixteenth blood quantum I guess she doesn't even remotely qualify for a fact [laughter] you got to hear this this is from a Fox Report Warren might\nEven be less Native American than the average European American this is what I was mentioning this last hour that I read this uh before the show Warren might even be less Native American than the average European American\nRepublican National committee spokesman Mike Reed set in a statement today Monday he also called a twenty four teams studying the ports Warren's claims in perspective\nThe study published by a team of scientists in late twenties fourteen and featured I'm In New York times amounted to the largest ever genetic profile of the U.S based on one hundred and sixty thousand people\nThis study examined the average Native American ancestry four Americans including European African and Latino Americans according to the times report New York times fairly new I talked\nAbout it but if Trump closest it won't be the failing New York times that according to the times report on the study which can be found on the national institutes of health website\nEuropean Americans had genomes that were on average Ninety eight point six percent European point nine percent African and point one eight percent Native American\nFor Latino America's the average percentage of Native American ancestry was Eighteen percent well African Americans average was point eight percent\nSo if Warren is ten generations removed from a Native American ancestor she would be known or Native American than point zero nine percent\nThan any of the group study the research so on the outset there are actual Americans that\nAre more Native American that her claims that don't even remotely there knowing or even climate so\nShe might be less Native American than the average American of European descent to buy more Native American in European American uh individuals or who descend from Europeans [noise] [laughter] [noise] so they\nThink it's a good idea ever tell this\nHoly crap I let me grab some calls here 'cause phones are loaded I still have to get to the Native American DNA requirements some fascinating stuff came up and research later to earlier today and then later on this hour I Want to play the Audi I got us a few excerpts from the little mini movie that she put out\nShe's on the phone getting the details from the doctor go there's a researcher boost the modern day like oh my God I I I I I'll prove it to be truthful though you're not in such a stretch\nI to the phones let's grab Scott in Michigan so Scott\nShould Trump path a million bucks if it's just I don't think they really don't almost undetectable amount of Indian DNA\n\nAnd your reasoning do an expanded oh just simply a she simply doesn't qualify by of the tribe rules\nRight and that's what I threw that out the fact that it's so minuscule and even if you go by the end I that's why I read the tribal rule rules for the two tribes which he claims to have been allegedly associated with Cherokee Nation and then the Delaware Nation a and she doesn't even fall anywhere close Scott\nThanks for the call let's grab my Kevin Page thank you buddy page Arizona Michael is next Don Smith hello Michael\nAid on our air all's well go ahead\nYeah hey I oh I don't think she has to pay up either or he has to pay up\nIt's just ridiculous right so and ... apparently you told sue that you are Native American correct\nYes yes full blooded\nAre so you're from Arizona while you're Navajo what what what kind of Indian

favorite charity\nWhat should the threshold me again\nThere are different tribes there weren't even different types of charity tried you know some there is a potential tribe which shows that all she needs some lineage again I ... we don't have all the exact details fear of what the claims are\n[noise] before I go back or you don't let me go back to court because this is fascinating a little more on Native American DNA requirements\nAnd uh the difference between percentages and uh just a a lineage requirement hang on we'll get to that in a second as men if this is somebody this fascinates me but what is even more fascinating is why the hell ... with Warren\nDecided to with this gap miniscule evidence\nDoubled down and make the claim look see I\nA Native American wedding is potentially as little as one and one thousand twenty four [laughter]\n[noise] not a sixteenth not he's not on a corner one and one thousand twenty four on the outside if she falls or if the descendants or six to ten generations back\nThen that brings her to the to the one in one a\nOne and one thousand twenty fourth between six\nAnd ten generations ten being the outset a and six being just one thirty second even one thirty seconds doesn't qualify as I get to the man for the second because\nI mean Democrats are scratching their heads saying oh really it's not like she's a quarter or an eighth sixteenth ... this is really big him this is digging deep uh Rebecca is in Fort Myers Florida Rebecca you are on Schmidt welcome to the program\nThank you\nAnd Rebecca your thoughts are should Trump have to pay the million bucks to her favorite charity\nWell the whole thing is arguing Symantec if he said if you can prove that you are part\nIndian she's got him she proved that now for the rest of that it's absolutely ridiculous the small amount it couldn't you know no affirmative action yes you have to be a certain percentage to get anything but he asked he said if you can prove that you are at all you know then\nAnd she I mean one what is it that one thousand and twenty four\n[laughter] yeah I guess it's something that\nShe got him he didn't he didn't say you have to qualify for your tribes whatever he said you have to prove that you're Indian she proved it he's got to pay up to her charity\nOr well wording but Rebecca let me come back at you with this should there have to be an independent verification men\nWould probably be within his right to say okay so you use this uh this bustamante guy certainly he's got a very impressive resume and and see me but if you don't mind we'd like to do two additional DNA tests\nAnd see how they come back to it's like a second and third opinion if a million bucks is on the line do you think that there ought to be a a a ... a control or should there be a at least verification from a different uh testing source\nI don't think there's anything wrong with going out and get him verification if she thinks she's Indian or he's going to stand by it and what did she care how many tests are going to be done and then I was going to come out that she's a snow again that's all she needs because that's how he worried now that\nYou know I mean yeah tried to get anything affirmative action and all that she doesn't qualify for any of that that's ridiculous she's probably as much American indian is I Am which is miniscule which is pretty much matter but if it were and it said if you can prove\nTo be it looks like Ninety grand but it's a whole lot better than than a million dollars\nOn us I think I I think there would be great if you actually pay them off that you know whatever your mouth comes out to be\nAn error you know you could have had a million dollars but you're you know your Democrats want a shelter for air quotes

that he is a a distant relative of the U.S as I said to show that was like a famous a Middle Eastern arms dealer\nBack in the Nineteen seventies and eighties and it turns out that he is a descendant ... it's it's a distant relative ... but the Saudis apparently are going to admit that they killed ... show ...\nAnd they get to claim that they said this interrogation team in to interrogate him and that during the interrogation something winter rye something went very very wrong\nAnd remember the Saudi admission allegedly is coming after the the king the Saudi king told President Trump in a phone call we had nothing to do with his disappearance of his death nothing so now they he lied to Trump\nOr less the claim is going to be well are are the the king didn't know or the king is just found out since so is it can get a cold front back and say oh never mind I'm Sorry yeah we kill the\nBig big mistake just they got out of hand it was just a you know it was like a a good fellows type interrogation thing just went ... went bad it's just that day they took I took a bad turn\nOh my God uh\nYou know the you know the the reports last week there was some there were some reports that they that they called in a like a forensic a doctor\nWho saw him up a again last week we had a a unconfirmed report that yeah he was murdered inside the the Saudi conflict in Turkey in Istanbul and that they actually cut him up and removed him in pieces\nAnd they use the bones saw to take them apart which meant that is that is gross that is disgusting\nSo one of the consequences biggest a President Trump said if they killed Jamal ... he said this on sixty minutes he said this on numerous occasions the last couple of days that if if they killed ... that ah there's going to be a heavy price to pay\nYou know the sun and the Saudis they came out like tough guys the Saudis over the weekend and you know this morning [noise] ah they they were rolling out essentially threats\n[noise] that hey if you pursue is if your if your claim that we killed just show he or that we're gonna we're gonna a Jack up oil prices\nSo the Saudis have essentially they threatened before now what what apparently this mission which is coming and I I Can't wait to see how they actually handle this\nUh you know 'cause also President Trump and said that uh there were role killers potentially if Trump suggested that there might have been rural killers responsible for whatever happened to cause Yogi is Washington Post columnist missing since October second\nAs as President Trump left the White House all the way to tour the devastated Florida have panhandle parts are today\nAnd uh uh he did land obviously earlier today and at Eglin air force base for his uh aerial view which focuses on believer in fact I'm going to try to get a hold of some folks in the panhandle uh later this hour to get an update but President Trump on the way the Florida Panhandle today I said\nThat he had spoken to the king and the king firmly denied any knowledge\nHe says he doesn't want to get into king sol moms mine but says it sounded to me like maybe these could've been role killers\nSo is that they're going to more fed into the role killers are these Saudi intel interrogators that that killed to show the inside the embassy so it it was an interrogation allegedly gone wrong\nIt was so wrong they had to take them apart when the bones saw and a ... member him and and carrying them out in the end result spaces\nOh All right so I I Wonder what the administration what Trump is going to say uh and how the Saudis are going to admit\nThis how are they how and you know ... when does he has pumped pale left yet uh you know my palm pales going over so\nI you know is I mean ... I I Believe is he's got to be a ... I thought\nThe president said he was on the way soon so I Would imagine ... en route to Saudi Arabia\nWanna mess that the Saudis they had no clue that this thing was going to explode like this that this was going to be an international incident mad that they miscalculated is now the question is do they plan on killing him or did something really bad during the interrogation\n[noise] I'm guessing they get a pennant on one of the interrogators and there's going to be a scapegoat in someone's going to take the fall\nOr even if and I don't think it's out of the questions they plan to take 'em out and make 'em disappear anyway thinking this would be just under the radar and nobody would do and not an international stories when it comes down to\nAn eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine also I think what's at play here is the Saudis are coming clean because\nThe Turkish must have some audio and video prove as they said last week and the whole claim and I'm not I don't have an apple watch\nI don't have an iPhone and Android guy bought last week\nYou know I was saying man you know it sounds like that the Saudis have the the conflict bug that they had an audio and video a inside the conflict to capture this or\nThat some videos taken and somebody leaked it whether they have a spot if someone on the inside and then it came out oh no he transmitted his death via his apple watch\nAnd then the story came out that that's technically impossible\nThat you might be able to control your cell phone from your apple watch but you can't take video with the watch and then transmit that or or being that to the class so that that doesn't add up from a technological standpoint from what I understand\nI ain't hunger and James is an apple not my uh and James my a technical engineer a James has an apple watch Adam iPhone and he's\nAs he says I Am correct because apparently his phone his iPhone was left with his fiance outside of the conflict\nSo I\nA lot to cover final half hour plus or some Trump on sixty minutes last night although\nLot of stuff to cram and don't move back in a moment you know [noise]\nYou're touching it

C. A. as people with preexisting conditions have been paying more yeah higher premiums and they were paying before\nMany lost the doctors that they loved taxing Americans who chose not to use it which by the way the individual mandate would tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that taxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big redistribution scheme\nNow if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors and we've talked about health savings accounts and we also talked about\nAtlas AMD Dr Josh amber and Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country\nAnd what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all if you could afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a a direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child\nWhere are you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do they are the innovators in this upfront pricing lower costs no government mentally All right well that's true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know\nFor example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would that would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nNow health care is local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear as the calorie is not coming from Washington to save us\nNow if we wait for solutions from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other six cause problems themselves and that's exactly what this loop and the movement does is it eliminates\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our ...\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but it's it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the healthcare after the
