really are as Ted Kennedy I don't want to start on this phone calls in a minute or my beef with NBC News here\nAnd again there were some disclaimer is or there there was more to NBC's report on MSNBC this is Kate Snow Kate Snow national correspondent\nFor NBC News and she anchors one of the weekend shows I think the Sunday NBC nightly news\nAh from New York and she had to sit down with his Julie sweating it who\nAre apparently the FBI bucket even mess was sweating it got yes [laughter] I mean each some Democrats have asked that they interview her but you know we know that the FBI is interviewed for we'll get to that and just a bit here but the sweat Nick ... has massive credibility problems now\nNBC News they play an excerpt of the interview during the NBC nightly news or a portion of one ran a longer interview on MSNBC the deal is though is that millions of more people will watch the NBC nightly news\nAh interview and that package that clip on the NBC television network them all watch on MSNBC on cable\nSo while they might have asked some questions or have some just climbers on MSNBC they didn't do the same with the clip the theme ran\nOn the NBC nightly news last night first of all my question for NBC News is why the hell would you give the sweat and make the time of day anyway you have other mainstream outlets that that think that this woman is quarterly she has a host of legal issues\nA restraining order from an ex she's been accused of defamation when she's had a bunch of legal issues apparently and a lot of other outlets are staying away from this or this woman uh CNN they had a avid already on\nA ... to discuss the issues that I if I have time I'll get into that but ah before I go to phones here from the NBC story you know she was backing away\nShe's she's she's not backing away from some of the claims she initially made\nWhen Avon lady first came out with that big reveal of this new third individual accusing Brett Kavanaugh and she's a she's backed off of some of these claims so NBC News of the cage so they said they couldn't be sure\nAh that ah they reported that that this sweat and they couldn't be sure the Kavanaugh was one of the boys who assaulted during a party and the Nineteen eighties so that that's a back off\n[laughter] that that's that's a change in the story\nSo remember this this sworn affidavit that came out last week from this this Julie sweat Mick\nHey how's it going I'm old well\nI have a\nCouple of points I'd like to make about Christine Ford um my theory is that\nThat for her this was a get rich quick schemes because she likes to travel we know that uh she lied about her fear of flying and she likes to fly all over the world and go on vacation and all this kind of stuff I'm\nLike ... one of the reasons I Believe that if because she was on the verge shaming Leo crying I'm through the entire testimony with her little mousy voice and\nShy or by the way I talked about the boys last week and the vocal fry and can the card dashing sandwich I\nMean I think we're all shocked last week when we heard open her mouth go ahead sorry\nSo she did not have one tier string down her cheek through the entire testimony what five hours or something like that\nAnd\n... and I think she stands to make a heck of a lot of money and her or go funding is up you know over seven hundred thousand dollars\nYeah I stopped watching when I when I heard it was over seven hundred grand I stop looking less and there were some times where she did get emotional you're suggesting it's a money making screen a scheme

I got something else you I'm In I'm trying to keep track of all this crap\nThat there's there's another accuser there's an accuser that sent a an anonymous letter to senator Harris' Kamala Harris\nSo I get a ... they don't want to go the phones you only got a place in ... but if you haven't heard about this this Kamala Harris deal anonymous letter more accusations about cabinet\nOh isn't that very easy with a non ... letters what about the story up in Rhode Island at a cabin on a on a boat when I met quickly fizzled the way I mean who's everyone's grabbing for a chunk of the action here it's really just they were ...\nBy President Trump here then we'll go to your phone calls so thanks for your patients President Trump was leaving the White House today this is on the south lawn of the White House before he climbed aboard marine one talking about the latest with the capital situation\nWhat was yours on as you can be a\nBlurry versus the thirty five years and then somebody comes and they say you do this or that and they give three witnesses and they were you wish is is that this boys do not corroborate what she was saying\nIt's a very scary situation where you're guilty until proven innocent my\nLife my whole life by version of it is just a joke Ruben guilty but now you're guilty until proven innocent that is a very very difficult to say\nYou know not to mention how memories are affected over the course of a three plus decades here are the fact the stories are changing\nI the fact that you had the initial accuser that that foreign or didn't originally named capital and they said come on in a marriage counseling session and twenty twelve was\nI mean there's just so many I ... I Know how memories work you know how memory is you know how over time stories get changed than shift get embellished\nAnd then one of the clip from the president here\nAnd the president was asked a question by a reporter Juana you say to young men\nIn America with what's going on right now\nWhile I say that it's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be you'll see something that you may not be guilty of which is a very very very difficult time [noise]\nWhat's happening here has much more to do that even the appointment of as a ... or just it really does you could be somebody that was her figures Hi ally\nSomebody should accused you of something that doesn't necessarily have to be a woman as everybody say what somebody would accuse you of something you're automatically guilty what Israel you are surely guilty until proven innocent that\nOne of the very very bad thing is like\nThe president's at the White House before getting a marine one earlier today Alison idol you know the problem here is when you have these squarely stories\nIt affects\nAnd it adds that tape in I think some people's eyes those that make real and true and honest accusations that's what I find to be most polling here especially with the sweat Nick this third accuser that came out with her uh you know daffy stories in her backtracking now\nIt is potentially causes people to not take seriously those that really are victims of sexual assault and that's just flat out disturbing some rangers\nThat was going to falls thanks for your patients Ben means in New York City a ban what borough you in Manhattan or where are you\nOh I don't even know what boroughs what Bernie more over here I could be a Rhode Island for all I Know it's\nAll by Ben you're on ... go ahead\nOh first of all this and I love your rendition of that's all because I Do believe that fools are rushing period so that was great I'm listening to Democrats they couldn't prove sexual assault\nSo he pulled off of drinking card okay maybe they should all the economic all tough um we you know I Will find a strictly to be a problem you know ah looks like he's got it under control and tell you every ... has got a bar because I work there and I used to serve drinks pretty committee members of\nThe fact that he got supposedly he wasn't in a bar fight but he threw ice or maybe defending his friend you know the fact that he was you know doing that you know I think I Want to vote for him even more now because he's showing some gumption 'em\nAnd all of these senators these especially that Kamala Harris yuck about sloppy floppy Larry I mean this is this is like having a speedy trial which is basically first one to testify which that's it we don't want to hear nothing else that we don't want to see you know what his first one to testify wins this\nIs sloppy Laurie like everybody in the house and Senate Congress half of them more than half of them are lawyers\nAnd they don't have a rule book about how to be a good lawyer how'd it go all the evidence you know they just they are I Believe I Believe you sort of you obey all believe that's ridiculous All right\nUm and and and now nobody's talking about this uh this this ... year book I don't know if you heard about it or bought bosses your book that's coming out all over the Internet YouTube where she was a binge drinker hung out with older girls All right\nUh nobody's a lot of MS LSD and\nNone of those well as the ... there there there are rumblings I got I got a pile of all of these the you know there's the the story by the way of the Safeway where there was an Internet mean rolling around the Safeway didn't exist until years after she claimed to have run into more judge\nThat apparently is not accurate or the the Safeway

don't think we have any idea and then also you have well listen you've got a a series of ... the run down here\nIs you have\nThree Republicans you've got the obviously Susan Collins you've got Lisa Murkowski of Alaska colleges of mania flake of Arizona now or none of them are facing reelection this year and of course flake keys exit the process he's leaving\nYou've got to Democrats though that this is what's important here is you have two Democrats\nWho are in red states that are trying to keep their seats and those two Democrats are Heidi Heitkamp she's from North Dakota and you have Joe mansion\nThe third of West Virginia so how how how are they going to vote when ultimately there in red states and\nThey're trying to get reelected and how would it be perceived\nBy a there are electrode if they vote against Kavanaugh so there's a lot of interesting things is at play here are regarding the president's if you're just tuning in there's a New York times\nBull last piece the New York times or just smack in the president in the last couple of hours the New York times out with the peace\nClaiming that the Trump has misled for years about how we made all his money that the ah the Trump but companies have engaged in tax fraud and especially in the state of his father of the New York times I mean really just mastery going after the president\nUh there's obviously no why shocker here are the New York times has consistently you know an attack this president uh you know some of the details I read some of the New York times piece last hour\nAnd you know I'd ask hey where they held it all the documentation come from well are you\nThere is plenty that we don't know exactly\nBut this is what they do say the New York times says the investigation also draws on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records bank statements financial on its accounting Ledger's case disbursement reports invoices and cancelled checks most notably the documents include more than two hundred and tax returns from Fred from\nHis company's the various Trump partnerships in France while the records do not include the president's personal tax returns and it'll be a little about his resume business dealings at home and abroad\nDozens of corporate partnership and frost tax returns offer the first public accounting of the income here were seen for decades from various family enterprises\nAnd it says what emerges from this body of evidence is a financial biography of the forty fifth president\nFundamentally at odds with the story Mr Trump sold in his book says TV shows and his political life\nSo the New York times here they're they're calling Trump an absolute liar they're saying I Am back to the story and Mr crumbs version of how he got rich he was a master dealmaker who broke free of his father's tiny outer borough operation\nAnd parlayed a single million dollar loan from his father\nAnd then in parentheses quote I had to pay him back with interest into a ten billion dollar empire that would slap the Trump name on hotels high rises uh casinos airlines golf course of the world over and Mr Trump's version it was always his godson gumption that overcame setbacks\nFred Trump was simply a cheerleader\nSo their claim here is that Trump has vastly under sold the financial kick start that he'd gotten from his father\n[noise] and then of course there's the allegations of all kinds of tax fraud and wheeling and dealing on his parents a state which they received a billion dollars from and if they uh they ... the low allegedly shorted the governments are\nOf the hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes with the New York times alleging a Trump tax scheme back in the Nineteen nineties\nThere are also reports that based on the New York times reporting here\nCNBC is now reporting that the New York State Department of revenue that they are now looking into the allegations made\nBy the New York times in this piece and again ah you know don't forget when it comes to tax fraud there's no statute of limitations that I don't know how to states work but with the IRS if there's fraud\nThem you know the whole oh you don't need to keep your tax returns past seven years and then I heard in recent years if you know for years uh but if there's fraud or that they can't go back\nA ... you know the statute of limitations et cetera but again that

questioned the sworn Senate testimony of Christine Ford who accuses the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault at a high school party\nOn sorry unless it's going to pass if ... if Joe Manchin if he sees Collins and Murkowski voting for Kavanaugh he'll go vote for capital St probably with Heidi Heitkamp I'm Joe Donnelly already said no who knows if he changes his mind but he's on record saying he's not going to do it [noise]\nUm so we'll see\nAnd you know everyone's trying to make a big deal the president was laying out the case about what is you know\nBut we now know fact should matter in this particular case and in the case of any allegation and I want to get into what this whole means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is that obviously\nAll the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it those that rush to judgment eliminated all due\nProcess all presumption of innocence that is the Democratic party today for getting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump\nNominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about\nYour rights fundamental rights that have made this a stronger country and I actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page\nA tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and\nTherefore he got as well as from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance that have covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already done\nWith the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate I Want the American people to have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with\nWherever they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations they're just going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already that they in the case of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date\nA day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in\nYou know then we learned about mystery mirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people they found out this Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was professor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nWell that kind of puts that case to rest\nAnd on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been in ... braided rather quickly at that that particular event\nAnd the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe cereal drugging almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties but as you said almost on a weekend basis\nWhat happened where young boys in these prep schools would be ... young girls teenage girls\nAnd lining up in the halls and raping them and then of course she gave for names to NBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person the backup or story one of the names was dead another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is\nAnd they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week prior\nHow does that become news and yet that is what the media now does that were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well well they weren't\nExactly wind up in the hall um while he was in ... I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people\nThat's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women young girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens that regularly\nAnd was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official\nA teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug young kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that\nYeah but the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nPolice documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way disqualifying for someone to send U.S Supreme court [noise]\nUntil I only need and has the Haitian because there are a lot of allegations at any point really are about how he behaves finance dry\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration released late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel an ex boyfriend of\nProfessor Ford's uh was the California professor\nAccusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination former boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the Ford\nNeither mentioned ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believe was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman I had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office in further claimed afford never voiced any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on seemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment\nAnd services that look these are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the day\nShe said they were for people that couldn't corroborate her story none of them can corroborate her story\nMost don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged\nAssault said it didn't happen\nSo at that point\nYou've got to presume somebody's innocent\nYou don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the for people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to ask the same questions\nAnd if they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there is no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to\nA lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor Ford but I I mean professor Ford is now told their story multiple times and\nI've got to believe and assume that they're they're thinking that well her story hasn't changed she just said it last week before the Senate Judiciary committee um you know it's just [noise] I I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means\nBecause what it means matters\nYou know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that matter Lindsey Graham is saying\nInsects accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor for it and I I think the the Republicans held the actually did something well\nI think they handled it with the level of seriousness a topic like this deserves and we'll see what happens in the next couple of days and who's going to vote which way\nA democratic protesters by the way of solving a GOP

November especially back in the Nineteen eighties when we did see a K to develop in the Gulf of Mexico and make its way up into the Florida Panhandle so we still can't let our guard down we still have

where Republicans led the generic ballot just to give you some historical context\nBut in mid September it was fifty two thirty eight and I know Nancy Pelosi seems confident she's out there I'm going

that's how far back they want to go\nAnd so I don't think it's going to be the story of people say but you know they don't have a vision for you they don't have a plan for you there's no discussion

didn't happen and the stories change about well they're putting drugs in the in the punch and boys are lining up almost on a weekly weekend basis to rape girls are lining up in the halls while he was around the punch bowl when he gave out some red solo cups\nThat's what that evolved into\nYou know at what point is there no shame here at what point do we not understand how deeply dangerous this is\nFor every American because we're throwing due process and the presumption of innocence literally out the window Newt Gingrich is with us a former speaker of the house with thirty four days away from an election best selling book Trump's America\nThe truth about our nation's great comeback well I guess that's on the ballot and thirty four days how are you\nI'm doing well and I think you know\nYou can't have shame if you're only interest is raw power and that's what we've seen a Dianne Feinstein deliberately holding the letter\nWas about raw power of the fact that you have a democratic senator who says if you're for Kevin all your complicit with evil such raw power or the kind of smearing dishonest\nQuestions and accusations that we've seen that raw power\nAnd that is what this election is about the selection will decide what kind of country we are\nTo Iraq how how many Americans are really comfortable for this kind of character assassination dishonesty and all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's going to be in it that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've seen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really too with the Democrats that would've considered voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh will only do it I Believe if in fact there's enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and\nSenator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England as we get most of the week and his media tour which is second to none so how does this end up\nWell I mean I think in the short run that I I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency\nA judge Kevin all of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been a smear treated with a\nVicious personal in fact all those things I think means that the Susan Collins the world is going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday and he'll be on the court but the deeper underlying lesson that all of us should learn\nAbout who these people are how they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope that that stays for very long time\nLet me ask you what thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president\nFor the first time in forty years you ran on something and you've got the entire caucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America and that you would you promised you would vote\nOn ten specific items in the first hundred days of what you did accomplish that task and Republican for the most part with a few bumps pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota\nAnd he's laying out the case that if you want results of a team called Republicans and if you want resistance\nYou've got a team called Democrats and he's been laying up and and you see it and the number's been people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening I think the president has set the stage now to pit\nAnd spent the last five weeks telling us what's coming next\nWe got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence said like you said America's coming back you know what I'm saying we're back yet because we're not\nWe still have a lot of work to them but we're coming back and now you have a chance for the president's leadership and I think this election ought to be about which kind of America if you want us to be you want us to keep coming back keep creating jobs\nYou want us to control the border to shave our children from MS Thirteen gangs from central and promote ...\nAre you prepared to be part of a team to one's constitutional judges not radicals I think if we got campaign could be stunningly successful and we could have as much fun on election night as we head into thousands of\nWhy I mean I hear a optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you\nI think it can happen I Believe it's winnable I Believe the Republicans can keep the house I think that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans can defeat Joe Donnelly in Indiana a a a Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nA Claire McCaskill of Missouri I think they can beat Heidi Heitkamp I think Martha ... a great candidate out in Arizona I think Dean Heller can hold the seat Nevada but I think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power they're\nShown course now that's probably have campaigns\nBut we've got we've got thirty five days a year to go out and when\nAnd and I remember and you remember 'cause you were there two thousand six team two weeks out I Do have you with Megan Kelly and she's telling me how we're going to lose so then you're gonna lose Michigan we're going to lose Wisconsin I said to her we have to alternative universes in my universe\nI Believe the average American is so disgusted with this resistance oriented left wing radical Islam I think the average person knows when when you hear Democrats say they're for Medicare for all their time to destroy Medicare\nThey're talking about destroying your health insurance they're talking about bankrupting the country\nAnd I think that we just have to go out and wage a campaign and I must say\nPresident Trump is doing as good a job of getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen and I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hard working decent American\nHis disgusted but what they just saw happened to Kevin all his is committed\nTo a work ethic due to a better future and as the Democrats get more radical I think you're going to see the Republicans continue to move a you know for example a\nGovernment run health care means tax paid abortion well they're very few places in America over there is a majority for your tax dollars paying for abortions and I think we have to be fair to tell the truth play into it in a direct way and if we do that we're going to have a very good election\nI got to take a quick break from our nation's capital more with Newt Gingrich on the other side later on Joe diGenova Victoria Toensing and much more as we continue from the swamp from the sewer it's Sean Hannity show\nBy the way if you like me and you hate weak weak coffee I hate it or those big liberal corporate corporate coffee brands they're the worst ah and you want the best coffee you've ever\nFrom the Florida central credit union free checking traffic center a stop and go right across our Franklin bridge into downtown Tampa where we had an earlier Bragg North on two Seventy five right near Ashley\nMight want to use the candy bridge instead to support a sponsored by ... smart security lights at Costco replace your porch light with a maximum security like maximus gives you instant notifications on your smartphone when someone's at your door even talk live with them from anywhere anytime maximus\nIt's easy to install it keeps your family safe at your own maximum security light at Costco page current news radio nine Seventy W.

years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney the way there is no we won the election what's the difference and the ... the means but I think the left\nSo believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would\nThey they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious

where it's just not going to vote\nAnd write it comes down to three I mean Mitch McConnell I had been a real warrior and pushing forward look though at a hearing grappling not only that takes up the Democrats you're exactly right and then they could we could go if we would have had like ... or ... or ... I think he can hear\nThat we might not ... ... ... and I say that not because I had any faith and Democrats\nUp because they have political calculation than mine you have your mansion looking at a date or\nFive thirty percent margin that people want to see happen often from five thirty percent margin people in North Dakota once the Kavanaugh confirmed it would be political suicide\nOr high camp or ... or ... or you're not vote for the nominee don't ever get people to get their humor lapdog but they might do it out of their own political South Africa\nA loop Beckley right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and mentioned but I think I don't think they go that way a less Collins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins and and flake or or Murkowski in like\nOnce the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri because if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean\nJeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters again\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah I mean [laughter]\nDon't get a real does wrong principle is man that bans on their values\nAnd it was a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater's a conscious of the conservative and it you know if he

accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a wild and that happens all the time in these investigations and you know what\nWe didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general was California She's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chain do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh committing some lurid sex acts is there no corn left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating that can particular that if in fact she you know she made these statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations\nUm you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this I Know that we have now we examined every single case in every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like\nThere are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview but they are today anyway\nThe eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two and\nNow the last minute because they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidents in high school\n... well\nI think um what has to happen who's truly sweating it is that the Senate committee after the\nConfirmation vote occurs needs to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitting false affidavits and for perjury\nIs written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee and the confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that this ...\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from\nMaking false accusations there is no substantiate issue for her story there is no substitute education for Mr ... near a story and I just want to say something that I Know\nAre probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied them like her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is a lot for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to you may be Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then she said\nOh I there was genuine surprise that remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes together a radical left wing activist the resistor as a lawyer this is separate hats that were cast by the way who said well Paula\nJones only spent ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the case of Al Franken\nBut I I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes well ... I didn't know that but that was very nice of you if you offered that I didn't know we should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional rules\nI I'm a I'm a very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy with except that I can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried that\nThis audio is for your review and not for broadcast Internet posting or distribution of other ... the equality original on his property by aren't menial Washington DC\nTalked about self introducing new Medicaid claims in Virginia and helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more in line to go family care dot com that's real family care dot com we'll call it for three four six seven eight to five nine for Medicaid plans from up to my health\nCrimes cases here's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety now why is her story not include her going to those people\nBecause if she had done that if she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up\nWithout anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know 'cause we're talking about the we all know that there are real evil predators there are people that do murder\nAnd rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think that the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously they handled it professionally they imported every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats they just they just now have pushed this so far into a ... ... ... ... any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever\nAnd we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act or react I Would assume was probably ... people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believes everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborate and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is nonexistent the shorter than happen that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and picking them apart are supporting them there's another problem with her story listen she said that they there was music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned the music up so nobody could hear her\nAnd then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what you think these guys and it just turn the music ups and one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down I mean there are so many flaws\nAnd what she does say I just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back more with Victoria Toensing\nJoe diGenova next and then your calls coming up final half hour we'll just do all calls eight hundred nine four one Sean\nHey listen if you have sunspots well our friends at Shawnee engineer so they came out with their brand new product it's this sunspot correct her now it's everybody's go to a product especially after summer it gets rid of sunspots aged ...\nAre describing it as an incident\nThat somehow shooting\nBy one of the employees and\nGross says done was involved in the shooting but didn't offer any other details [noise]\nFrom the forest central credit union free checking traffic center we're still seeing big delays on the Howard Franklin bridge from a crash north on two Seventy five just north of\nFour straight approach and the right lane is still block there began to purchase also heavy too if you're considering that for an alternative to support a sponsor by Ashley home store discover saving said Ashley help source Columbus Day mattress sales for one final week you can receive zero percent interest for six years I'm ...
