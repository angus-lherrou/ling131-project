Smith but there are times where like you know what good for him you know I said something similar because I'm sitting there by this microphone every day I'm calling balls and strikes as I see him\nWhether you agree with me or disagree with me\nListen and figure it out as I go along\nBut the fact is that I agree with Trump I a hundred percent agree that you have to take a stand you got to let this caravan no they're not coming in if you've got a stock of the border with support troops\nAnd it seems like we're going up or from the fifty two hundred it seems that the president seemed to say something that are up to Fifteen thousand troops are going to be said to the border so I was able to glean that\nI think the president said up to Fifteen thousand might be stationed at the border of course in logistics in support roles are not an actively or you know a barricade and keeping these migrants from coming into the country but Shepard Smith\nYou know he had said no the migraine care of and they're not they're not coming to you this is not a Halloween pool I listen I I I don't want to trivialize it like that too I think the caravan is coming to the United states to you know invade your house and\nTo ... I don't\nI don't think that's a I have the ship is correct in that but still we're a country of laws were a sovereign nation that has all the right to protect our border and the president is one hundred percent right that it is it's his duty as the president to make sure this doesn't happen\nI mean we have an audio bite of of Obama back before he was president he was Senator Obama from Illinois and he was talking about you have to immigrate to this country legally\nYou can't just a bar John in Obama's said this and I I don't want to plug city here I'm sick and tired of a double standard so on this Trump is one hundred percent right\nAnd as far as you know it's a lot of this a caravan and don't be scared of them was again I'm not scared of the caravan I just want our laws and our borders protective that's all\nI'm asking for\nAnd the president was asked by reporters as he fear mongering Alison I Do I think that the caravan is rife with all kinds of bad actors and do I think the bulk or or there are many MS Thirteen gang members or Middle Eastern terrorists I don't think that's the case but\nCast set aside you don't and I ... I don't even use that as an argument it's just we're we're a sovereign nation should be able to protect our borders and you just can't bash in our back door and say I'm coming in\nThat's what I Would stick with it or not drum up you know some of the bad actors\nThat have infiltrated the allegedly other care of it we have all the right to the federal regardless of you know if they're all good people that just want to come to the United states well guess what you just can't snap your fingers and Sam coming in\nSo I I don't think the president is really fear mongering I just don't think he needs to talk about the you know all of the band element which I I think he's exaggerating a little bit\nI and as far as I and I was talking about I see the phones were jammed up here again a eight hundred eight zero one aid I still give them a Halloween pile eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of the nation wide number eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine is how you get on the program and then regarding his commentary and again I joined the press or a little late as we're coming on the air at six minutes past the hour as the syndicated radio shows do\nA and the president was was talking about the DACA apparently and that if President Obama could uh uh essentially a bring us DACA by executive order that the president can cancel birthright\nWhich the fourteenth amendment provides for via executive order I from from my standpoint I'm not a legal expert I'm not a lawyer my wife has a and I've got lots of lawyer pounds here I've done a lot of reading on this obviously the last couple of days and I I just don't you can't compare\nThe fourteenth amendment and taking what's in the fourteenth amendment and trying to issue an executive order I don't know I don't think you you can't compare that\nTo dock I think you're dealing with two different types of produce here apples and oranges are however again I I I agree I don't like the anchor baby situation I don't like illegals coming into this country\nAnd and a woman dropping a kid out of nowhere and suddenly that kids a U.S citizen I'm Sorry I don't think our founding fathers I had that in mind with\nThat with that said with that said\nLet me be very clear I think that the president if he does issue an executive order essentially turning the off switch on elements of provisions of the fourteenth amendment it's going to be ruled unconstitutional the constitution allows for it\nOr do I agree with it or in all senses no ill illegals coming to the country and having a Ken I'm Sorry I don't think that kid ought to be a US citizen automatically but the way our constitution and the amendment the fourteenth amendment to the constitution is written it allows this I don't agree with it\nAnd if Trump does try to pull the executive order it's going to be shot down or in in the federal court system it's going to be shot down on the federal court level the appeals level and ultimately the Supreme Court level I'm just telling you the way it is\nAn eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine to nationwide number here on Schmidt eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine if you want to get on we'll go to phones coming up in a bit I've got the Halloween pile but of course Trump just breaking news with him making comments to reporter so I wanted to jump in\nWith the caravan and the fourteenth amendment debate which I obviously the extent we handled extensively on yesterday's program\nThe Schmidt roles are momentarily and hang out for my Halloween ...
