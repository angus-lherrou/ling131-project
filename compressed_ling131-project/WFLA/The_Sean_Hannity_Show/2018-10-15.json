used in showing that Republicans more enthusiasm the Democrats in the lead up to the mid term elections I think the Kavanaugh hearings says awoken people to just\nHow vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics to the past with the Republican Party which you're intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox or you know a racist besides you just you know the the phobic sober folks kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time Sean and a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then I work in a back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Orange County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spiced up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen to them and looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend and and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks um and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that\nThis was a process of the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their life and you know the reputation or ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is redundant uh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnace today just care about their own political agenda\nHowever misplaced and wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country\nOr they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down\nInto endless investigation and likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republican celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the\nAnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host\nAnd a parasite at this point they're the same thing\nThey have ginned up this rage or not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rape it Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe'd been he's been called trees as they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapist or whatever sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this that this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do well\nWhat do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't beat that by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how in a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible uh for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals' and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to ruin the accomplishments of Donald Trump which have been incredible\nYou know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than\nBrock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not just made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to\nMaintain that prosperity 'em and add money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved just squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWhile I did like Kevin McCarthy introduced which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments that is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age and the health of some of the justices um ... there's no doubt that will be vacancies in the in years to come in the\nNear future yeah and and don't forget showing that the circuits and the district court the Supreme Court it's all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell you most of these cases that are ... reports to American businesses American individuals moms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump already has\nWas uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to the to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat or you know they could come open if Trump wins reelection bid may come open\nI ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually worried what will happen to the country if that seat if Ginsburg decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed with cabinet can you imagine what's going to happen if that seat comes open and it's a potential six three conservative majority on the courts\nI mean it is genuinely frightens me at a at a again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen\nAh why wouldn't you want to testify Greg Jared under oath\nWell he doesn't want to transcribed interview or anything under oath or which chairman Goodlatte and others are demanding why if\nIt's not record it or not under oath Rosenstein can do what he always does deceive and the lie with impunity without putting in self\nIn legal jeopardy too what Rosenstein really watches oh you know Mr good lab which is Jude I sit down and have a cup of coffee and we'll chat a little bit too if Rosenstein or July as as I suspect he might\nUm he doesn't he's not looking at a fashion misleading statement to Congress he's not looking at perjury because he can always deny the conversations that good ... remembers the which which is why there's just so critically important\nOr they've got a shot to subpoena him and they've got a demand to show up and they've got to put them under oath and these answers have to be given but\nUh I got to let your books or do we write great

know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the phone eight Clinton bought and paid for ... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day\nAnd that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller and uh now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled appearance before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse\nOver the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional task force interviews\nAnd those closed Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nOr the interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney at the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nAnd I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured I tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nBut the fact that there are no wires means everything you don't have to build out

Raphael and all these ... I don't want to hurt jobs I don't want to lose an order like that and you know there are other ways of a\nHow to use the word that's a pretty harsh orphanage true\nHow everybody what to think here [noise] you know there's a lot\nTo say there's a lot at stake and [noise] maybe especially so because this man was a reporter\nTo something you'll be surprised me say that there's something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to see what's going to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\nBy the way the president on sixty minutes last night talking about the mysterious this appearance\nOf this reporter Jamal ... ah we have some new updates for you on it it looks like the Saudis are preparing to admit that he was killed in an interrogation gone wrong we'll get to that in a second we do have other breaking news\nUh twenty five now till the top of the hour we're glad you're with us\nIt looks like in Maine the Bangor police department along with the fire department and the local hazmat crew\nAre on site it Susan Collins is Maine home investigating a suspicious package the state's criminal investigation division is also assisting at the ongoing probe and reports of the alleged threat came after ... of course gave a key vote as it relates to confirming justice cabin on to the U.S Supreme Court\nPrior to the voter office was they luge with threats against the senator and our staff\nIn one case the person didn't leave a name and number they threatened to literally rape one of my young female staffers cones quoted in the wall Street Journal\nLast weekend Collins returned to Maine after capital was sworn into office and address the media regarding the her decision and she told reporters the supplemental FBI report that she pushed for\nWas a turning point that helped to reach the decision to support cabin on despite the accusations that were leveled against him she actually gave due process um I've had this happened to me white powder sense in my office one side and the system that there's been\nWhat the the varying rest of the day in a panic state in isolation because of this white powder you know these things that people do and in some cases it's actually real as in the anthrax case\nUh one other news about this more news on the Senate before we get to the issue of cars shaggy a in Georgia you know this blue wave is a midterm election is apparently according to a Georgia gubernatorial candidates saying well that's going to include illegal aliens\nBut the thing of it is the blue wave is African American as white it's Latino it's Asian Pacific Islander is disabled this differently abled it's L. V. I. L. J. B. T. Q. it's law enforcement it's veterans are\nThe candidates said and then Stacey Abrams is her name and it's made up of those who were told they are not worthy of being here those who are documented and those who are undocumented so I guess she's saying that the blue wave is going to include undocumented people voting in Georgia\nThat's got to be interesting to GOP nominees by the guy by the name of Brian Kemp\nTelling Fox News that Abrams wants the illegals to vote in Georgia\nSo I think hard working Georgians should decide who they're governor is not people here illegally like what my opponent wants\nAnd adding that it would be unlawful for undocumented immigrants to vote in a gubernatorial election\nBy the way I told you last week about Christian a cinema now she's going up against Martha ... one of the important races that were following and how she uh had referred to her own home state and people in our state of Arizona being crazy and the meth capital of the world and\nAll the
