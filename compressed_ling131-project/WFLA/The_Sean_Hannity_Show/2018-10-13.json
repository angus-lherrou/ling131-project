{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "We're talking to a Twenty one now on best of the bay of course in Studio with us the American foundation for suicide prevention you can find out more a F. S.\nP. dot org switch we tell us about your personal story\nAh so I lost my brother and a two thousand six oh about twelve years now twelve years of November um ... it's one of the situation that I was completely unaware because at that time my family and I were living in the state of Florida and he was living in Missouri by himself and\nGrowing up with my brother um just one of those really motivated people I mean just outgoing trying to thrive in life and as time went on as we're living in Florida being separated my brother actually came down to visit us at one point\nAnd it was just strictly just for vacation for what we're told and next you know the next month he took his own life unfortunately and\nUm since two thousand six it's I've really I was a loss I mean everybody was in one is one of the biggest stigmas and Asian community is is that you don't talk about suicide\nIt's just a one of those things where like in almost brings dishonor to your family and so for quite a while it was just one of those things that\nWas never spoke about at home\nSo suffering in silence was\nLiterally suffering in silence\nAnd so it took me quite a while to find out where\nOr how I can start reading or morning or finding hope\nAnd that's when I came across FSBA with doing um the out of the darkness lock\n'em oddly enough all our former board chair Jason Thompkins\nI'm having to be one of my Starbucks customers and so I happen to see them at one of these suicide prevention of events randomly at a concert and I'm like hey what can you tell me more about this he's like yeah I lost my mom and November two thousand six I'm like oh weird\nI lost my brother in November two thousand sex tell me more about it and since getting connected with Jason he literally open doors you where I Know that I can actually find help and healing and hope through this dark time of my life and\nBecause of that I've invested in my life besides teaching into the passion of suicide prevention and trying to be involved as much as I can\nLet's talk a little bit about the under the darkness a cp walk coming up again we're talking to the American foundation for suicide prevention be tampered chapter way of hand the giants Tampa Bay chapter board chair and building bachelor\nA an also brandy Pauline Tampa Bay chapter board member and when you when are we just said to be out of the darkness saint Pete walk cheer 'em ... what does this event designed to accomplish and and what are you hoping to show people or if they go out and agenda\nSo the outer darkness lock in general is really just a key many walk for awareness of the whole purpose of the walk is not you bring up will bring to light about suicide to let people know that there's it's positive it's positive like the old for it looks like\nIt's one of those things where we want people to know that their connections that can be made\n'em that there's other people who you can relate to you you know I neither one of any of our board members here you know handle washed her dad\nI'm brandy lost her son I lost my brother we can't connect on my level and other darkness as one of those great opportunities for people to come and relate to each other and there's people who come in teens and you know they make posters and and you just kind of ... strike up a conversation and say you know like here's my connection with you we're sorry for your loss but\nWe know that we're in this together it's because of unfortunate that but we know that we can rely on each other and we're really a small knit community and I'm sure has of the situation I'm so out of darkness in general really the focus of positivity bringing hope healing and celebrate\nIn the lives of our loved ones that we've lost I'm fortunate to suicide\nAnd and working people find out more about the walk itself for or join and be a part of it\nSo we actually have three walks in Tampa Bay chapter this ah October ... is the the the walk a it's at South Park in downtown St Pete from eighty eight thirty AM to twelve PM then we have one on October twenty seventh and pass county\nUh from nine AM to twelve PM and then I Walk in Tampa on December eighth\nFrom nine ... nine AM to twelve PM 'em all this information can like you said found on if they see that or if you just go onto the website and just like a community chapters a local chapters even within the Tampa Bay chapter actually gives you a link for over ... walks and even survivor day on that website itself\nAnd if I can just add one or you don't have to be impacted by suicide to join one of these walks the walk so really about empowerment and joining together as a community to prevent suicide\nA so if you support that cause if you've been impacted if you if you suffer from mental health issues\nEverybody is welcome that these flocks\nSo you know mental health suicide it feels like we know more about these kinds of things PBS the um from what you guys are seeing kind of on the front lines being a part of this organization or are we making a dent when it comes to helping or is it still a big appeal climb\nSo suicides in our country is the tenth leading cause of death and it's the only leading cause of death that has continued to rise because\nWe have not been paying attention to it as a society until recently it's been a ... issue and we are making changes I think locally definitely um we did we went to Washington DC in June and we made changes for the\nNational suicide prevention national suicide prevention hotline improvement act we advocated for legislation for that\nThat would give 'em the one eight hundred two seven three ... three digit number okay that's a good idea and it would kind of help with the stigma just like if you have the physical crisis you would call nine one one mental health crisis you call that three digit number\nIt also improves funding for the hotline as well so it's wonderful we got that passed\nRight um but we still have a lot more to do I think\nOn the verge of change right now they are really is I think there's a new that occurring there's been a lot of national oppressors local press so this really is the time I mean it really starts with education so once you educate yourself and you become an advocate that's really how we drive prevention\nOn there isn't there is a a statistic out there where there is a belief that a suicide attempt actually happens every second of the day while I'm while we have forty one death\nSo the good news is is not every suicide is successful if you have attempted suicide you can still have a very productive life and just because you've had one suicide attempt doesn't necessarily mean that person is going to have another or be quote unquote doomed so I think\nThe more you can prevent the successful attempts\n... more successful you'll be in the end\nAnd how can people get involved in other ways outside of the walk or are there other things that you guys are looking for a F S P in terms of volunteers or donations things like that\nWell on a really simple level um I kind of touched a little bit on advocacy if you want to become an a field advocate is what it's called if you go to the FSB website there is a link for become an advocate and you enter your information and it's a really quick process and basically anytime there's any legislation that comes out\nOr whether it be at the state level or federal level you get an auction alert and it literally takes a minute when you do it and it generates an email that that gets sent to your legislators\nAnd let them know hey I support this legislation and please vote for it so that's just a very basic you want to stay behind a computer way to get involved um brainy do you until you want to touch more on some other ways to get involved yeah absolutely\nSo and it actually mentioned before I'm an brainy as well to education is is the biggest key and one of the biggest things that we try to get to many of all this is actually taking the training\nWe offer the same job training which every single one of us taking here and it's one of the things that literally opens up our eyes it gives us the signs and symptoms to look for and how to speak with a person how to guide them to resources that will help them with their struggles and suicide and general general\nAnd I'm sure although a lot of that information is on the website\nIt's gone and why okay there's there's links out to our walks there's links out to the education there is a contact us if you want to host an\nEducation where you know you're in a church or something along those lines and you want us to come we will come and then there's also a ... a piece around those that have been impacted by suicide can can go out and find resources\nThe website is a F.

S. permanent resident not a citizen\nYou want to stay on the application here what does this mean so the Turks if the Turks are Turkish if they're claiming they've got audio and video you know what this means\nFolks this means that the Turkish had the Saudi consulate bugged ... [laughter] I mean I can you figure any other way they they had cameras inside\nThey edit audio listening devices inside so they just tip their hand I Can't think of any other explanation for this claim to fame audio visual evidence\nYou know there is video that\nThe Saudi embassy had [noise] there's a closed circuit TV or you know security camera footage of Jamal to show the walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey back on October second so they have the walking in\nAnd wait a minute the Saudis than my daughter is going to say okay that show us the video of him walking out\nAnd I'm waiting for the Saudis then to give the exact same image on or give the exact same video\nAnd then just reverse it you just play the video backwards and you'll see that you'll see the uh the journalist ... you'll see him walk backwards to take the take her walking in video and they just run it backwards and I'll look he left his right here look he left\nI mean it was just like Keystone cop is also earlier this week\nThe the Saudis let some journalism or photons into and reporters into the er the embassy or consulate and there were like you're going to take him through rooms like opening up closets and saying look not near nope not here look it was it was comical but this story faults\nIs anything bought comical this Jamal to show the Washington Post of late columnist very critical of the Saudi Government especially the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman mom\nOh there's a lot of money and arms deals folks with us vendors or we'll get into that\nLindsey Graham by the way it has said this is a quote behavior like this is unacceptable violates every international norm it can't be condoned the way we deal with Saudi Arabia will be a message to others\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have written a letter\nSome in Congress they want the arms deals stop there are calls for sanctions and a halt to about a hundred ten billion dollars in arms sales some are calling for the cutting off of relations with Saudi Arabia\nI let's let's dive in just a little bit deeper here\nBecause I apparently there's evidence here and now with alleged audio video proof and this gets pretty gruesome\nThe reports are that the\n[noise] the Turkish have the audio and video of him going in being interrogated him being beaten and then him being killed and there have been some reports that he was caught up inside the embassy\nAnd ah [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYeah it also important understand that the Saudis need us more than we need them\nSo I think that the arms deal can be saved because there are so many cascading pieces and the Iran situation is important we can't allow the Iranians to get any stronger in the region and certainly arms sales to the Saudis a help keep that in check\nBut we can't allow [laughter] I used to murder people was just like we can't have the Russians have led to report and killing his adversaries in poisoning people on you know British soil for instance you know\nThe Chinese also arresting the head of Interpol or you know the what the Saudis have apparently dime here you know Trump's own Party Republicans like Lindsey Graham now turning up the heat\nAnd this is very complicated and\nIt's going to be a very interesting thing to see how this thing unfold you know Trump's under a lot of scrutiny I he's a question how involved we need to get considering that the journalist is not an American citizen buddies are permanent residents and has four children are American citizens\n[noise] [noise]\nI don't we can't cut off relations I wouldn't cancel the arms deal but the Saudis got another you you can't do this there's got to be some kind of punishment some kind of sanctions here so this is a a tight rope walk you know obviously\nI we just we can't leave that power vacuum for the Russians and the Chinese so I mean this is a very delicate walk here\nYou know I don't trust the Saudis Fifteen of Nineteen hijackers were Saudi I Do believe that there were a high level members of the Saudi royal family that new\nUh what was going on or certainly had some information we had you know some of the hijackers had information on a you know Saudi embassy contacts in Washington [noise]\nBut as always it's not an easy situation\n\nYou have a Saudi hit squad I mean the Turkish they have ... airport video of the of these prior summer came in on a private jet and some came in commercially but you had essentially this Saturday hit squad and assassination team came in him\nBecause they knew they could show he was going to be at the embassy them coming in to fill out paperwork yet an appointment and they brought this team them to make him a pool of disappear and they did and they've been caught on the question is are the\nTurkish are they going to release this audio and video that shows which they must have a hidden in the embassy which has a whole different amazing matter are they going to release the video of him being tortured and killed inside the cautious\n\nI seven is that what you fell a one oh two point nine ...\n[noise]\n[noise]\n...

nature\nAh and did the president's stole some of his unbelievably good momentum\nLift the Kanye in to them then you know the rally or in in Pennsylvania which again I didn't think the optics were great there as well\nI I think the president maybe should have at least on a fly over you know you don't have to hit the ground\nBut I think it's important to show and I and of course keep in mind that the president is important folks and don't don't shoot the messenger here\nThe president said that he don't want to disappoint the people up in Pennsylvania you know thousands of people waiting to see him in Pennsylvania earlier this week you don't want to disappoint but also keep in mind that the pan handle these areas that have been raped\nThat's also big time Trump country as well\n[noise]\nUh you know the president was able to resurrect a you know that that capital of victory\nBut you know an eerie Pennsylvania he's kinda preaching to the choir it was a rally for instance

excoriated the trumpet a correction I ... for many years the Obama administration on so many levels I agreed with virtually zero\nOf what Obama stood for believe them carried forth I had many words

F. R. and B. S. and just the erotic crazy train a performance of the time yeah I I Would be a hypocrite\nAnd it it's just it's unbelievable that those that would all over Obama and his choice ah are fine with Tonya in what he did it just folks it's it's a double standard and it's hypocrisy and I don't want a part of that\n\nHopefully you know there are you understand where I'm coming from there are people folks and this is this is troubling you know while I support the bulk of Trump's policies and I keep a lot of praise and credit on what he's gotten accomplished and you know they even put out that list of two hundred eighty nine accomplishments in just twenty months\nAnd the ministry she has done some amazing things that I've given them a lot of credit on this program\nUh the tiny situation and

mean I got to believe that Jared and the volcano Jared hit invited canyon and the first place it set up this lunch awhile ago which then turned into that photo op in the oval office and I got to believe that the market and Jarrett were just cringing\nAnd what transpired but what I find scary is you know let's we'll we can have tons of preys on Trump for the good things he's carrying up but he gets himself and messages and I talk about it because I'm honest and I'm a I'm fair I'm intellectually honest on this program\nAnd it just it would hypocritical if I didn't talk about the ups and downs\nBut the scary thing here is that some of the the all out blinded Trump supporters I truly believe the Kanye West could have pulled down his pants and dedicated on the desk in front of the media
