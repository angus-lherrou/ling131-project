{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "And so our hope within that is that we could eventually move away from what I call the kitchen sink chemo where you're just blasting kids with this poison essentially and hoping that it kills\nThe cancer faster than the one size fits all yeah and and it doesn't you know you you look at kids or any cancer patient who sunken eyes and the fall and heads at the side effects of chemo not cancer rice um and so that's something that we're moving away from it as we focused on that side that you know mix\nUm we started to realize that this was a ... not just in in their ... but in any solid mass pediatric cancer and so now we have\nA hundreds of tumor samples that have come through and we're starting to say\nUh you know this drug actually is working on this other cancer maybe we should start a clinical trial around that and see if this actually could work or an\n... and I have heard of that before that is incredible uh an incredible yeah I can only imagine and hope that must be bringing to not only you guys but but some of the families who were actively dealing with this right now um\nYeah it's a paradigm shift in how cancers treated\nLet me ask you this in terms of the organization itself you've got people listening right now who may be hearing this and and it's kind of touching them in a way that they want to help whether it's volunteering are donating of course when it gets to the party in a moment that's one way they can do it\nAnd not everybody likes to get dressed up in fancy Halloween costumes [laughter] but um how can people\nBe a part of beat and be and and offer their support yeah\nObviously the the the party is a great way to come out and meet us and and see the people that are uh involved here locally that uh I think that's a great way to do it um you can also check out our website and our Facebook we're usually most communicative on Facebook so it's just Facebook dot com slash beat MBA you can search beat him be on\nUm you know Twitter Instagram as well but Facebook seems to be the best place to kind of catch up with what we're doing and I think really just following us there and and finding out what it is that's going on a lot of people just you know they see a saint Jude commercial and they think oh childhood cancers taking care of\nA but the reality is that there are still multiple cancers within the childhood cancer world um that we are losing our kids to and and so knowing that being aware seeing the stories\nWill make you more aware of that and then as we do things in the Tampa Bay area you can you know come out to be a part of that I'm so we we love just people following along and and knowing what's going on\nWe're talking to beat and be and Thirteen oddly man here on bested bam your host Ryan Gorman in the studio with me ... executive director of beat NBA and David ... president of Thirteen ugly men the two websites beat and be dot org and Thirteen ugly men dot coms or David ... now that we've talked to Kyle about\nThis tremendous organization and the great work they're doing obviously a great organization to highlight for your Halloween party I can see why you guys decided to go with them I'm tell us a little bit about your interaction with beat him be up to this point the relationship that you guys have built\nAbsolutely as I mentioned uh you know I Believe an application came a few years ago and typically you know we review financials and review the board and this is one guy you know [laughter]\nYou know who's speaking\nOn behalf of it and you know we we've just as you guys mentioned there's plenty of\nA children's support for cancer there's up you know the children's Cancer Center the have the same bond yeah and even amazing things and it's so easy to write a check for 'em because you know instantaneously but\nYou really have to hear the story yeah and you have to hear the story from Kyle and I think that's the problem with that group is there a third of our guys and we don't have enough time to get that in the meeting in ... or um so when you hear it and it never went away usually when we get an application and after the year where we picked the four and we're kind of moving onto the next year\nThis never went away and that kind of speaks to a little bit of Kyle\nAnd probably how Jordan and his national meeting felt about it\nAnd uh you know from that point on\nWe made a point every time we were talking about charities we gotta get beat envy we gotta we gotta get these guys involved in one of our events and\nThis one came up and we wanted to make sure it was one of our events that it was the most successful which is Halloween every year we're making at least twenty five thousand dollars to donate back so we're already committed they are already promising that we're going to do that so how do we make it further well we have an event and we have sponsorships that can help us pushed that\nI'm In our relationship um we did go you know some of our group was fortunate enough to go to their big gala gala at the armature works and um\nWe actually met one of the other families and they you know personally came up and talk to us and what our donation means as [noise]\nAs you mentioned you had two options wanting to well these donations that hopefully not only if you go to our event did go to and check out beat him being donate directly to it we're providing and other option this is not a a vacation to Orlando and then there's a chance to save somebody's life and that speaks the there's a\nLot of organizations that are that are doing great work and helping people deal with their situation which is very very important and and we had them on all the time and we're all the stories of what you guys are focused on a beat him be is is changing the game really a which is very unique\nAnd and I'm sure a David once you heard that beat and be did a live band

as soon as ah Collins finished\nUh as soon as Susan Collins finished uh Joe mansion\nHis office pointed out that he's a yes vote\nSo mansions a yes vote Collins is a yes vote Murkowski is a no vote but she's not native she's around living at this point because they have\nThe votes and Kavanaugh will be the next Supreme Court justice or on the U.S Supreme Court he will be the next associate

haven't even given out the number of yet every line is are jammed here eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine if you want to try to get in so wait for a break in the action when when somebody hangs up but I take another call try to squeeze in\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine is the number to get in a here on Smith or any aspect your thoughts on Susan Collins your thoughts on the fact that it looks like a cabin on is an absolute shoe in here folks\nAgain it's a it's like fifty one forty nine\nIs the way this thing is is shaping up your flake or has not determined or hasn't while I'm sure he's determined but he hasn't said which way he's going but flake is most likely going to be a a yes vote so and then we have an interesting case of senator uh [laughter]\nNot a household name for me but we have this this is a really interesting case of\nFits the Senator Stevens games of Montana who will not be there tomorrow for the floor vote for cabinet because he's going to be walking his daughter down the aisle\nShe's getting married so if his vote is needed and of course listen even as a fifty fifty tie if it was fifty fifty then that's when you bring in the president\nOf the Senate or the vice president of the United states and Mike Pence would cast the tie breaker ah which I don't know if that's going to be needed here but as with gangs who are ... he's going to a potentially fly back\nBecause Mitch McConnell can keep the the vote open\nSo if needed Danes who's going to his daughter's wedding to walk down the aisle or right after the wedding he could get on a jet and fly right back and then cast a vote either in the middle of the night or cast a vote or early on Sunday Morning\nBecause Mitch McConnell can keep that vote open our number eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine\nAnd again and it looks like Kavanaugh is a done deal\nAfter we witness just an incredible display by Susan Collins and Joe mansion\nOr having the courage to also say based on the evidence and what was presented that he's a yes vote is well\nJoe Manchin Democrat West Virginia incidentally I just saw during the top of the hour news break and ah we're we're going to try to grab this audio as soon as we can turn it around Joe mansion emerging ah from the the Senate floor\nA was a swarm by reporters talking about and he was answering questions I thought a very professionally was answering questions there were a litany of of protesters in ... in the whole\nUh uh you know calling him a sellout they weren't they were shouting at him they were shame on you shame on you and the the reporters are\nAsking mansion questions were essentially getting drowned out or you can still hear what was going on but it was just really annoying with the protesters shouting down Joe mansion as he was being interviewed and asking questions\nAfter he left the Senate floor after the er the announcement from Susan Collins and she was a yes vote right to the phones here and I think we're going to be very very heavy on phones on this remarkable day you know there's another issue that I that I Want to bring up a lotta grab some phones but just threw a fit to lay things out here\nUh this is just absolutely disgusting and despicable\nThat Leland Kaiser as Susan Collins brought up on the foreign leader in Kaiser this friend of Dr Ford that doesn't know Brett Kavanaugh cannot recall the incident\nThere's a report that came out last night\nFrom the wall Street Journal and I've got I've got the wall Street Journal piece right here a friend of Dr Ford felt pressure to uh read visit her statement so the report is here that Leland Kaiser was pressured\nBy that very good friend of Dr Ford that Monica McLean to change her

cabinet supporter I just couldn't believe\nThis well organized attack and you're in a in a moment of frustration with these other accusers coming out and just all of this detail\nAnd you know even some Republican showing a whole lot of concern our earlier was it was earlier this week or late last well you know I said I I it was it was before the it was before the FBI investigation so much for us right\nBefore the so it would have been late last week a year at a moment where I just I was really depressed that I I was on the show with all of this information all\nWho yeah I did say oh my God I I think capital could be done here\nAnd you know I I'll I'll I'll take my lumps but I think I've rehabilitated myself over the course of the game and last week here and and also I was on the cabinet supporter or I ... I ... I don't know how often you listen to the program but I've been very much on the attack\nAre over this whole process on how despicable and how desperate and how cool water needed and scripted this whole attack process has been it's really nauseated may\nAnd you look at Kavanaugh's judicial record you look at all of those it said that his qualifications were matched unparalleled so I Do apologize Audrey from my moment of week this uh last week when I said\nWhen I when I said oh Mike oh my God I I I Can't believe what's what's going on here and remember what else that I Do you remember what else I said oh long around that same time\nAfter the FBI investigation was agreed to\nAnd Jeff Flake remember a lot of conservatives a lot of Republicans were very aggravated Jeff Flake\nFor that little meeting that little sidebar that little huddle you had with Chris Collins Democrat from Delaware\nAnd that I Want to say who are college I cuckoo's run I've got Susan Collins on the brain so when when ... met with Chris Coons from Delaware and they came up with this plan All right a flake wants a one week uh uh FBI investigation\nYou know what I said I also said at that moment on this program oh my God\nI think Jeff Flake just saved Brett Kavanaugh\nOn this program and remember I I was getting yelled at from color sanctions\nThat wanting it to all your grade to the FBI investigation why are you saying that one flight\nDid was a good thing why because I was a hundred percent right in that I told you that with this little a scheme that flake and coups had hatched up no pun intended on or had a that\nThis was going to be the saving grace this was going to save uh the nomination and it happened\nThe flaky win over so also who knows I Wonder if he's getting cramped from Democrats biggest this little coups flake maneuver that helped save\nTerminal so a cool one Democrat he essentially has some responsibility and the fact that Kavanaugh is going to be confirmed as the next a next Supreme Court justice here but it's it's simple folks Jeff Flake\nOut going flake who has enraged many Republicans and conservatives flake saved cabinet all\nYou must realize that Audrey do you understand that\nOh yes I Do and I called his office and encouraged him even though he was leaving the Senate that what is done now will affect us even now we don't live in his state\nAnd listen and Audrey I had people when I made the statement after we have this crazy maneuver or late last week on the FBI investigation and flake having the caviar on voting for a cabin on the full floor where he voted to to uh uh\nWithin the vote that he did make and then agreeing that we have to have this one week investigation when I said that flake his move was brilliant and this is actually the same capital I had numerous calls on this show last friday\nI was getting yelled at that what do you do it while you're I mean I was getting yelled at one of ... because they wanted me to just attack flights and I'm like no you have to go past just the emotional talk radio talking point and understand\nWhat's really happening here Audrey thanks for the call let's grab Gary is in New York Gary uh where in New York are you\nA Gary are you there [noise]\nI guess Gary walked away let's let's stay in New York I'll grab a call from white plains New York and here's rich Nextel rich\nHey taught you know what I was going to talk about something else but let's stick with Sharon Collins and yeah you know it was a good speech he made but I think it's the the only speech she could have made in order to maintain her half Democrat half Republicans status if you will\nOkay she she could have gone the other way easily I listen Maine is not a red state Maine is a blue state\nWell let me let me get to the larger point\nI don't think that it should have\nEver or you know what it offers a purple is but if it's going ... ... it's purple to blow is what's going on in Maine I go ahead\nI I I don't think it should have gotten this far I think this process should have stopped if the Grassley and the Republicans had a backbone and said look there's no way we can\nAnd vehicle for Seventy five north bound and it's a big Ben Rhodes major delays for real time traffic of is when you're out there on the news all the traffic ... by traffic ... can use it in Seventy W.
