thing of beauty speaking it's time to Johnson is talking to the media right now let's go to that interview\nLetting radio\nJust how how does it feel to kind of get into a rhythm now get into you know the season that's when we talk so much about the time off you had yeah uh\nYou know it feels good uh now you can kind of feel like summer's over and you know playing some games I think starting what last game we have about thirty six games in Seventy two nights or whatever it may be so uh now we're in the ... and uh you know feels pretty good\nHow 'bout for you um you know the the the ... ... your fifth career hatch or just what's that feeling like when the third one goes in\nA you know he I don't really think too much about ... more happy that we won that game was a thriving more pumped eg oil scored that a third one than anything so um you know I've been playing with some good players and had some good opportunities tonight and luckily they want to\nTry and can you break down the first two goals that going to\nLifespan of office yeah first one or you know to be honest I didn't really do much a joke kind of did it on um uses speed got in and kind of set it on the plot or for me so I just kind of how to put it in um the second wandering made a good play in the middle of their kind of give it to me and um luckily I had a cap on the guy they will kind of show them off in\nA you know just kind of forbidden to talk about that ... have you on that first of all of a you know Joe he he just kind of does it all he's a really good player he's he's fast I mean on that call or he burned by everyone so it's kinda fun to watch I think I had the best a seat in the house on that one so\nI'm you know he's been clients you only well for us he deserves to be hearing deserves to be in our line up and um you know I see um progress in every single day and I am really excited to see what's gonna happen by their songs\nAh you know I like this on so I I like hearing it uh hopefully they can play a few more time\nJust to say let's let's get back together obviously it's a little main thing because of how well you guys been couple of years ago for her life to live in the back with\nYeah they're they're unbelievable player so I Love playing with them um you know tiniest makes the game is you're kind of slows down we get some opportunities I think as a you know everything for grad says we're going to get a little bit closer and closer and um the able to work and kind of progress on a few things I think it'd be better so um\nYou know hopefully going to continue to work on things and work in video and um you know just be honest and pager\nEvery game is a process to get better as a team where are you guys now for maybe where you were a week ago\nAt this time well I think especially at the start of the years when you really make your biggest strides and I think we've had some really good practice is really good um you know momentum and some team bonding kinda got everyone together and um you know I think where we are now from last week even been a big or progress but I think there's still a lot more\nRoom to grow for us and I think we can do that\nLast question for you Louis demand comes and makes his first starts and I was obviously exceptional what kind of confidence as he kind of given you guys with the job that he can do\nYeah I mean we see 'em all the time in practice he's a very good goalie um you know the way he played ... seasons stuff was outstanding so uh I feel like we have a very good tandem back there may be one of the ... well there'll be ... um you know that uh we're going to have\nYou know the backbone for us when we really need it and are they both an outstanding\nNo doubt they've been tremendous and are dimming face forty shots tonight and uh was just\nReally really good and a tip of able to pick up two points against a really good Carolina team you heard the man asked a couple of questions the end of that interview with a fiber Johnson Eric roads and joins us from the locker room and\nI again let's start with Louis demean we weren't sure when he was going to get to start it was tonight against a team that likes to shoot a lot that might have helped him settle into this game but you made a number of big saves and allowed his team to chip away\n[noise] yeah he he knew a with Caroline and the way that they can shoot the puck and how much they want to read the book they had to be ready for that and the irony here is that he almost didn't start he he said he had a little bit of a neck issue\nUm during the the students and basketball before the game of pre game to kind of warm up a little bit and he said he had a little bit of a stiff neck he's been sleeping on a kind of funny and he he had to work and to get some training work to make sure you can actually get into the game [noise]\nThe neck we've all had that before it that way you know me I'm more than once it happens a lot more as you get older\nAh what did you make of the fourth one week we talked about uh you know the depth of scoring I thought the again Adam Ernie\nJake the Miller Cedric part cat they have and I were discussing this er during the post game segment one of them that you're not expecting a ton of goals especially from Bernie in park yeah but it's nice to have that threat than I thought they were pretty good I\nThought they were really good I thought I had an Ernie especially at his best game so far here in the early season I thought he was involved uses body really well I'm In a couple of really good a place with the park or\nYou know in Central Park cat it just continues to kind of pick up where we left off and and you know we know Jaycee Miller Miller's been on the first one guy for this team and now he's playing them a more of a reduced role but um you know he's he's kind of being in power for that you buy into being when you can have those three guys\nAren't in in in any ... situation but when you have them contribute in the way they are being responsible the way they are that just makes you a much more dangerous\nLastly they're doing this really without them coast or future off exploding fence away about the son of a really good team isn't it\nWind the death we've talked about so much from really the start training camp that this team has it they don't have to rely on one guy or even one line they have so many players that can contribute offensively and we're seeing that I mean Tyler Johnson gets a ... another goal brightened point in a couple of all the other night\nUh we know what some pointing to ... to ... stand cos are going to start feeling the back of the net and that's when they become even more of a dangerous team offensively when you start to get countries contributions from your big stars are and as long as you continue to get the ... and that's what makes this team so dangerous\nYou'll be talking about tomorrow letting power play from one to two on lightning lunch effects body\nExtract it's either that or at ... and joining us there what did you quit game recap spots you by fire choice with the lending scoring forego some fans can take ten dollars off any service up two hundred at their local our choice auto care center tomorrow must be hard game ticket or a steam cart\nTo redeem this offer Caroline and got on the board first in that first period for land getting its fourth season\nTo make it one nothing in the first spirited twelve forty two short handed ... Johnson getting his first from Joseph ... then in the second period at six or seven even strength Johnson picking up a second from Ernie and Miller\nNature's ...\nType things up at two piece at twelve forty eight of the second Vogel and in the third period it was all Tampa Bay ... a lot at seven to two that was a power play goal than the empty ... age you know for ... and ... and Gerard ...\nAll right when we return we'll wrap this post game show up get your set for last call with my stamina nine Seventy WFL lake ... forward to you're listening to it all on letting radio\nLightning fans get back to full strength with a joint Wednesday at Dunkin' Donuts get immediate hot for ice hockey for just a dollar through the junk and ... every Wednesday during the lightning regular season it's perfect we\nDownload the dumped it after day should regime of wars and we see the exclusive offer there's no better take them to move full flavor\nWe talked about him being lighter and quicker again this year than he was he looks more like he did three and four years ago\nA lotta times players will go through that especially guys who are who are a little shorter stature um because they figure they need you know the power and his game and you know Tyler Johnson just ripped I mean these guys are all in great shape but he\nSaid at the beginning of this year he said last year he said I went to the heavy weights a lot\nAnd he said I think I was too bulky\nBut during the year it's really hard to change that so you have to wait till the off season change your died a little bit and certainly changed the way you work out he said he did a lot more stretching and I think things like yoga and things like that\nAs compared to as many heavy weights has he done before and so he said I I literally just feel you know looser and able to to to move more quickly\nIt shows a and he showed some great versus speed nobody was going to catch them so I always had great hands and I think you know the move back to senator\nJohn Cooper brought it up a week or a week or ten days ago saying that yes somewhere along the line we'd like to get Johnny back at center a little bit more often maybe than we had him last year he was on the wing with breaking point ally and he you know he's he's a good soldier about it you'd rather play center\nAnd he just said okay fine you want me to play we play way so I\nI think he's pretty happy back at center and um and I think everybody you know we talked about this last game I think the fans were all pretty of those uh see the triplets back together because of their their past history in past years\nUm and you know it's it's working pretty darn well especially for ... Johnson but it was it overall very very good effort a penalty killed was great again our play didn't get a chance until late in the game but uh you know they got they they had chances and um it was a factor\nSo all the way round really good in Louis dimming was absolutely terrific he really was\n... he deserves a half when\nI talked to Louis or just after training camp he just kind of shrugged anyway\nI just want a normal year this year I just want a normal year started off in Arizona last year when all insects and ... got cut he was just gone and um\nThe lightning picked him up and worked with him and he did well in the America league next thing you know he's up here but I mean if you look at his numbers have you had eleven starts last year he went seven three in one\nAnd you know all those points were important trying to finish in first place which the lightning did\nHe didn't play a home game until march the tents\nSo of his eleven starts only three of them were home and the first one was the end of march ... or early March so that that's a lot to put on a guy shoulder even though he's got some experience so\nYou know for to start off this year for a backup goal to enter you want to hit the ground running and and you wanna you don't make those first early saves that he made some disease and his first four or five shots they were not easy saves so it was good for him to get settled in there right away and Louis dumbing was a big part of that when\nYeah there's a lot of talk going into the game about how many shots on goal the hurricanes have been averaging ... forty two shot yeah per game in the previous two games combined one hundred total shots\nThere wasn't much concerned say well this is actually a good thing for a guy like domain making that start yeah see the puck early often make those safe settling rather quickly and you're right that this was not one of those simple games where\nOnly thirty nine shots are all coming from the perimeter and you're just swatting them waste time and time again as you mentioned the special teams penalty kill now Eighteen for Eighteen on the season second shorthand a goal of the season\nAnd a power play coming up big it turned out to be the game winner tonight as well\nAnd you look at especially all four goals but certainly the best opportunities that the lightning had tonight\nYou knew that the Carolina Hurricanes are going to be burning speed to the table and sometimes you just have to fight fire with fire and I thought the lightning best opportunities offensively were were they were just moving their feet and going into that second and third year\nAnd you know the the Matthew Joseph set up on that first goal by Tyler Johnson the prime example of that but even on the power play you know it's Henri plot for checking just skating right on end and Calvin Don and Don's feeling\nA pressure and let's be honest we get a little lucky bounce there to the ... kind of rolls off a stick and big bang boom it's in the back of the net\nBut to I thought that's what really made the game entertaining as well even though there were I think it was sixty uh eight face off tonight\nUh normally when you have a game but that many face opposite you'll slow it's bogged down right but uh when you get these too fast teams together again not like it eighties NHL tracked me but um you know you got to see both teams at their strength tonight\nAnd certainly the lighting were able to just come through a cash in a more of those opportunities when they have to be moving yeah quickness\nAnd the speed of the game mean a lot of things that means high end skating speed for sure like you saw from Joseph in from Tyler Johnson and in specific place and I and from other players on Carolina Carolina's got some really good young talent\nSebastian I had another really good game for them a ... I Hope quietly scored twenty nine goals last year on a team that wasn't very offensive\nAnd I'm In you know I I think that rod Britain to more than a nice job with them sort of loosening them up just enough to let them feel themselves you know\nUm there were so structured under bill Peters I think you know their their brains were spinning by the end of the year because it was all about where am I supposed to be next and he really hammered away on 'em so\nI mean and and that's good for a young team in a way\nBut then Britain more comes into a team that's now been you know\nDrill sergeant to death almost and good just goes okay we're going to relax us a little bit so he walks into a pretty good situation there\nI'm In Carolina is is a good team and you know in today's NHL that there are so many new faces a and teams look so different from one year to the ... the prognostications at the beginning of the year don't meet a dark especially early on in the season because you don't really know who's walking through the door\nAnd Carolina's a good example of because of what they've done so far um and ... it's it it made for a really good hockey game and I I enjoyed that one a lot and it was really well deserved victory for the lady\nAnd I don't think it's a coincidence that you mentioned that it's been awhile since you've actually looked forward to seeing the Carolina Hurricanes in person here that's not a knock on them I mean they've they've had their struggles over the years there's no doubt about it but I don't think it's a coincidence that the most energetic loosened up team\nThat we saw tonight and we've seen in the previous couple of weeks from Carolina\nLooks an awful lot like the O. six ... winters that Rob Bryn Mawr was the captain of I don't think that's a just pure\nChance that that's a you know the apple not falling far from the tree right in that basic set up there a couple of other notes I thought the fourth line was outstanding tonight again we'll be talking to Jason Miller and just you know it's it\nUh Adam Ernie ... cat to have an excellent games and Louis donating again ah you know got a tip are kept him and you know I I think certainly this gives Louis\nYou know confidence going into the season you know you don't really know\nHow your season's going to go until they get that first game under your belt but I think the lightning fans you could all breathe a sigh of relief here in case you forgot that seven three in one stretch than Louis had a last season but you know you look ahead to this upcoming road trip you've got five games featuring to back to back so\nWell it's probably going to get a couple of starts here adjusted pretty quality opponent you are so everyone can breathe a little easier here\nAnd I think it's easier to spread the message too that\nThere's nothing wrong with giving a few more starts then perhaps the backup to under ... would have gotten in previous see I think ... gonna\nPlay twenty odd games this year where everything goes according to you know the planned the overall plan that they have no plans change all the time\nBut uh he has and I think he knows that and understand that so he set the table extremely well for him I agree with you the the fourth lined the pocket line was really good on a number of times and the telecast tonight I said that it's\n... and particular he had three really good scoring chances are he scored a nice school last game that we talked about\nMiller's presidents on that line has been a big help and Adam already had a terrific game he didn't get a chance to play a lot last game that's what happens to the fourth line you know you get yanked off the ice because a line match ups and penalties situations et cetera\nBut I'm a I'm a ... cat in particular\nI think he looks really good really quick and he's generating ... we know what he does position of the killing penalties and you know banging guys around but ... unique production from the fourth line and I I think that line is given it's really an interesting look with a with Ernie and a\nA Miller on the wings and that makes it that much more interesting when Kelly comes back in a couple of weeks\nAnd we are anticipating Jaycee Miller who's a taking this time but ah hopefully getting up here and just a few minutes we're going to take a quick time out we will hopefully hear from Jay tea also head coach John Cooper and Brian and I will look ahead to the Thursday night match up against the Detroit Red Wings against the\nWind lists Red Wings yeah it's been a tough go yeah I and the motor city this year and uh\nThey didn't have a good one last night against Montreal and they're going to have a what he's going to feel too sorry for the new era no not not too much about we'll talk a little bit about that in just a few minutes as well as the last call presented by Jack\nDaniels continues moment on nine Seventy WFL is\nWhen you think about it a flag is not a whole heck of a lot of anything\nIt's fabrics known to stick\nFlag may not be much but when it's a lightning bolt waving above your front door\nSometimes in the country was allowed to [noise]\nBe the thunder this Thursday lightning versus right wing seven thirty pm to get the Tampa\nObviously they've been a big part of a lot of success here so I mean other than that I mean there's so much stuff up front you can put anybody with anybody and I think that like you said I mean you can call it a fourth line but you know there's a lot of good players and you know up front and when you're on lines like that with that much talent I think that it's very hard for other teams to keep up and obviously it's been pretty evidence so far\nAnd while you're talking about adjusting we had John shortly after you were required in the trade and\nThe great story about you are not really giving who your card games on the way to Vancouver uh after you learn to do or traded uh but uh you know now you've had an off season now you've had a training camp but the team now you've gotten a little more familiar with your teammates here\nOr how big was this off season for you to just kind of get settled in and knowing you're going to be here for the long haul as opposed to just a whirlwind right after the trade and then boom it's the playoffs and everything just doesn't stop for a few months\nYeah exactly what you said I think that um when you have time to go home and relax after having a baby in the playoffs and everything you feel like you blink and all these things have happened so you've got to go home and you know relax and enjoy that family time and get back into workouts and prepare and you know after the signing\nThey said it's very exciting because I Know that I'm coming here and um you know you get to learn how demanding this training camp is and how much the coaching staff and they are the management expect out of the players and I think it's that high quality of expectations that makes it such a good team and obviously the personals\nI'm On the team is very very good as well but uh you know it was good to know that I'll be here and um you kind of can learn how to how the approaches when you're coming to camp set of just winging it and um you know when you got here I wasn't you know that first couple of weeks or two you're trying to figure things out and get acclimated as quickly as possible but\nYou know I was so excited to be a part of the future here for the next year employers in\nMy opinion you're the best on the team and doesn't matter what area of the ice but let's go off in sub zone for for to simplify\nHanging on to the park in traffic and taking your time and still being able to ... sometimes two or three guys around you and still be able to make a play that makes sense you don't make hope place\nHow like who influenced you on that or anybody in particular how did that develop and you're getting wiped prior to coming here has made thousands of hope ... and\nYou know your favorite across as far as some yourself in the head with a hammer in doing so that's what makes things a lot of\nVery stubborn with the pocket I haven't always been like that but I learned as you know it's all the time and place to make that good players like the play that sets up a little break away in his own or whatever it may be and um you know I like when there's people close to me I Know where they're at when they're close to me if they're not touching me that's when that's when the play opens up that maybe you know and make so\nUm I've always been like that I enjoy uh you know when the players are on me I Know like I said I Know where they're at so I ... I use my body to my advantage and hopefully get a little separation never enough time to make way out of it well\nJT we're off to a three month start here let's make it for one against Detroit on Thursday night thanks again for joining us here run\nFishing here on the last call it just a moment we'll hear from head coach John Hoover and we'll wrap\nThings up here from Ron Fish grills to stick

some more thoughts about tonight's game from head coach John Cooper his ... comments are presented by WMU Cooley law school the Tampa campus gives them a call at eight one two three four one nine\nFifty one hundred years head coach John Cooper\nHow did you take it you know is that was how did you know [laughter]\n\nYeah that was a little alarming in the pre game when he kind of came to his neck and so we just you\nFast he was ready to go just in case but he uh sitters writing and he went in and good thing 'cause he played rather well\nJohnny for a while a hard worker how nice to see and I'm like well\nWe like them in the middle that's helped him but\nIf there's one thing about Johnny ... and ... the competitiveness and all that that's ... taken for granted that's she competes but to skating and when he's skating really it's game changing forum and he was definitely skating tonight just a\nBursting through holes creating chances for himself and I know he had three probably
