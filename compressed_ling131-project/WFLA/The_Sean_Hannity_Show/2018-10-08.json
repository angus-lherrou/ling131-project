I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware like risk but he was never part of the ...\nWhat compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no he's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about it as drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and Mr ... and the fall and incredibly incredible lead within a week I think the FBI's about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and said this changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee\nWith the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopeful and get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii he wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was a pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator her own out now is saying she wants an F. FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar and so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is this whole bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to delay\nThe hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're great and then I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nLet's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped a huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but right close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh we legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict at the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused I'm not given up on him less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states where Democrats are rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yeah most Democrats would know no matter who Donald\nTrump us ride they've already against score six\nYeah All right so now what's going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona up most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are for its plans are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins\nAir traffic and whether

another of the French she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nRight twenty five now totally a top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing at all this was was absolute ... how does this task for news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would things you can stay consistent in a week\nAnd the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a ... a systemic party culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then lined up outside the rule waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that this happened thirty six years ago and nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that then we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here to put this on the air Byron York\nIs joining us he's been running a lot of columns about there is not the least of which is how high the bar\nHas risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote now you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron hey Sean listen on the on there's going to be a thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds about\nA war on on the basis of the lack of evidence and uh there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bad but it was given in part a due to the news networks I'm hearing about Michael I have an anti her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that if you see as reported this problem or a good correct or at least where you can see what I think was a parent to a lot of people are there just was not going to the story\nUm and when she offered a witnesses to corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nAnother was deceased and didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gone to damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation that's now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but\nIf we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen\nAnd then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker or the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens of dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mr Ramirez\nLike you're on the truth that's what they say\nWell now we have the Democratic ... uh Hawaii senator the one that said the men to just shut up and sit down and Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants that investigation into the ice throwing incident\nI'm at a ballgame and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity\nAbout was he truthful about his drinking he said he ... he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college and high school kids I drink too much beer but they're saying well he must a blackout and this event\nNobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said that somebody I blacked out correct so does it look a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him\nSo here you know the ... question I go ahead where we're told us that things have changed yeah\nI'm from an emphasis on me the sex misconduct allegations to once he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact that there really isn't any evidence to support the sex\nOr allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking although he mentioned many times in his testimony that he did in fact\nDrink today rocks published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking trick is mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr are they going to let it go there thank you so much Byron York a widow sanctions on Washington Examiner eight hundred nine four one Sean is our toll free telephone numbers we

I'm here or whatever you want to call her but she sympathetic but she's not credible and that goes to by by the expert opinion of a prosecutor as a specialist in this field prosecutor Mitchell says it just wouldn't\nEven make the minimum requirements to get a warrant let alone presented in court\nWas an I don't really have anything I I I think this is such a serious topic\nI I literally of nothing\nAt all bad to say about professor Ford I don't like the Dianne Feinstein hooked up with a a radical left wing attorney who's known for going after the Paula Jones well it was only ten or twelve minutes um that Bill Clinton\nThen attorney general of Arkansas exposing his pain has been saying kids that are that ten or twelve minutes she says doesn't meet the definition of sexual harassment in the workplace so you got a political operative all arranged by the Democrats\nThey perfectly the purposely hid this from the Republicans and as he has now been heard but it doesn't the stories\nNot corroborated by the very people she said would corroborate the stories including eight eight alleged die witness to the alleged incident that's problematic for her at that point it becomes he said he said she said and there was no evidence\nUm and that's why the Senate should move forward at this point [noise]\nHey there's still a lot more head on the best for the Sean Hannity show stay tuned for more right after the news on this station\n[noise]\nWarning if you're buried in debt you\nCan't afford to not let the credit card companies make you think that you have to pay it all back because you don't what the credit card companies don't want you to know is that there's actually a way to get that free without paying off your entire debt or going bankrupt if you have five thousand\nDollars or more and credit card debt you know have the right to let us settled that debt for a fraction of what you will for free information called debt free dot com now\nAt one eight hundred two hundred seven four zero to relieving show you how much money you could save if you are struggling to pay off your debt do not let the credit card companies make you think that you have to call debt free dot com now for free information on how to get out of debt faster than you ever\nThought possible without bankruptcy we offer a guarantee with no upfront fees so there's no risk for the free information you need a call now\nOne eight hundred two hundred seven four zero to that one eight hundred two hundred and seven four zero to one eight hundred\nTwo hundred seven four zero to\nHi Michelle mocking here if you found them I work you know the one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was a trial of abortion doctor Kermit cars now\nHow the woman goes into funding comes on data there's no police report\nThe results are now in polling and we're seeing it in the Fox news poll that now shows that are Heidi Heitkamp who is a no on judge cabin on North Dakota's she down by eleven is going to be interesting to watch what Joe Manchin does Joe Donnelly in Indiana is a no\nUh we know Claire McCaskill is a no we a have a battle going out Martha ... I think it was a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her\nHer country with incredible honor and distinction and Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but these numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent and more importantly we've got a raspy is simple that says\nWell the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nLet it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive the enthusiasm gap does is closed almost two dead even hold and you see Republicans and important Senate races now in a dead heat\nIn all of the states that are red states where we're Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to go further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice Catherine off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they meet your it everything you can imagine and they lost\nAnd I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial a Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is\nThat he and the process he may well have crippled his party or a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things they're called Republicans and there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats\nAnd he said to me I just don't think people are Americans are going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we've been living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict this with certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know as rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever ... nature of politics they can bring up comes up every election year but they have now son to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case of professor Ford there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nIt took to look for anything forensic league that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talk to the poor people professor Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this\nThis so called party when the alleged event happened\nAnd she identified one person that was supposed to be a witness to the assault and the eye witness that that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just going to jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's an of allegations out there I mean you just got to kind of believe that they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look\nDeclare Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of the Cade I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he just kind of decayed into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks whatever the Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance I has a history teacher I found it painful\nUm he he makes comments like that I mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you are then the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that you know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created for a million fewer people on on food stamps\nOr you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling and war and the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high\nAnd we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe don't even know their name is\nWhy do you just put your finger on the key question of this election I have as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and [noise] one of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I I don't care about the polls\nShow me the police sinks I Want to see the first real votes\nI Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote\nBecause that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back in the special in one um\nAnd is the first Hispanic Republican state senator or in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience\nWho this is going to come down to isn't holding it isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote\nAnd if our side does show up in both I think this could be one of the most historic elections\nThat you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would rush to oil behind\nThe scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before you\nBecame speaker the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and and you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that them and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be an abysmal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again and it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they're either going to seek kiddy happy\nLiberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nChuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will be the chairman of this committee or that committee and that the impeachment of Trump will go forward taxes go up open borders will remain\nAn Obamacare stays all this or they're going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and be in the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I look I mean I think what would I Would say to everybody who's listening to us everybody says with countries richer make sure you vote makes sure your friends vote make sure everybody you know who favors\nA solid productive work oriented results oriented system make sure they go out and vote if that happens my I'm not I'm not quite ready yet to project\nBut am on to tell you that because of the intensity of anger\nAbout the way the liberal smear cab and all the characterization the dishonesty I Believe we have seen and I've been looking at data for three days I Believe that we've seen a substantial shift\nTowards Republicans now I think that they were almost certainly now going to keep the Senate and probably going to increase our or the total number of senators by significant margins\nHeidi Heitkamp of North Dakota who's down eleven is no on Kavanaugh to me what a fork in that race it's over\n[noise] yeah well again I think Kramer who was a great great guy and I've known for twenty four years he's got to get out there and keep campaigning\nWant one of the lessons you know I I had very close races including a couple of recounts and I had very big raise my experiences\nAnd I said it's every candidate do not quit to the polls closed and do not relax until the recount just over a this is a business where\nTo me it becomes a tipping point in the country where you're just going to get more of this\nAnd anybody that the Democrats don't like is is going to be subject to guilt by accusation and this type of smearing slandering that goes on I'd also like to see a change in the standard in the law if you're a public figure well do you have to show in ... the absence of malice how do you prove an absence of malice\nIt's a ridiculous standard that nobody could ever reach which is why people like you and me whatever what people say about us we get stopped taking it sure look\nLet's say I think that overwhelmingly the American people do not want to reward that kind of behavior and I've seen you seen it now and the kind of surveys we're seeing now are amazing people have moved\nVery significantly in the last week and it shouldn't reaction throughout despicable oh and how vicious and how personal or the Democrats and they brought this on themselves and I think that they're not going to reap whirlwind\nOr I missed the
