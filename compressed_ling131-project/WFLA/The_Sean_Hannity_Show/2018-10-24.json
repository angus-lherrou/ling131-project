Seventy WFL eight and ... to clear water\nSomeone is gonna get hurt or worse if these mobs don't stop what they're doing now the mobs in the case as I was talking about you know let through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages pipe bombs\nThat had been sent to Obama in the Clintons apparently and and CNN and others um how many times yesterday on this program that was a story about George Soros apparently some the vice had been putting his mailbox\nAnd I listen what am I say about George Soros yesterday why they have it on tape let me say what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device\nWas found near a George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list or George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away I Want to be clear with everybody\nThis crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop\nThis is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days\nAnd on almost I you could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of the senators\nIs going to end up getting assaulted or worse you got to clear the halls you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces spinning and Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders\n... when you can't let this continue because it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing\nI didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children were run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud or the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she has to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife ... they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face you know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or\nGuys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this\nHe's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing he's not working is on his off time\nSome guy comes literally right up to the table to bangs on the table and then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is\nAnd throws the guy's food out in the street and then starts screaming at the top of his lungs and then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their\nLeftist activist they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out these incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news there is some truth to fake news\nAnd they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that is or racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he the nationalist and his policies\nOh the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they weren't just disproportionately impacted\nBy the horrific\nPolicies are bronco bombing sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where people are dying\nNow you have a few famous people that have had these suspicious packages that have been sent and let me be very you know leading up to this I have been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt\nI don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American hurt I don't want anyone in a caravan hurt it ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states\nYou want to avoid confrontations like this if you can\nSo we had a pipe bomb suspicious packages sent to the Clintons home and chaplain claw similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters\n... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros his home in Westchester New York suspicious package sent the Debbie Wasserman Schultz is officer investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face\nHolder kick them they go low we pick up Hillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant sing department stores in\nGas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore and watch it had happened to all these Republicans as any of this\nYou know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are\nUm you know let me be very clear I Know I Know firsthand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today\nI've had similar incidences of security in my life\nYou know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl at work for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally\nYou know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news and she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation because we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent don't get packages anymore in my life\nUh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will\nDisclose here it's not about me today but I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that was it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with reports suspicious packages and\nYou know that were sent to the Clintons Obama recall there was another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story but if you go back to three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters\nWere actually sent to President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis\nOr FBI Director Christopher Wray or CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here and then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve skull east nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations they barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin hurt the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people I I never saw such her was it was amazing\nBut you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing in the build up to all of this and everyone else has been silent this isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that skill Lisa shooter happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSean Hannity didn't go on the air and say say I blame Bernie I just I did the opposite I don't know I Can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible for the actions\nWay you want me to\nRadio nine seven WFL a good afternoon\nI'm Dana males are top story at three thirty officials say crude pipe bombs were mailed to the homes of bill and Hillary Clinton

midterms\nIn other words she's purposely lying again to the people of North Dakota\nStaffers saying she's acting moderate only to get votes\nAnd hike camp staffers want people to think that is used for the wall and she's not for the wall and saying that if there's a blue wave show move left and saying that their staff are saying Trump will be impeached if the Democrats win the Senate but of course she's not saying any of this publicly listen to an election [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nDifferent\nIssues were running but she was\nGood for\n[noise] that you aren't getting elected when they didn't really liberal yes she's ... she's\nFrom\nI don't like to she took them bomb a poster that\nOh that's my favorite pictures that are [laughter]\n\nAnd yeah you know I'm all year okay\nWhy\nThat are not yelling\nAt me now\nHe's not coming to an end to a campaign for us either\nWhy now\nFrom what I can tell is that you know in a very\nRepublican I had no yeah it's\n\n\nA long line [noise]\nUm [noise]\nYeah this is the same same thing with a with Claire\nLewis Land them in our interest and down you know because it makes people fall out here\nSo don't say she I supported the wall is active or whatever those on the ground saying\nOkay because justice as or something like making people gossip doesn't support the wall and the other day I don't know but ah so I don't say that she doesn't want them in time is\nThat people don't really understand this is my head on and then\nHe like he\nWas right on the wall or was on the one who has a horrible horrible\nShe'd do move against the wall [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nAnd then the other\nOne and they didn't want to be like you know\nThe amazing this is now number three British send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal but she's not going to tell you that until after the election\nAnyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you [noise]\nHey showing great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is that consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they can basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people tendency ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nA there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same user and everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those a bottle of like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well\nBecause the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to want to moderate voters and play that they are progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it and we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's got to be selling liberate once you get selected that staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in this video quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties told or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that ... that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known to be true but my point is just have integrity does it it's not really a left or right thing I was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and\nHearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to move the moderates and that and they can only make one choice\nOnce but if you're not a good choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody in his staff but McCaskill asked should be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone no and it it it's in a hurry to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's\nIt's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something I'm Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks then how wrong is that for that\nAnd to mislead the voters if it's it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such an awful way\nI'm Dana males are top story at five thirty officials say it would appear to be functioning pipe bombs were mailed to
