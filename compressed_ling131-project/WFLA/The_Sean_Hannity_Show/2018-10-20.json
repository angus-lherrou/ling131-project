{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "As well the guardian ad litem office there is that a team of attorneys that are amazing\nAnd so we were actually we're the only non profit um that funds a guardian ad litem program in the state of Florida to be able to pay for things to that legal team\nYou know sometimes we think about these cases and they go to court and you think well to the child should have the best representation possible and I was ... and I believe that the lawyers do but they don't have the funds to possibly get that expert testimony or a psychological evaluation of the parents to make sure that they're in a stable\nEnvironment um and so we try to fund those items and and sometimes it's surveillance sometimes at paying for depositions\nLittle things like that all adds up and so we try to support that legal team as much as we can so that they can make an a decision and the best interest of the child\nAlong the way like I said we try to keep the children out of the court room I'm the guardian ad litem volunteers their child advocate will go into the courtroom for them so that there aren't there we don't want them to be re introduced to a their parents or offending party\nAnd um but there's times when the child has to retell the story and when that happens we uh have Florida is their first courthouse facility dog named Tibet who is a beautiful golden retriever lab mix and she and her handler Brenda ...\nWho is a full time volunteer um travel between the courthouse and another facility called ... house and they sit with those children and and the children have to share their story or Tibet sits and\nLess and the child recounts and is able to be um smuggled we called them ... hugs [laughter] with the up but um you know to that one of the one of the most magical things for me is\nUm if any of you and your life have a six year old child you know that it's not really easy to have a six year old sit for an extended period of time um but there was a six year old child who needed to tell a story and as\nA the story was being told Tibet sat on the floor and the child massage Tibet ear kind of rolling the ear over and over and her little hand I'm sharing what happened for three hours while in the first three hour that would have been\nReally difficult without sitting there and\nYes I Am and you just as it is just kind of got into her um frame of mind and she was peaceful and she was able to share everything and and the people were able to ask questions and\n[noise] and that is that's the gift it's a special gift and um we partner with a great organization or a land do called a companion stuck canine companions for independence and this dog is purpose bred for this so different than a therapy animal um Tibet is is special and\nThat you know she really can set and and be pet and loved and and it's evidence I'm On the floor you always we call them Tibet sprinkles and you'll see just a little pile of\nMurderer [laughter] after all the loving and um\nSo we're very proud to have that program as well and I think the last thing that we do and we try to support as much as we can\nIs the recruitment of these volunteer child advocates and we need more of them you know we have seven hundred we have over thirty three hundred children on we have some case where some uh some guardian ad litem volunteers that\nHave as many as eight children that they're trying to help a lot of you that's a lot [laughter] it's a big ... you know some of these children maybe from a family unit\nAh siblings but they may not I'll be placed together and so it it's a it's a calling I think that if you are an individual who feels like\nYou um are passionate about children and about the rights of children and that you are not intimidated to share your voice in your opinion and and go into a courtroom and share your story which I think any of us that you have a\nA young person in your life you automatically become passionate about them you know and and it's so it's it's easy to get caught up in the story to make sure that they're safe because that's what we want to just a safe permanent and loving\nHome there at the end of the day I'm as a volunteer guiding light on if you're able to help that child down that path you know ... it's very rewarding experience I'm not going to say it's always magical sometimes there are things that happen um but you just you the best you can\nHave you seen a renewed interest in the program since we've had some high profile cases in the area that are brought the foster care system into into the news or have you seen more people interested in helping out in that way we\nDo in fact you can go in the guardian ad litem website and sign up for an information session and we suggest that anyone that's interested do that first and we are finding that we are filling those seats thirty people at a time where maybe it was Fifteen people at a time I'm we're finding that\nYou know I think some people think that volunteer work is just for those that maybe are retired\nUm maybe even a stay at home mom and the kids are at school and his hours\nBut that's not the case of guardian ad litem a it's a whole range of professions a whole range of individuals and I'll get my special clog we need more men they're men out there\nThat doesn't matter if you are working full time job CEO of a corporation if you have ten hours a month to dedicate to a child\nI we need you need you because uh there are a lot of times when these young boys in the system need a male role model to look up to\nAbsolutely yeah that makes a lotta sense we're doing the best of the bay on your host Ryan Gorman with me in Studio we're joined by children across borders one voice foundation\nAnd voices for children in Studio with me were just listening to run a Kennedy executive director of voices for children also we have ... cofounder of children across borders and Mary ...

with using ...\nPhil media platforms to create listen in his ...\nSocial media accounts also creating email accounts\nThat all are designed to make it look like it was coming from a United States citizen then it was coming from somebody here in the U.S to according to\nThe charging\nDocuments to create an amplify divisive social media and political content\nAmong the ... are among the\nTopics here according to the wire reports and this is a combination I think this is Associated Press and NBC News or the topics that were uh were broached tear gun control of the women's march the NFL anthem\nSituation gun control and I say gun control gay rights\nAre also picking up on specific events also ah fomenting a discourse on the horrific Las Vegas shooting\nA little over a year ago on the strip of the country concert also oh I'm trying to stir things up with that that Charlottesville debacle that unite the Right rally\nUh there were numerous a political positions that were taken it wasn't just one it was just trying to sway opinion\nYou also had American politicians that were attacked Paul Ryan John McCain Mitch McConnell\nA former president Brock Obama or\nJohn McCain did I say McCain Marco Rubio or on the list here or the federal prosecutors image court charging documents\nAre they included a display of these are fake Internet uh graphics these these Internet means if you will\nThat were posted and then tried to circulate via all these bogus social media accounts are pretending to be\nAmerican people trying to push this narrative out when in fact you have a a woman heading this thing up in St Petersburg Russia ah\n[noise]\nI've got some examples of the means you don't get to that in a second again this is just breaking up kind of a rolling through this a live having a chance to look through all the charging documents here uh the federal prosecutors said this Russian woman Kush ...\nIs a chief accountant for a\nRussian organization called the project locked huh\nWhich they get their money\nFrom a a rich Russian dude otherwise known as an oligarchy or his connected the Concorde companies and they were also involved in a separate indictment that was brought back in July by Robert Mueller's team\nAnd they were accused of metal linger attempted meddling back in the twenties sixteen elections so here we are new Russian Mets but you know I got to be honest here a false breaking news here on Smith I don't think I'm is worried about this Russian meddling [noise]\nAs I Am about the Texas Democrats meddling known Russians here old I'll get to that you're the second one of the means quickly let me let me bring this thing up and I just I downloaded a file\nOn one of the Russian means for instance a ... to to try to sway voters or to so um anger and and this course one of the means that there's a Russian woman\n[noise] ah put out is a photo of a what appears to be a Mexican or Central American family or a a father or mother who's pregnant clearly with a big baby bump sitting down and then a whole bunch of other kids in their laps\nAnd ... it's a photo of what they want you to think are are illegal aliens are either in this country are coming to the country and you must Internet me with the photo of what's purported to be illegals\nThat captured the graphic says every deported illegal household saves taxpayers seven hundred thousand dollars that's why it is very important to keep families together\nAs they're all being deported\nSo again you've got multiple things at play here just one of the the means but going back to I did I pick your curiosity here\nOr that I'm not as concerned with the Russian meddling per se or ... you know again I'm being slightly facetious here yes there is no place for Russian meddling the Chinese are meddling multiple governments are those are the two biggies the Russians are the Chinese and there is zero tolerance to zero plays for this and\nIt it is in foreign countries trying to interfere with our democratic process you in the United states and I've got a zero tolerance it did happen back in twenty sixteen or it is happening now we knew what was happening we've been talking about the continuation of this for months and months and months so much that I'm I'm\nNot trying to downplay Russian meddling is a problem a Trump needs to be tougher with let them in Portland has come around a little bit but not as tough as he should have been at the beginning uh and I've got zero tolerance however let me tell you what else either zero tolerance for\nHow about Texas Democrats\nAnd their election meddling yeah talking about interference I got your interference right here right here I Am from what I mean literally ... right here [noise] [laughter] got it right here [laughter]\nA
