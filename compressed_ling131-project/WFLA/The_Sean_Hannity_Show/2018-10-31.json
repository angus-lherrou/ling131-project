[noise]\nI thought they did a terrific job and I was glad to see the cuckoo played okay sure get you played okay the young guys yep [noise] so [noise]\nHurting at a good game but the Ernie had a good game the image and everybody was all in the same direction that I I thought so I thought that the way the wheel of a game or we're waiting Ryan McDonough\nMatch they were high with three points tonight a goal to assess he scored the snowman goal three but his assist on the ... that was a big goal you mentioned at the time was kept the lighting of the hour like Enron but done to join us downstairs well\nRyan this game to start the way you guys want it but it didn't take long to get your skating legs [noise] oh what kind of look for you once you got into the game but the first period [noise]\nSo definitely uh not not necessarily wanted especially coming off what happened in our last game uh we were little just a segment stuck in the mud and not moving our feet so regroup there quickly thankfully uh Kobe ... give us some life there was a big goal in in a big two goals to get us rolling and I think I started to settle in and make plays into the sea the ice\nAnd the power but you guys pass around pass around and then you've got a worried on to the states who does\nThat mean obviously we are in jail great about our policy when in Arizona giving up some and not very much so\nThere's a great time for us to respond here and\nKnow our big guys from the talk shows and that's and and that's what she wants to go the shooters set them up as much as we can [noise] yeah\nSo look it's a nice three game people going to look at the final score and say blow out I mean [noise]\nDon't get lost in the shuttle year hopefully people won't lose sight of the fact that the point\nLine and you would draw it going head to head with that he's your whole Mary lied and they got the power play goal that you guys did a fantastic job what was the key to try to limit their [noise] their dangerous chances are just\nTo return overs you want to manage the buck obviously against the top line and then just using your ah structure stand on top of I'm not giving him time and space\nWell it's interesting because the line that went against them as also keep winning games for the lightning I've operating point might have been the best part of the odds yeah he was flying than I and he created a lot of off at day which was good to see and and we were talking about it off there are a little bit I mean he can match up so well with other teams first line\nIt's hard to get away from them because of the speed of the tenacity and then you compliment him with a guy he has on his wing just a good when it and we talk about all the time just pick up like yeah pilot points right now and it's just going to make a difference like\nWell they look at those ten game segments and whining at a really good first ten game segment right you know they went seven to one that's Fifteen points well now you started a new ten games like that and you're off to a good start\nNow you've got a tough team coming down the day and then you know the back to back over the weekend so there's just no way out by that he'd go every other night or back to back so you got to keep on going but a very good start to the second time game\nSegment and a good way to finish October they finished the month eight to one one with we looked at that schedule the five games at home to start a little bit of pressure there to not let it slip on you and then the top five game road trip to come out of this first month eat too and one is outstanding\nThey say you don't make the playoffs in October but you certainly can not make it a ... or whatever the\nYeah the kings for example yet topped off they'll climb as do the Panthers\nYeah you you don't want to get behind the eight ball in Tampa Bay certainly has given themselves some\nBreathing room I think moving forward here and they're playing some good hockey\n[noise] All right Greg will talk to you on Thursday got to sign off thanks to everyone involved in tonight's broadcast including ... back in the lightning renting in our studios Steve or cynical long set us in the radio booth\nFor Eric ruins than regular alien Phyllis ...

you guarantee you're going to come out with the kind of effort that you needed to have was this exactly what you're expecting\n... besides the first five minutes um yeah I think that kinda\nWoke us up a little bit to be honest it was just a couple of characters to turnovers and once we corrected then I thought we control the majority of the play I'm also talked about special teams benefactor tonight and\nUm and they were um you know even the ... gave up his or his Mac and goes into those guys have been outstanding power play bounce back tonight um and we won the special teams and and that helped us one\nHow much is that a sign of a mature teen have the first five minutes later today correcting quickly and then get back to your game\nYeah for you know for a couple of years now I think with\nWith this team in particular with the core that we have there there's always going to be a belief that you know we we should win games if if we play the right way doesn't matter if it's one nothing to nothing early\nYou know obviously the the ... exception but you know when it's that early in the game you just need to get the next one a vast you shut the door and give us a chance to gain some momentum obviously Coby ... fly in and um you know I thought he had a really good game tonight not only from the two goals but just um\nControlling the puck utilizing his his size 'em and made some really good players and nice to see him get rewarded with two that really gave us a momentum\nI Know you don't really care much about a milestone moments but that was your three hundred and fifty a career goals that meaning to you right now\nIt's like it's ... nice to to score goals it's something that you probably look back in your career uh obviously like to to keep a scoring and helping her team won but um\nIt's always nice when he he can get an accomplishment ... like that but definitely I'm not first thing on my mind right now I'm just want to keep the keep getting better there and and doing it and you can help it one\nHow much should the shift to start the second period by the point line they're really just kind of set the tone for you got a second period\nYeah that was used those guys were were button um [noise]\nYou know the age brings you know so much he's an energy and and that was a tremendous shift of just hunting pox get in touch to the net and I'm obviously getting rewarded that's that's a typical anytime you can score in the first minute of a period gives you some momentum and you could see from there on it was it was a pretty dominant period ...\nWhen you guys as a team or as a relentless on the for check as you work for a good portion of tonight is that the style a game you need to play yeah absolutely\nThat's that's what our teams built for 'em when you look at our forwards up front on this\nSpeeding quickness and that's to to for checking a different style that may be a big physical team or we're gonna get guys in the ... are going to disrupt plays 'em\nAnd they set the tone with with that shift and carrying on and it was nice to see us come back and never really good game in front of a home [noise]\nSorry the air curl up and talking to the ... dam goes after the game is our game recap continues brought you by fire choice at the next leaving home game fans can take ten dollars opt for each let me go up any service up two hundred dollars at their local tire choice auto care center\nHe let's bring into the broadcast down there talking to a lightning players and I've got to think feeling very good about this when particularly coming off that a five game road trip\nThat they weren't thinking that five minutes into the game for sure but the you know it's it is a sign is asked even there are of a mature team to be able to right the ship so quickly into the game usually it takes you know an intermission to kinda\nGet things moving in the right direction but they were able to correct it pretty quickly on the bench their income back in and play their style a game and I think that's very important having coming off that game in Arizona you fall down two bowls five minutes into the game and you start to\nYou know ... a team might get rattled by that this team didn't get rattling and to me that's just such a positive sign of a mature team that knows what it takes to win\nYeah and then having brain cover and get your first two goals really probably woke them up and she said\nIt did in in a lot of praise for breaking Coburn in that room tonight uh you know the the the team gives out their little awards and he was wearing the camouflage jacket for basically player the game for the team in a you know those are big goals and\nYou know it gets lost a little bit in in a game where you scored eight but those were two very big goals for this team and for him to do it then you know a breaking point was very excited to see his namesake so to speak up put up a couple of goals are and get rewarded for some of the work that he does because he's the type of player that block shots and does a lot of the grunt work\nOn the defensive and and get rewarded for a couple of goals that the the the locker and definitely felt good for breaking Coburn\nA great job will talk to you or tomorrow I ... I grow up in from lightning lunch and lightning insider dot com check out his work tomorrow one or two on lightning power play\nAll right we'll get some more and abused when we return to look at the post game scoreboard as well if they beat up on the devils that I ate the three you heard earlier and letting radio a false\nDeserves recognition for the dedication on the field and\nI were still wants service for those of tons of viable impact on our youth and those walls are rewarding twenty world class Hillsborough impassable youth coaches with one thousand dollars each why we're thirty one but come forward slash cheers before November ... chief nominated coach that has made the difference in\nIt was all brain and point because the lightning the first few minutes and you know getting your legs back after the road trip and that tough loss in Arizona that takes a couple of minutes but couldn't get out of his own passes\nOr hitting legs and bouncing off sticks and it just seemed like breaking point just turned on the motor\nSliced right through the middle of the ice a few seconds later Coby gets shot from the left point the lightning round the board and it's almost like the lights went off the bell went and the guy said you know we start moving or feed will be good and a lot of teams aren't going to be able to keep up with the lightning and it was all downhill from there for the devils tonight [noise]\nYeah I don't quite know where to start a with with all of it it it wasn't it wasn't very good start we're Jeff ... in between periods and he said it looked like a continuation of Arizona and at the beginning of the game [noise]\nUm it was apparently about ... management but it was just a lot of mistakes and coverage a which\nAre really playing them in in Arizona and I think that's what a ... I had been referring to 'em but you know they they cleaned up and and went forward\nFrom there and uh went forward with gusto again the winning tonight aged three will look a little more tonight's game and individual performances later on in the program and we will hear from junk Cooper as well but first our guest is here ladies and gentlemen Slater cuckoo\n\nHouse later before we talk about the the game as a whole are after Coby got those first two goals are you guys like hey you know to save some for the rest of us defense but here I mean you've got to share the welfare but guy well\nI was trying to rub my stick on is trying to get a little bit of heat office and he was sitting next to me and I had to move it was too hot that guy where where are you guys lobbying the coaching staff now let me go out with ... I Want to be as partner next time around he could've had\nThree two yeah the ... period he uh just like as a second goal so ah no those games are awesome and a\nFor him if he wants to start to go your way out of fun playing and those ones right although at the same time it it it tends to get a little ugly when John Heinz called the time out you know he wasn't singing happy birthday to his team over there on the sidelines\nAnd they came out and they were smoking hot after that it can get a little edgy and it looked like it was out there\nYeah I we knew they were going to come our um even on the road no team wanna wants to be embarrassed that we had it happened in Arizona unfortunately and then a thought it was good response than I\nAs far as the way you guys were creating a the chances um and it just starts to build on itself and then you start to see whether it's breaking point skating or whether it's coaching staff member owned a power play or whatever you just get that feel on the bench like here we go\nYeah I think it was a the second period there for a minute and then we had a five on three and you can just tell the way the power but it was moving it that it was our night and uh\nThey were just feeling it and that's pretty fun to watch\nIt all pretty much just keeps rolling from there now even though you look at the final score it's aged three as we were discussing when you're making your way up here a little bit of a sluggish start there was just getting over a you know the last game the travel and everything else\nJust finding your feet or is there something else to it I'm not sure I uh I'm with you I we uh when we came out and got down to nothing early I was a bit worried I think um\nYou know we've regrouped on the bench and and kind of dug deep a federal that down and had a very good at the end to the first period which was crucial for the rest of the game\nYou an idea in a little conversation this morning talking about getting back on the line up in in Arizona and this is now your second consecutive game at least that you know a chance now to get something\nRolling and how how important that is but ... ...\nA lot of a great point that they're at the beginning of the year you didn't play in the first nine games do you play it in the tens game in Arizona\nBut it wasn't even so much the number of games it was the time period right that you had to sit out because from your last preseason game too when you got into a game night\nWith the way they see the start on a Wednesday guys didn't even start till Saturday didn't play again until Thursday so now time as a laptop so it was really the weeks that we're building up even more than the nine games sitting out that made it tough for you\nYeah and like we were talking about if if we would at nine games in a you know Fifteen or Eighteen days it would've been a little bit easier as you're obviously it yeah so you know I always sucks but um it would've been easier\nIn if I didn't miss three weeks or whatever it was it oh yeah yeah yeah\nAnd even though there was that long time to be a number of games are days in between them I mean you've got a lot of pros working around you so you've been partner with Dan Jr already so how does the grizzled veteran help you just get back to speed like that where you don't miss a step\nDespite the time off I I thought we worked well tonight I thought we support each other or made some good breakup plays a dance great to play with obviously I'm I Know I'm not headman when he looks older but hopefully I can uh [laughter]\nNot many people are so don't feel bad little smaller when he looks to Atlanta [laughter]\nHe's not looking down at down at you know he's a great\nGuy and funny guy in the room keeps them loose and a very good teammate\nYou've had to go through this last couple of years now where you do go long stretches and you don't get a chance to play or\nWhat have you learned from it how do you deal with it may be better now than before or or does it get any better\nIt doesn't get better uh [noise] I always want to play um\nThe thing is I Believe in myself I Know when I get in the lineup I can do things and I'm contribute to this team and play solid it's just getting there like I Know what I can do that that's what makes it easier um if I'm missing a game [noise]\nYou know you have to have that self belief that uh I'm going to be All right and uh I think I have it and some days are tough obviously just like everyone has tough days but yeah I'm I'm very blessed and fortunate to be where I Am and uh I have a great support system around me and you're also\nFortunate to uh get free admission to how scream over Bush gardens Slater was one of the four players who are lightning vision staff are cameramen extraordinary ... followed them through\nAnd I don't think it's an accident you you put the young guy Anthony ... smart man Anthony ... really is fearless he'll go into any corner he'll pick any play\nBut if you've got to Freddie Krueger ... he jumped out at me he he know that it's a puddle that had to be fun to just kind of a push 'em through that haunted house well the thing is only the first\nGuy get scared through those houses because after that the cameras and the lights and uh after you see someone jumped out at the first guy you're like oh they're yeah yeah so the rally went first and uh I think we want another house and said he pocket went first I was pretty funny too I got\nA my gift was I got to go on the front seat of the roller coaster there you go that's what I like so it was fun\nDid you guys are draws draws or did you make the kid go first the first one he ... he had to go yeah [laughter] ...\nRight yeah that's a race of changed about a hazing initiation so if you're in the haunted house you're you're going for his earlier so well we knew that tonight's game it's going to be important or just because you you had to push past the Arizona game completely so now you've got to keep it going you got a completely different challenge in Nashville Thursday\nSo how do you guys approach that game while they're going to be a tough opponent obviously they're having a good season I'm just like New Jersey a\nUm [noise] I don't know we had a long road trip there kind of fell off at the end like we were talking about uh I think tonight is huge for Thursday as well as the weekend coming up in a auto in Montreal yeah absolutely a tough\nBack to back and then you're back home for more than a few days is going to be a nice change over the last few weeks and uh hopefully we see out there uh for a lot of these games coming up here Slater too 'cause our guest on\nThe last ... thanks for joining us later I had gone out and we'll take a quick time out here and\nWe will hear from John Cooper and just a few minutes and also\nA look ahead to that game it gets Nashville on Thursday in touch up on a few other points following tonight's win an eight to three victory over in the New Jersey devils so stick around as the last call presented by Jack Daniels continues just a moment on nine Seventy WFL a nine Seventy\n[noise] and when you went to the ... Clearwater [noise]\nAre you not a boring parts and then tonight jak done you tend to the honey may be for you because it's made them more warming honeybees and many boroughs don't ask\nPermission from the twilight big demand satisfaction from it and what the goals that never go to voicemail used the bond started on the brink and you'll ... honey and make the night will\nForestry response would be better if I'm a mom I'm always going to do was burned Tennessee [noise]\nPods moving and storage cleaning out my will deliver a container maybe he'll help you pack it's just trying to find work keep things that are secure storage Center for as long as it takes not happy about this or keep them on site for quick on loading loading I said unloading I mean I'm sure you did\nBut he controls things and dominates the play and allows players to have a fence of chances so he effects that line so then when things went south and uh it became into this game or does Miller go back and he goes back with the big boys and he had a big contribution again it was not just coach and it was not just Ammar\nAnd um I think a JC Miller's become to fix or\nAnd we talk about a belief in yourself and having the right attitude Slater cuckoo we had that same discussion of Jaycee Miller a few weeks ago you know the moving from the top line to the fourth line bought a lot of people can see it as a demotion because\nFor is a lower number of them one and in in how you put your lines together here I have ... role he realized why he was there a he realized that if he was going to get the opportunity to be lined up with a you know different teammates and the different role\nHe was going to have to accept this and excel at it and boy did he ever so that when the time comes where coup Scott I'm ... no brainer All right we'll put that top line back together and it's gotten results\nFar well especially going into a five game road trip you know you know you're going to you have some tier players so you're going to want to use your entire line up a lot more so when you can put a skill\nGuy along with Callahan and pocket to to make that you know skill more available they played more minutes I mean when they played against Colorado or they played against the top line an awful lot and they did a heck of a job against that and the kid in line and at that point I Would say they were the best lines in the league\nAnd they did a heck of a job on them so um and then also you know when the fourth line starts to go they're not playing against top line centers on top line forwards so if you can get production and they should get the odd production because you know they're not facing those top guys all the time that's spreading the off and so this is all about\nAnd a real quickly before we take a quick time out and we'll hear from head coach John Cooper I Want to get back to breeding Coburn this is a very big season for Britain Coburn his contract is up after this year or whether it's his future in the NHL is with the lightning or with another team he's got plenty to prove this season so that he can get\nPresumably one more kicking the can down the road another two or three years in this league I he's come into camp or he came in the camp with a great attitude or you know really you'll from the physical standpoint worked on his off season training came and feeling leaner faster a little sharper but I also have to wonder\nOften being paired with Mikhail surrogates yet\nYou got the young guy a on your side there it you've got to kind of over see and you know kind of mentor him but also we've seen it with guys you know Marty would say this one he had Steven stand cos on the line you know it kind of you\nBreathe a little life into these old bones and you've got to think that that's got to be a little bit too but you know we are only eleven games in the season here but uh I've got to come in Britain Coburn set of really good solid start to the season and you know defensively he's been solid this year and for him to get the office of rewards tonight was real fun to say\nYeah it's a really good to see him get a couple of goals um\nHe first of all he's always been fabulous condition so he's got a couple of years left in a he's not like you know other guys that get into their towards middle thirties that makes you old anymore in the league and he's getting their um he's incredible he works like a horse in the in the offseason tremendous long distance runner I'm\nEverything in the gym diligent as\nHe is one of those rare guys that have trouble keeping his wake up I Wish I had that problem\nBut he really has to work hard at it so you don't have to worry about that and he moves really well for a big man so he's got another year or so before you start to see him at first effort to is causing him to be behind and not even what the guys that's when you start to have an issue but a\nRatings very smart he he knows ... through his experience what he can do and what he can't what has limitations are and when you have those limitations\nWhat do you have to do to be successful against the guys you're out against and that's really what becoming a good pro was all about in in Britain code words a very good pro\nAnd we'll take a quick time out again John Cooper's posting comments coming up in just a moment following tonight's eight three when over a

presidents promise to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv\nTo Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel thinking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally\nJust the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look it would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve skull east on the ball field in and shot up these other innocent people\nYou know it it would have been it would have been wrong to blame Bernie Sanders Bernie is not responsible but what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not isn't it

with the president so he seems to be a hero in in\nOn the two pillars of the media continuing his trail and attacks against\nAnd migrants continuing to ratchet up the language about them just and and
