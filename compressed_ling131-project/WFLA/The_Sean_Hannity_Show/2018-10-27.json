for follow American social on Facebook and Instagram\nThree to light in your final breaking point joined us in the locker room pointer congratulations this was a hard topic was but it\nYeah it really was um I think we had a a good second pair that build us a bit of a lead and um you know they can stronger third or as he was huge obviously and I'm kind of hung on there but uh I think Korea did good jobs building the lead in the second\nSo I Want to ask you about the third period because definitely like they had a ton of puck possession but at the end of the damn kind of picking back and you know they had some gray days when they got the goal but you guys defended even though you didn't have the ... which wasn't the way you wanted that third period on bold\nDid did you feel like you defended pretty well to limit the number of chances based on how much time they had\nYeah I Would say I would say pretty well I'm like you say we obviously wants to go out to be playing in there and but um you know sometimes they they're good team and he's you know sometimes they are going to take a suicide vest and like I say ... so I wouldn't say we depend a perfect but I'm good enough to win\nWhat worked well for you guys and the second period that you were able to have those long extended authentic zone shift and keep them off\nThat they were we were just getting well and and\nMoving while I'm In there's on um you know creating some confusion kind of like they did us in the third and uh you know it's it's um you know it's just it's a game of ... and I think we did a good job of of you know not having it with a fucking throwing it away but I'm putting at the spices right I feel about\nThe end of a long road trip tomorrow I Know you see this one for a second but it's been a great road trip you can make it an unbelievable road trip is it important to keep your eye on the ball here and make sure you've been a strong even though it's the end of a long trip\nYeah absolutely um you know the we have a like you say another tough matchup tomorrow and in Arizona that you can skate and I don't have a ton of often so I'm assuming it was tough one um you know what you say you're going to drive a really good trip here if we could you point so folk who has no\nAlright point a congratulations for joining us by All right that was breaking point for the locker room he had some good things to say about kind of how the lightning\nHandled different points of the game let's bring in regular Nellie and\nGreg this is a good team I and I think we mentioned in the open the biggest is metrics yeah are better than their record and I think we saw that again tonight you know the thirty one shots\nCouldn't brake two goals you know I think like he said the second period whiskey I think the lightning in a way won the game and the first period because against all play they came out of that period up to to watch\nWhich was really important and that probably frustrated Vegas a lot but my point is that you know this is a good team and and the lightning maybe had a little\nBit but don't break there in the third period but you have to give credit to the other team for building a momentum and and coming up the lightning are the way they did\nYou do a Vegas is a good team or a playoff team but they they won this game Tampa Bay did without their best defense and the best defense spending the league for the majority of the game I mean that's that thing like I thought the turning point in this game that you can say there were many\nBut it goes back to Vegas not being able to convert\nAfter Carlson scores vast he makes too big says right McNabb yeah the breakaway because right away and then McNabb had one right after the gold Seventeen away a couple of minutes into the third I thought those were big because it goes back to you know statistically is Vegas regret thing a little bit when it comes to\nGoals per game than what they did last year at least shooting percentage wise maybe those two places illustrate\nThe issue from a macro level for Vegas not being able to convert on one of two glorious scoring opportunities so I thought that to me was a turning point from the standpoint that really in close vast he comes comes up big and he makes it saves\nThe lightning did a lot of good things but when the second period and yeah and\nYou know fans sometimes they're like well you did it in the second one you just do it in the third we talk about this all the time it'll hockey's a game of momentum there are two teams asked me the other team and sometimes it's going to get a little winded its back but what's been impressive really in all the games on the road trip\nYou know going even back to the Minnesota game which was the game in some ways is frustrating because the lightning adult lead ... we've seen when they are playing the game how hard it is but the other team to do much of anything and we saw that in the second period tonight\nWe did and you know maybe Vegas is most dangerous players Jonathan Marcia so and I I thought for the most part relatively quiet and the big games big games against Tampa Bay last year and you know going against her former teams sometimes that can get you going a little bit more\nBut you know look thirty five for thirty seven on the penalty killed day that's that's the story of the season I mean that's been right it's a pretty incredible I Know they got one tonight but it's been pretty incredible\nOne final thought before I started off I think that\nMaybe the best player from the beginning of the season until now consistently gaming gave out was the guy made the number well bats loves scheme to me I mean I'm kind of separating them because the goalie obviously has had an impact on every game blading\nHave one so far this year but I didn't rhyme and gun as having yeah nominal year and we saw it again tonight and again sometimes it doesn't show up on the ... that was taken away because they gave that\nFirst schools and other sister goal but particularly without had been for more than half this game ... done it just made so many good decisions with the puck and without the puck like went to attack the other team when they are potentially getting into a dangerous area\nI just think his decision making has been spot on this year and then when you're making the right decision obviously you can use your talent to make a play but I was just blown away with how well he played today he's\nPlaying like in the lead defense spending in David's it as simple as you know a full year or at least the full training camp with this team and being healthy and that might be it for ... getting getting used his team but\nHe played like a top two defense men when it had been went that he's done that all year but it's a nice luxury Tampa Bay has right now in the back and it's been a another big story for them to see them\nAll right Greg we're headed to the airport talk to you tomorrow save travel Arizona and the lightning wrap up the road trip will try and make it a a nine point trip if they can nine out of ten if they can get a wind tomorrow we'll see what happens\nAbsolutely be fun safe I

know he was very clear that you have these quarter have blown up he he said that these were not hoped devices\nOr I'd like to know why none of them blew up the components appear to be there you know how significant a blast would have\nBeen I think that's to be determined I'm sure we're going to find out more especially on why none of these Thirteen devices actually blew up and of course there were more devices that were discovered\nToday we had some ... to to count here the first device was sent to George Soros and that was the the device that was first discovered\nAt George Soros his house the Clintons got a package the Obamas got a package Maxine Waters got two packages and in fact apparently it was a evidence on on the one of the Maxine Waters packages it was late and fingerprint\nFrom one of the package is sent the Maxine Waters that they lifted the print off of that you know with with all of the the potential areas for an individual to screw up\nBecause you look the fees on below she looked at these devices they didn't look very sophisticated so I figured it was going to be a skin or a hair or a fingerprint\nIf all the scotch tape that was used to put the the labels down that were printed on a laser jet or an ink jet printers to cut out and then plastered on top of these manila padded gloves and then you know shipping tape clear shipping tape pulled over\nThey got a fingerprint on one of these packages and that's what the on well this and then of course some DNA evidence was also on ah some of the other packages as well\nSo late and fingerprints from a was it the one of the ... and then maybe some DNA from one of the waters I I was trying to write and and pay attention during the pressure and I got some of the audio we'll get to address the minute so the Clintons Obama's George Soros a Maxine Waters you had um\n[noise] Joe Biden and with two packages or you had a the uh\nThe package to Eric Holder that went back to Debbie Wasserman Schultz office of course all the return addresses well Debbie Wasserman Schultz or whose offices and she represents the neck of the woods where this individual is from\nUh the uh CNN John Brennan package the package to Robert De Niro and then the latest packages\nOr Cory Booker\nJames Clapper\nAnd a a catalog or Harris a senator from California who's ... who is very very very prominent in the Senate Judiciary and the Kavanaugh hearings and then so what what are we saying about atomic ... what are you saying\nRight ah and then a a Tom Sawyer and then apparently Tom Steyer also was the recipient so I Wonder if if Chuck Schumer is feeling left out\nIs Nancy Pelosi feeling left out hey I Want to go to phones here and you know I I'm going to be very very very very clear I Am going to be very direct that the phones over the last couple of days have been packed\nWith caller is saying that this was a democratic false flag that the Democrats were behind this you know many people thought that the Democratic party or or of a democratic operatives were behind this to make it look like a Trump not\nAnd I'm looking at the whole screen here for colds that you know wanna maybe correct what they said I'm just I'm just not seeing those types of calls\nHold folks whether you want to believe it or not I'm going to say this I'm not going to run away from this\nI Am a conservative I'm a registered Republican I voted for Trump I liked the bulk of his policies I don't like the way he operates at all times and I'm I'm a fair conservative entertainer that's what I Do\nYou're right to say oh yeah it's the president's rhetoric that drove this guy's engine and that's that's what she was getting at I I assume that's what you're pointing out as well\nYeah absolutely and then another question they said was a you know what is this guy's motivations are just the general there's going to have a mind reader with him what's that about\nYeah I wasn't you know they're looking for whatever they can glean and yes some of the questions I thought was stupid and misguided but\nAre not all reporters are rockets surgeons Brian thanks for the call and we'll try to get on

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Don you're on Schmidt thank you\nSchmidt non going\nHave to say about this whole crazy thing you do this they have to interrogate this guy get parents what this guy get it get him to tell them what exactly why he he came up with this idea and the the the only one or there's are there others beside him\nAnd the Democrats have asked for people who have the Republicans having the president has been saying stuff I mean he he says you know that the rhetoric or whatever but they're not going to do with this guy they find out why he did this\nAnd if this is a perfect way to blame the president by looking at that van for God's sake\nBut I think could be so that you could be a a A R Trump lover you can also be hate trauma say here and by\nThe but apparently he did registering as a Republican and he did vote for Trump be voted\nRepublican in twenty sixteen that's a long way to leave this that I just think we were dealing with the ranged individual then I think like Trump and dislikes the Democrats and as far as finding out others involved\nUh there were apparently five pen register warrants on this guy so they'll be able to see any calls that he made who we spoke to a maid or received phone calls I'm going to get into that a more detailed just a bit but Don listen of course the investigation must go all we must find out all the details and that's going

Schmidt hello Keith Hi\nHello how are you doing are doing well um\nYeah my comment is you know the news media is going to run with this you know they're going oh Trump's rhetoric that's what caused this Trump's rhetoric you know if you go to the rallies and you're listening somebody screaming um you know Trump and the Trump will say\nYou know what nobody touch that guy escort him out of there nobody taught you let him you know let him be just escort him out\nBut you know they get to the Democrats screaming kick 'em you know are called him kick them on a Maxine Waters and getting her face and they're the ones that are pushing you know violence and they don't even listen to the Trump I mean he's saying make America great again you know he's talking about the fake news he's not advocating violence\nOr kids hang on there there are problems on both sides and I have sure rented\nThe Democrats that you just referred to a with their comments the Eric Holder comment were then he tried to back out of the you know his little violent remark or Maxine Waters and her comment to harass Republicans and and don't let them get away with it we've discussed all of that ad nausea him\nBut on the other hand I I'm Sorry I cannot ignore and I don't ignore because that's what makes me and intellectually honest conservative talk radio entertainer and host unlike some of the others in my genre\nOr where I can still pointed out the fact that the president of the United states does not need to be calling the media the enemy of the people\nOr you know we have you can see the some of the mob mentality in some of the rallies with you know lock her up lock her up\nA and I I Do wish a Hillary Clinton I I think that Hillary Clinton should have probably been investigated a potentially charged with what happened with her email and private server and classified information et cetera that's a whole different argument\nBut as far as uh you know the president seeming to support Jim forte for instance in Montana\nAnd giving him a thumbs up and laughing about him body slamming reporter I Can't give that a seal of approval of sums up I can condone that\nEither yet but you know what it's nothing compared to the violence that the Democrats you know I mean they are over the top\n... keep us and its on both sides again the president\nHas such good policies Trump pests such good economic policies are for the most part I got my issues with our growing a you know debt and deficit obviously but you know we'll get into that a little at a later date but uh the economy has done well GDP Growth uh is has been phenomenal obviously new news on that\nA list at the bottom line is the president to back off of some of the rhetoric and I wish she would because some of the comes across as just a MBA silicon childish and he could take himself away from that\nAnd he won't give his critics as much to nail him on and of course\nYou heard it was some of the questions that the pressure and the media the pundits on CNN and MSNBC they're going to be all over this and they're going to say and they own already started that the president and the rallies and the chance of the crowd CNN sucks and then CNN sucks stickers on the side of the van of\nThis a pipe bomber who was just arrested in South Florida so they're going to of course they're going to tie this together but the president on some levels is giving them the ammunition to be able to blame him and Trump would do a whole lot of service to themselves\nAnd we conservatives and Republicans if he would just tone down and get out of campaign rile up the crowd mode\nAnd just focus on making this country better and I that's my advice to him thanks for the call Keith let's grab Russia's Orlando, Florida Russia Iran Schmidt high write\nA book this guy might be a right wing cook but how about the left wing cuckoo for somebody runs with an assault rifle Republicans at the congressional baseball game last year I mean there\nWasn't a a year a hundred percent right and that is that is on my little scribble list to discuss today a and you know you you beat me to the punch but you know we've talked about during the course of the week I talked about ...\nAnd ah the Democratic liberal nut job but did the target Republicans at the Republican baseball practice in of course\nHas changed the course of steam skull leases life uh for the rest of his time on this planet and you're right that would you want to talk about violence it was I Know what I Want to go to for tat here\nAnd you know try to come up with a a moral equivalence or justification but you know here we have this nut job that put together these devices none of them exploded nobody got hurt\nAnd yes you did have a a a a liberal whack job that actually tried to kill will live fire Republicans\nWho were specifically targeted at that baseball practice in northern Virginia and like you know ... I got your loud and clear I was ... I was on today's show I was good to go back into that narrative and discuss that so I thank you for bringing it up\nOh yes absolutely I mean there's wackos on both sides and I'm an independent voter I just don't like when political points or attempt to look a lot of these media outlets using it for you know on sort of you know that the Trump score points\nAll the mainstream media is going to use this apparent Trump supporting not job they're going to take this to the fire walls to use this against the administration and Trump you can count on it we've we've already seen it so\nThe media is going to overplay this and Democrats Democrats are getting a whale overplay the arrest of this a crackpot in South Florida Russ thanks for the call on if you're on hold standby right back to falls in a minute Linda Tiffany Day Vern all the other\nAnd on us forty one both directions or completely shut down just north of the road fifty to whom are real time traffic of it turned out to all of the new total traffic I've heard by traffic ...

[noise] the suspects is now arrested for all of the pipe bombs mailed to Democrats\nOr around the country so this is audio it appears to be Broward County sheriff's office\nA very ... or um some agency and Broward County now the arrest was made implantation the arrest was made at an auto zone get him to do an auto zone uh this this was a uh\nApparently he was a frequent customer the auto zone\nA initial report said he was an employee there apparently that's not the case but his van was parked in the auto zone they were following him they been all this guy for a least a day\nOr a day plus they pretty much had their sights on it they they took him down at the auto zone and this is police traffic audio\nOr a police scanner traffic a and you can hear them talking about the suspect vehicle and they even use signal forty six now in in Broward County a signal forty six that's code for bomb threats\nI and many other police agencies also will you single forty six a Broward County single forty six is definitely bomb threats so listen to this police scanner audio from just before the takedown just before the arrest\nOr just on when the ... the um in reference\nTo ... a correction just just after the arrest as what I should say so here we go and we're all from the beginning\nWe just don't I mean the ... the I'm referencing are important for our car and I'm not sure we weren't around shut down and then we'll start evacuated and we use the mark you're wearing the the the lord of the auto zone\nSo they're asking for mark units to clear the traffic because you know they're trying to figure out you know ... is this van cleared is there an explosive devices what materials in the van hey folks this nut job might have made the bombs inside the van because there's some speculation that might have been living in this van\nThe van is a cluttered mess the windshield but when when the tarp blew off a\nAnd you could see the expose windshield from some of the proper shots as they were hauling the van away I don't know what the hell's on the front dashboard of his old dodge ram but I it it looks like maybe a whole bunch of baseball caps the whole front dashboard is littered\nAlmost to the extent that when you know people back in the you know a couple of years back he's the take all those stuffed animals and and cram 'em in the back windshield or the back window of their vehicle you know what I'm Talking about this man is just a cluttered mess so that that's the audio\nPolice scanner audio Broward County implantation Florida just after they took him into custody at the auto zone we\nJust don't I mean the company\nI'm referencing are foreigners across our car and I'm not saying we want to drive\nAn hour is the single forty six is bomb threat he says we want the road shut down\nAnd then we're very accurate and a girl who you're going to mark you're wearing the than the north of the auto zone\nI said earlier just a little flavor as to what's going on now I before I go back to phone calls and I got to get into the the chip 'n' Dale dancer aspect of the there's a ... stuff that's coming out here\nOh here we get now see I've looked at my wallet monitor CNN sources suspect that the suspect was living in the sticker covered van\nThat he was living in a van down by the river with a whole bunch of stickers on\nSpeaking of the stickers and we just took a call before the bottom of the hour break\nAnd the caller was like you know I'm calling from Orlando I live in Florida and it was the folks I I've lived in Florida in Nineteen Ninety two I vet stickers on some cars I'm not really a sticker person but you know some stickers of faith in some stickers have have done fairly well but the caller\nEssentially emulating what a bunch of ah my my\nTwitter followers or people that have responded to me on Twitter are saying and they think that this smells the stickers or in too good of a condition\nAs I'm looking in one of the side window sticker or one of the side windows or the ban the image that has a my president no path to Seventy landslide it was three or six to not only a and then there's you know images of ah Toby Allen\nThere's the images of a couple of other countries singers I Believe\nI you know this collage it looks like it's one a sticker or one poster board type sticker\nThat he could have had multiples if he's been driving around with this for a couple of years or he is the digital file on a thumb drive and what it said he goes in print out a new one I mean so if\nYou have to go Schmidt yeah I just like to say this guy supposedly is living out of his van maybe to get the money for the full color graphics and the postage ... by bombs\nWell the postage you know six forever or stamps is three bucks or so you know he's he's got pipe\nBombs there's probably about ... what would cost Fifteen to twenty bucks to ship ships all the time\nRight and guess what I don't know the weight of them they they weren't metal pipes they weren't PVC pipe so that's going to be a whole lot that is going to be a whole lot to hold on a secular ... put Dave on hold let me go to the Trump\nOr at least ... where by President Trump speaking I just moments ago on the White House lawn\nRightfully so it was a big thing right now we have to start over again as a Republican vendors haven't always busy all the valley\nSo he was talking about the the bombing arrest do you have a lot of Senate races where we're leading to the president now talking about the upcoming midterm elections was moments you know talking about the uh mail bomb and rest\nA lot of people in the house that goes but I think we're doing very well\nBy reporters\nShouting questions over the ruler\nMarine warmer for the engines spoiled\nAnd we do but I think we'll probably\nStill couple of questions from the president or being answered a from a president answering questions reporter or reporters from the folks it's frightening it's been a busy week the president answering questions from reporters back today for a second here can you bring the backup\nOr they've only got\nOnly got about thirty seconds here not want ... young young\nTelegraphed all week on every talk show that you can listen to that they're going to find some Trump guy with all kinds of stickers and stuff all over again and this is you know played out all week all the different talk shows everywhere\nYeah you know I never said and I never really heard anyone say that it was going to be some nut in a van with stickers all over the were pro Trump I they've I I never heard that about ... ... you know ...\n... ...

S. bought the purchased the blame is a range the psycho who decided to mail these pipe bomb devices to these Democrats\nThat's who's to blame here\nAt eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine gets you on and again we've run the gamut here even even today I'm getting social media messages on my Twitter feed\n... Todd Schmidt folks saying oh this stickers all the anti democratic stickers and the pro Trump stickers all over the van a well they're they're not faded from the Florida sun there is an image\nWhich I re tweeted a woman claims that ah [noise] ah they took a picture of this van\nAh they took a picture of this van ... or the husband in a year ago November first of twenty Seventeen a woman and she's a verify Twitter accounts of she must be a writer of some sort\nAnd uh folks are accusing them of doctoring the picture a doctor or the image and now that's not really ... and with the claim is is that this band made a food delivery to her husband's office back in November of twenty Seventeen\nAnd that's why they had a picture and he had sent the bigger hunting look at this picture of this ban\nSo it's the same stickers on the van from a year ago\nNow does he ... they don't appear to be individual stickers they appear to be a a a a digitally printed collage\nOn one type of I'm bored or whether it's a plastic board or there's a film that's put on a plane whether it's Velcro to the windows were stuck to the windows or he might have multiple sets if they fade into Florida some folks that the conspiracy rabbit hole that is stupid\nI don't doubt that this guy is a nut job who happens to support Trump\nWho is just adore ranged psycho than it has all this crap all over his vehicle\nThat's it it doesn't mean Trump gave him orders to do this of course Trump didn't here's a report from media hype\nMedia is reporting that CNN has found footage of sayings I say Iraq\nIn sleeveless T shirts covered with pro Trump rhetoric and holding anti CNN signs and this goes back to a rally from Melbourne, Florida in twenty seven team\nAnd I'm looking at the video right here and it it looks like it it could be ...\nAt this rally that that's what they're claiming\nSo I don't think that and and those that are suggesting that this is a democratic a operation that this guy's been paid to do this or the stickers or to fresh and new looking this brand new this is just this guy is a is a either a puppet he's being paid a come on folks\nJust to face the facts here the guy seems to support propping just happens to be alone a tune\nThat the air\nSarah here there's no grand conspiracy\nFootage from Melbourne, Florida rally twenty Seventeen it appears to be him a CNN's were named Mars reported so much you know when I think I have a the audio here I Am I might be able just to play the all these individual\nAny Trump rallies from twenty seven\n... we had been digging into a senior staff backgrounds and coming across his social media and within our own video archives you are looking is highlight in there and this is as February of two thousand and Seventeen are\nMelbourne, Florida and ah this is toward the end of the rally at the end of the advance man holding a sign with his CNN's letters there that is ...\n... again ... standing behind the press wise or is that what was happening in front of him is that the reporters were going live from the rally and there he was holding a CNN south sign\nA back in Florida are back in two thousand and Seventeen or we have been going through his social media we do know that obviously authorities have been going through his social media as well his Twitter account extremely political in nature\nOr in going through many of his tweets or it is clear that\nHe had his eyes on his targets before he even I mean\nThere's a lot of the messages and there's a lot of\nA posts that our political and a year at a tax or some of these democratic targets that received and made comments about these individuals who have received\nThese pipe bombs in the mail eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine a nationwide number here on Schmidt this guy appears to be all over the road and I mentioned the shipping details and there was a report that he might have been involved with the ship and Dell's male dancers\nWell I it the chip and details have come forward\nAnd they said ah that no no no no he doesn't work for the ship and details but apparently in one point this a bombing suspect was working for a knock off organization not the actual real shipping details\nOr TMZ had reported the here's an extensive criminal history also worked for shipping Dell's as tour manager but then the ship and Dell said no no no not not us it turns out that apparently he worked for a similar type male dancer review a\nInternational gold productions\nAnd maybe the Caesar's Palace royal burlesque shows so and allegedly he was delivering food from some company\nA year ago in that van and a woman's husband took a picture of the ban in their parking lot and it was covered with the same anti a democratic stickers CNN sucks crosshairs on Michael Moore and Van Jones and Hillary Clinton and that was a year ago\nI back the phones here again there's just so many little pieces here or a single finger print a single little fingerprint which was lifted on one of the packages that was sent to Maxine Waters was enough latent print\nAnd that was match to fingerprints on file because he has a criminal record he's been fingerprinted he's he's been arrested multiple times in two thousand to the suspect on the phone threatened they Florida power and light customer service agent\nBecause they were going to shut off as a power for non payment and he threatened to blow up SPN out on the phone and said that he was going to blow up they're building a in Miami and it was going to be worse than nine eleven so he was arrested for that\nSo this
