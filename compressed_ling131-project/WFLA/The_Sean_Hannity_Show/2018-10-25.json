in it so you've been watching the growth of rather than here for the last couple of years McKinnon been this way and a\nMan [noise]\nCaves reader if it's a\nFine line to watch your priest called the games and take your opposing coach head off and that kind of admire their lines really uh they're fun to watch for sure we can it was going to coach to North America or do you want to think about him but yeah I Know\nI Do uh I got the child the mold in the morning skate and he's\nUm he's great like I've had them there I had him at a world championship so I'm very familiar with his skill set and and what he brings to the table and so it makes that much more daunting\nCompared to your team you have a one stop on the road you guys have been a little bit slow the top guys um is there anything you can do to get them going scoring why\nWell you want if you can have everything your team when all your guy score you're safe percentage really high goals against really low it's\nTough for that to happen and um I I just look at are the guys competing hard and and are they getting chances and they are so at some point\nYou know the McCain line they're going to be really hard to chances are not going to go in there just everything's going in for um right now so it's um it's hard to you you can't compare to where they're going it's just\nWe're getting contributions for a lot of guys that are team and that's what's helping to our team's success some provocative translates wins us we'll we'll take that\n... had against the ... the patients who have gone into my ... well\nYou look at the defense of side of things to Colorado their tops and league almost and\n... and and five on five so um [noise] this will be challenged to replicate what we did in Chicago but remember we only really excelled at it in\nOne period the other periods where still wasted did well but not like we did in the second\n[noise] but this is a different team and different night and and uh we just got to keep that mentality even if we don't get as many of the net um that's hotel do we have to move forward [noise]\nAll right so that was John Cooper earlier today and talking about Colorado and the difficulties in defending it seemed like that particularly their first line and it'll be interesting to see how do you have a base performance on Sunday against Chicago\nTranslates to tonight's performance art let's bring in the guys will be calling the game tonight the Michigan and Brian ... joining us and a guy's\nGoing to be with you and you know before we get into the game tonight maybe let's reflect a little bit with the the game we saw in Chicago\nIt's tough to say you know it seemed completely dominated by one opponent in today's parity driven league that we live in but at second Perry was pretty special in it just seemed like Tampa Bay dictated play for good portions of that period and you can make a case for the game\nYeah they did a there is no doubt the second period you know is it's a record so that speaks for itself Chicago joke line voltage Chicago coach afterwards\nSaid you know we didn't hit anybody we didn't take anybody out around the net or we didn't even touch the puck\nSo that pretty much says it all from from your coach um it's a nightmare for 'em because those guys just ran around on their own zone and when you were in the second period you that much farther from your bench that led bench muscle looked a hundred yards away for those defense minimum Chicago Blackhawks having said that\nI think it was almost a little bit out of respect that the lightning came most of the third period and said okay we're really smoke them enough and we've got a four to one lead and so they concentrated on good position they played hard but there wasn't that full on attack\nThat's going to be more of the focus and the rest will be look you have to get your minutes you know ... got to get us minutes points got his GED as minutes of the ... the triplets have got to get their minutes so um it it is truly a chess match for both cultures\nAnd I think one thing that you can do if you're the lightning you say All right but Keenan light is out there and it was just detail we heard from both coaches this morning about why that line [noise]\nIt's been so hard to handle we played the Cooper interviewed Jared been talked about it too and they do so many things well they can skate they look to shoot\nTheir strong they go to the net they play with a hunger but [noise]\nThey can't score if they're having to chase the buck and all that yeah so I mean I Know are simple formula and it's hard to execute but if you can make them play events that's one way to neutralize their attack unless they get a chance on a counter so you have to make sure that you're protecting the puck and managing the fucked well\nAnd then for the other three lines it'll I have to make sure that they're applying pressure and trying to build\nMomentum I think [noise] well you know it is go ahead right\nI was just going to say it's the classic there's only one ... so if you've got to they don't for sure so putting pressure any of the line that's out there for the lightning if they can spend time in the the avalanche zone and yeah put it in the right place even if they're not getting a lot of shots on that when that line is out there\nYou know they can only stay out there so long so that's a very important factor [noise]\nYou know but I don't want to ask you about defensively and Dave as well I mean okay we're only seven games into the season but\nYou know Tampa Bay is six in the league in goals allowed a two point five seven are you seeing anything differently this year than last year that made them better defensively is it just they're getting really good goal tending or to your point are they playing with the ... more and the other team zones zone to not have to defend so much\nWell they've gotten really good ... you always have to have that um that's that's important that's where you start right away um the lightning are real fucked possession teams if it's a puck centric\nNational Hockey league you you have to be able to play that way\nSeems that just sit back and play defensively you look at the Montreal Canadians and claw Julius he had the changes way they're they're they're more ... now auto ... he's changed his style Randy Carlyle in Anaheim these are all guys who hammered away on defense slowing the game down working your way to ...\nAll three of them have gotten on board now like we've got to go like ... you gotta go fast you have to get out ... years old and you have to head man the park\nSo the lightning set the tone for that several years ago John Cooper and the visor men and the entire organization saw that years ago we want to be fast we want to be scaled and are there at the top of the food\nChain when it comes to that so they're not going not going to change anything in that department they want the park and the more they have it um that means the other team asked jacket off of them and and get going in on the other end of the I ...\nI think there have been segments in games were the other team has surged graying and they've had\nSome dangerous chances but I think that is Brian alluded to old teams are feeling that I mean you're not going to just completely ... the mother a team for sixty minutes you know and if you're going to do it it probably is not going to happen in October if you're going to be having that kind of success usually leave the regular season\nInto the playoffs having said that certainly there probably kill\nIs a lot better statistically\nThen last year so they want an area that's a great point and I think there have also been segments in games where the lightning have had the windows their back and they've got a good job defending because they've had the pocket I look back at that third period against Detroit it's too on Detroit\nTo one lightning but Detroit at a strong second paradoxical I came out in the third period and completely smothered the red wings they had a couple of isolated chances through that final period but\nThat was a really strong defensive third period in part because blading played when the red line in but also in Detroit at the clock they didn't give him much so I mean I think that it's early in the season or see a mixed bag\nBut I Do think that we're seeing some good signs when the lightning are playing well that's I guess my mind at all or fire when they are playing well the other team is getting some great looks when they are struggling the other gene is getting great looks and the goal to enter as being as yeah today's game there there's no way\nYou can hold everybody down for for three furious for sure\nAnd you bring up a great point I think because the penalty kill has been so good and they've been so aggressive and they've been you know attention to detail I think that's carried over and said their defensive game five on five inside their blue light where they're more aggressive they're more in the right areas they're more attentive to men on manned situations that are dangerous\nAnd ah you know this is carried over to them and and they've done a better job inside their own it [noise]\nSo let's talk about that Colorado first line I mean ...\nObviously look at the numbers it's it's very very impressive Brian what sticks out the most when you look at those three players that are assembled on that first line obviously speed skill everything it seems like\nA nascent McKinnon is a freak of nature he's he's like a wild Mustang going up the ice you can just see he has got such power and speak I mean it's a powerful it's not nice ... like a nice Chris it's it's like a\nHorse coming out your full speed as soon as the home of the Broncos you know from you know exactly and he's got tremendous hands me to go on top of that rent is probably the least known player for\nBut he's got size any of these two hundred and Fifteen pounds and he was second on the TV it eighty four points last year he was second on the team to McKinnon and he's the overlooked one well not so much anymore he's good everywhere\nUm and they're trying to get him to shoot more so that's bad news for everybody who plays against them and land this guy is a classic to a conscientious player he won't give up anything and at his end of the ice he's not going to cheat\nAnd he goes into the top areas and he's also two hundred and Fifteen pounds with some great hands and he's on a roll right now he's got eight goals already so those guys have a little different look to all three of them and their chemistry fits perfectly and they've had success\nI mean last year is not necessarily a an indication of past is prologue but it's not like these guys haven't had past success against boy and the lady and\nSeen what they do yeah McCain had a hat trick you get the lightning couple of years ago with this building\nAnd as sixteen points and career games against the lightning and that a wild game here last year were lining at a big lead and almost surrendered it landed Scott how to address in five ... points [noise] [noise] well it's\nGoing to be interesting do we expect the breaking point line you would think again to to go against them the whole time [noise]\nI I Would I Would think that probably is going to happen more often than not\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised at all along the game there might be a little bit of line juggling going on for John Cooper depending on how the game's going [noise]\nThat'll be interesting because we know that there a line that can play any other team zone zone as well and\nMake that first line work really really hard a brain when you go take a look at the minute the defense are piling up right now we've seen you know had men and McDonough\nCarry on a pretty big workload you expect that just continue law all season long or you know the more maybe ... get comfortable with the his minutes increased a little bit how do you see that\nPlaying out it it varies from game to game a situation the score for sure makes a big difference penalties make a big difference I mean Victor had that one game where you is that the penalty box for six minutes so McDonough ended up instrument ended up with the most medicine that game for obvious reasons so you know that changes Victor doesn't normally do that but it it does happen\nUm strongman and they've done A R D shutdowns hair and they're going to be against top guys night after night so um [noise] against special teams how much are the lightning on a power play all those things are big\nFactors but actually ... minutes I think are actually down a little bit because McDonalds numbers are fairly big early on\nHere and they're both left side of the guys [noise]\nI don't think it's going to change much they don't want to burn out victory headman especially early on in the year so I don't expect the numbers to change my [noise] pretty easy\nDay we've talked about this before a pretty simple I should say when you talk about ... game but who is the sad I think since last January he's the second leading scorer on this team next they ... and you can make a case that Ninety percent of his goals are coming within five feet of the Gulf\nIt's been pretty remarkable Yeah John ... works\nOn the box telecast and he's like you're sat me but he comes up with some great stuff on earth that yeah that uh I think ...\n... like the total ... goal really for the number that he scored is like the shortest in the league in other words like going from the blue eyes scoring for\nThree feet out and if you add up the distance of all of his goals for guys I think it would score twenty five goals it was it was the shortest yeah I'd probably not getting it exactly right but the point is that if you watch and you see going from the hash marks in\nAnd for a guy who's not the biggest guy in the world\nAnd it was a different game than when you played by it but you know it still takes some courage to go to Larry oh for sure and and he loves it your way to fight your way to get to lose pox and a lot of these calls have you score or not you know in coming in from the circle and scoring\nIf he's getting a refund standing there and and getting the beneficiary of being in that area\nWell how many times you see a scrum after the whistle who's right in the middle of it it's it's ... 'cause somebody punched him in the head and he punched them right back you know and you still get some of that and you still do still get beaten up when you stand five feet in front of the gold standard for sure and you only loves it he\nDrives on that he's been told by the coaches you have to do that but you don't have to ... every player what did they say getting ... getting the scoring areas getting the dirty area he loves that he does that naturally he's got really quick hands what your underestimated Yani quarters legitimate\nTop four five six forward on anybody's team in ... in

but\nA shots right now Seventeen twelve in favor of Colorado so again they are shooting Colorado eight six in that second a much better period for them not just a matter of generating a little bit more often than testing Colorado's defense and\nA little bit more if they can't shots on gold present by ... the official shot at the Tampa Bay lightning\nWell joining us right now on the line he's been watching the game from lightning insider dot com and lightning lunch what you can listen to on lightning power play weekdays one to to our good friend Eric Earl ones then he it's been a\nA pretty interesting game so far through two periods you would have thought maybe some goals would have been scored at this point but no score\nWhoever said there are there are games can be fun it's fun games fast paced there's some good scoring chance of going on with a good goal tending we got good special teams\nA lot of good stuff going on in this game I think for both teams and you know for Tampa we knew this was a Chicago we knew that this was going to be much faster team they face here with Colorado and after looking like they were a little slow to START I think they they've caught up in a you know they're really starting to pay ... a play with some ...\nYeah you this Colorado seems pretty good I mean this is our first chance to really look at them after you know reading everything and then you know talking to different people um that followed them but this is the this is a pretty good color on the team at least early on\n[noise] yeah they are and they have probably a you know the best line going hockey right now with land a Scott I'm In Canada and in a rat and in\nA creative some chances actually that was a line that put the goal um or put the pocket and that that was called back on the opposite side they're on the first period and a dangerous team you know but they're they're showing that they're not just a one line team they got some some depth to you know the second power play has been just as dangerous\nLooking as a first power play and ah you know very impressive looking team\nYou know getting the first chance to look at an early in the season\n... missed a great chance than Elaine that second\nYeah you you can feel it right you can feel in common um a couple of really creative opportunities he's had um you know with with the one place to set up Johnson coming

I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and I think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal the\nMore and more people drilled down on my actions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good that we're going to win an election day we just have to keep out working on the way we have\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business you know it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's but energy is the lifeblood of our economy and\nOnce Donald Trump got elected which by the way would've never happened to Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nFor well thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment\nThere couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are and I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate it so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because\nIt's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked

thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you a\nGood good I at first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are and um uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nA I Know other stories or you know kind of taking the lead now but we really don't hear a whole bunch about a repeal and replace much anymore\nIt was just wondering if you could give us an update\nAbout Republicans are doing\nIf we in two weeks to have a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and West Virginia being and plays huge if we can hold on to the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on\nWhich is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races then the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to have and by the way preexisting conditions a big lie that's being told all over the country or the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions nobody is going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about I've been able to get Dr Josh amber atlas MD in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita\nHe's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals\nOr even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks a treatment for people and you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge care you ever dreamed up twenty four\nOr access to a doctor or your primary care doctor do you get your check ups every year you got great reduction and pharmaceuticals and if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care\nAt a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario and it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there all the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been invasion\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against that last minute\nBut uh the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days up but I'm focused on these house races all say it again every single house race matters\nSome more important than others we put up the most important on my website ... dot com\nAnd the top races that are going to tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every it we
