the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal but she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are\nYou [noise] hey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff\nOne thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of Brett is an even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where where they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video the video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nAnd we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those a bottle of like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your power poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here\nAnd and we take it down and when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff say\nSo it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to want to moderate voters in play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be similar but once you get selected that her staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties pulled or\nThey don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's it yeah\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's ... there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that ... that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions and we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really left or right thing\nI was at this first them and conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were ... you know very cheering and and hearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to them out or if they have to work with a moderate and they and they can only make one choice\nOne for this is not a choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do\nThey have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda and so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it's so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talked to anybody in his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNon non it it it's in a hurry to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone\nTelling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're just
