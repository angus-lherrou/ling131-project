F. LA [noise]\nYou were less than thirty minutes away from you or next news update on nine Seventy WFL a this is PM Tampa Bay with Brian Gorman\nVinyl segment of the showing this October third I'm your host trying Norman with me in Studio my producer James for lander and nine Seventy\nWFL a legal analyst Felix Vega so it looks like senators are going to be able to read the FBI reports\nOn the cabinet law or the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh beginning tomorrow so it sounds like\nThe FBI either has concluded or a belt to conclude their investigation with a day two days to spare\nYeah and also I noted that um they set up the vote of the quote they took the cloture vote in order to set it up for friday that they can vote on um have the final vote on the job and they did\nTake the cloture vote okay because I Am in keeping an eye on Mitch McConnell he's the one that's putting all the Senate procedures in motion that would lead to a vote\nI saw a couple of minutes ago but it looks like they're heading in that direction\nOkay so so a vote will be likely at some point towards the end of this week depending of course on in the report on what's in the report so that that remains to be seen we're not sure if the reports going to be made public I doubt the full report\nWill be made public um with lots of senators on both sides of the aisle are calling for at least the summary\nTo be made public which I think is ... ... you gotta let the American public has been following this so closely see some of what was discovered during the course of this uh you know supplemental background investigation\nIf they don't they're just going to paint on both sides are going to paint themselves into a corner again like what the secrecy and the ... the finger pointing going back and forth and it's going to be ... they're going to be a lot of lakes and no question I think you were saying earlier that they're they have to go to a secure location where the skiffs essentially up in order to view the report so that you have some concerns as far as\nWhat's in it what is it that damaging that has to be viewed in secrecy or gets out of it actually came out\nI think it's going to be a balancing act between not wanting to reveal information that some of the people they interviewed\nProbably don't want out there and giving the public a broad view of what they discovered so that we can uh either feel comfortable moving forward with Kavanaugh nomination\nOr take a look at it and say maybe we need to go in a different direction that the big question is going to be who was interviewed and who wasn't that's going to be the the real focus over the next twenty four hours if it's just figures\nOn the periphery of all of this who weren't talked to then Democrats are going to have a lot less to complain about but if Cabot on Ford Warren interviewed\nI think that's going to be a big deal if they if all they did was go off their testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee where uh for me it left me with a lot of questions about Ford and her story I had more questions after the hearing them before\nAnd in Kavanaugh's case there was some things you just didn't really answer a I think that's a bit of a problem up a little bit of a problem if they didn't follow up and and at least do some extra questioning of Kavanaugh and ...\nAnd that may come in terms of a an additional report that may come in the coming days and you know we only have until friday supposedly by deadline but if they went out and talk to the other people you know and didn't develop anything new and that's what comes out of it then then\nThat could be a reason why it and go okay so so there's a lot that will need to learn and at the end of the day or if it's not done to the liking of ... Murkowski\nBlake and perhaps mansion and Heidi Heitkamp then uh you know maybe they'll have to do an interview forward and cabinet if they if they come back and say why didn't you talk to those two we wanted to\nUh have follow up questions asked the both of them then you know look there there there could potentially be no vote if they're not on board because that's where they hold the card\nThat's what forces hand with Jeff Flake last week exactly and so they could do the ... the same thing you know come friday went before they get to a vote\n... it's all about Collins Murkowski flake mansion and Heidi Heitkamp Murkowski is going to be a tough vote to get there's lots of internal politics of play in Alaska including with Native Americans causing her whole bunch of problems on this uh so she could seriously be a potential no\nMansion and hike camp to me or get them all based on some of the new pulling out of a North Dakota\nI think the high camp gonna have to take a serious look at voting yes right on Kavanaugh a mansion\nMight have some wiggle room has more wiggle room I think than Heidi Heitkamp done once if he's up by about eight nine yeah ... I saw\nAlthough it seems like he wants to get to yes just based on what he set up to this point but we'll see Collins is defeat flake is likely yes\nUm but he certainly wasn't happy with how Kevin I handled himself a at times during the hearing you made that clear the past few days so I don't think his boat is a guarantee so a a lot could unfold over the next twenty four hours hopefully we'll know more\nWhen we come on the air at six PM tomorrow getting full shows tomorrow six to nine PM and then friday six to nine PM a\nAnd the next week some lightning games will interrupt us a bit as well be the case going forward\nA once lightening season gets under way if you want to check out our blog post\nFelix wrote a comprehensive peace on the new Tampa stand your ground case we have a video therefore you as well to check out that the nine Seventy W.

cost as the bag and the New York times is fake no we are a lot of ground to cover the folks at phones are already jam if you're on hold for something else and everybody's going to tie in today just hold your spot don't\nDon't lose your spot eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of the nation wide number or how you get on the program it's a very very simple process so why don't we start\nWith what's making a lot of news generating a lot of chatter today and that is the comments that the president made at the rally\nIn Mississippi last night [noise]\nCouple of things in this is obviously ruffled some feathers a first of all what's what's wrong with this particular state but I Can't find anything wrong with this what's happening\nNow [noise]\nThey had gang raped by gangs [noise]\nTurned out to be wrong so many different charges [noise] guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous Veronica\nAnd I haven't myself all the time\nYou know I Can't argue with that or give us a guilty until proven yeah and that's what's going on uh with with capital here and you know if you go back and listen to the statement of this this is not for one of those people really ticked off with a ... this is important\nTurned out to be wrong so many different charges [noise] guilty until proven innocent and\nAgain that's a very important point there and that's what's happening here because there's no a\nCollaboration there is no proof again with the doctor Ford story in fact there were three of those name but couldn't recall a evenly the ally\nOr this this ... ties are the ally of Dr Ford could not remember the events of the party or capital I mean I I Would think that that would be a kind of an indelibly inscribed in your or whatever role was ah in your ...\nUh handle that data but but no\nAnd you know those that have to and this is what's most troubling to me and I don't take sexual assault or rape lightly it'll\nIt occurs in his despicable I feel from the bottom of my heart to anyone any woman that's experienced any type of a an assault on what the touching a rape it is it is horrific\nYou have my ... most uh empathy or in in that department but\nThe way this has been treated is that capital by many Kevin O's already done convicted guilty he did it\nTaking Dr ... a doctor or for the word that it was an absolute proven foregone conclusion and that's just not the case All right so that was one of the items to walk to the plate Trump's a hundred percent right however\n\nThe president went a little further and this is where the president is getting a whole lot of attention here was this an intelligent move last night at this campaign style rally in Mississippi\n[noise] thirty six years ago this\nI had one beer [noise] right I Am wondering\nWell is it goes you know it was one of them are good [noise]\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know\nI don't\n[noise] I don't know [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know where's the house\nI'm zone where was I don't know but I had one beer that's the only thing I remember [noise]\nIs the president wrong there in the factual presentation really nuts I mean the president's correct in what Dr Ford cannot remember\nThe issue here the\n... and she did know upstairs downstairs 'cause she described that landing and she did describe the room upstairs across from a bathroom I'm mistaken however\nAgain what was that the house I mean we get we don't even know what House it is I guess you I guess you could describe anything the point is the president for the most part they're not factually incorrect in fact the president's right\nHe quarter ... said what he said in a different fashion that did not alienate free of the votes that he needs worse habit\nThat's that's what the issue is here he could have done this in fashion\nUh and we already have a Collins was walking into a Senate room earlier today and TV cameras captured senator Collins commenting on what's being described as the president mocking doctor for last night and this is one that sounded like\nHe just words for Iran that's college college saying that the president's comments were just plain wrong we had Senator Flake for instance\nRoadways in Hillsboro this evening for two Seventy

I don't care I I really don't\nI and I'm just not buying and ... there's just not enough factual evidence to prove that Dr Ford's allegations are correct the issue again is the president I don't think needs to install any additional\nSpeed bumps or a obstacles hurdles to get underway\nOf Brett Kavanaugh and that's why I don't think some of his comments in Mississippi last night I don't think they're actually helpful\nFolks I Can't sit here and say that the president didn't didn't openly for applause and laughs in engineering up a crowd and Mississippi didn't mock\nDr Ford now was the President Raul on most of the front slow factually the president was raped I brought up the same things on this program\nAbout her inconsistencies and not knowing this or that there's nothing wrong with the president could have done that it's just it's the mocking issue and today Sarah Huckabee Sanders held a White House press briefing a little after one o'clock this was the first briefing and in quite some time a couple of what three weeks or so I think since early September it's been a while\nAnd Sarah Huckabee out what was it the the Thames okay September attempts or you know a couple of three weeks or so so ah Sarah Sanders\nDefended the president a um [noise]\nBut I I ... the facts were mostly right it was just the demeanor which I don't find helpful and again I don't need the president or alienating the votes that he needs again\nWe've got three Republicans that are needed we've got Murkowski we have Susan Collins we have Jeff Flake\nAll three have now chastised the president for his tone last night I don't think it's helpful\nI mean this the mob mentality I you know torch caring yeah it sometimes it's gone sometimes it works but there are other times when it does it you have to win Helen Julie apply\nThat strategy I don't think last night was intelligently applied at all\nAnd then we have of course the the red state Democrats we've got Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota we have a Joe Manchin of West Virginia and again those are votes that could help push Kevin all over the finish line as well so you know the question is\nIt before I go back to your phone calls you what is\nThe endgame here what is the president's goal\nAs far as getting Kavanaugh across the finish line\nBecause I got my comments last night by the president will not helpful for that particular goal\nSo is it possible that the president has concluded that the fight over Kavanaugh is may be worth more in the midterms than actually having\nI'm Dina meals are top story at five thirty
