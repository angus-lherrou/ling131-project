Fox News those comments from Supreme Court justice ... White House ceremony today Fox\nStalled delayed delayed delay and they gambled wrong because the FBI investigation and ... there's limited scope and they all agreed on a limited so and then the Democrats roll belly ache and complaining oh they were you know Eighteen or Nineteen that we're not interviewed and this is a farce this is a sham\nGave me a break I I mean you look at the primary accuser\nYou'll walk at Dr blog the Ford and the people who she supplied as witnesses or those with the greatest amount of knowledge\nEven one of her friends could not come from her story and in fact never even met Britain capital\nI saw the whole thing started to fall apart but again I was chastised and so how many calls it wasn't a ... I've got no problem if I say something controversial I have no issue no problem putting corps on this program that disagree with me\nCall me this call me that call me names I assume I executive producer\nSo quick question on friday the twenty eighth when I said hey guess what this flight don't get picked off folks a flake is not siding with the Democrats per se here I think flake just did the cabinet favor I said that Jeff Flake\nSave the cabinet nomination so how many calls as executive producer deal remember as soon as my phone screen was well about how many calls did I put on folks who are angry at me screaming at me\nRight yeah so so she had a couple of dozen calls and how many made it to air that we were able to take\nA right yeah right oh\nAren't yet I sue sue\nSue says she says she had over four dozen calls it was screaming at me watch them do what she meant why is he agreed that the one we pause because they didn't have the votes it was the one we pause that brought Susan Collins into the fold and was enabling\nCollins to deliver that I'm believable speech on friday\nThat it was amazing it was incredible and remember also\nAnd this is what's amazing even President Trump Pence said okay I he's OK with the the the ... the White House the White House signals and from signal that they were OK with the one week FBI investigation because why ladies and gentlemen\nThey knew the votes weren't there so suicide she screened or talk to over four dozen callers that was screaming at me what's the matter with you ... what are you talking about why you allowing the Democrats because that was the catalyst that was the only path forward\nThe delay the pause that brought Susan Collins into the fold and that one and also brought a flake flake was going to be a yes vote\nThat got Kavanaugh confirmed with out it toast\nNo go whether he was going to be re nominated or Trump was going to come up with a new nomination we don't have to worry about that now but all those were possibilities\nSo I was I had no problem with folks yelling at me but I Want the record to show that ultimately I was correct and I'm sure my other cohorts and talk radio we're probably not saying what I was saying I'm sure they'll do with the mob mentality rule when in fact\nTake the emotion out and look at it more as a strategic play and that's what I\nTodd Smith did on this very program and I feel great about it and I said I don't want to brag about it that's not my style I'm not the bragging time [laughter]\n[laughter] I'm just making it really really clear a welcome to the program folks in of course are you in fact some of the stats here on a premium Supreme Court a confirmation vote some of the tallies going back you know a number of years\nAnd you know some of the details here are just the amazing which I Want to go over oh the limo crash in New York state the hurricane heading toward the Florida Panhandle I Want to get into all of this year moments you know in fact let me before I get back into the cabin on the confirmation and Murkowski\n\nVoting President Trump is not happy obviously the president saying that Alaska is never going to forget I Want to grab some Alaska calls were hurt in Alaska gray to Philly and out of Anchorage so hello Alaska hello Anchorage and the surrounding areas picked my Florida Panhandle\nListeners and we've got a great affiliate in the Florida Panhandle it's Ninety four point five FM WFL a talk radio and uh Panama City\nUh and of course it's hurt all along you know up to towards Tallahassee a Fort Walton Beach in Niceville you know toward the uh Pensacola and of course we're heard in a mobile and Pensacola as well on another a Philly\nFolks take this seriously with a what a soon to be\nA hurricane or my ... so what's the what's the status ah I I I missed the intermediate at two PM well let me bring up the the latest fear because\nYou know what I'm Talking about a wind speed and and all that excitement I was a sand again yeah\nYeah so we're we're out of a low category one it was a tropical storm Michael so now we're in a low category one according to my my team over here\nAnd I I just want all of the folks along the Florida Panhandle\nTo have all of the warnings because the projection\nAnd you know they've gotten good as far as tracking for the most part I clearly a jobs is way that way there was the ring current user\nBut they've gotten much better at the course projection versus intensity projection I mean look what happened in the Carolinas that was supposed to belt is the the shores of category for it did not\nAnd of course of the intensity was much less there are calling for a major hurricane here a category three\nTo whack into the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday Wednesday afternoon into Wednesday night and the difference here folks is and for all of those affected along the pan handle you know from the Alabama line and across the Florida Panhandle to the big band where the state makes that turn\nOut you have to listen and he the warning we hear a storm surge could be intense\nAnd the time to prepare\nIs nowhere near as long as it typically is with the the the previous hurricanes that head toward the United states there's typically you know watching as motors through the Caribbean and he gets here and the and it's just it's a slow steady path\nAnd with this it's much different because of the late formation right or you know off the Yucatan Peninsula it's already right in the Gulf of Mexico so the amount of time that you have to prepare is cut I mean dramatically it's cut by like Ninety percent [laughter]\nThose are my numbers but you know that's the way and I I'm an vision so you have to ... you really ought to be in full blown preparation mode as this is going to be a Wednesday afternoon to Wednesday evening event so you don't have as much time and I just implore my Florida Panhandle listeners\nPlease take he'd take warning and\nThen the projection on the track as this thing hooks\nEye it looks like it's going to roll right over the Carolinas that was just pounded with all of the heavy rainfall from um the previous hurricane that we just had\nIts you know just an unbelievable\nOn our phone number here on Schmidt is eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine the nationwide number eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine

of\nConfirmations a from years gone by and understanding this colossal shift in\nHow regardless of what side of the aisle you're on how we essentially used to vote and we'll get into that and just a bit but as far as this this horrific limousine this a stretch SUV crash\nIn New York state now where this happened is a place called sky Harry and sky Harry and I think I've been through there is about forty miles to the west of Albany and when you think about twenty people dead Eighteen in a limo\nSeventeen passengers the limo driver that's Eighteen died in a limo and then to people\nOutside of this a farm stand a restaurant now we're in the parking lot at the wrong place at the wrong time for a total death toll of Eighteen people the governor of New York who I Am not a fan of at all obviously\nI I find them to be quite a number so I actually bought a he had ... and the politics out of the equation I just you know I'm not a not a Cuomo fan or obviously\nBut he had said earlier today the limo had recently failed its inspection\nAnd this vehicle should not have been on the road\nAt all and that the driver did not have the correct endorsement he didn't have a limo license\nSo and the limo company\nApparently has a litany of issues where a vehicles have been taken out of service due to inspection issues\nAnd that their problems are multiple times the national average from limousine companies with the number of problems they had just just an awful awful story and as I was telling you before are not a tweet but a text message\nFrom one of the deceased\nInside this limo or turns out that uh she sent that text message to a relative that the vehicle was in terrible condition this was prior to the crash just awful now as far as my little speech here\nI don't know why people drop their guard for whatever reason\nPeople will get into the back of limousines and what is this feeling of inherent safety that oh we're not going to have a car crash there's not going to be an accident don't need to put my seatbelt done I don't know what it is but it's not just limousines\nIt's also people that ride in taxis\nPeople that ride in the you know ... ... for instance or a Juno wars you know some of the other uh you know v is some of the other car come in a nationwide is pretty much over and lift but you've got some places that are that have some of these other young up

little black cars you know the Lincoln town car services and he was in an accident he was in the backseat didn't have a seat belt on\nWhy is it the people that there's a false sense of security when you ride in the back but especially I feel that when people get in to liberate cars taxis\nOr over type vehicles limos that oh what changes\nWhen you get in your car in the front seat or the passenger seat buckle up most people buckle up but there is this this this dropping of people's guard when they get into certain vehicles and I was mentioned Bob Simon from CBS News he got into a up one of these black car limos\nA you know one of these you know for a Lincoln town cars style of vehicles\nAnd even Clarence Thomas going back to Nineteen Ninety One after the whole Anita Hill affair Clarence Thomas was voted in with a four vote margin\nSo that's the way that Kavanaugh ended and a Fifteen of forty eight vice president Mike Pence see did person\nAll right over the vote because the vice president United States is the president of the U.S Senate and he was there as a tie breaker if needed but again you know he was constantly interrupted by these a noxious screaming mean these\nAre

on this\nYou know Democrats totally blew the Kavanaugh situation in a couple of major ways\nLook at the final vote for the final vote of fifty to forty eight now if the Democrats have handled this thing in any kind of rational matter they actually might have succeeded in defeating the nomination\nIf they are to handle the letter from Dr for earlier so that late game blitz that little Hail Mary the Dianne Feinstein at the last minute with the revelation and and again the league whoever the hell leak the letter I you know who [laughter]\nIf if they what they thought that that was the

or maybe even an in person meeting\nWith those two on the fence Republicans\nOh says after the fact you but I I just want to illustrate how the Democrats really F this up\nSo instead they paraded Dr

are the names and all my good friend ... Kaiser was there and she can't remember anything doesn't even know who Brent Kavanaugh is\n\nRemember that Dr Ford she did tell a compelling story the president even ... even sadder story was credible and compelling\nBut there was absolute lack of corroboration of any damn facts here so that was the Democrats first mistake\nThey couldn't help themselves they were so drunk on what they saw\nWas the secret weapon to annihilate Kavanaugh they got in ... and they add up points ... blood alcohol level essentially on how intoxicated they became\nWith their plot with their plan they were drunk delusional\nAnd that leads to the second point here because Democrats really don't believe in anything\nThey constantly fall prey to the whims and the vibes him and the the weather vein of of pop culture the winds suck a pop culture\nIs too damn\nTrendy for their own damn good whether it's\nWall Street or black lives matter or in this case are trying to Velcro me to to Kavanaugh and with Dr Ford\nThey glom onto what ever is trendy whatever's a hash tag him at the moment to try to ride whatever wave they think they can ride them that's exactly what they did and they wrote this wave right into the ground\n\nKnow it doesn't matter doesn't matter whether you're talking about the latest goofy a fashion trend that that came out of the the the Paris fashion show\nOr fashion week in New York or whatever that was about uh whether you're talking fashion or politics gas want folks these little blip pop up programs they don't last\nAnd the clever asked Democrats they thought they had this whole thing figured out but guess what\nLike a road runner Wylie coyote cartoon it just absolutely [noise]\nBlow up in their faces like acme dynamite is what happened [noise]\nOh very good at making their signs and their marches and they're a cabin\nNope cabin no meat to\nHaving the litany of ... at the confirmation hearings and and then again in the Senate vote on\nSaturday that daisy chain of protesters flooding the Capitol Steps or a and and flooding the Supreme Court steps is I I witnessed on a Saturday\n\nAnd they they they don't have a big size protests sit ins in walkouts\n\nBut they rarely translate into votes\n[noise]\n[noise] the poison pile\nRobert Deniro you know we've played that Robert ... he had a minute and a half video when he was just railing on Trump or Robert Deniro is now mocked Brett Kavanaugh at a charity events\nIsn't this lovely here's the latest on the narrow\nThis is from New York Post today Robert Deniro made is deployed displeasure with Robert with 'em so Robert Deniro ...

Florida's panhandle by Wednesday\nLet me be clear hurricane Michael is a monster storm and the forecast 'cause she keeps getting more dangerous\nGovernor Rick Scott says areas north of ... in the north and the panhandle may get a storm\nSurge of twelve feet ... miles\nFox News\nFrom the auto bailout hearing aids studios Ninety six seven FM pass go one or two nine ... nine Seventy telling you eh ballet all over Tampa Bay\n\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to the show\nThe latest on hurricane Michael and we have the latest advisory come out a little less than an hour ago the five o'clock eastern four\nO'clock central advisory and regarding hurricane Michael we have a lot of listeners in the panhandle uh my show is heard or in Panama City on Ninety four point five FM I'm also heard immobile and uh Pensacola as well so uh and I've been through this drill a lot\nJoining us right now from the national Hurricane Center in Florida is\nStacey steward a senior hurricane specialist Stacey thanks for coming on that show I Want to get the latest with at five o'clock advisory\n[noise] well as the five pm eastern time advisory hurricane Michael is located a very near the western chipper Cuba has continued move northward it's now probably located about do say twenty miles or so north\nOf the western ... Cuban still moving northward a speech somewhere around eight to ten miles an hour we expect a motion to continue tonight\nAnd tomorrow morning and not a gradual turn to the north northwest is expected tomorrow afternoon and in a couple of days we're expecting a Michael to make landfall somewhere in the Florida Panhandle uh near major hurricane strength\nNow Stacy I've been watching this obviously and I'm trying to employ my listeners especially along the Gulf Coast or to the east to Panama City to the big band and to the west the Panama City over towards Pensacola\nTo prepare and prepared quickly the difference here is\nAnd I tried to illustrate this for the audience typically you know we're watching these hurricanes is they they roll off the Cape Verde and they they they they courage across the Atlantic and into the southern Caribbean and if they just take a long time and we were able to watch and you watch the cones or shrink and grow and\nAnd you know all the forecast in this case the difference here with Michael is this has formed in the Gulf of Mexico essentially and the preparation time is so much more compressed because we're dealing with an event that's really just two days away\nSo that is correct Todd uh the system's only been alive technically for about two days and it's going to make landfall in roughly another two days so this is gonna be you know easily less than a week\nOr event and we want folks in the Florida Panhandle everywhere in the Florida Panhandle not just folks you know where the forecast track is supposed to be but\nUh especially folks are living in the areas east of where Michael was forecast make landfall when people are going to be a very broad on the east side the Florida Big Bend area is highly susceptible to storm surge because of the concave shape for the coastline and the shallow water there so there's going to be significant storm surge many miles away\nFrom where the storm makes landfall and then of course everybody who's going to be a location\nIn east of where Michael makes landfall you're now in the heavy rainfall threat the tornado threat so uh just because this joined track might end up being sixty eight even a hundred miles away from you or you know to the west of you please don't feel that you're going to be a inside company\nStacey did I see that the u._k. model is starting to run in more agreement with the U.S models\nThat is correct but it's still out there on the right side showing you know perhaps landfall near or just east of Appalachian coal Florida and we need to remind folks that are\nA two day a forty hour forecast errors or you know pretty much on the order of about a Seventy nautical miles so that could be anywhere from uh the Florida Big Bend area too as far west as almost to Pensacola so we don't want people focusing entirely on\nWhere forecast track as a showing it making landfall right now that could change a little bit over the course of pot\nI let's talk intensity now over the years the actual forecasts path has gotten better intensity is still one of those areas where we're still trying to get better\nI so now where where where in a category one the five o'clock eastern advisory for central had a maximum sustained winds at eighty miles an hour or so up five from the intermediate forecasted at two PM\nAnd you guys are projecting it to intensify with two and then potentially a three what makes landfall on the Florida coastline is that correct\nThat's correct were explicitly forecasting a store to become a major hurricane and about thirty six hours while it's still out of where the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico or then as it makes a term or to the north northeast and biggest approached the Florida Panhandle might see a little bit of slight weakening but still be near\nBiggest outrageous I reported on was a trial of abortion doctor Kermit costs now how the woman goes into a clinic comes out that there's no police report I helped

your life better or they do want to destroy Trump\nThey want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare short of that what else do they stand for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember the you know it's an uphill battle in midterm elections the party that controls the presidency as only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one

you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago is America stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago is the president keeping\nHis word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation east kept his promise on building the wall he hasn't fully been able to do it because that hasn't been fully funded\nKevin McCarthy introduced the ... bill today to fully fund the wall but he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to fund the wall we now record unemployment and fourteen states\nWe now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine\nWhen the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series that's how far back that goes Hispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for\nAsian Americans also record low for our veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to residents kept his promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea\nSanctions in Iran are now paying off we see the Iranian economy about tank every day\nWe see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be\nRemaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that President has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism\nIt's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there and we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the\nDakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too it's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed\nHe gave us the names of people that he was select from any selected from that list promises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country and in twenty eight days or weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are\nThe good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think Nancy Pelosi's picking out the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment\nJerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people what are they going to do they gonna now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts are working\nAnd it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either you know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a head of the investigation and the next hour\nIn a while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood thinning of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering\nOne of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally undo\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history we know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice once she deleted some painted emails\nAnd then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction but of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company\nAnd told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in may\nOf twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing and then all of a sudden they interview heard Peter ... one of the interviewers\nA man that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation an exoneration before an investigation\nThat means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet an issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James ...\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney or by the company Perkins Kuwait that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil\nOr they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait which is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group that went out and hire the former ... six agent\nOr the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and then enter August tore and Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and\nThe DEA OJ or either resigned or fired or or stepped aside and anyways stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm\nGave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for\nAbout Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign that's studying in terms of what

risk the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined Fort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job was started the official weatherman of the Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and spin I'm being told is the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad as\nWell so I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City\nOr that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cake\nIf they are in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf but a week into a category too when it went through there\nSo this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area now the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the of sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this is a big deal and mobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain\nBut once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThe weather pattern you remember of Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast\nThis one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a at least that strong category where he perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean to look to the average person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters

twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency it's maps came out and said look out October of ...\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the tycoons have shut

folks as you can watch this stuff\nComic to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to ... ... or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw it once we got so last Thursday and friday you know then showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get them ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto\nWe hit it off to the east over there with or it's this is going right in between and instead of coming west northwest sitting it's hitting in the classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nA lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain coming Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right out to sea to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it but it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas\nOr because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to

third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associate\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to seek ... secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the ... say something that they could use and then and vote the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power\nAndrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page and go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker's set it Baker and heard about it and the other two

in sworn testimony but\nJames Baker also telling Congress last week\nMember of the law firm Perkins Kuwait\nThat's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC funnel money so it would look like a

put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... same dusty a that was never corroborated uh verify but used as a\nBuys a warrant application the bulk of information\nTo get a ... a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate and it gets worse than that was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used what now understanding to bludgeon then president Donald Trump\nAnd to try and get him removed from office and creating a

Pfizer Warren wiretap on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton\nAnd that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton

house intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign\nWas feeding information directly to the top lawyer at

Sean Solomon and Greg Jared continue with us or anything I'm saying here that is wrong right Garrett\nYou got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was Hillary Clinton Russian\nCollusion two people are on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who composers it totally fabricated phony document based on suppose Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the DEA OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now\nA second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Saltsman or who is passing along computer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection\nAnd yet on July thirty first two thousand and sixteen\nThey officially\nA launch this investigation Peter Struck signed the papers he had just finished meeting with Christopher Steele\nAnd in fact the same day that James Comey cleared Hillary Clinton twisting the long run toward the end the facts his FBI was meeting for the first time in Europe in a building with Christopher Steele\nWho had composed this phony ... that the FBI was never able to verify and yet they ran with this
