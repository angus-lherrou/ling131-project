{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "And I are all the comments off the air or don't don't don't go anywhere I think it's fair\nLet me just say it's a matter of just how the current depicted in the in the current it really is just I'm doing a\nI'm doing essentially a word study right and so I'm looking at the at the Hebrew and looking at the Greek and I'm looking at the Arabic for the word murder or kill ... which is what\nIs implied in some in some stories but they don't actually use the word murder the only reason I brought it up as I thought it was significant that the the ... murder is a very very very big deal in Islam\nIt's not it's you know people often talk about Islam and there was you know they make all these characterizations about Muslims and it's it's really unfair because murder any kind of death anytime you're killing something that's a big deal in a slump\nAnd so the fact really the elevation is really my point was that they were elevating the death of Jesus by using the word murder\nOr they weren't pulling a punch and I think that's cool um as for um as for other things yeah no I think you're you know that's an interesting thought I Can't get in the mind of the\nOf the Bible writers who felt like that was but I I Know that sometimes murder is sold softly and the Bible the word murder exists they exist there Hebrew words for murder but they don't use it all the time instead they use kill\nA which is more neutral and sounds almost in some cases justifiable or let me go to Alex who's in New Hampshire until she goes to him and I'm afraid I started something Alex that are probably probably I don't know how he\nGot his start in I'm Sorry I'm dragging everybody into this but I Hope the obits conversation you're enjoying anyway Alex and\nI Am I Am enjoying it and I'm taking my call 'em I spoke with a few years ago about a book I'm interested in that whenever I hear you I'm ... I'm always thinking along spiritual lying there with the decline [noise]\nUm [noise] I I ... I'm interested in my book called the ... of Jesus yeah I'm\nFrom the from the turn of the last century right\nYeah yeah I think it was published and or like you know eight\nUm apparently with what they say according to the introduction of ... it was kind of transcribe written transcribed by Levi Dowling\nWould transcribe it probably a classic record ... also known as God for book of remember is another way of putting it I'm fascinated with this book because it's her role in many ways for for gospel\nI'm describing the life of Jesus and also covers like that so called missing years of his life [noise]\nA highly ... locked in years or so [laughter] um but it does talk about the different ages and that is full of full title of the book is very current gospel of Jesus calmer the price of the highest in age\nAnd somewhere and I'm a I'm not an expert on this book but I'm fascinated with the idea of the return of the Christ that I'm not in a lot of conservative Christian I'm ... I'm more in line with Quakers and I've had with the idea of um\nThe beginning of an age where they've got to be occurring age began if their disagreement about\nThat and it really is is is that I'm going to determine I'll go ahead I'm Sorry no no no you're you're you're bringing I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes I think there's a lot of debate about\nWhat age we're in for and this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism and ... you know all we could ever do is the arise because we can't there's no there's no met a\nData so that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... [noise] so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what something that just otherwise would be completely ... the way for us to try to understand the time period in which we live I I spend a lot I ... I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I've looked it up several times and\nAnd it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any arguments for or against it and it just sort of like it it's sort of exists out there especially in the part about that period of time the missing so called years\nUm because there's a lot of different books that address I don't want that they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all those different book or when I'm familiar with it\nProbably ... years\nI'm ... I did want to wrap it up quickly a lot of could go ask you about this book I wanted to say um I I agree with what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier whatever color you\nAre talking about the liar along the lines of\nIt you you appreciate the freedom we have a we we all worship something you know whether it's money or her materialism or whether it's got him or her so that we really appreciate that freedom is that your your your your chicken works if your way\nI I I appreciate that but I also think that there's a downside to that there's a\nSure but I did it because you know we have this freedom but we don't always use ...\nOh yeah we have a buddy not correct so individual you know we gotta collectively\nCouldn't agree more to have some kind of shared values\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political here I I think what holds us together as a country is I I I don't fixate on borders I understand the importance or security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut what people talk about it's the border that makes it as a country that's just not true you know it's not the border that makes me in Arizona and write or soon to be a a a cans and it's been a like didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nIt I think would hold us together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we've got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to your philosophy should be where every education starch I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers base the entire country\nI think that's what we need to always focused\nOn that's the that's the most important thing to other things are also important but that is to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot ah\nFor people who don't find it interesting pardon the blather but gosh darn it that was great\nThank you so much for jumping in an open lines and look forward to borrow night so the most elusive serial killer\nIn history\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case [noise]\nLet him make that decision I Want to think a George ...

book\nStopped funding Uncle Sam through time and get a plan that simple and easy to understand and it's funny because I had a lady in the lobby last week and um I you know went out to greet her and she was reading the book and I said hello and she said oh I'm Sorry I just you know I got into this book how do I get a copy of it\nAnd she said there's so much information here about Social Security and the color of money that you guys talk about I can read it right here so of course the thing is that if people want to copy of this book what do they have to do\nA pretty simple I mean if you're serious about your retirement you're serious about\nGetting things in order to just pick up the phone scheduled time and he's with us eight when three nine zero nine zero zero two two when you come in will give me the book we want you to get educated you know we had the books you read we also have an audio so we can definitely help you want to make sure that you understand what your options are so let's talk about that\nThe different phases of money but many people spend their time and energy focusing on how to accumulate a larger time a nest egg without giving any thought to really how their retirement assets are invested\nIn what you're talking about is creating a pile of money and I remember you all last week saying to a client or you did was build a pile of money and they looked at you and they like yeah and the question was what are you going to do with it right how do you how do you build up a distribution phase of it now so you know when you accumulate um your money\nYou have a desire to mount in retirement or do you use the question how much do you need a retirement and it's so important because it also important to have your money in ss that represent the risk and see if you want and let's talk about that because we just had this conversation\nWe talk about red money green money and if you're all in the market and many people that come in we do risk tolerance for them we find that the eighty five Ninety percent Chris is in orange red money\nRight and red money these that says I'm have a return that it's not guaranteed and they carry varying levels of risk and there's opportunity for growth or read money but you need to make sure that you are prepared to see with caution and that's the biggest thing the example of red money would be stocks hedge funds or even off shore investments\nYeah and and the problem is I think most people and we see this all the time don't open their statements when you sit down and open up a statement we ask them do you know what you have they may have some bonds mutual funds in stocks they don't even know what kind of stocks they have and that's what's important because when you sit with us we're going to go over that with you the other um color of money we talk about his yellow money in this\nTheir assets that may be safer\nBut still need to be examined with caution you get to a red light or you get to light the yellow lights telling you slow down or stop\nWhy because something else coming across the other side it might hurt you so examples of yellow money would include real estate variable annuities mutual funds bonds in some stock and this is so important because we do a full review I recline comes in\nAnd we also do report for someone mentioned it's been very good uh found money report and here's an example where you know you can find out that some of the investments you have a really not going to give you the return that you're hoping\nFor that's right and that's why it's so important to understand really where are you invested so this red money there is yelling money and there's also what we called green money and these assets are designed to have principle protection and provide safety\nYour growth potential is less if you had red or yellow money but you can also moved through retirement comfortably knowing your assets are potentially more safe\nAnd available to provide income stream that you might need in your retirement years example of green money might be government bonds CDs a savings accounts life insurance with cash value\nMoney market accounts or index annuities lot of different things that are safe and when you come in and meet with us you know where do you want to be where are you currently and that's why when you come in to analyze what you currently have\nAnd maybe if something good and that was a guy and the other day and he said to me said ask them why came in and he said well because you know you guys are for do Sherrie\nYou've got to tell me if things are good or things are bad\nAnd we analyzed his accounts and I told him that hey you got a great thing going here keep it and he looked at me and he said\nWould you say and I said well you're fine state where you are and he was just he was shocked and he said well I I thought you would tell me to change it and I said why would you do that if you got something good it's always great to get a second opinion so we really appreciated that and that's why it's so important to determine the amount of risk that is right for you it depends on your specific situation\nAnd let's go back to what you said because this is so important what that gentleman didn't realize from his investments he was taking a seven percent\nOr would throw All right distribution distribution and I don't think he understood that until Crist actually showed up to him the reason why we told them it was a good what he had he thought it was it was because we can't find something that's going to give you seven percent of a distribution right\nWell guaranteed you know that's what he had he had a ... he had a really great interest rate that was locked in for a long time and he thought that there was something better out there and we tell them hey you find your good state where you're at take the interest and he did and that's what made him feel so comfortable\nWith what's going with that this is why we say when you come in we have to sit down we have to do a risk tolerance because it's so important and here's a case where we help the gentleman really nice guy got to do so I just want to see if you guys have something better and it's not about us having something better\nIt's about finding something that's going to be that's gonna fit your risk tolerance you know you don't have to take that risk what about if you could put your money to an extent we can get up to fifty percent of the games they keep the gains talk about that for a second\nWell Yemenis save money ... money options where you can still participate in the market and as a ... five hundred\nYour gains can be linked towards the U.S in the five hundred index but you don't get all the games get fifty percent of the game just the markers up ten percent you get five\nThe markers up thirty percent you get Fifteen exactly but if the market tanks and goes down thirty percent and you don't get anything but you don't lose anything you know if that's what you're looking for then there are options for you and not every advisor\nCan come up with these options because there's a lot of advisers that just deal with red money red money or had money but at our from we deal with everything here we can helping a lot of different leads to pick up the phone schedule a time to be with us we have a tax division we have an income division we have an insurance division where we can help you with safe money\nWe have an investment division where we can act she'll the manage money there's third parties that we use that actively manage money in the market\nThere's a lot of things that could be done for you to pick up the phone schedule a time to meet with us and\nWhen we talk about retirement assets typically they're meant to do one of two things either providing retirement income\nAnd it's interesting because most people that we sit down with we do the risk tolerance for them it's a ten question a tolerance for him\nAnd they go why are you asking those questions because the last page elected we Chris does it he goes through page one in ... and you get a score and score indicates what kind of invest you are on and tell me if I'm wrong maybe tell us we get to the end the investor will say I didn't think I was that bad what happened well those are the answers to the questions that we ask\nCapsule and you go to Maggie tax dot com and uh right on top of our website is is that the color of money whether risk analysis you can go ahead and do it on your on your own if you want to so if you listen to the show and you say I Wonder how or what my tolerance is just got an egg attacks dot com and you can you can start right there\nSo it's so important to understand what that is we talked about you know when you want to retire but what are your financial goals advertising minutes no question that we ask\nYour particular financial goals or what we called magic number will also play a part in your ability to take on risk\nFor example if the level of risk that you're comfortable with manages your investments let's say to four percent return and need to ... percent return on your income just aren't going to be met when you need to rely on your investments for your retirement income that's why you may need to look at other options that offer a high quality growth\nAnd however this could be coupled with the possibility of substantial losses so it's so important to weigh it out and if you're working with the right advisor they can show you some safe money options they can show you some high risk options they can show you different buckets and had a plan for your retirement\nAnd here's the big one the Taj everything together and think about this one watch what is your ability to handle a financial loss so your emotional ability to handle a financial loss is an important factor as well\nOr if you're likely to pull all of your money out of an investment due to a dip in ... performance and then get back in when the market performs well you have a low risk tolerance and\nYou know people always say well what what should I get out well I don't know cut past couple of weeks the market's been high so if you get out when you go back in but the point in trying to make is if you don't do a risk tolerance for them to separate your money we talked about this red money ... money all the money\nYou can make a nice plan that's going to be a plan that you design and in addition to that it's a tax plan it's an income plan it's an investment plan and you know at the bottom line Chris it's their plan it's not my plan or your plan it's something that we helped design and that's what you have to sit down and do\nSo give us a call ... won three nine zero nine zero zero to

Lee disassemble your heating and air conditioning system have it completely clean sanitized disinfected\nAnd put it back together and that can get expensive we're talking thousands with an S. okay\nA little piece of free advice folks if you're going to buy a one inch filter\nBy one from your local big box store your age your lowers your home depot wherever it is that you're going through filters nowadays and here's the number one rule the number one rule is to get a filter that you cannot see through okay if you can hold your filter up\nAnd you can see your hand on the other side not a good filter okay that's basically is and sister take that out are looking for gold or something take that to the beach with you we call that a rock stopper it's good for\nAll balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at filtering your air\nAnd it's not going to protect your heating and cooling system\nAnd you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive okay that's what the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay\nCome on people spend money on a good filter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money\nNow the correct one for you to buy if you're going to get a one inch filter is a one inch police did\nFilter that's P pleaded filter\nLook for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip okay goes up and down and up and down\nAnd it's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big span um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouth\nYour system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and it can cause some damage\nAll right so I buy one that costs between maybe six Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs that are not no look\nI can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter starts to look a little dirty it's becoming hard to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor\nAnd the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor it'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat pump your furnace or your air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you\nYou will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a\nFive inch thick pleaded filter on some of these five inch filters will fit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive than the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly hey you're rock stoppers you're saying sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in droves they give you a great\nReturn on investment okay\nNow look we've only got a couple of minutes left in the show folks and

when three nine zero nine zero zero two two when you come in we'll give you the book we want you to get educated you know we had the books you read and we also have an audio so we can definitely help you want to make sure that you understand what your options are\nSo let's talk about that the different phases of money but many people spend their time and energy focusing on how to accumulate a larger time a nest egg without giving any thought to really how their retirement assets are invested\nIn what you're talking about is creating a pile of money and I remember you all last week saying to a client or you did was build a pile of money and they looked at you and they like yeah and the question was what do you go to do with it right how do you how do you build up a distribution phase of it now so you know when you accumulate um your money\nYou have a desire to mount in retirement or do you use the question how much do you need a retirement and it's so important because it also important to have your money in ss that represent the risk and see if you want and let's talk about that because we just had this conversation\nWe talk about red money green money and if you're all in the market and many people that come in we do a risk tolerance for them we find it to eighty five Ninety percent Chris is in Oregon red money\nRight and red money at these that says I'm have a return that it's not guaranteed and they carry varying levels of risk and there's opportunity for growth or read money\nBut you need to make sure that you are prepared to proceed with caution and that's the biggest thing the example of red money would be stocks hedge funds or even off shore investments\nYeah and and the problem is I think most people and we see this all the time don't open their statements when you sit down and open up the statement we ask them to you know what you have they may have some bonds the mutual funds their stocks they don't even know what kind of stocks they have and that's what's important because when you sit with us we'll go to war with that with you\nThe other um color of money we talk about is yellow money and these are assets that may be safer but still need to be examined with caution you get to a red light or you get to a light does the yellow lights telling you slow down or stop\nWhy because something else coming across the other side it might hurt you so examples of yellow money would include real estate variable annuities mutual funds bonds and some stock and this is so important because we do a full review I recline their comes in\nAnd we also do report for someone who mentioned it's been very good at found money report and here's an example where you know you can find out that some of the investments you have a really not gonna give you the return that you're hoping for\nThat's right and that's why it's so important to understand really where are you invested so there's red money there is yelling money and there's also what we call green money and these assets are designed to have principle protection and provide safety\nYour growth potential is less if you had red or yellow money but you can also moved through retirement comfortably known your assets are potentially more safe\nAnd available to provide income stream that you might need in your retirement years example of green money might be government bonds CDs a savings account life insurance with cash value money market accounts\nA index annuities lot of different things that are safe and when you come in and meet with us you know where do you want to be where are you currently and that's why when you come in to analyze what you currently have\nAnd maybe as something good and that was a guy and the other day and he said to me had asked him why came in he said well because you know you guys are for do Sherry\nYou're going to tell me if things are good or things are bad\nAnd we analyzed his accounts and I told him that hey you got a great thing going here keep it and he looked at me and he said would you say and I said well you're fine state where you are and he was just\nHe was shocked and he said well I I thought you would tell me to change it and I said why would you do that if you got something good it's always great to get a second opinion so we really appreciated that and that's why it's so important to determine the amount of risk that is right for you it depends on your specific situation\nIt let's go back to what you said because this is so important what that gentleman didn't realize from his investments he was taking a seven percent\nOr would throw All right distribution distribution and I don't think he understood that until Crist actually showed up to him the reason why we told them it was a good what he had and he thought it wasn't was because we can't find something that's going to give you seven percent or a distribution right\nWell guaranteed you know that's what he had he had a some he had a really great industry that was locked in for a long time and he thought that there was something better out there and we tell them hey you're fine you're good state where you're at take the interest and he did and that's what made him feel so comfortable\nWith what was going with that this is why we say when you come in we have to sit down we have to do a risk tolerance because it's so important and here's a case where we help the gentleman really nice guy got to be so I just wanted to see if you guys have something better and it's not about us having something better\nIt's about finding something that's going to be that's going to fit your risk tolerance you know you don't have to take that risk what about if you could put your money to an account we can get up to fifty percent of the games and keep the gains talk about that for a second\nWell Yemenis save money ... money options where you can still participate in the market has to pay five hundred\nYour games can be linked towards the U.S in the five hundred index but you don't get all the gay and he gets fifty percent of the game just the markers up ten percent you get five\nThe market's up thirty percent you get Fifteen exactly but if the market tanks and goes down thirty percent and you don't get anything but you don't lose anything you know if that's what you're looking for and there are options for you and not every advisor\nCan
