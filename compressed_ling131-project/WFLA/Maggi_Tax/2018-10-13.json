retirement\nLet's just say this you don't know you don't know and as many people that come to us and they have worked for so many years they focus on what they do each and every day\nThey have these piles of money for retirement accounts and they just don't know how to maximize the income or have buckets to create future growth in income tax favored bases well that's what we can do we can show you and you mentioned a great point because to clients I came in last week they said well I don't know if I could retire\nAnd we sat down and we talk to them we looked at a tax return we looked at the income that they need we asked them in a ton of questions to make sure that we understood them and then we told them at the end of the meeting we said hey you can retire and you can have more income coming in\nThan actually working and they both sat back and they said really\nGoing on with them they don't know the numbers exactly and then we showed them they were just it was like an a ha moment and they said we didn't know this\nGoes back a minute ago because we talked about the sequence of returns and the gentleman that came it was a math major and it's funny because the numbers didn't match up to him the way he thought so look when you do planning when you do tax planning and do income planting the numbers have to be what\nYou need and the gap that you'd you have created we have to

multiple IRAs with your record minimum distribution so if you have more than one IRA you must calculate the recording them distribution for each including if you have simple ... race\nBut you can take the total and this is important to a total of all the armed these from any one oil ray you can divide it among your arteries if you want to do that we see that sometimes so say you have a set up your different Irish for different beneficiaries or to hold a differing investments earning very rich return\nYou can balance or re balance them by selecting the are raised at the total or the comes from across this is another thing that advisors out there don't see how to do that to limit the tax problem\nIt's called strategy yeah having a strategy having a purpose and that's why when you meet with a complete advisor\nNag attacks and financial group that's what we do we look at the tax side the insurance side the investment side for the benefit of you and when where's the best spots take the

Maggie plan for your retirement plan that simple and easy for you to understand many people out there have piles of money what are you dealing with those piles of money phone Kay's IRAs brokerage accounts\nSavings accounts bonds what are you dealing with it\nWhat kind of purpose to you have do you have a plan if not pick up the phone schedule time to meet with us they have all this on both sides of the day let's put together a plan to help you millionaires have a plan but you don't have to be a millionaire to have a complete plan work with someone who can do that for you and that's what we do here Maggie tax and financial services\nSo let's just talk about something 'cause it's always this concerning to me when prospects you know in clients' the and yes even agents out there and advisors they tell you how great the market's doing so if you're not in the stock market and then if you feel like you're missing out and if you are in the stock market\nThan many of you are very reluctant to leave for fear you'll miss out on the higher returns and we hear that all the time so no one wants to suffer the indignity of missing out on those gains so if any of this is true then why\nWhy there's so few people in our country who have enough to retire Chris and that's a question that people\nJust don't understand why retire\nRight and how many have you experienced Nineteen eighty seven Nineteen Ninety Nineteen Ninety four two thousand two thousand two and two thousand seven to two thousand eight and currently now and really have no memory of what that really felt like or what that did to your assets think about that\nHow many agents out there or even advisers and in our particular industry at here to the quote unquote buying hold strategies with route really understanding who put that idea into their heads and why it doesn't work when we return to the basic fundamentals\nYou know and it's funny Chris how many recall the tongue value of money because this is where I think agents don't understand this but let's just talk about it say a man and a woman they start out with a hundred thousand aged forty and demand experiences a fifty percent loss in the market in a four month period\nAnd by the way I'm how does that make you feel\nBut that is how much time it takes to lose fifty percent on average when these economic bubbles burst and of course you can go back to two thousand one in two thousand eight when those bubbles burst people lost a lot of money Mm okay so now the man has fifty thousand and the woman who was more protective she still has a hundred thousand\nSo they each average is seven percent return for the next Thirty years and what did I Choose seven percent\nNot because I Believe the markets are going to average ... percent but it is an easy way and a number to explain the accounting rule of Seventy to Chris so if each average is seven percent for the next Thirty years their money will double approximately every ten years\nSo it is an easy way to explain the tongue value of money and why it's imperative that you've never lose any money Christian this is where I think when we sit down with a lot of people you know they always ask about percentages and so the market did but when we talk about certain products and strategies we have\nThis is important to let them know because we do a ... on how the money's going to look in the future right and it does help them based on a certain percentage right absolutely so I mean that's the way you look at it so\nSo here's the question did the men make a fifty thousand dollar mistake\nOr a four hundred thousand dollar mistake and it's really pay attention you're going to see the argument that the buy in holders make yeah even though the men lost fifty thousand because he didn't leave the market\nHe's still ended up with four hundred thousand which is four times more than what he started with so he's not even close to the woman's eight hundred thousand and sharing the same exact same return\n\nHey let's talk filters for a minute are you buying a cheap\nFilter huh admitted just admitted okay\nWell if you are you might want to start a savings account because it's likely that you're going to need to come ... lead disassemble your heating and air conditioning system have completely clean\nSanitize disinfected and put it back together and that can get expensive we're talking thousands with an S. okay\nA little piece of free advice folks if you're going to buy a one inch filter by one from your local big box store your eight year lows your home depot wherever it is that you're going through filters nowadays\nAnd here's the number one rule the number one rule is to get a filter that you cannot see through\nOkay if you can hold your filter up and you can see your hand on the other side\nNot a good filter okay [laughter] that's basically is and sister take that out are looking for gold or something take that to the beach with you we call that a rock stopper it's good for a golf balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at filtering\nYour air and it's not going to protect your heating and cooling system and you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive okay\nThat's what the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay\nCome on people spend money on a good filter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money\nNow the correct one for you to buy if you're going to get one inch filter is a one inch police did\nFilter that's P pleaded filter look for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip\nOkay goes up and down and up and down and it's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big span um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them having one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouth\nYour system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and it can cause some damage All right so\nI buy one that costs between maybe six Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it change it every thirty days whether you think it needs it or not now look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal\nWhen that filter starts to look a little dirty\nIt's becoming harder to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor\nAnd the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor it'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat pump your furnace or your air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you\nYou will absolutely thank us for it long term okay now the other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on some of these five inch filters will sit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler\nAnd they are way less restrictive\nThan the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that\nPeople just love so thoroughly hey you're rocks diapers you're saying sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in droves they give you a great return\nOn investment okay now look we've only got a couple of minutes left in the show folks and I've got maybe four maybe five of these left to give away at the discounted rate and I want to thank everyone who's called in today\nYou know I don't
