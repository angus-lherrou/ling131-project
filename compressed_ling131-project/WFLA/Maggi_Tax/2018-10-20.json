example or TV show that we do every Sunday we had a gentleman coming last week and this is how you know important as soon as you heard about sequence of returns\nAnd the sequence of returns really got him and it bothered him Chris and he said I have to call these guys because he started to realize that the plan he had with the Saudi out a plan wasn't going to do what he thought it was going to do when he starts taking distributions and my ...\nAnd this was a big surprise for him he was a math teacher yeah and when you sit there and he understands number understood the numbers so the sequence of return to pretty simple you know the sequence a when those big market tanked returns could really affect your portfolio\nYou know mark goes up and down right so if you have read money in and you're invested in stocks bonds and you can find Z ts and you're in the market it's going to go up and it's going to go down and many people talk about how long term it's going to be up\nBut do sequence of returns if you have your money and now a new experience big returns that our losses in the upcoming first part of the years even though years down the road it recovers big returns on the upside it could really drastically affect your bottom line portfolio number\nWhich leads me to another little key issue here what if you could get up to fifty percent of the returns\nAnd not lose anything meaning that if the market goes up at the U.S if he goes up ten percent you get five right if the market goes up twenty you get ten\nAnybody out there listening to what I'm saying because if you're not getting that one of the sequence of returns is very important to talk about and to getting up to fifty percent of the gains how important is that to you because the CD rate is a real joke the

plan\nAnd I said no that's not true and we got done with him he apologized to me and he said I never heard of these strategies and concepts that where you guys explained it and it's simple Chris you said it before because a financial advisor just wants to do one thing stock Boehner mutual fund the transactional\nAnd you know I've been talking about this we put a plan together for everyone out there your plan so just talk about why the strategies and concepts we have the old plan doesn't work all the time and that's where people are cemented into the mindset that I only have to do with that way\nWell let's talk about this you mentioned a great point does the retail advisor most advise out there and many people listening today don't really know I don't understand that there are retail advisors and there's also complete advisors\nAnd understanding that every advisor is not the same\nAnd a lot of people get in the same position where they need with one on one retail advisor and then they go to another advisor in the same thing as a retail they all they want to do is just sell you something\nNine nine nine zero seven zero six and you are going to love to service\n\nHey let's talk filters for a minute are you by using a cheap\nFilter huh admitted just admitted okay\nIf you are you might want to start a savings account because it's likely that you're going to need to ... lead disassemble your heating and air conditioning system\nHave a completely clean sanitized disinfected and put it back together and that can get expensive we're talking thousands with an S. okay a little piece of free advice folks if you're going to buy a one inch filter\nBy one from your local big box store your age your lowers your home depot wherever it is that you're going through filters nowadays and here's the number one rule the number one rule is to get a filter that you cannot see through\nOkay if you can hold your filter up and you can see your hand on the other side\nNot a good filter okay that's basically is and sister take that out are looking for gold or something like that to the beach with you we call that a ... it's good for a golf balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at filtering your air\nAnd it's not going to protect your heating and cooling system\nAnd you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive okay that's what the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay come\nOn people spend some money on a good filter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money\nNow the correct one for you to buy\nIf you're going to get a one inch filter is a one inch police raided\nFilter that's P pleaded filter look for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip okay goes up and down and up and down\nAnd it's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big span um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouth your system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and it can cause some damage\nAll right so I buy one that costs between maybe six and Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs that are not no look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter starts to look a little dirty it's becoming harder to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor\nAnd the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor it'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat pump your furnace or your air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you\nYou will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on\nSome of these five inch filters will fit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive than the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them\nAbout every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly hey you're rock steppers you're saying sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in droves they give you a great return on investment okay\nThey'll look we've only got a couple of minutes left in the show folks and I've got maybe four maybe five of these left to give away at the discounted rate and I want to thank everyone who's called in today you know I don't think business people say\nThank you enough without

for\nUm I don't know if you listen for educational facts to help you make a decision to make an appointment to come in because that's so important I'll give you another example or TV show that we do every Sunday we had a gentleman coming last week and this is how you know important as soon as he heard about sequence of returns\nAnd the sequence of returns really got him and it bothered him Chris and he said I have to cool these guys because he started to realize that the plan he had was the Saudi out a plan wasn't going to do what he thought it was going to do when it starts taking distributions and\nMy ... and this was a big surprise for him he was a math teacher yeah and when you sit there he understands number understood the numbers so the sequence of returns are pretty simple you know the sequence a when those big market tanked returns could really affect your portfolio\nYou know mark goes up and down right so if you have read money in and you're invested in stocks bonds and you can find Z ts and you're in the market it's going to go up and it's going to go down and many people talk about how long term it's going to be up\nBut do sequence of returns if you have your money and now a new experience big returns that our losses in the upcoming first part of the years and even though years down the road it recovers big returns on the upside it could really drastically affect your bottom line portfolio number\nWhich leads me to another little key issue here what if you could get up to fifty percent of the returns\nAnd not lose anything meaning that if the market goes up with the U.S up he goes up ten percent you get five right if the market goes up twenty you get ten\nAnybody out there listening to what I'm saying because if you're not getting that\nOne the sequence of returns is very important to talk about and to getting up to fifty percent of the gains how important is that to you because a CD rate is a real joke the bones are having problem right Chris\nSo think about what we're saying because if it's about education and you're listening to the show\nGive us a call ... won three non zero nine zero zero to to\nVisit Maggie tax dot

return we looked at the income that they need we asked them a ton of questions to make sure that we understood them\nAnd then we told them at the end of the meeting we said hey you can retire and you can have more income coming in then actually working and they both sat back and they said really want to know them they don't know the numbers exactly and then we showed them they were just it was like an a ha moment and they said we didn't know this\nGoes back a minute ago because we talked about the sequence of returns and the gentleman that came in was a math major\nAnd it's funny because the numbers didn't match up to him the way he thought so look when you do planning when you do tax planning and do income planting the numbers have to be what you need and the gap that you'd you have
