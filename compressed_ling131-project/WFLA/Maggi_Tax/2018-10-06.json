retirement or you can log in username and password you can go there any time and this is what Chris than I Do every week it's about education the other thing is we wrote a book very successful book\nStopped funding Uncle Sam through time and get a plan that simple and easy to understand and it's funny because I had a lady in the lobby last week\nAnd um I you know went out to greet her and she was reading the book\nAnd I said hello and she said oh I'm Sorry I just you know I got into this book how do I get a copy of it and she said there's so much information here about Social Security and the color of money that you guys talk about I can read it right here so of course the thing is that if people want to copy of this book what do they have to do\nA pretty simple I mean if you're serious about your retirement you're serious about\nGetting things in order to just pick up the phone scheduled time and he's with us\nEight when three nine zero nine zero zero two two when you come in will give me the book we want you to get educated\nYou know we had the books you read we also have an audio so we can definitely help you want to make sure that you understand what your options are so let's talk about that the different phases of money but many people spend their time and energy focusing on how to accumulate a larger time a nest egg without giving any thought to really how their retirement assets are invested\nIn what you're talking about is creating a pile of money and I remember you all last week saying to a client or you did was build a pile of money and they looked at you and they like yeah and the question was what are you going to do with it right how do you how do you build up a distribution phase of it now so you know when you accumulate um your money\nYou have a desire to mount in retirement or do you use the question how much do you need a retirement and it's so important because it also important to have your money in ss that represent the risk and see if you want and let's talk about that because we just had this conversation\nWe talk about red money green money and if you're all in the market and many people that come in we do a risk tolerance for them we\nFind it to eighty five Ninety percent Chris is in orange red money\nRight and red money these that says I'm have a return that it's not guaranteed and they carry varying levels of risk and there's opportunity for growth or read money\nBut you need to make sure that you are prepared to see with caution and that's the biggest thing the example of red money would be stocks hedge funds or even off shore investments yeah and\nAnd the problem is I think most people and we see this all the time don't open their statements when you sit down and open up the statement we ask them to you know what you have they may have some bonds mutual funds and stocks they don't even know what kind of stocks they have and that's what's important because it when you sit with us we're going to go over that with you\nThe other um color of money we talk about his yellow money and these are assets that may be safer but\nStill need to be examined with caution you get to a red light or you get to light the yellow lights telling you slow down or stop\nWhy because something else is coming across the other side it might hurt you so examples of yellow money would include real estate variable annuities mutual funds bonds and some stock and this is so important because we do a full review I recline their comes in\nAnd we also do report for someone mentioned it's been very good uh found money report and here's an example where you know you can find out that some of the investments you have a really not going to give you the return that you're hoping for\nThat's right and that's why it's so important to understand really where are you invested so this red money there is yelling money and there's also what we called green money and these assets are designed to have principle protection and provide safety\nYour growth potential is less if you had red or yellow money but you can also moved through retirement comfortably knowing your assets are potentially more safe\nAnd available to provide income stream that you might meet in your retirement years example of green money might be government bonds CDs a savings accounts life insurance with cash value\nMoney market accounts or index annuities lot of different things that are safe and when you come in and meet with us you know where do you want to be where are you currently and that's why when you come in to analyze what you currently have\nAnd maybe if something good and that was a guy and the other day and he said to me said ask them why came in he said well because you know you guys are for do Sherrie\nYou've got to tell me if things are good or things are bad and we analyzed his accounts and I told him that\nYou got a great thing going here keep it and he looked at me and he said would you say and I said well you're fine stay where you are and he was just\nHe was shocked and he said well I I thought you would tell me to change it and I said why would you do that if you got something good it's always great to get a second opinion so we really appreciated that and that's why it's so important to determine the amount of risk that is right for you it depends on your specific situation\nAnd let's go back to what you said because this is so important what that gentleman didn't realize from his investments he was taking a seven percent\nOr would throw All right distribution is going to be done and I don't think he understood that until Crist actually showed it to him the reason why we told them it was a good what he had and he thought it was it was because we can't find something that's going to give you seven percent a distribution right\nWell guaranteed you know that's what he had he had a some he had a really great industry that was locked in for a long time and he thought that there was something better out there and we tell them hey you'll find your good state where you're at take the interest and he did and that's what made him feel so comfortable\nWith what was going with that this is why we say when you come in we have to sit down we have to do a risk tolerance because it's so important and here's a case where we help the gentleman really nice guy got to do so I just want to see if you guys have something better and it's not about us having something better\nIt's about finding something that's going to be that's gonna fit your risk tolerance you know you don't have to take that risk what about if you could put your money to an account we can get up to fifty percent of the games and keep the gains talk about that for a second\nWell Yemenis save money ... money options where you can still participate in the market as some ... five hundred\nYour gains can be linked towards the U.S and the five hundred index but you don't get all the games get fifty percent of the game just the markers up ten percent you get five\nThe markers up thirty percent you get Fifteen exactly but if the market tanks and goes down thirty percent and you don't get anything but you don't lose anything you know if that's what you're looking for then there are options for you and not every advisor\nCan come up with these options because there's a lot of advisers that just deal with red money red money or had money but at our from we deal with everything here we can helping a lot of different leads to pick up the phone schedule a time to be with us we have a tax division we have an income division we have an insurance division where we can help you with safe money\nWe have an investment division where we can act she'll the manage money there's third party is that we use that actively manage money in the market\nThere's a lot of things that could be done for you to pick up the phone schedule a time to meet with us and\nWhen we talk about retirement assets typically they're meant to do one of two things either providing retirement income\nWhen needed or pass a legacy onto your family and when it comes to preparing your retirement income for some grain money there might be the best place for you but there's also called yellow money where you can have some of that as well it's up to you so pick up the phone\nDid absolutely and also when you retire I mean the the the process to complete the paperwork\nIs really just drained informs that you have to you to certain forms whether you want a survivor benefit you know how to keep the health insurance\nYou keep twenty five percent of survivor benefit you keep fifty percent of the benefit where the costs that are going to come out of your annuity and you know what we talk about this you have the pension if you're eligible or knew what he would just guaranteed income for life\nMany people many federal employees aren't even aware that they have an income stream coming in with a gentleman last weekend and he's been there twenty four years and we said hey you gonna get Social Security yet your ESPN other income source and you're also going to get the pension and he says no one that\nWe said yeah you are you're eligible you're going to get at the twenty four years you're going to get a guaranteed pension check\nThey don't know what the minimum retirement ages and how they get it and folks there are people that we meet that of their Thirty years thirty five years and they tell us just well Chris mentioned I didn't know what I'm getting an annuity so\nThe program that we offer specifically designed to help federal employees obtain necessary information to make fully informed decisions we do a free benefits analysis so understand the servers and first and even this one the\nService offset retirement system we get people that are in that so they don't know what to do the life insurance Chris mentioned about ... how does it work associated cost and what happens to it too when you get older when you retire it gets more expensive\nHow do you maximize U. T. S. P. account how it's computer what benefits are going to be able to use survivors that's a big question one thing I'll bring up we find out that many of them and not many but some of them don't have a beneficiary on the ts and my gosh\nWho said all the time and you know this accounts gonna go through probate if you don't title at the right way were have been a Fisher is the right way\nAnd also you know we talk about first and serves this is an in depth discussion that we have on the first retirement system and check it out Social Security\nService health benefits are calculated requirements to qualify for your pension too you know that\nShe is the catch up rules this loan regulations your what your options at age fifty nine and a half that many of you don't know and and how it's going to help you in retirement and the big one facility view what is the windfall ... provision and could affect your Social Security benefits so Chris\nWoman talking about federal employees I Hope we you know help you out here if you're a federal employee give us a call ... won three non zero nine zero zero to to\nGo to federal educators dot com folks register for an upcoming seminar I don't give you worked at the VA in Tampa the VA in St Pete if your Social Security if you post office go to the website federal educators dot com\nThat's right and egg attacks in financial group we create an aggy plan the retirement and it's a plan that simple and easy to understand and complaining tax planning\nInsurance planning investment planning state planning legacy planning federal employee benefit planning eight one three nine zero nine zero zero to to watch our show tomorrow and ABC TV at ten thirty ABC TV eight one three Ninety nine zero zero to [noise]\nPrivate and whether hard radios nine Seventy WFL a [noise]\nFrom the voter central credit union free checking traffic\nCenter where we see in quiet driving conditions on the interstate to this morning as we have no delays on two Seventy\nFive it's you're heading out of novels county across a Howard Franklin bridge once you're off the bridge is clear into downtown Tampa no do they know what ... found on Seventy five and you're moving while on either for wrapping up that earlier accident on the real one near causeway boulevard delays in that area but a good rivals direction of the two Seventy\nFive to ... county I made a Springer news radio nine Seventy WFL a\nCatchy cloud to the overnight period will start off comfortable by Saturday morning at Seventy four degrees Ninety two on Saturday afternoon temperature still above average that trend will continue into your Sunday is well we'll bring you arrangements up to twenty percent for the second half of the weekend\nMorning low Seventy four high temperature climbs back to Ninety two\nOut on the water northeast when the ... not with two foot seas and just delight chop on bait and unload waters news channel a meteorologist at bloods worth for news radio nine Seventy WFL legs [noise]\nFox News I'm ...

Lee disassemble your heating and air conditioning system have it completely cleans\nSanitized disinfected and put it back together and vet can get expensive we're talking thousands with an S. okay\nLittle piece of free advice folks if you're going to buy a one inch filter\nBy one from your local big box store your age your lowers your home depot wherever it is that you're going through filters nowadays and here's the number one rule the number one rule is to get a filter that you cannot see through\nOkay if you can hold your filter up and you can see your hand on the other side\nNot a good filter okay\nThat's basically is and sister take that out are looking for gold or something take that to the beach with you we call that a ... it's good for golf balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at filtering your air and it's not going to protect your heating and cooling system\nAnd you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive okay that's what the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay\nCome on people spend money on a good\nFilter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money\nNow the correct one for you to buy if you're going to get a one inch filter is a one inch police raided\nFilter that's P pleaded filter\nLook for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip okay goes up and down and up and down\nAnd it's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big span um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouth\nYour system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and it can cause some damage All right so I buy one that costs between maybe six and Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs that are not no look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter starts to look a little dirty\nIt's becoming hard to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor\nAnd the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor it'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat bump your furnace or your air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you\nYou will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on\nSome of these five inch filters will fit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive then the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly hey you're rock stoppers you're saying sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in droves they give you a great return on investment okay\nThey'll look\nWe've only got a couple of minutes left in the show folks and

depends on your specific situation\nAnd let's go back to what you said because this is so important what that gentleman didn't realize from his investments he was taking a seven percent\nOr would throw All right distribution distribution and I don't think he understood that and so Chris actually showed up to him the reason why we told them it was a good what he had he thought it wasn't was because we can't find something that's going to give you seven percent or a distribution right\nWell guaranteed you know that's what he had he had a ... he had a really great interest rate that was locked in for a long time and he thought that there was something better out there and then we tell them hey you'll find your good stay where you're at take the interest and he did and that's what made him feel so comfortable\nWith what going with that this is why we say when you come in we have to sit down we have to do a risk tolerance because it's so important and here's a case where we help the gentleman really nice guy got to do so I just want to see if you guys have something better and it's not about us having something better\nWoman talking about federal employees I Hope we you know
