yeah so I'm just a good ... due to his girl because really true that girl is going to need to face these type of behavior for the rest of the life and and it's no compensation to do that\nWell they tried to destroy a little girl and use her in cartoon I Try to promote their highly biased political agenda which\nIs I don't I don't really trash ahead very much\nBecause he ... he can fight for yes but this was a child okay that that is the direction this this is like you're moving around and came back to to the family in in ... and the wife of reducing can survive on that\nBut the the the the view of these girls for the rest of their life is going to be stain\nI don't care if you become whatever in a key becomes the best judge with the world already why is going to be people all the time I just want to bring these these are the situation in willing salt them and it's going to be ...\n... something that should be said is that Kevin Hall was so demoralized yeah I think something that demonstrated the character of the cabinet family is when they were so viciously attacked\nBy everyone in the privacy of their home their youngest child said let's pray for this woman no that sells you a lot about the caliber of the family that he's raised\nAnd you know I think you're right I think you're right you know you guys has very nice\nTo watch I don't I think these I think I think his wife used to go ahead and get them illegal illegal behavior against this woman because she lie in in in because never proven anything these were all political and wash weaponized by the by the ... the director of the\nDemocratic Party they used for in a miserable away\nAnd and and now she says I don't want to have anything to do no change too she needs to be brought to justice but that Dr\nMhm I agree but my question for all of you is they threw out every stop every\nEvery awful tactic they can do to someone they tried to pull on justice Brett Kavanaugh now that that's done what happens when another seat becomes available\nWhat could they possibly do person because it's getting a scheme like the same joke as the next one is serial rapist you\nKnow they're going to end but that is now\nThat is going to happen you know\nThat there's going to happen for a few we do not go ahead and seek justice I mean they they the director of the Democratic\nParty that they hide this information from from Ford or they should lose that position on the seats on the on the on the Congress and that they need to they need to remove the need to be a remote boat going\nYou know docket raises another question though the the people who are elected to the highest office in our country the president the vice president our senators are congressman certainly appointed judges\nAfter going through this who in their right mind would want one of those positions one wants to be nominated and dragged her family through it\nBut that's that's exactly what happened in the Democratic party the only thing that they have is very crappy irresponsible an educated and poorly ethical individuals' thought they'd go to these positions and that's why the Democratic party constantly is so dirty in the way that they fight because\nThey are not really intellectually prepared for those positions and the mixing of happens is they're going to corrupt the same thing that the Republicans the Republicans they always claimed the Republicans have our our power that they don't fight they don't they don't do the things they don't go to the guy\nWhat they do to try to fight intellectually they would fight with the law they tried to fight ethically you gotta fight it directly with somebody who worked with trash\nAnd that ... has this yes well Trump Trump is not going to deliver the ... and there's going to get you back in and and you go oh I don't like these guy because he is insulting\nPeople tried that but you know what I relish in extra money and my pay check and I I relish with the fact that our

agree I agree\nHow to use it properly and what to do with it when you're getting near retirement look you've you're five years off for retirement or retiring next year or you've got a lot of choices to make and so we're going to talk about that stuff the show this was going to be really really important and I also want to talk about when we're done with this health care writers the other issue I see out there\nIs a\nNot managing or not knowing about this wonderful tool that's available to you and unfortunately your advisors aren't talking about it and it's really important and we have a whole chapter in our book dedicated on healthcare writers so I thought we would cover that as well\nSo but I Know that you are constantly inundated when you know we've had conversations among the top questions that you are asked it's about four one case it's about Iowa arrays\nAnd should people be using one how do they manage their their company four one K. can you shed some light let's dive in\nYour ears what I see all the time taught is I I see people they have their work based plan and remember ... here's a difference in what say four one K. that's a retirement plan\nThat most people have that's what a for profit company would use you know a General Mills Proctor Gamble Delta Airlines whoever it is they're going to run for one case\nIf you work for a nonprofit they called for all three ... said the same thing that they're no different you know you as the employee would use these things the same way and government employees are called thrift savings plans and teachers are are I'm Sorry teachers or through our savings governments are ts peas\nIt's all the same thing and what these plans are and why they're so important\nIs to pieces the money you put in there as pre tax you don't pay\nThe taxes on that money that you put in there until you withdraw later\nSo that's a really important piece so if I'm frustrated with all the taxes I have to pay even though we're going to have lower rates\nOr we can warm further by using these plants so you want to put money in there and the other pieces typically you get a match so whoever it is you work for is going to match you three four five percent of that depends on you know where you're working so every dollar you put in they put a matching dollar up to a woman\nSo if I were to put money on my retirement plan my four one K. for three be two things are happening I'm lowering my taxes and I'm getting a match on my money I think that's wonderful\nBut here's what I've been hearing lately I've been hearing financial advisors saying all don't put your money in your retirement plan at work put it with me in an IRA and I can invest it for you much better than they can\nNow I got to tell you that's horrible advice this terrible advice because that four one K. allows you to put more money than there are a cost less than the IRA and typically are not going to roll it over into retirement\nSo there's a little controversy you know we're gonna talk about all that stuff but you want to be using these plants and you want to use these plans to the maximum extent possible not the minimum so the mistake I see people doing is they put enough money to get the company match\nBut more so three or four or five percent of their salaries right that's not good\nLike say you're not maximizing if the government is going to give you a benefit\nUse that or try your best to use it the government doesn't give you a much so try to use has ever whatever little a little bonus they're going to give you use it I mean just take every bit if you kept\nThinking about this for a minute if you're in a twenty percent tax bracket a lot of our voices are twenty percent or higher twenty percent tax bracket\nThat means you're saving twenty percent on every dollar that you put your four one K. that's a twenty percent match from the government you know we're worried about a three and four percent match for a company the government is giving you twenty cents on every dollar going into your four one K. so you really want to maximize it\nAnd the amount you can put in a four one K. changes with age so younger people are Eighteen thousand but when you hit fifty you gotta catch up\nSo he could go up to twenty four thousand or ... or catch up so the idea was four one K. is one of the things I say wrong is people are minimizing just to get their match in there they should be maximizing the four oh one K. the first place you should be saving is in your four one K. first\nAn outside your for one case or returning plans later right\nSo the tax the ferment is clearly an advantage and putting as much as you can in and then having the right investment over the years the compounding of that it's it's just going to grow and grow\nOh yeah but what is a financial advisor going to tell you they're going to say oh don't put your four one K. because they can't earn a commission\nTheir health as self centered at five or wrong I stopped stopped stopped ... let me folks let me just let me stop the presses right here let me tell you why we have to listen to what Bob Harward adjusted listen to what Robert Harward the president of the horror would finance ripped just it he essentially\nI just took money out of his pocket\nHe well but what I'm saying is though is I mean that's me that's what you mean you get when when you deal with with your company you get straightforward advice you're telling people maximize your four O. one K. when in fact that as a disadvantage\nTo financial advisors because they might not have as much money on under management or make a commission you're giving people honest advice\nOr for those areas were for this year advisors were going to do what's in your best interest you know our industry has bias everyone wants to make a commission off of you what they really should do is do the right thing and if they do the right thing they're going to have a good relationship and and you're going to stay with your advisor unfortunately that bias with so get the bias I'll\nUse your four one K. is now I got to say something there is a little secret of four one K. is I Want a teacher that's pretty cool so when I say use your four one K. is absolutely fund them that's where your money should go not to your advisor in your four one K. and we help people with us all the time but there's two things number one is coming up on retirement\nOnce you retire you're going to want to roll this over and take control of that account because you may want to invest differently than what you're four one K. allows you to do that isn't always the case but it's usually the case so when you come sit with me I'm going to teach you these things but the other thing is a little secret for one case is\nTypically a let's say you have a four one K. and you're not using it because I don't like the investments in it\nYou should still use that four one K. put your money in there it allows you that great tax deduction\nBut then what you can do is this thing called an in service distribution most people don't even know about this I put my money into four one K. and then I get a move it where I have better investment choices so you're not necessarily stuck with those mutual funds and your four one K. you can open that thing up\nWith what's called an in service distribution so I Want you to use your plans your fall through these are four one K. is don't let your advisors steer you off from that there's a great advantage but you're not stuck in the plan if you don't like the\nInvestments in there if you feel like the fees are too high or we can show you how to fix up that the secret with all this as as if you're coming up on retirement or you're not sure you're using your your plans writer you want to all your taxes\nI just give me a call come sit with me we can do a CPR or planning review together and just bringing a bunch of questions and I'm happy to sit with you and I'll answer any questions you have we talked about in our book or we'll get your copy of the book\nAnd just come on let's sit together and get a great review and I'm going to teach you how to use these things properly because your advisor may not be giving you the real deal\nWell the beauty of what you've just heard in this segment folks\nIs that Robert Harward is a fiduciary that means that he is a financial advisor runs a very successful practice with right people are working with him but\nHe is legally charge as a fiduciary he's legally responsible to give you the best advice to\nOperate in your best interests and that has just been manifested here on the radio show how he's telling you to make sure that you utilize your four one K. to the max and work\nAnd he wants to give you that type of advice and of course a lot of people they have the work four oh one K. but they also have their\nUnder investments are or other uh monies that are invested in in other areas are in their portfolio and this is where Robert Harward and his team\nA lot of work with you in totality he's going to give you the best advice on four one K. is on IRAs but also what you shouldn't be doing with other aspects of your investing Bob are you a hundred percent right on the listeners to the show right now really should call you up\nAnd make the appointment what they offer the hardwood financial group

maybe because they're working with brokers you use the broker or if your financial advisor as a stockbroker\nI change because broker sell you stuff and they're not really helping in these health care writers are so important they really are important so in my book taught you know you've read the book numerous times and we talked about on the radio quite a bit chapter five\nIs the rising cost of health care and what you can do about it and there's a whole section in the book that talks about\nHealth care writers and these are so important you know the chapters in the book talk about the invasion of the money's Snatchers understanding your investment options how to know your advisor really works for our advisors paid it covers all this stuff and and this chapter is about health care and the rising costs the reality is is that um\nWe all should have insurance so I Hope everyone has some form of insurance right when you're working as through work or or if you're on your company you have a plan of group plan\nAnd when you retire we're Medicare but the flaw that whole system has to do with something called long term care what happens if you down the road you're now older and you need a nursing home\nOr home health care or something like that you know that this event the rails so many financial plans people say they've done everything right\nExcept they never addressed the cost of healthcare long term care and all of a sudden boom they're in trouble because this event happened this is so important to talk about taught\nAt so the the the thing we have available to us is you can go buy an insurance policy there's people out there that want to sell you a long term care insurance all day long and I'm sure it pays them a big commission yeah and you pay a ton of money every month for your policy\nBut they don't talk to you about this other often called the healthcare writer so if you're one of the people\nThat are concerned that says I Want a really good plan in my advisor has never told me oh these health care writers ... let me teach you real quick because\nYou know that that's a really good point\nWhat do you ... if somebody says to you my advisor has never told me about a health care writer never brought it up ... what do you say to somebody that that has a current adviser broker that that that has never brought up the possibility or at least educating them on a health care writer\nI'll tell you need to find out for yourself because frankly if you get sick it doesn't hurt them or hurts you and your family and so sometimes if you're not working with the right kind of advisor\nOr you're not going to get the right kind of advice I mean it's really that simple so these these health care writers I'd say about health care right as you know if you ever needed long term care home health care we don't really want to think about this but\nThere's actually a very high probability more than fifty percent of us will be using those services one day\nAnd they're really expensive and they're going to be even more expensive down the road", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Win at RETIREMENT the Harwood Way with Robert Harwood", "city": "Tampa", "day": "13"}
