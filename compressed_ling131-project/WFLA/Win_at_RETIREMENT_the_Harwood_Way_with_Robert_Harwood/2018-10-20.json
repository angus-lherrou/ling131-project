{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "To American medicine today presented by the ... Institute featuring internationally acclaimed inventor of the ... procedures Alfred been out of you in the once again your host Kimberly ... and co hosts Ethan euchre and Jeff whack staff\nThank you for continuing to listen to American medicine today we\nAre here with our friends even ... I Believe I'm here you are and Jeff Flagstaff I are here you are and also present is world renowned orthopedic surgeon Dr ...\nLet's look at what's new in medicine today featuring ... [noise]\nSo this is about medication assisted treatment so [noise] um this one I had a bone to pick with and I know what your segment doc than I Am so sick of giving drug addicted people\nMore drugs different drugs in different doses to try to wean them off a different drug\nBecause you had heroin heroin horrible street drug okay so then they take methadone are actually go down and then people get hooked on those then they're sold on the street and then all of a sudden this medication assisted treatment where\nNow there can I add in a different drug um Suboxone\nAnd it's going to be injected and they think\nOkay it's time release no more problems no more ...\nThey're not going to be able to uh get any extra scripts and you know this drug is going to replace the others and everyone's just happy go lucky gay we found them\nTo do that because that's not true because what's really happening with these drugs\nAre trying to replace exactly what you're saying they're trying to bring the hearing\nThe problem is not strong enough so the guy's going to take this this medication and then they go to the streets and by the the the harrowing because\nThe fact is the same ah the the next thing that this also bad they we can we can he knew allowing the industry to the bill up new narcotics because these are still narcotics or so for you when you get this medication to a patient do you go\nIf fake type or Fey are facing behavior it's a little bit less a a\nStrong as destructive in ... but there's no true because it does get everyone is high hardly the right to because his narcotic but the problem is ... you get one of these medications these people\nWill see the medication and then is going to pursue he's he's a he's a opioid a addiction\nOutside those that that facility right because still needs the the kick that the heroin or other drugs that they are stronger I'm going to have them okay so you're not correct in the problem\nThey just pass a law on on the on on the Congress with three hundred Ninety three votes in eight no votes and these these votes on this this uh this is bill ... is to really try to increase the\nUm the treatments for the drug addiction people mhm the major trouble now that we see with this is\nAll of these slow is so low they are allowing the industry to produce new drugs mhm and then in the ... to go ahead and say okay you're an addict\nTo ... to ... we are going to allow you in as a special facility to God we withdraw mhm no don't don't don't don't think I'm cool with um same\n... to some bother you are going to we throw away the with the um a harrowing picture of three to five days to to go through withdrawal ... right but if you go you do the same thing with Suboxone\nMhm they their withdrawal take weeks is the problem with this is you're not going to go to withdraw\nYou're going to continue taking the medication because you don't want to go to the withdrawal crap but these people needs to go to withdraw\nCause great great percentage of these patients ah they're taking narcotics\nOr people that they are with a surgical pains or with other types of ... and that these amazing in my practice\nThat when a patient comes\nIn has a real pain in his already considering a guy who are addicted to it in our topics because\nYou're taking the medication for three or four years right and then I go at the pump ... pumps morphine and things like that to me when I when I treat the pain and the pain is gone\nThe majority of these patients might don't take ... to ... again friday don't hit ... even withdrawal\nRight because they were on them purely for the\n... on them for the ... really have a pain in the we're not really addict is a great percentage of the population that can be saved if you control the pain if you remove the pay\nNow if you're really really an individual who you say is a is an article guy or a person or do\nWhat you need to do is let them go to withdraw mhm the experience of that one is pretty bad writer and once you go one time use all want to go back to\nAnd it's true that they have to appear news people think that that is totally inhumane oh I don't think anybody can get that once you get that experience mhm you touched a drop again right\nOr if you do then or you'll just stay on 'em forever because you don't want to do that again but yeah the intelligent ones that I was terrible and I don't want to ...\nPercent the you know going to touch it okay so that is a way to withdraw this these this problem in ... in society and I can buy new in New York continue giving money to the to the to the ... to the farmer who does it come to develop a new drug in a new drug but the other was this\nIn liberals not topics so forget it is not going to correct a multimillion dollar industry let's face it if they are the drug pushers\nOther people have written this thing up and and that's wonderful but eventually eventually this growth is going to stop right we're going to take the stimulus out of the marketplace is going to be more volatile and\nThat's what we're seeing right now you know it has been a long time since two thousand a correction that was a big one that one was a doozy\nBut it was a long time ago and and people for kind of forget what it felt like two two I've lost thirty forty fifty percent of their life savings I mean down and thank God has recovered\nAnd things are going well right now but those threats are still out there those problems are still out there and and it was in the back of our mind so uh what we're seeing right now is\nUh the stimulated the market they printed a lot of money we talked about this on radio shows right they they want to get this market going after two thousand eight they want it to prevent the next Great Depression\nAnd to do that they had two major tools they lowered\nInterest rates so that people and companies can borrow money cheaply right and keep everyone employed that worked pretty good but they also printed money they printed money like crazy and everyone was getting nervous and concerned back then\nAs they should be today because the fed was printing trillions of trillions of dollars are putting an end to the markets to make money available so the market can recover\nAnd are the United states that\nThe money that we always a nation\nGoes out of control trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars are being laid on to this country and they have to service that debt they've got to pay the interest\nOn that debt as well as the military mil you know government pensions all this stuff Social Security Medicare Medicaid they've all these things they have to pay for\nA long with this giant norm is that they created so this is what has happened as a result of the stimulus program getting out of two thousand eight and and you got to remember how bad it fell back then that was miserable\nAnd also with interest rates are starting to pick up now yeah there is positive and negative there but ideally you don't want your interest rates sitting at\nA next to zero because the number one complaint that you heard as well as advisors all over the country and what really was weighing on people's minds that if you had a C. D. or if you had some money in cash\nThat you weren't making any interest on that many money that's that's number one a and also in a healthy economy\nYou should have a a viable decent interest rate it's just it's a sign that the economy is in good shape what I'm Talking about some of those crazy hyper interest rates that occurred back during the Carter administration for instance and I remember I was a kid back then\nI bought I was doing the Carter administration I was eleven twelve Thirteen Years old\nAnd I ... I remember the news stories I remember my parents who are trying to get a mortgage and some of the interest rates back that if I'm not mistaken they were knocking on twenty percent I mean whoa yeah it it was out of control so you don't want a reasonable interest rate it's a sign of a good economy but also what's important\nIs if there is another economic kick up if there was another catastrophic event you know the fed needs room to them lower interest rates if in fact you need to try to economically recover\nAnd it's tough to lower interest rates you know when you're essentially at at bumped zero that's why with a good economy they're starting to raise rates\nI mean you bring up a good point here here's the thing to two thousand eight was horrible there isn't anybody I think they didn't get hurt and two thousand eight and and it's hard to remember that 'cause it's a long time ago but we will have more of those two thousand eight there's no doubt about it the market goes up in the market goes down\nRight now right now the market has been stimulated into a recovery right lowering interest rates printing money cheap monies available\nAnd and the market recovers well you just hit on it you know here's the good news is the good news is the market is good enough has done well enough that they can raise rates you got to look at that as a positive thing\nAnd the other part of the thing that's wonderful as if the market crashed again by raising race they can lower it right there I got ammunition to to address the issues but think about this for a minute if lowering interest rates helped the market recover\nWhat does raising interest rates to it adds to volatility it adds to problems so here's what I Believe we're going to talk about what you need to do uh to to get through this kind of market but here's what I Believe\nThe days of stimulus are over okay they are not stimulating the market they are I don't think this is a word but they are on stimulating or these stimulating the market they're taking the stimulus out so what are they doing\nThey're raising interest rates that's a good thing it's a good thing for two reasons are children would not have a future that we just kept doing what we were doing we need a future for our children\nThey also couldn't be doing this the market wasn't doing well but here's the bad thing as they take the stimulus out of the market the market is going to react very poorly is it's like I I think of it like sugar you know you give sugar to your children\nAnd they get all hyperactive you take the sugar away and they go through withdrawals and they act poorly will the stock market is acting out\nHere's the other than they are doing this really important they printed a lot of money and they put trillions of dollars into the market to make money available so that people can pay their bills and businesses have access to funds cheap money\nWhile they're actually taking that money out with a lot of people aren't talking about right now as of the trillions they put in\nThey've already taken one half of the trillion dollars out so this is kind of interesting they actually physically removed money is called tightening\nAnd they literally if you look it up on the Web you'll see that they burn it you know we have to take money out of the market I mean that's the bags of money on their armed guards and the incinerator now I'd like to be the guy working at the incinerator but not really about the answer is that they're burning money they're taking money out of the market and the market is draw going\nBecause of the lack of stimulus has been used to stimulus now says two thousand a the stimulus has gone and what that means to us and we're talking about this is you got to tighten your seatbelt right now it is not that market we're in before where you throw it\nArt and everything goes up it's a different market and frankly if they don't do a good job and they're tightening taking the stimulus out they're going to cause the next crash if they do something wrong they could cause the next sock market crash so there's a lot of things you need to do I we're gonna teach you what to do\nWell and that's what your clients expect from you and it's not just you know the coal lions as your your uh your customers or your client you got a relationship and you know you your your\nYour

nine Bob Let's dig a little deeper into President Trump the Trump Administration your finances and let's talk about financial happiness\nYeah financial boy is how about financial boy will find a blissful way here's the thing that's important for those you joining us we've been talking about the fact that the market has been stimulated over the years so that we could recover from two thousand eight that was almost almost the great depression they called the great recession\nAnd they stimulate us out of that but after a period of time that mark has been doing really well they're taking the stimulus back they're lowering interest rates day they're taking some of the printed money out of the market and the market is behaving or earliest reacted to that and that's the\nWhat we're seeing in volatility right now now here's what I Believe everyone is asking me what do I believe in war things going number one\nThis volatility is the new norm this is what we are going to see we all wanted to go back to normal world well these ups and downs that's what the stock market does and so we've got to go back to the type of investing that's more defensive\nNot grow grow grow grow grow but grow with caution that's what I Believe\nBecause there's going to be like this for a while I Do not believe it crashes around the corner we keep hearing all the talking heads saying oh the ... you know two thousand there was a long time ago the world is falling apart\nIt's not falling apart companies are doing well people are employed there ...\nThe money but the rocky roller coaster stock market is back in my opinion is is here to stay for a while so you need to borrow your seatbelt\nAnd think about how you're investing and what you're doing and one of the biggest problems out there we alluded to this and talked about it and the first segment\nIs the fact that all this stimulus added to our country's deficit and our debt and our debt\nIs trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars and that that is kind of like a a ... you know they say the light at the end of the tunnel be careful might be a train yeah\nThat that that that that debt if they can't manage that debt than this nice stock market has been going up and up and allowing them to take the stimulus out is going to one day stop that debt will cripple this country if they don't\nManage it and so what do we need to do right now what do you need to do with your portfolio number one start being defensive and you're investing I'm not saying not to make money I'm not saying not to invest what I Am saying is\nBe smart about what we invest in what we choose and let's put some safety nets in our portfolio so that the market crashes\nYou won't crash with it and there's a lot of ways to do that so number one I Want you to take the time to think about what you're doing\nIf you don't have professional help comments that with us I'll teach you what we do you could go back and do it yourself\nBut I promise you you're going to learn so much for my team in that meeting that it'll be invaluable the allergy spent with us\nAnd if you've got a financial advisor that's awesome come in and get a second opinion let me take a look at what they're doing\nAnd I'll give you my opinion on what you can be doing better and either way this time well spent so come and get a review\nBut also recognize the fact that this volatility we're seeing right now is here to stay for a while as long as they're raising interest rates as long as they're removing stimulus\nAnd as long as I Jain enormous debt sets out there\nAre those are things that are like a a an albatross around her neck and and it's going to slow down this market is so common was do good review but also rethink your investment strategies let's talk about how to be safer and still achieve your goals\n[noise] it's all common sense I mean what you're saying Bob\nIt just completely it just [laughter] yeah it does cause that's but no one's doing it to put this into the easy as possible and grass terms I mean what you're saying is so simple why do a lot of people not follow\nBothered by I mean most advisors aren't doing this ... you know and and and you know gets hurt when they do what they do you do they don't they made their commissions they're okay but a year left holding the bag and and that is not right\nLet's talk and you always have good stories you've got the good the bad the ugly I I like to call them the or the basket case stories and you have people that come to you all the time for the complete planning review or what's the most recent a basket case of audio\nNo you know taught I'll tell you why on you say that\nUsually when people come in there just a little off base or not so far left or right but they certainly need a tuna man do we make a difference and can we help once in a while I get people and that their fees are so high they're literally buying their advisor a new car every year", "show_name": "Win at RETIREMENT
