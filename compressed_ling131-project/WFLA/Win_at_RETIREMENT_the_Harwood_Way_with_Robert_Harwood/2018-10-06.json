you are looking a population that this whole new ingenious population in other countries mhm you come to United States\nA you have a Democratic Party ... open the doors to every foreigner who comes through the wall [laughter] [noise]\nYeah then you have a situation that these very conflicting yes in health care and one of the problem is you don't know what type of health health problems these patients have correct you're going to know how old they are\nYou going to know what the seizes they bring to the country\nProbably would have stuck to look now diseases that were totally eradicated from the United states tens of years ago were singer ... ... ... you know suddenly we're starting to get ... come from we are being confirmed that we try to develop vaccinations and problems and education for the people correct so went up and he's\nHe's a lot of money diverse\nTo protect the that illegal population that shouldn't be expended a in the population of the country yes well the major ... this is one of the problems\nThey let go and talk about ... he'll care in in in the way that the individuals\nThat they are eating properly and individual ... practically totally the police of the food right the population come over here and they have a tremendous amount of health problems associated with lack of of of resources\nTo protect themselves to heaven Norma organs or Norma Norma Norma bothers all those bodies are already with a lot of problems very fragile and we need to re establish these people in to be able to have a service or they could get hit with a normal life\nSo you can then you hear the population of the brick here with his son lives\nIn those families are all people with a lot of other problems and then they go to Medicare and Medicaid mhm that depletes also monitor all the things I Do not being\nDiscussed by the politicians of course now they are not going to discuss that one because of the boats are not going to be for their correct so what happens is they create if voters representation of the hill kid in this country you know the very end\nThey are forcing you to socialize medicine that these are the ... the left side won't and they're getting closer and closer except for right now you have a problem with Amazon suddenly jumping healthcare\nGive it probably will Google is jumping ... not a problem because this tremendous problems those those corporations or sociology the corporation the ideal these socialistic corporations is grab all decided to these through these nets and get to everybody ...\nIt's important to everybody was all do this before we get started though I got to tell you you know we we research for the show all the time\nAnd as I'm researching\nI come across an article from a person named Steven Hawkins now a lotta people know him this is ... he's considered a probably one of the smartest guys ever in the world\nAnd and and he's just a genius and he's a technology guy he's always talking about technology and how technology is going to change society\nAnd his article said that in his opinion\nThis could be the biggest event in the history of civilization the biggest thing ever this this technological revolution that's going on and and this guy is just really a smart guy and a\n... when he talks you got to listen to you know it's just it's just as smart and this is a trend with technology that's going on right now that we as investors can take advantage of I mean this is a great opportunity there's a lot of things going on right now you know the tax plan and all that\nBut inside your are opportunities that you can take advantage of it as an investor\nAnd technology is one of those trends so I don't know if your advisors feel this way or you feel this way but I got to tell you something uh this technology is going to evolve the world who we are you know I remember you probably remember this George Jetsons you remember the Jetsons were that were that old you know\nDon't get laws made that the flying cars made that noise base scooter you do that and that technology\nWell listen I don't know that we're going to live in a pot up in the air or anything but a lot of that stuff is actually happening and we as investors or me as your investment manager\nShould be taking advantage of some of these things is is where a lot of the growth in the market has been over the last few years is technology\nNow Bob did you just said that you don't know for going to live in a pond up in the air\nI I'm just guessing that might have been a stretch of the joy\nYou know I'm just saying it if you don't manage your finances right if you don't plan well for retirement you might be living in a pod in your front yard I'm Talking about one of those were those moving boxes\nSo [laughter] you know that you know there are only like a hundred and sixty five bucks a month ... conditioning but you could do that yeah pretty cost effective actually you know you remember the show we did about the guy that said he can live on like four or five dollars a day and I know whose backyard yeah you don't want to be the person in the backyard you\nMention the genius you mention the astrophysicist Stephen Hawking and\nThere was a story maybe a year or two ago do you know there's the kids just just a little side by you know there's a conspiracy theory that's been floating around for a couple of years that Stephen Hawking actually had passed away a while ago and he was replaced with a body double\nOr knowing how about an alien that's in his body\nI [laughter] crazy stuff Ida ... let's let's dive into the nuts and bolts let's talk financial gut check\nWell before I get there I Want to tell you something funny though I don't want to go there yet I Want to talk about something else okay so we have these opportunities\nIn the market because of this evolution make sure you're taken advantage of it if you want to learn how to invest in these things I'll teach you but they're smart ways to do this now tell you there's another side so here's this genius that says that this is going to change the world and what a great opportunity for people\nAnd there's another genius out there his name is Iran must remember two thousand one\nSo I see I have to yeah how are they right when the computer how how how how two thousand right yeah how takes him troll so what have you on a bus say he says don't worry about North Korea North Korea's the big threat the big threat\nOur robotics these robotics we're going to have two thousand one space odyssey these robots take over the world ... it'll be kind of point of the apes movies that apes there'll be robots I guess\nYou know by the way I Apologize how nine thousand I said how two thousand I shorter how by seven grand\nWhy it's going to come back and get you will be carrying the hippo so so he's saying boy this technology is here's what I Do here's what I Know we're in a World War cars are going to be self driving manufacturing is done by robots right medicine advances a lot of it have to\nDo with this technology and as investors man what a what what a great day to take advantage of non not saying that you throw your money in this\nBut don't ignore to either you know investing is about opportunities about being able to make money but maybe minimize the risk as best you can as you're making money\nAnd so my job is help guide through these things stay abreast with things and show you how to do well I mean we've got this evolution our world and his two sided I mean what's on one side here's the bad side I don't think he won ... guy you're smarter than I Am but I don't think we're going to World War three with robots but here's what I Do know\nA robot takes the place of a person and that person used to pay taxes and feed their family with that money and the robot doesn't and so we're going to lose some tax revenues and things like that I'm sure of that you know as this robot has come in and it's going to cost us jobs well\nYou know it it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me and I've discussed this on my nationally syndicated Schmidt show on numerous occasions all this chatter about AI artificial intelligence and robots and replacing people if your place all the people\nAnd you know ... what what people do and I know that all all there'll be other jobs and ... you know I I don't know if that in a case that that concerns me is you can create all the robots you want but if you don't have people that perform work\nThat earn an income I mean that could be a huge option to the economy\nWell I can tell you there's a committee that's been formed in ... in Congress to research just because their concern is social unrest people don't have jobs and the other one is tax revenues and one of the proposals is to start taxing robot so let's say you have the car Ford Motor company with a robot painting a car\nWhile he replaced the individual that used to pay taxes on his income and they're saying well why can't we taxis robots I mean\nThis was going to change a lot of things it's monumental\nIn our world but here's what I Want to stay to our listeners is\nAs this evolution of Kurds\nWere talking about investing we're talking about smart places to invest your money to make a little money I Would never put all my money into this stuff\nBut should you not have some exposure to it wouldn't you like to see your portfolio grow as the world changes and we take advantage of these things so these are opportunities that you have when people come in and sit with me out with a program called CPR complete planning review\nI get to see how you're investing I get to see what your advisors are doing and frankly there's typically a lot of room for improvement you can do a lot better than you're doing right now and some of these things are common sense you know where we invest what we do how much risk we take my job is to help you balance that stuff out\n[noise] well it's a simple process or the harlot financial group has a grown in reputation over the years\nYou have a wonderful client base you know the best thing about your client base is they recommend due to their friends their relatives their associates they're collies that is the sincere as former flattery that's the highest form when when you're recommended by your clients\nAre taught absolutely you know we have a good relationship we we I was on my way care were to do share as we do the best we can all the time for our clients that the thing that I Want to kind of expressed of our listeners because you are listening to learn and grow and do better with your finances\nIs there are certain opportunities that are available for you and those opportunities are only here for a short time so if you want to take advantage of them than than you need to do that you need to take action with that stuff and we can help you do that year visor can help you do that you can do it on your own\nBut what's taking advantage of these things are certain areas of our market that is just going gangbusters\nEight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine eight hundred three nine five
