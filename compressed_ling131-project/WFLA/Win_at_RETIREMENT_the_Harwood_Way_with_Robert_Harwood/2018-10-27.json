Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolfe now with the scene of a deadly mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh calling it an absolute tragedy Pittsburgh Police spokesman Chris Todd Mary\nI think back then people would just say look I just want to have a job I got my paycheck or if I'm retired I Want to make sure I have the money I Need to live on\nIt and I wouldn't make a statement sometimes we have to refocus on what's most important what's most important is the ability to support our families pay our bills have what we need a especially in hard times like oh wait you know that's not right now the market really isn't that bad we're going to talk about how I feel about the market was going on right now\nI don't think this is all white I don't go away even around the corner another one for us that's not what I'm saying but it's really important to talk about this show that we really focus on what's important and what's really important is the ability for you to retire with grace\nTo be comfortable in retirement have what you need or while you're working to be able to pay the bills and get things done and you need to get done\nHappiness really does live at a steady paycheck and sometimes we just got to take our eye off the stock market and and not be forgotten days is up and depressed on his days as down and have a kind of ruined\nEverything going on in our lives you just got to turn off the noise once in a while and move on so so let's talk about the market for a second let's talk about what's going on what's driving this madness out there because it's it's really kind of crazy or what's going on right now in the markets\nAnd when you think about it just in the general sense\nOur markets were stimulated to keep us from going into another Great Depression back in two thousand eight right everyone's like the systemic failure the world's ending and we don't do something extreme\nOr we're going to end up in another Great Depression worldwide and the U.S lead everyone out of this just this terrible position with Iran I mean it was really horrible back then through stimulating the market\nAnd remember how they simulated the market what they did Todd\nOh we cut interest rates dramatically we had all kinds of a governmental spending with all of those programs that were there were a number of things we did\nYeah yeah ... exactly right they cut interest rates to zero essentially zero and want it to even talk it talked about going negative you and I talked about that on shows you know how easy that was\nTo stimulate the market and the other thing they did is they had a lot of programs and the pay for those programs they printed money the printing presses were running twenty four hours a day printing money that they were putting into the system through programs and things like that and eventually\nThe market recovers and frankly takes off like a rocket ship I mean what's in the market fully recovered twenty Thirteen and they kept stimulating after twenty thirty and then the market gets over stimulated\nYou know they probably should have done something sooner maybe so it wouldn't be so drastic right now but they didn't they didn't do anything they allowed the market to get over stimulated\nAnd what's happening now is the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and remember when they lowered rates the market went up so what do we expect to do when they raise rates\nThe opposite right exactly yeah it's a logical the market goes down and the other thing they did is they quit printing money right they're young they're printing money they are actually taking money out of the system they're making money harder to get for businesses\nThat it's called tightening the monetary policy I don't want to be too technical but they're just making money harder to get so it's harder for companies to borrow money right now to invest in their future growth\nAnd the stock market is reacting to these two items and we're getting this what I Would call very massive kind of volatility really good really bad all over the place\nYou know it's a catch twenty two or it's a weird position than many might have been following the news and as interest rates have picked up the president President Trump\nHas been very critical and President Trump has made some very overt statements toward the fed and what are they doing this is insanity you know it's important to keep it keep track of a couple of things in that\nThe president uh picks the fed chief so the press has their person technically installed a guy understand that when you raise raise it does cause this volatility but\nThe goal is to ultimately get out of that very low interest rate zone and get to a normal thing to get a normal interest so it's it's a tough position to be and I understand the president frustration but you\nGot us it is healthy to have interest rates added normal level but it's also one of the complaints that that you hear in your business Bob as a financial advisor is that people with cash or seen these they've been making nothing and it's someone I recommend you know whether you have a portfolio with bonds and\nSocks and other vehicles you know ... ... cash a cash component has usually been part of a portfolio that cash historically is typically made some money but\nFor since oh wait the cash has made butkus\nYeah so so you brought up a good point you know we need the fed to raise rates they I mean we can't live in a zero interest rate arch listen we got to get the stimulus out and back to normal market but there's a right way and wrong way to do it and I'm going to say they're both right and they're both wrong I mean\nThe fed is right we need to raise rates and get back to normalcy you use a great word there but three percent three percent of the treasury and here's the big one that people weren't thinking about\nBut the thirty year mortgage on homes is now at five percent\nThat's a big number we're not used to that and that's probably getting pretty normal to rice or getting back to normal interest rates but the housing market drives the job market I think about it for a minute you know if we're not building houses\nBecause interest rates are getting higher and it does affordable for people\nHow many jobs does that affect not just the people building the house but how about the plumbing supply and electrical supplier electrician there the realtors everyone involved in the housing market the housing market has always been a driving force in our economy and so what's happening is because of rising interest rates\nThat people are seeing you know these big pension funds and everything are seeing a building starts slowing down and interest rates going up there going oh my God this is bad the markets topping out and it becomes a volatile\nAnd that's what's going on right now raising interest rates higher mortgage rates\nThe fed is no longer stimulating but taking money back and all this comes together to kind of like remember the perfect storm we went through well this is the opposite of that it's it's a perfect storm of taken all of it out and I want to say something this is really important for listeners\nWhat they're doing we need to get back to normalcy but if they make a mistake\nThey can cause another correction right there was a little balancing act going on and that's what I Want our listeners to know\nI don't think it crashes tomorrow you got all the talking heads on TV that you know after the crash will tell you I told you so but\nThat they don't know no one knows what's gonna happen here's what I Do know the market has changed a word changing the way we're managing investments were building more cash or being more conservative with our\nOur our clients right now because uh my opinion this is a different stock market than it was last year and so you need to be making those changes your advisors knew to stay in touch with the market because\nFrankly you know a lot of ... and have a good golf game but there are so much time on the golf course maybe they're attending to your investments in that frustrates me when you hire a professional to watch over your needs\nYou wanna watching over your needs so my opinion the market\nIs going to be tough for a while the they're going to keep raising interest rates even though I think the fed ought to stop for a while or they're going to keep raising interest rates they've said they're going to do that and my concern is that they go too far\nIt might cause a correction but other than that I don't think that there's a big crash coming up I just think we're in for a a heck of a ride is the way to save the volatility house here\nWell it's about what you're saying and the ground you've just covered I think it really demonstrates that you and your team at the Hollywood financial group\nThat you guys watch everything that your eyes are looking all directions eyes in the back of your heads and you care about what the markets go what the markets or could do a up down sideways\nAnd you apply all of this knowledge in what you and your team gathers and you apply it to\nHow are you a consultant and how you direct the portfolios of your clients and I think that just that little truncated conversation just demonstrates how active you guys are and what areas folks\nAh we have a lot of ground to cover a including why retirees should be very worried right now we're going to get into that in a bit\nBut if you would like a a second set of eyes or a many or
