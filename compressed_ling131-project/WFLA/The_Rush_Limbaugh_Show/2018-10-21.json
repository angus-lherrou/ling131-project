{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "Filter huh admitted just admitted okay\nWell if you are you might want to start a savings account because it's likely that you're going to need to ... lead disassemble your heating and air conditioning system have it completely clean sanitize disinfected\nAnd put it back together and that can get expensive we're talking thousands with an S. okay\nA little piece of free advice folks if you're going to buy a one inch filter\nBy one from your local big box store your age your lowers your home depot wherever it is that you're going through filters nowadays and here's the number one rule the number one rule is to get a filter that you cannot see through\nOkay if you can hold your filter up and you can see your hand on the other side\nNot a good filter okay that's basically is and sister take that out are looking for gold or something take that to the beach with you we call that a rock stopper it's good for a golf balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at filtering your air and\nIt's not going to protect your heating and cooling system and you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive okay\nThat's what the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay come on\nPeople spend some money on a good filter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money\nNow the correct one for you to buy if you're going to get one inch filter is a one inch police raided\nFilter that's P pleaded filter\nLook for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip okay goes up and down and up and down\nAnd it's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big span um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouth your system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and\nIt can cause some damage All right so I buy one that costs between maybe six Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs that are not no look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter starts to look a little dirty it's becoming harder to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor\nAnd the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor\nIt'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat pump your furnace or air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you you will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on\nSome of these five inch filters will fit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive then the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly have your rock stoppers you're saying sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in droves they give you a great return on investment okay\nNow look we've only got a couple of minutes left

have been very leery of granting DNA be cause they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize\nDNA if any of this but ...\nThe media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't\nAny Native American DNA and by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump about her that she wouldn't have to take a test from a little kitten with wandering around you can you can ah do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate\nA future debate and that's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he ... that she wouldn't show up as the Indian if she did do it but you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump\nThat is causing this Trump is literally causing these people lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go insane and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and ... out in the American left and I have\nI have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known

months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about\nThe Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this is going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive\nLandslide and at one point that we're going to take the Senate but then if you look at the reality of voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world\nUsing common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave the trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right and it all started with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten\nDo you remember how many times I reminded you that during the\nFirst six years of Obama you go through the two thousand fourteen midterms\nThe Democrat Party lost over twelve hundred seats\nNationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state

his opposition to them\nA host of reasons or so the little words there's much more to this than what the simple can drive by media is how about you and they're going to simple to the root because they desperate to link Trump to this killing\nTheir desk was only Trump to be sharing responsibility for it uh by by claiming that Trump is is I'm\nJust too loyal to this murderous Saudi regime at the expense of Americans said they knew was working at the Washington\nTrying to construct as they always do set of circumstances designed to make Trump look like an absolute he been in rep rebate and

outrageous I reported on with the trial of abortion doctor Kermit costs now\nHow the woman goes into his money comes out data there is no police report and\nEarlier this week it's a British and that gets BBC One if I'm not mistaken although that could be wrong\nBut it it's a British network and the title it's a six episode one hour per episode mini series called press and it was about to compete in newspapers in the current era in this modern day\nAnd it's amazing\nHow honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there is nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era of generic ... explores the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them\nIs very serious take them to feel very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than the furor trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does\nIt's flat out amazing how honest it is in terms of what people who do journalism think its purposes\nDestroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not\nBut it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously has\nTo be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the concerts breaking the rules there has to be something mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and and and ruin\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never I had a little\nTaste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that had me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to us and people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it it's it's more than that ... it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes rebuilt journalist ... little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy any day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin all it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it I I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars and I've never seen them in and things for\nI don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google any of them but I watched this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ... and I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen honest this is\nOne of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed who is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected\nBy life to him everybody's\nA bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life and the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions\nI'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions and he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because\nThe world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one\nEpisode went to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship it's not clear to me like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began and the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being and Pete if I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in\nIn the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you and I'm ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like and live with it in the private ... I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise] it's just it's quite it's perfect if the kinds of personalities you would have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief that everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter] it's amazing how this is the eyes of a journalist an editor\nNow I imagine real journalists are going to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's it exposes too much uh people have\nNever had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\nThe competing editor of the queen paper or the above board paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirmed the pizza file story while the other paper\nPuts it on the cover of having confirmed it because the editor at the other members doesn't care whether it's true or not whether recalls that got as peta I'll just get it up there and get it on the newsstands whereas the female editor didn't\nHave the guts to run it until the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking they obviously you're not worried about the me too movement here\nPut this thing together so the name of it is ... I have no idea it's it's I think it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them are just competed completed it's um it's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here and if you watch these kinds of things it's gets faster because it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\nIf it's it's bad hit everybody everybody is a rapid rate including the people at the papers the reporters I I have to admit I was so [noise]\nAnyway here's Donna Brazil now I Would I did not lose my place Usama bill hammered a day and they're talking about the blue wave where she thinks we're headed\nAnd remember now this is a woman that used to be one of the head honcho those are the DNC the Democratic party who in her normal countenance would be out there so oh yeah blue wave Democrat's gonna win big it's it's our time people are fed up but that's not how she sounds\nSee how many days in a long time in politics [laughter] I'm not breaking out the champagne and I'm not trying to scramble my eggs before I get my chickens right we still have to improve turnout turnout turnout turnout\nDemocratic victory depends on turnout among millennials want on the millennials voted in the last midterm we also got to make sure that we get a paint way before we can get a blue tie we need these women to when they're wearing says I'm confident not over confident\nYou asked me today what would I Do differently in terms of Democrats our target Latinos I Would talk to millennials\nOkay so why would she do differently she's saying here the Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why is she saying that well because she has the freedom to say it she's not at the moment in the in the hierarchy of the apparatus and it\nTurns out the Latino are far more supportive of Trump
