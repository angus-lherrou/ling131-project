some of the election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday Tom\n... who co founded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle\nSite real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top of it here\nAnd Tom Bevan sat in all of polling data that they had a real clear politics\nAnd analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning\nThe Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race\nReal battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house\nThat they do have an advantage right now\nBecause they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now is anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half states which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project I pick up a twenty five seats twenty five an hour or two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing the generic ballot is not moving and Democrats favor Trump's approval numbers are rising\nOver on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats\nTwo weeks ago they were predicting no change Republicans wouldn't gain or lose any\nTwo weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend and he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban\nAnd misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it then when the polls have to be shown to be correct\nSo they still have

[noise]\nMany Republicans right now in the midst of this political campaigns on a two thousand sixteen midterms how many how many Republicans [noise] because they have the Clinton or Obama on their

don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clintons are done any buddies radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phony collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much change in so much anger why even a mirror here's not cigarette distances to pet it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is uh we'll

by and on this will be that we have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting these bombs in the mail\nYou know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that how this will be owned by the media where do they go about getting the mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYeah that that information is not out there for the masses of pain you know there were never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right away to point fingers of certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrat they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's whoa it ...\nAlong\nThose lines if you want to look at it that way it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\n\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and our history there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever\nBut flip that flip that around would it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat\nIn cocaine and a lunatic to do it because\nThings are not working out the way they thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us\nBut the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember\nThey believe their pollsters if the polls are telling there is a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it\nAnd they start reporting it and it just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nThen the things that are supposed to mend it like that Kavanaugh trick backfires\nAnd these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives so if you flipped this around\nYou've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention there's no way that helps the Democrats and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me ...\n[noise] [noise] and Obama folks Obama said he can't draw crowds he's out there trying to claim credit for this economy wouldn't he wouldn't know how to create in fact the Democrats are the people that have people on
