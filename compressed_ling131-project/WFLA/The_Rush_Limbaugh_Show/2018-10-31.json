the idea that the opposition as far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's that on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed\nIn the perverted view of the American left is white men who created this racist and bigoted unfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the\nUh Lenski days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from the traditions in institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary evidence the primary example or exhibits of their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the\nSteps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration policy\nYou name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and filled of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo ah to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins\nNow it covers much more grounded in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize everybody who is not a white man they're using a victim of allergy\nAnd victimhood in to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be a white men or continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media responsibility\nTo the actions that people can notice how quickly they want to do that\nNotice how quickly on the left the people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always\nThe result of environmental things and so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things I think it's day if you're gonna if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame\nThe people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it that doesn't raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said let's or Monday Night also that he doesn't see\nDemocrats killing people over politics you mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't Republicans in that group looking number a police officer been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters\nAnd look at how many of those cops murders

I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence up everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets and his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea\nOf the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\nAs one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh\nIncendiary things he says why let me ask you some people\nIt's horrible what Trump said about ... why\nIs it why is it that when he gives it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had\nTo disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation was we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know with\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway as a great\nPiece today [noise] speaking of Kevin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the cabin on hearings remember all the Democrats questioning Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls e forward with her allegations of whatever capital I did that led to the fact that Kevin all the spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rapes we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it none of them ever present at any but the media and the\nDemocratic Party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... gets the confirmation vote\nAnd is in sworn in why did the media drop it if Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I would've Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are represented serial rapist where is all it just it's going on is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credit that'll leave all that the post tearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political none for which they were willing to destroy a man\nWhy they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kavanaugh if all of that was legit\nIf if everything Kavanaugh was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice they would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching\nKevin why aren't they doing that there is a big campaign going cameras all of us have been rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office their opinion if Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching capital where are these questions\nThe reason those questions are being asked of the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up\nIt was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every day I'm One of these is none of what they were saying about Kevin always true it was all manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary\nIf balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been\nOne of the first witnesses she would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy made public thing I did I Do here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up your\nRepublicans running for office have you ever been debates left you need to start asking a Democrat opponents\nThey still oppose Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you\nAsk them if they still support Kavanaugh or oppose Kevin ... asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election if this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up\nEither in campaign ads we've got a week it's not to wait to include this in any ad campaign if if

to have you here with us Hi\nThank you so much because when my call I was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because the recession and ... he was becoming mine and I can handle I started writing my own class has caused courses because I couldn't handle how they had revised American history [noise] the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration and if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph\nWhat most people don't understand is when these millions of people came over\nTo Ellis Island we didn't just open our arms and say come on in the way that Democrats want to get him now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship is specially looking at their eyes they take a device him like open up\nThe upper eyelids and if you had a disease called trick karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you are strong and we're not when that\nNo one to ship Dr performed his examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the truck coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam if you were sent back that ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe\nSo they wanted to make sure we did not want any on that could not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong\nYou realize that what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then where am I that's what people are thinking listening to retell the story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work\nUm there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets then I heard the streets were paved with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one page in the streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people that's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it or we will on the whole global everybody not true\nI have a nine year old grandson and I just shudder to think about the kind of history he's going to be learning it's um I don't get on giving him for Christmas one of your books oh wow you know very was because I think that\nWhere's he going to get it he's not going to learn it from his own history books they're all revised they give even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nTry a paragraph to Abraham Lincoln John Silver Boston University at Boston University way back in the nineties did a survey and the most popular high school history textbook and found one paragraph in reference to Abraham Lincoln one paragraph\nThere were pages devoted to Bill Clinton for example in and American history the name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard Zen as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a white guy socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this good but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause of immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program so over Thirty years\nIn one white thank you very much a Ella for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about el as it was it not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process we were much newer and younger country boom and we had an entirely different attitudes about\nImmigration and growth\nAnd it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents or or design\nBut more importantly the immigrants who were allowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America it wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort\nAt noon lightning tomorrow night at\nSix and I tell you when LA all home most likely\n[noise] is making notes you remind me

like what Trump is doing with suggesting that we need to uh and birthright citizenship claiming the fourteenth amendment ...\nIt's not say that you have everybody in the world out there disagreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump has done that that's what's conservatism was as a form of movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but\nIn mid term elections I can I can show your countless in two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody for casting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house\nIn those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something odd um he predicted was off by two but nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because of so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened\nYou should've seen and if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it just totally came out of their sales in two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody did Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives because everybody hated Bush Bush was not duly elected Bush stole the election and the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court\nAnd Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way\nAnd what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was Don ... that drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen they ended up being surprised the brightest minds in grave this go rose\nThe most heralded analysts and it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does\nI have

on\nCertain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch the twenty eight ten men germs are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find only know who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is and how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty to two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred and ten Democratic majority\nBut this is here splitting to a certain degree\nOkay so here he says in the second paragraph\nIt's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five states are Republicans with two hundred and ten next paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that data the Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller\nHere are some things that shouldn't bother any sober mind that the elections analyst\nIn the final week of the election why we just concluded\nHere that the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats in the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any bird because the truth is we don't know those are my words not just ... days [noise]\nHis words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers this\nAdds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait here's are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on this trend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you here's Beth gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... do you can think of where it might their talent that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear how about your weight all of this in the current cycle well then how did you get to to twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this\n[laughter] but that's just me into being smart alec\nAh in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia ... possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggest\nBut what about the nineteenth representative John Faso is up by appointment the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that suggest some very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIs it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\n[noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things\n[noise] and then the next burger about how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke\nChallenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a outer Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead in the generic ballot which asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress not normally this would be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win\nSuddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning how 'bout liable aren't on this thing and then the next ... are we're relying too much on one pollsters out that's a pretty straightforward concern and then the next ... what is it\nEarly voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's just simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately\nThey can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over we're not counting votes so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election is over\nBut yet we're still going to talk about it [noise]\nSo the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats\n[noise] which renders every poll prior to this day ...\nMore and more Americans are succinctly aware of the unfairness the imbalance and the other way be unbiased if if that's true if a number of these things are true then there couldn't very well be a major surprise\nAnd shock in store for the media and the Democrats on election day too\n'cause it's a parent now they think they've got this in the bag [noise]\nWay you want me to no\nRadios
