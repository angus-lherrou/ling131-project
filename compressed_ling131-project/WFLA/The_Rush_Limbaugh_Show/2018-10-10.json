this\nAnd as far as the media is concerned as an opportunity to federal response won't be any good and so they can call this Trump's Katrina don't get mad at me for talking about this because I'm telling you right now is exactly how assignment editors and producers threw out the drive by media are looking at this\nThey're looking at this as a potential political event that they're hoping might be somewhat helpful to them in the mid term elections that are only three weeks away\nThere is a heated governor's race in Florida mayor of Tallahassee Andrew Gillum running against Ron this and this and then Rick Scott the current governor is running for the Senate against the incumbent Bill Nelson so there's a lot politically at stake here you can't deny that folks\nAnd you can't you cannot ignore\nThe way the media is preparing a bunch of different scenarios to report on this um it's\nIt's got the global warming component that's number one as a category four hundred and fifty miles an

Hillary Clinton\nWent out the other day in an interview with Christian among poor and pretty much admitted everything I had been trying to warn people love about the American left and the Democratic party she went out there and in her best Maxine Waters impersonation was encouraging people to be an civil\nAnd she was saying that it was justified being on civil given the opposition\nThe Republicans and if they win the house then they can go back to being civil if they win the Senate then they can return to civility\nI mean they're making that case they're proving the point and there

Democrats attempt to distance himself or herself or the party from it I haven't heard one\nElected Democrats suggest to these ... protesters to dial it back I haven't heard one they're all encouraging it my point is this is who they\nAll are and what Hillary Clinton now advocating this incivility what did I tell you yesterday were not in the battle of ideas anymore\nWe're not in an argument over ideas they don't they don't they're not even looking at any of this is about ideas\n\nThey see America today as flawed and illegitimate and therefore in need of a new set of defining values that will serve to unify the people who want to be part of American not\nAnything to do with our founding not the constitution not the declaration that's out the window because all that's tainted all of that was written by a bunch of privileged white guys who were setting up a system for themselves and their families\nAnd their descendants and they didn't care about minorities and they didn't care about

you can put a bag of nowhere in a bag out there and I wouldn't know the difference in Taylor Swift\nNow a story is Taylor Swift lead American music awards hit all time\nLow in ratings well how the hell can that be if she is generating massive record voter registration and then a host the television show an all time low record ratings don't as I don't have one thing or another but Taylor Swift I

know for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world than three weeks\nI'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this is in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named Brent Butowsky\nWho sounds like the captain of a bowling team ... says he thinks this guy was a legislative aide who who do you think\nThis guy worked for the lord benefit a a former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that lord Benson right okay [noise]\nWell whether he did or not he still writes pieces for the for the whole dot com Butowsky code red alert to Democrats what\nAre the Democrats were smoking I bought the Democrats are going to win everything like the he'll dot\nCom had a story yesterday I mean it looked like two hundred nine seats are going to convert to the Democratic party\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama and one of the most popular respected public figures in America shouldn't spend the day taping personal endorsements for democratic candidates for the house and Senate\nThis column is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way\nThis column is a code red alert to Democrats in a call to arms are the most popular in respect to the Democrats in America such as Michelle my bell Obama to\nLead the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is a twenty five percent chance of Democrats and the mid term as well the nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare why don't you guys had it all locked up I thought you're pretty much had the house\nAlready done mostly is already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on Trump or verse\nMyself now there's a twenty five percent chance that Democrats\nAnd the midterms in a nightmare scenario\nThat's that's not quite the same\nAs a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night\n... ... ... why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves\nIt's a moment for Bolden maximum action and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in danger says it's possible the Democrats win the house by a significant number of seats\nHow ever it is also possible the Democrats again only ... seats falling short of winning control that would leave the Republican dominant\nWith a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser is in the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members\nDemocrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing Republican Senate does even further to the right and even more partisan than the GOP majority that day\n... says it's a ... in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and triumphant\nTrump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and don't you love [noise] [noise]\nYou people on the left don't understand unity when you see it you don't understand love when you see it you would do not understand confidence when you see it you'll see love\nYou see hatred UC excitement you think you'll see fear when you see\nThousands and thousands and thousands trying to get into Trump rallies use some house the division\n\nOf vindictive and triumphant Trump will stand along side Republican leaders of the new Congress feeling he's achieved unstoppable dominance over his party our country in every branch of government with all checks and balances destroyed\nMy point is like\nYou can do not fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and then there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats\nIn their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they really believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be dispiriting hand or depressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ...\nUp turnout ... up interest\nAnd they're really ... and ticked off at a bunch of polling data\nThere is an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News poll a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women\nAre saying in polling data that they have ... new interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote this is not what we're supposed\nTo happen that's why all of these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white conservative suburban\nWomen and do we need them or not and we don't\nThey say so this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand six soon as you remember any pieces before the presidential race\nAnywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here were drunk and when you got a diamond back we've got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none\nThey were so solid sure they were definitely of a a convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\nI mean they had Trump's chances at three percent seven percent ten percent\nBut nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was going to win drunk never even wanting to when Trump was the most surprising guy an election in the world when he won he didn't want to win and they were all the press the Trump quarters that's what they wanted you to believe\n\nNow they've started out saying the same thing is though power is a birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power every American realizes the mistake of voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed\nWants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others\nWho are raising red flags out there that this might not be developing\nAs they wish also\nFrom Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said yesterday that the ... are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to the midterms\nThis is the Trump administration's latest warning that the ... or attempting to sway American opinion a head of the elections\nOf a ... watt swim [noise]\nChai comes want the Democrats to win right why do you think

that when you do for being branded\nIt's an election since Nineteen thirty two now when you look at it that way you can understand why in the Democratic party circle there's hatred for white people white people white women\nHad been rejecting them white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left as as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three through Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not does eat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell Nineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course went to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable\nWay\nAnd that wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries the Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing white women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here\nTo Christian I'm On four of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies\nWhat they have to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nWas change America so\nBack to Hillary she said what was done last night and the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh what\nWas done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly Christiana unimportant it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking at\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton and the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you've heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people\nBut stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal the steak\nEvery liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture to log on to reality today is because Democrat activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce\nDecisions roe versus Wade is the most certainly example of this but there are countless others\nThe simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning legislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them\nThat's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional guy\nThe ass not by you\nIn fact the Hillary Clinton and people like her the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state of college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America\nIs to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Chris you're on on on for listening to one another working on our differences but that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now\nWhen the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland and here we go off to the races again miss characterizing that\nBlue in the face\nThat's what Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies\nThat happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them\nAs they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it's it's a time for instability in is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton that that Republican baseball practice\nCannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stab docks\nBeaten run out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urged Democrats to be even more uncivil what an irresponsible statements\nEvery Democrats just announced they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage written by applauded they support it that is who they are\nThis is the party by the way that has been railing against\nAll this and civility for I don't know how long this is why\nLook at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side\nWith what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it I Know what happens but it's it's a mystery to me my hope is my faith is that this incivility this insanity\nDinner and I'm Steve ... job story in one thirty hurricane my close still a strong category for hurricane with one hundred and fifty mile hour top Chastain

you may think that and I'm not going to try to just abuse you of it but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump ... seem to have any real interest since he doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about\nHim he does this for a host of reasons but most importantly\nI Believe Donald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job is doing and he wants people to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor as of information in this country do not\nConvey\nProper information about him is his only smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have

of al ... and ... [noise] hey my point is a today\nA with Hillary's comments it or by liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote I came across ... years ago and maybe even you set a but here's the quote a society is either moving toward the village the Fort barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism I just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a society barbarism or civilly were trending one way or not in the middle exhort eater trending towards the middle of the barbarism\nOff the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order a restoring it and\nIt seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa\nViolence shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all gotten fine and dandy one more day then\nI think it was before the Nineteen forties\nAnd know what ... what not when what why are they what were they like when the Democrats weren't the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what they want but they're doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic uh\nWas a labor laws and um when\nYeah but what purpose\nMy point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point\nThe Democratic party has always been rooted in the modern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in an anti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government\nThey've just now a band in any pre chance of moderation about that\nAnd have gone all in\nOn militant and violent socialism to achieve their means my boy they're not\nThat different there just mass getting less today\nHere in you know read about it in the paper tomorrow Raj Shah Mickey\nI be met word I happened to you when you add ballet one or two point nine\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he's diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier from medical insurance tremendous share where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it with a ... year\nIt's so worth looking into there's a reason this is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nHave five five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B.

Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh out of eagerness to show a pattern\nOf such behavior mayor told Elle magazine her recollection of the Thomas hearings says J yeah so\nHaving watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps establish who's telling the truth when there's a standoff there wasn't a pattern this is amazing she ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless in my attempt to explain this the first story that was run about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it\nThe New York times found it so bad that they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it and so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run\nA second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior when Kavanaugh up pattern a beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation\nBe it from all the Ford or be it for Ramirez or from Amman ... client was her name swept Nick I mean this is a flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story\nWell didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it\nYeah we needed to show a pattern here is that Krista Smith of Ohio your next I'm Glad you waited high\nHigh right very very close to talk to him thank you um so\nWas just wondering I was concerned and mine to get your thought you mentioned that's a little bit yesterday but with my role as it is and with Hillary claiming that they're hurting neatness civility right now I'm\nI just get worried when the mom and they left in the act in it\nAnd then fattening or if they begin to help people um it just hadn't have worried about provoking violence um you know to the point where we don't do anything and Chong fire but come stickers and our yard", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "10"}
