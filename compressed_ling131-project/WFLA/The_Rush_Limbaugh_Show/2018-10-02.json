to go back I Need to find Sheldon White parent is number not\nSheldon Whitehouse this guy's money this is a Democrat who on friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it\nAnd the date in ... he figured this could be the date where the incident Dr foreign described happened and he is thought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward Kavanaugh\nSo on good morning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talk English Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied and we don't know how all the details yet clearly if they have been given free rein to interview marvel they want so that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here at a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to ah get this done by friday if they really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we grab audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle

Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth just yesterday\nNBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates to get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying about cabinet shop perjuring yourself and that means he's not qualified what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape is actually froze ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk and now\nHe's a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer yeah are they friday night yeah there's not too many people to talk to hear that guy's got a lot of corn or we can get this done\nThat's just to central maybe White Houses out their truck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target where they can catch Kavanaugh in anything\nUh there's one more that I Want to play and I'm looking forward and I just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve\n[noise] the question of who leak Dr Ford's letter to Dianne Feinstein you know this this is of leaking this\nLetter my memory on this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the foreigners to the gym judicial committed I remember her showing the letter holding it up or talking about it\nI remember I don't know if that was the week but she\nClearly talked about it and said that she had it since July\nAnd that\nShe told us all about it that whoever Senate didn't want to be named
