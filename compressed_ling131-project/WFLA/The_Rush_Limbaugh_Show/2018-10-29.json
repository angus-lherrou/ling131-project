for which force opposing witnesses can't even placed themselves at the place because the victim doesn't aware it happened doesn't know when it happened but it becomes real and we've got to destroy somebody's life we have to destroy somebody's career we've got and Kevin is supposed to sit\nBack and just take it he's just see those are the old rules in Washington\nPeople under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it\nAnd that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not a Donald Trump visit wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told to tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts that are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're going to have

then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined\nAnd he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him so\nTrump ... do not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to what they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh where this your first ... thank you for calling hello\nHey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nI to tell you that last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down eight to one\nNow the thing that happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented\nAnd then you have but mayor do could do was very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that in an armed guard would not stop it's what we need is more gun control I mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control not answer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you are but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount\nOf shooting whatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is and it's important but it's not really about guns it's\nAbout something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except and he spoke of the above above it all for freedom as we define that he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with um [noise] Trump himself that says this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews it used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint base business\nWell it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by to unify them all in court and joint base\nWhere multiple services are on the same place and so that's that's where air force one is parked at Fort Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter\nSaid Mr President do you think you need to revisit\nDoes seem so a guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill and the first\nQuestion and drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws\n[noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that\nIn all the other things an anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focus on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise and on and tell you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here\nStarted writing bad checks for merchandise\nYou Joe up a day later to return the same stuff asking for the returned amount in cash or you do that enough times you can be holding sixty thousand dollars or so and cash that's how much money this particular identity of the head when the police caught up with it\nThe worst\nPart is that the rightful owners of those names never had a clue who he was they never had a

may have excuses you know we can look the other way\nNot exaggerating on that\nBut the point still remains that Obama was chummy with Farrakhan and Al Sharpton and the Reverend Jackson are as well and

for those who were killed in the worst shooting massacre of Jews in the U.S was a service of remembrance of the temple of manual enlightened Randall fewer Kelly news channel aid you attended the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh and one time\nI you know last time I went to it and the guy with an EMT court service and in New Orleans and I and a rabbi held that Al Gore's inconvenient truth and and started to preach on that and I and I just\nI couldn't take it anymore you know it it's not even my religion and\nWorry that limited by what was that rabbi conditioning what was he was he suggesting that the congregation as Jews had to sign on to the Al Gore climate change premise that that was part of\nNot not the Jewish faith but then if you didn't describe George ... maybe you wouldn't be welcome\nI don't think the way that he he when he was a fostering an atmosphere where he wouldn't be welcomed but I I think you know\nIt's just the pilot association of everything right that wouldn't have happened in the entire time I grew\nAt a time I ... and maybe it's because I I mainly grow up and military synagogues my dad was in the air force that there was never politics never came current events said not politics\nLet me ask you this is it's not like me ask you this ... I'm I'm In your opinion and you said you've got some experience with the Hollywood types in Europe parents that opinion can liberal Druze be anti Semitic when it comes to it when it comes to Israel\nThey when they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they they they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but couldn't put it I said that they were I mean because what I\nSay that yes he has a lot of a lot of a lot of them also tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think as a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThird willing they're willing to claim the victim had nothing else [noise] [laughter]\nWell one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do\nNot understand how a liberal Jew is like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThis it it it it it's it's a Jewish state\nAnd yet there's there's so much anti Israeli\nSentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and don't quite understand it\n'cause it's a ... because it's anti that religion is not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's it is it really isn't any type of religion yeah\nBecause you can't separate the Jewish state from the religion I don't think you can and it's you know any any time you're Jewish and you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with\nLiberal and Israel comes out no way that I said this flame or I'm Jewish\nBut I totally disagree with everything is real feeling that ... that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics is associated with with Israel is a book because if they're inside the religion\nThat's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheist I mean you see that they're anti Christian Tito um I don't see them as necessarily being\nSeeing Islam but I mean you know but I think it's the it's a it's like why\nIs it that's exactly right and this is wearing Mrs all headed this is all headed towards atheism an anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is toward atheism and no God or at least agnostics those little because that removes image judgmental isn't right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there is no ultimate\nPower that can meet out approve or disapprove of one's accidental one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so how\nThis of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say that you are\nThere's all the liberalism to creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it it's rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so\nThis event in Pittsburgh that it does it add to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\nI mean it doesn't and I I don't I don't\nFeel like that there's a million people out there targeting a Jews in a way that they would want to go shoot up a thing that I think that this is these are isolated is an incident in this country because the country it's\nSo good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe as a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish\nI and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the ... or anything silly like that\nI Am glad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people think and they were predominantly ... thank you thank you so much a re July presents racial Thousand Oaks California [noise] um\n[noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do a lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what you you think I'm wrong or you\nYeah I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after Caesar say a dare I say this year I put\nMy hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipe bombs none of them went to explode it what do you think the odds are to the drive by and the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember even Trump alluded\nTo the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that OK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat and then the second event happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people to politicize everything and that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who\nIrrationally try to explain things away but the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\n\nTo be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have I have a tire early different which is why I did the show open\nToday but I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday shows yesterday with is the attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nEnd of the public domain hoping to influence people do abandon Trump and it has been happens to these two events come along and they but ah this is that this has to be what it is their thinking\nAnd they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the

compassionate people in the tolerant people in their side has no hate and their side as no bigotry and so forth [noise]\nWhen it's the exact opposite so here we have NBC if Americans are fed up and made it they'll vote against Trump with a GOP that's a story about the synagogue [noise]\nABC Trump at the center of all the political violence right now something they cannot be\nEstablish something that cannot be proven but yet there is reported as fact\nGleefully I might add\nSo now we have a a a tweet from Max Boot [noise] [noise] you know I\nDon't know what happened to Max Boot Max Boot used to be a columnist and reporter for the wall Street Journal is the the international\nPolitical expert\nAt what have you and I used to think of the guy as a conservative being a journal opinion writer and he would occasionally send me his pieces in advance\nThinking I Would enjoy them but ever since Trump was elected he has gone off the reservation I'm going to the point that a lot of ... ... people asking what what what happened to Max Boot [noise]\nAnd now he's on CNN is often easy as he can get on there just ripping Trump a new one who primarily from the standpoint that Trump's manners and his behavior and his ah\nCome Portman just isn't present control and you know the usual complaint from the\nEstablishment grad so he tweets out\nThere is partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum but know left wing outlets\nPropagate extremism as successfully are widely as conservative media do conservatives are being brainwashed and an echo chamber form rumor and conspiracy theory\n\nThis tweet is then replied to by John Harwood a former New York times Wall Street journal reporter now at CNBC who has never been anything other than and Wilbur ultra left his\nHeart was says Max Boot is one hundred percent correct most important extremism on the right has gotten back into the entire movement and the G O P White House\nCongress Fox Limbaugh Breitbart the pack [noise]\nI maintain view as I said in my opening monologue in the program today\nThat we get up every day and we see people and institutions that we admire and respect under attack I mean\nEvery day the left is politicizing everything including mass murder\nWherever it happens they are politicizing the whether\nRepublicans have been called murderers by the Democratic party ad willing accomplices in the media Mr boats simply because we don't believe in the man made climate change folks\n[noise]\nMurderers Republicans have been called murderers for not supporting Obama's takeover of the American health care\nIndustry for the purposes of putting it under the auspices of government for the purposes of controlling the way people live\n[noise] [noise] ah\nPartisanship on both sides but know left wing outlets propagate extremism and a successful lawyer why\nThe mainstream media is extremism if you ask me that's what they've become daily media\nReporting has become extremism it certainly isn't factual it certainly has an investment in the outcome of events and somehow we conservatives\nIn the media are far more successful\nIn propagating extremism and are you in this audience are being brainwashed in an echo chamber by rumor and conspiracy theory\n[noise]\nWhich takes me to President Trump President Trump tweeted and I'm also mentioned in the first hour that Trump was elected to behave differently\n[noise] he was elected precisely because he is cut from a different cloth these people have never [laughter] look\nIt's kinda understand a little one sense I mean the guy goes down the elevator and talks about these hordes of illegal immigrants containing a people who are murderers and rapists and you just don't talk about them that way I mean nobody's supposed to talk about him that way but Trump did\nAnd so they all start laughing I think this guy can't be serious he is not gonna last this campaign two weeks\nAnd then the first poll came out and they saw Trump bleeding and this\nGuy is not going to last this craziness Trump\nTapped slowly but surely eliminating all of the other Republicans in the primary and all of them had this preferable a laid back a walk all over me attitude toward the left and Democrats that you want\nTrump kept eliminating them one by one by one with catchy nicknames and so forth\nAnd they thought this is to sift it can't happen these camps that you're never going to survive in the Access Hollywood video convey thought that was it was over and nobody can survive but\nTrump survived and then they started the two years silence cool and that is the real reason for all of the suspicion about those of you on the left I'm going to tell you something Mr boat there is nothing that I\nOr anybody else I Know in conservative media couldn't do that even approach is what the Obama FBI department of justice and intelligence community did and is doing\nIn corrupting\nThe highest levels of our government for the express purpose of overturning an election I don't care how much power I think I've got I couldn't come close to doing what was done and has been done the past two years\nIncluding the Mueller investigation including the planning of out right lives five times a day in media all over the country from anonymous people alleging that it was only a matter of time before proof that Trump pen colluded with Russia to steal the election for two years Mr boot\nFor two years with no evidence and everybody in on it knew there was no evidence everybody in on this know that there had not been any collusion they were hoping\n\nThey were hoping and they live with every day with the idea they're going to wake up and that the smoking gun was going to fall into their lap but they knew\nThat there wasn't any collusion they knew they were trying to create some they knew what was going on\nThe FBI the OJ they knew the tricks being played and they willingly supported\nThose tricks they ignored the real collusion and rigging of elections on the part of a Hillary Clinton campaign the DNC I don't care what kind of power use think we've got over here and conservative\nMedia but we couldn't get anywhere I mean we couldn't we couldn't come close\nTo getting away with running any kind of a soft or a silent coup\nUsing the upper reaches of power at the department of justice\nAll Obama loyalists and Hillary loyalists\nWe no way we wouldn't have the power to plant spies in that campaign of a presidential campaign we opposed\nThere is no way any of us could write up a phony document purported to be real intelligence claiming that Hillary didn't despicable things on a bad in Moscow and go get a fire so warrant to spy on the Hillary can't there's no way\nAny of us in the in the conservative media

believe\nI'm not going to believe just because I'm told that something happened the way it did\nAnd that's a shame it's a shame that the highest levels of our government have gotten to the point where
