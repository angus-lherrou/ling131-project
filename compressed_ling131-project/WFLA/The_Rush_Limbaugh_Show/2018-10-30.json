promise to build a wall to get a handle on illegal immigration\nAnd to stop it because of its for ever changing consequences to this country\nBut primarily with Trump is a law and order issue as it is with all the rest of us it's simply a law and order issue we have laws defining legal and illegal immigration we have a political party that is pushing illegal immigration\nAnd actually both parties have to the extent of promoting programs that have amnesty involved for all of them in both parties have different reasons for supporting in the meantime\nThe very definition of what America is and

not citizens so Congress got into gear and pass the fourteenth amendment it guaranteed that freed slaves would\nHave all the privileges of citizenship by providing quote all persons born or naturalized\nIn the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states added up a state where he may resign which means the draft or is it the fourteenth amendment had no intention of conferring citizenship I'm the children of aliens who happened to be born here in fact\nThe very author of the citizenship clause senator Jake I'm Howard of Michigan\nExpressly said this is why the original intent of founding documents is so important quote this\nMeaning the fourteenth amendment this will not of course include person who was born in the United states who are foreigners who are aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers\nIt was expressly intended to confer citizenship to slaves and their descendants\nThere was an Eighteen eighty four case elk versus Wilkins Supreme Court ruled the fourteenth amendment did not even couldn't for citizenship on Native Americans\nBecause they were subject to the tribal jurisdiction not us

I I have at times I marveled that this country is held together the way it has\nFor as many years as it has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper in the U.S constitution\nThe honor system and the ... the respect for that document is what's held us together and all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who wanted it literally rip it up throw it away\nAnd establishes on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept election results for whatever reason\nIt make it up well it was stolen the Russians this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept it means that there really isn't any unity\nAround the premise of our country and we may not unify issue to issue the issue but we always have been unified about the premise of America\nAs founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind a profoundly dangerous and we are raising him haven't been since the seventies\nGeneration after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing in common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've we've ... you go back to the days\nWhen we learned that I'm a ... in\nJunior high intramural football in softball that nobody won that there were no outs in a baseball just you know no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until they hit the ball put it in play\nThere were no losers there were no winners outcome based education two plus two was five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart and scoring a slow them down\nWe're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we've not gotten to this point where kids have been raised\nCobbled they had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derive from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been teaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In\nIt and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child like snowflake behavior on college campuses and we have a political party that's behind all of\nThis right now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results of an election\nThat is on going and now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened if not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand who Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise]\nUh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump presidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I think\nReasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are\nAnd it's\nA large explanation of why they're behaving as they\nAs they do and\nIt's ... refusal to accept is not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy I don't feel good when they feel bad then something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n\nSo look at some headlines Tom ... Facebook ad comparing Trump to Saddam Hussein this is from what I'm calling the news civility and let's tone it down stack\nThe Democrats and the left and the dry buys are telling everybody and we need to tone it down they told Trump you need to tone down their rhetoric dude you're causing all these people engage in violence Trump said I thought I had gone to down if you need me to turn it back up I Will they went bonkers\nSo here comes the left wing billionaire Tom style or\nWho is one of his environmentalist wackos\nWho hopes to make a killing him this this fraudulent hoax of man made climate change\nDire is running a Facebook ad campaign comparing Trump to Saddam Hussein\nThe ad features a three minute long video that accuses the president of following it dictator's playbook modeled by tyrants like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Kim Jong only in North Korea as well as Saddam Hussein ... describes Trump as a malignant narcissistic\nAnd claims he is perpetuating systemic\nMassage any\nVideo claims that Trump's support for a border wall and attacks on the media make him comparable that dictators\n\nDictators not attacked the media they own the media\nDictators don't spend their time ripping the media because they are the media\nTrump visited dictator [noise] not even close to it\nSeems like only yesterday Vanessa drive buys her blasting Trump for tweeting that dire comes off as a craze stumbling woman [laughter] yet here he is Washington Post yesterday Trump mocks Democrat mega donor Thomas dire\nThe target of a pipe bomb and stumbling lunatic and now here comes Tom's dire bumbling along like a lunatic comparing Trump Trump to a bunch of tyrants\nJeff Flake said yesterday but it's on the line between Trump will\nChange his rhetoric but elected official should call him out and his supporters as being out of bounds you elected officials\nThey'll continue to appear what the president and rallies where lock her up chants are encouraged in routine and phrases like the president is using I Can't imagine as an elected official attending a rally like that and not stand up afterwards or many for him to say don't\nDo this don't do this\nLake was on an Arizona NPR station on Monday saying elected officials and got to abandon Trump\nBill Nelson running for the Senate in Florida compares\nUs political climate to Rwanda before the genocide there was a place gets so tribal that the two tribes won't have anything to do with each other that jealousy turns into hate said Nelson\nWe saw what happened to the Hutus and the Tutsis in Rwanda it turned into a genocide a million people hacked to death within a few months we've got to watch what's happening here well we've got to give him his due senator Nelson those Democrats best I guess is concerned should be taken seriously you may know\nArmed security officer many years ago no\nNo I'm I'm a cancer you need to renounce Trump you need to renounce your support for Trump that's what they're trying to get you to do don't do it that's what they're trying to get you to do\n[noise] way you want me to know\nRadios nine seven WFL a good afternoon and I'm\nSteve all our jobs during one thirty democratic candidate for governor Andrew Gillum says President Trump needs to speak out about tragic events like the deadly Senegal shooting in Pittsburgh Gail I'm appearing on Comedy Central's the Daily Show with Trevor Noah\nWhether the president has a skill to do it or not [noise] um that's what he should do that's what we expect the president of the United states tried able to lean into the nation\nTo it but also to give list\nYou know for the rest of us\nYou know on campaigning in the bay area today and I mean for the Democratic party says Yellen will be joined by former President Obama and your mission and Bill Nelson prayer rally the ice ... film studio in Miami Friday President Trump will be in Fort Myers tomorrow campaign for Florida Republican candidate\nOne dead in St Pete the stories next after this traffic update from page Herrera from\nThe train traffic center power life Burgess eating an area east on the East Bay drive is open now between striking and ... problem someone Tampa heading north on tell me very just north of runners avenue and Humphrey street is awesome Florida Avenue at fears\nIt supported sponsored by the ... foundation which is march ... foundation music promise for a cure to learn more visit teach him I tell us out or at ... dot org page current news ready and I'm Seventy W.

mass ill education that's taking place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens\nI've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night they deem sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restrictive the blacks that essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes\nSo then Congress said okay you want to play that game then we're going to formally recognize former slaves of citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that they do sweat coach were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the Fourth Amendment was represented by the name of John Bingham from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that\nIn a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth so all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he will be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he shouldn't do this and that's his point people have looked into this\nMay have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who are involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent\nThe fourteenth amendment was never intended to confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents it was expressly written looking first citizenship on slams\nAnd now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration and you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean ... there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen and they they settled in uh in neighborhoods are Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians is that\nYou know but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western\nCivilization that's what's different now there is no interest in that we don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're ...\nIf they use this term tribal but we're more organizing our population because modern arrivals don't all sneak to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it\nThen for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this will be reestablishing the constitution or re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that\nSo two calls to great points that the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been\nBlamed for the synagogue surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we are going to come together and we got to do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being set up that's\nBeing said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you rush and thanks for all that you do for us yes you're bad ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up\nBut maybe maybe a few of them are but this whole thing is\nPolitical this is a political movement these people\nAre being paid somehow I'm In somebody's paying for all of this to happen\nUm\nThere are plenty of places to be the only place they can go to the United states that can't stop and get asylum in Mexico or some of these other countries\nUm well I I agree with you that if the rest of the world was more like the United states everybody would be better off if the unequal distribution of capitalism could be dealt with and then we had a far greater distribution of capitals that would be fine and dandy but the Arab man\nI don't think the solution to this is enterprise zones and it was all about door or Guatemala uh maybe long term economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but\nThere isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another and this is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's ...\n[noise] we're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies going to relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\nBecause that's these people aren't capable being hired anywhere yet\nBut I understand that if you want to talk of political theory and economic theory it makes all sense in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a short term political movement here this caravan [noise]\nI look no either George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind but somebody is and their\nPurpose is to destabilize the United states the purpose is not to improve life from these people this caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives\nBetter this is being done to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party which wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in
