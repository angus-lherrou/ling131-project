Clearwater\nI'm John the question our top story at twelve noon a double murder in Tampa with a man who call to tell the cops about it now accused of killing so we received the nine one one call from a male caller who advised said he was involved in a ...\nMuch as the Washington establishment would like to deny it much as they would like to change it it is still the issue that keeps Donald Trump in the forefront of his supporters mines so I've been studying the media to try to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay the even if it's just sixty percent of their time on the show again they're not focusing on the care of him that tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be covering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street of views with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America and that may yet happen down the road but CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's let ... wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now and there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms at the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure [noise] that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electorate hasn't happened yet everybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think it'll put sort of things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm of\nWhat's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs to stop and Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming not on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff\nTalk about sending the military now and they're talking about sending a National Guard but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump with their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border\nAnd how Trump did an all white the narrative and didn't want to last so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this despite everything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans at look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in as elected still\nThere are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared that when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do with anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one the issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters begin to\nI don't no doubt\nIs the right where would they would be my elite disappointing particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some\nRepublicans are behind this than the there's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many two\nThousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance and Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day\nJust decided to start walking to the United states two thousand miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role\nIn transportation but there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so\nYou've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden it aside all of a sudden 'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly think but I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams of what would the environmental wackos thinking about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they got maps in San Francisco for tourists can blame the piles of human the fate [noise]\n[noise]\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing to begin or just hit the southern border may go they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how many miles\nA day you can walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next day\nBut people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\n\nA hundred days for those every unreal Linda that's over for three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nThe polls open on mid term election day\nWhen you want me to know\nRadios nine seven WFL a\nI'm John the question our top story at twelve thirty domestic violence becomes a double murder in

president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nPolitical world it's so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best\nAre being driven solely by emotion govern slowly by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense\nAnd because there's some odd Kirk that's happened in our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life\nAnd having a mess the bunch of experiences there is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever we may as well not have a border if this is something\nThat people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and said to the world come on in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped\nIf it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement\nTo the United states taxpayers back pocket what the Democratic Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe

you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOutward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned about this ... saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop and invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can use the military because a positive comments out is look\nThat normally prevent some military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you know you you you he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis is it ... what is one of seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way for the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms\nOf it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening\nI'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God I was trying to get in an invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because\nOf the optics I don't care if you're militarized border that if they bomb rushed the border like it down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or tear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but\nHe needs to do is call a a house and Senate back in the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean I think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacle that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people are planned this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own she leaves to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer

he raised in a quarter except there's a problem and that is it Ted Cruz has been creeping ahead in even the polling data and it's it's being acknowledged by the Democrats that that it is real\nAnd yet they have continued to maintain that Beto O'Rourke gonna be the guy and it can take a Ted Cruz has anybody found a hundred thousand people trying to get into a Beto O'Rourke\nEvent you have\nA venue that whole Seventeen thousand people you have anywhere between Seventy five thousand in a hundred thousand people to want to get in\nThat is not the kind of thing that happens with in a political party that is losing losing favor losing support losing elections every where Trump goes these rallies\nYou know I had a post this Rush Limbaugh dot com I have some friends are out in the in the Phoenix area and that the Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona they thought about going through it until they got there and found out how impossible it would be\nThey sent me a video that they took what their iPhone tennis max\nDriving along the entire line in order to make the video fit to be in a size they can email it to me they had to run it at twice normal speed and it's still thirty five seconds long it never ends and then there's a note\nThis is that this doesn't even\nShow that people ... through the parking lots to get in\nThere was a mile long line of people to get into the Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies the media is not telling you how many people want to get in\nAre trying to get in and how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did local media may I don't know\nNational media CNN MSNBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did it would put the lie to the notion of all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere\nNear these kinds of rallies nice ... these kinds of people what the Democrats are doing is continuing to show up where Republicans are having dinner and harassed\n\nThe turtle and his wife are at a restaurant Louisville, Kentucky and some mad cap\nAsinine\nProtester shows up and just start shouting things a turtle just sits there doesn't acknowledge him doesn't move doesn't say anything the other\nPatrons in the restaurant or just watching all this go by this guy is making a spectacle and I watched him talk about this on Fox today and they were talking about such a shame that we lost a little to you and so forth\nAnd this isn't this isn't about civility\nThis is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave and I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against the on the Democratic side whatever you want to call a\nLack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning it's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes\nPositive outlook these are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\n... the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\n\nThis the number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump rally is ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures of the media is happy to show your those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture seven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people\nMultiply that times can that's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\n\nI Wish they'd use AT and T. stadium it's Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play with a hundred thousand people in there\n\nSo you think the Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have march jumped through Mexico mad walk out your most people are really and we're supposed to sympathize with it\nThey don't show you the thousands upon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance\nNow available in stores everywhere and

back to the phones we go\nTo a certain Wilton and Macon Georgia great to have you with us on an E R B network I think for me on Russia appreciate you about well it's great to have you here\nLike the reason why I called I spent a lot of years military are retired from the older we are very good a lot of things we are not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one saying throughout the years we not be good at so this situation that look I'm One hundred percent for putting the military at all the board but this one is perilous and we have to be careful\nWell when when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about\n... this is not a military invasion and talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people that are largely are going to be thought of is starving or steep poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife well my God let us\nIn the military is not used the standing up to people like that certainly not inflict thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to locality we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we are the individual you're sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nOkay what about this what about just the president's here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not\nCross okay what happens then if they do and are\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWhere you don't you know like you you don't use bullet you use ah one of the dummy is called I forgot about the use use some kind of force but not lethal\nYou only have ... thanks you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal like a pig and then it so we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president would be tremendous\nBut the president would be okay so there's ... ... you think the military showing up is\nLet me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a lose lose proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take your next step because the next step is not what they're good at they are not used to it I don't know how to do it\nThat that's the ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWell then what is it what's the preparation for you to have to be prepared to use deadly force like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time on my bed may it may sound\nInsensitive don't mean that they hold the line I hold the line\nProvide a visual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line it probably would push you would or talking about members of the the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got hit that it would storm that caused the mob the rain storm the military just in and and and it it essentially stormed the bullet storm ... you'd think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they are met with equal strength and we just have to\nBut even if there is a casually or to the drive by their story Trump Jerry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd they're still peril yeah\nOkay so the alternative is still a lot of men\nNo no I have to hold a lot it and like I said somebody you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the chain of their political legalized asleep it's unfortunate but this is what they what they take it all by taking there's just\nYour own okay right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you think the media is going to allow that that this is um [noise] a left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it we've got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh making radio rain again you're listening to the\nMid ... when you add ballet one oh two point nine\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there is ... and\n... helped me find them back home prone to my area in the handle any kind of project you can read reviews of the problem kick their bail ability even book appointments on line and when my wife I Love most is that home advisor completely review\nYelled at ... dot com or download the ... to get started\nAt people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage your well\nOur investment advice is about you [noise] it's about providing your kids with opportunities for head start in life viewing secure and your retirement in ... in your dreams just may become a reality because you have a plan\nWe believe in you\nThe path to investment advice starts with your steeple financial advisor find your news people financial advisor rich people dot com that's S C I F ...

people are not rational right now they haven't been rational for a long time and their irrationality really was jammed up\nAfter Trump won but there's a companion story all of the people showing\nYep for Trump and that is not up for the people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out to try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidates and it isn't working now by showed up to do a rallying for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum\nWho as an aside and he debated Ron descent as last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of the with an Obama like way\nA would be the first African American governor\nAh is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion the guy is a full fledged leftist Marxist that really makes no bones about evil just talking about Florida as a collective that's communist ...\nShe was talking about Florida as law or a collective he hid it would be a\nDisaster for Florida right now the well liked anybody like this guy\nBecause of what he will do in racking a growing economy do you know the Florida and Texas economies are growing like gang busters and ... and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here\nFrom other areas of the country it's about tax policy Florida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves editing business is in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrat leftist who doesn't want there to be any private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate I and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally and so forth this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything\nFor his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has wanted an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start\nThem has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd you didn't build that\nA would just be just bad news horrible knows a thing that worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor or in in Florida Rick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and he is\nRick Scott is one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies in disasters in just\nCame through with flying colors and and and Nelson has become a\nJust a static flat line just a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever leftist leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit the Florida or not\nBut the Santa would be great defense is is a is a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump\nA but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing here and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now\nWe've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward\nPeople have have ah exceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing any extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\n\nIt wouldn't constitute rolling back every achievement that has been made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you've got to eat better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved\nWe wave stole a lot of what we had we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I Can't\nI Can't imagine people\nWho are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved would ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported Trump is supported because he's in the last line\nTo hold off on this attempt at transforming America into being something\nThat it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by like this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved\nBecause America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be then you got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democrat Party of today wants to happen\nSuccessful America needs to be punished\nWhatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own\nThe Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible if government makes have happened or less have happened\nBut more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups of victims and these victims have turned over their own futures to the Democrat Party they have decided\nThat life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference\nAnd so more and more what they want by voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful or anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness the Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited extremism\nThe Democratic party has become the home of people sadly when psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed anyway I mean this is just hands down at this Andrew Gillum personify is personify the exact\nWrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put but one of these up on the digital camera
