I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important election in our lives and that's why it's not\nThis is not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that's the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now in the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho wouldn't be running\nVarious cabinet posts and agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one including names of people and what they've been doing\nIf you had people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one it's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of the elections\nAre the the the drive by us have their formula\nAnd it's rooted in the desire they habit everybody hate Trump\nAnd so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result polling data and says the media so hey it's Trump\nThey want everybody else to therefore the trend is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have awake realize what a mistake they made voting for Trump\nNone of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks of the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in a history of landslides a Democrat Party deserves to get by\nFor the tactics they have engaged in for the actions\nTaken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAnd it just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and in a sane society they wouldn't be punished greatly\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be\nMy point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly hostility that he has created\nBetween the European Union allies and us\nWell I I mean what's ... we have wonderful relationships with a lot of people but we don't teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union no mine was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is high and yet they it's not hostile sounds hot sauce on the way they treat us\nWe're not how somebody can in daily within within the stupid country for so many years are you willing to get rid of that\nWestern alliance now I like NATO men is fine\nBut you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on trade electing a don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here are the concept but just so hostile the hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean it sounds so it sounds so this is confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left\nWe want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still functioning at a democracy but\nBut that's that's what they want us so we should be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this was just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nYou can listen company incorporated member S.

ripped to shreds not Vanity Fair it's six of one and a half dozen the variety is not so much a celebrity focused ran against Vanity Fair is a but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comments on left wing entertainers actors\nActresses TV so called journalist and so forth and it it's just a a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is just another sample from last night Trump and\nLeslie stall is it you know General Mattis said to you the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances instead prevent World War three\nNo it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you tend to try one more time okay yeah I Know unless you have to try it again [laughter] I Know that whole aunts and my answer is this I Will always be there with NATO but\nThey have to pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO [noise] but I don't want to be taken advantage of\nWhite and general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you he's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way\nHe's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments explosively in Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO\nTrump already called her out on it for doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less we still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can sneak up on people any more particularly Trump he knows he in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got on the roster coming up probably do\nBut he said something to her that is as as honest and true is anything you've ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I play golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree\nEspecially when discussion as in the media came up he thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerated in some of the things I Would tell them about my opinions with the media he said to her\nI had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie\nI had no idea how dishonest the media is until I ran for president I had no idea I being really serious with you he said and I I think that's probably true as a new\nYorker and emerged in New York may be aware of it was a star when he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's by you know he made fun of him and they laugh but he was a big get\nHe appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post when he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but\nIt all vanished when he ran and he was surprised in a way kinda like McCain was\n\nSo when you send to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked I was really surprised this honest that's the word he uses instead of biased\nAnd I can tell you that that is true now what else has he learned that he didn't know but he knew\nBefore he ran for office and I think a lot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you and I did but now since he suffered the treatment is fully\nRush Limbaugh

F. LA all over ... Scott\nIn Oklahoma City right to have you here Hi\nRushed good to talk to you know it gives her look Elizabeth\nWarren is resurrecting the one drop rule\nOr an anti bail them a a rule created by a southern plantation owners Democrats say if you have one drop of blood was black you're black or this was this was a grotesque cruel her her percentage are so small\nThey don't have ... excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop your going to be called black\nBut that's exactly right intersection holiday requires quantification yeah\nAnd so when we need to know how much of a percentage\nOf pressure you are versus oppressed this ... this this role is as grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties use can Nazi Germany it against the Jews here she comes again\nThis is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives is about her future run she needs to tell her base\nI'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of a pressure to\nWhat you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists concept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define\nGlad glad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so much more than welcome that's why I'm a good host I have ever that no one's gonna thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection out comes straight out of Marxism Marx said that at every one is either on a presser or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl a target\nAt its later it's now being adopted to the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how oppressed and how much of a pressure you are it's called intersect finality because instead of just being one camp or the other\nGets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's it intersection Natalie for me\nGreat on washed you're you're talking or you're you're speaking in language of people's formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful um yes any intersection out on the next is basically something that has been constructed by these marches\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations Meek somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that I'm\nA cohabitation it's with that with militant Islamic lists that then with illegal immigrants and their activists and we're all of these people intersect is why they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those\nAnd they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this and the recent white privilege stuffed ... absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now with the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press she's arrested him anyway she's a woman therefore she has impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth India and she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know I if I could say you know I took a DNA test about four years ago\nAnd of course you don't normally you'd never see me but believe me I'm whites however what I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa well that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim\nA professorship and African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times\nMore of a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American his\n... just admitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor for the Afrikaners are not black\nUh I well I\nI I understand what you're saying I Am referring to blacks than\nOkay All right I just want to best because a sub Saharan this is somebody what ... what is it what it was it and then you start talking to the sub continent then some people really get confused you're coming from from India or over to sub Saharan Africa is below the arid desert or which\nIs where most of the population of Africa is most of them there is some north of this arid desert as well\nAnd I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this all of that not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this\nBecause they think it is
