you later [noise] for\nThem to the program glad you're back I'm just talking to Steve off the air is fascinating is they're really really really a pheasant\nAnd now he's one of those guys to his you know really walk through the fire for his principles and um and uh I I that's something I really respect\nI really like what he says about Donald Trump down from South problem\nNot just days of reflection of of us and he's reflecting that part of us that says get him when he's really he's really done his homework on on Donald Trump and and and how bright he is on reflecting the people and it really when you look at\nHow Donald Trump is reflecting a those guys if you will\nBe really shows how wrong the Democrats the the democratic leadership really is they're just they're off the deep\nEnd I think I mentioned I don't know if I mentioned is off the air but there's a certain the New York times today this is the headline in the New York times Michelle Obama wanted Democrats to go high now they aren't so sure and it goes through the Eric Holder a quote or when they go low we kick the Michael ... when they go\nA low I say hit back harder um Hillary Clinton a you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for 'em when we when that's when civility concert again um there was another a Joe Biden if I were in high school I take them behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\nI mean this is as they sit there and the new democratic ... what's the difference between that and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him back twice as hard\nWell I mean I I you know that's the ... what they're saying they are trying to opposed as Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're certainly not selling themselves as the new Donald Trump's ... they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nSo I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who was the only one that I saw out of all of the Democrats who came out and said the holder comments were bad\nThat's her phrase that was being criticized trained but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that his complete lip service the Obama administration played lip service just civility paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip\nService to ... what made them almost unbeatable was for the average person right\nThey they won twice based on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nose as any other Democrat just as hard nose they at least tried\nTo hide it\nThis switch is now overt we're harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said this now it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic part\nAnd it's amazing how they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders because they're all emulating Malcolm X they are not emulating Martin Luther king\nYeah that was really the the the that was his deal mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung back\nAnd that ... that they would have followed Malcolm X things might have been worse for ... for ah for blacks for a while\nI mean you're back very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean\nPeople want\nThey don't want to think of themselves as no 'cause you know animals harassing innocent people in the restaurant and that's not something that anyone wants to ... you want to associate yourself with those people ... right and you know you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who who go down these roads\n... you know the all right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the alt right generally speaking\nIs either they're horrible horrible and the people in a totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist\nRight like there's very few people were like you know what the alt right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know and I don't know not to you know but the Bannon was the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really\nOutside of Steve Bannon you've seen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like who wants to I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right it's just a normal human instinct\nAnd that's not even Nazis that's all right really nobody even knows what All right is I mean the average person\nThey just see them as people who are going out in the streets and you know a beating people up or torturing people or or marching you know against you know Jews and blacks and everything else and you're like I don't want to be part of that I just don't want to write a ugly I don't want\nThat I mean there was an actual death in Charlottesville right yeah yeah and everyone would say that that is horrific um but you know there was over there right like we're just marching around with torches and saying horrible things do you want to be associated with any of them well no\nBut the left also there were ... the shooting of of our of our congressmen a

believe in climate change do people with more than just rank amateur on professionalism but the reason I played this is is not not to mention this guy\nBut because while this guy is jumping all in my chili listened to this story this is from the federalist papers liberal professor says hurricane victims\nDeserves what thank God because they support Republicans now do you think these clowns in Boston with zero in on something genuinely get range like this\nNo they're going to make up the fact that a bunch of people like me who know oh that climate change and man made climate change is a hoax are somehow responsible for people having lost everything including risking\nTheir lives\nDoes University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota thermal and fluids sciences professor Dr John Abraham he's a professor actually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a catastrophic hurricane because they elected climate deniers\nHere's the headline in an article written by this guy was published in the guardian not some obscure little rag\nOr a penny saver this was published in the guardian on Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we are reaping what we so\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it this is the logic and the reasoning that he is teaching these engineering school the guy is still reigns this is\nThis is hyper political partisanship disguised as science he thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes\nTo hit red states and the people in red states who voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans and his name\nIs Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michael's intensity on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricanes ever hit the panhandle\n\nYet he blames the intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claimed that southern voters brought this upon themselves\nBy voting Republicans into office\nIt's a wonder that a state like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott and the Senator Marco Rubio and his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office that more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction ... so this clown\nWho is disguised as a as an engineering professor literally is saying that if you want to stop\nDestructive hurricanes striking where you live vote Democrat he literally there's one that's what he said\nIn an unrelated story a bunch of ... which is somewhere are putting a tax on Brett Kavanaugh this week and I'm not making that up\nAnd they are disguised as Democratic Party activists are

to destroy Kanye West at what Kanye West Dennis simply venture off the liberal Democrats plantation\nThat is a no no if you're African American you venture off the Democrat plantation they are going to destroy your meanwhile idiots like this\nProfessor a professor of engineering literally tells people\nThat if you want to stop hurricanes from blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you\nNow do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking there were people\nIn the leftist medium\nWho literally weren't trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana he wanted it specifically the strike New Orleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents\nOf New Orleans would have to abandon the city and go to Texas where as Democrats they wouldn't be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if and get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats\nAnd sort of people out there saying that Bush\nActually wanted the hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents would have to leave would have to go to Houston there were some even saying that Bush was doing what he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because most told the weather service\nTo downplay the warnings\nWell I didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead and mentioned there were some that now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out there\nTalking to Amy lunatics on the Internet who were claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane\nRemember that\nThe Bush was steering that hurricane Bush himself the president was there in a hurry and and what this guy\nIs professor at the University of St Thomas is no different by claiming that simply the way people vote determines where a hurricane goes how stronger hurricanes going to be\nAnd whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't know yeah it's the redneck Riviera and yeah traditionally the panhandle of Florida and blow both Republican but he doesn't know there might have been some democratic voters he got wiped out the odds are there were\nBecause so many people didn't get wiped out you know we we we looked at these events are these people do as one off political events\nSome of these people who had been wiped out you you look at

bit of a way the more people so I don't know what the what the problem is I mean\nLike Oh yes it does ... the problem is they're trying to scare everybody into signing on to this because it's it's classic if you sign on to agreeing to the whole premise of climate change your dream to a lot you're agreeing you are to blame\nAnd that's a big one\nBecause when you agree that you are to blame then they hit you with but you can fix it you you you can make demands and how do you do that you agree to pay higher taxes you agree to become an activist you you agreed to start criticizing everybody else so they get you to accept blame\nThen you also admit that\nGigantic organizations are the only way to structure our lives and to protect everybody so it's it's simply a waving guilt people into accepting\nWhen they don't even know this is being done to them the premise of socialism communism\nUnder the guise of saving the planet but your point about the optimal temperature I've expressed

elections\nBefore they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly governor twenty Eighteen mid terms\nStill point to a good a great night for Democrats they are the out party and the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely he'll Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten of Republican numbers around now\nYet yet now we pointed out\nThat all of these national generic polls show this gigantic way but if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way if you don't see the evidence in the polling and people have been asking how can this how can this disparity\n... how can you have a generic ballots that shows that Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen\nWell it must mean the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslim ... how could it generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling people\nA month three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote\nWithout a name and the question what do you think the result is going to be\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate they suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning the authority and the Senate\nThat would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole every other seats if they have\nThey held by incumbents at at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo [noise]\nIt's [noise] let me go state by state to show her and this is all happening and then the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hope that this is a\nTraditional here party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls would say that's exactly what's going to happen but then you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to\nTell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities all reading

of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interest in in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that climate guys now\nWhat's the worst thing that ever

imagine\nBut they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a it's a procedural\nMoving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula it doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder\nThere is not a lot of hardly any\nAbhorrent\nGore and violence in the movie it's it's they picked him in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things in movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe inform it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood

know about\nWhat he did Kermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even and this trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie
