[noise]\nI Know when he was little heads up here I'm going to continue today my at him and\nExplaining the divide that exist in the country's specific way by explaining just who the left is what they've become what we're up against\nA to me it is the seminal issue that we all face we're talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as we know it I mean America is always going to be here don't misunderstand about this country's surviving as\nFounded we're under a solved it has never been worse and they made of the civil war but but those were different circumstances oh that was a specific argument I'm about cultural things regarding slavery that in the end nobody\nOf any\nReason to attitude could ever support we find ourselves here in a multi layered multi faceted all out assault on the entire concept of America as mountains\nSome people's sense it\nSome people are not aware of it and I I've I've uh just sort of evolved here into a position where I feel compelled to try to explain this sounds some warning bills and it may be present some\nAre solutions but they have to I have to be very careful I don't over do this I don't want to I don't want to you know me I'm In the nation's number one natural optimist and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the best way perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real threats\nThat we face are still that's coming up as the program unfolds\nBack however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off apologizing to the nation\n\nApologizing to Kevin all on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him and they have an episode codified is exactly what I think we're up against\nAnd it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas\nThe left is not interested in our ideas we're up again we're battling people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments over the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they\nHave no limits on how low they will go on how the brave didn't perverted they will be in seeking their reality it all I Am convinced started on America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean do you go back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point would be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention or whether it's because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born\nOr and so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't know it so the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this my\nThoughts but they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes ideas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate and not even worthy of discussion or acknowledge\n\nAnd they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination that was founded as part of this country as far as their concert\nAnd it was all on display in the Capitol hearing everything that we are up against the absence a presumption of innocence\nKavanaugh was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any

get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he is not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but

I mean we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n[noise] [noise]\nWell anyway Sally Quinn says that John Tower once assaulted her but she didn't come forward and here's what she says\nAnderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John tower basically tried to sexually assault you in the back of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in the Senate or you don't drive around and yellow cabs [noise] you have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she search it happened in a cab\nThat John Tower tried to sexually assault you in the back of the tax that you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was a nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out\nBut Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything he drag\nNow where did this nightclub and ordered brandy and wouldn't let go of me and finally I got away and ran out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me and basically tried to assault me and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding Adam senator stop and\nI was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father was station he was in general and the army at the time and the cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the carbon screech to a halt in front of our quarters and I think then tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shot God\nBut I went in the house that night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never tell my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn the assaulted by John Tower um but but you know she doesn't want here yeah there's one more bite we've
