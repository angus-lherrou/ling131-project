Lee disassemble your heating and air conditioning system have it completely clean sanitized disinfected and put it back together and that can get expensive\nWe're talking thousands with an S. okay a little piece of free advice folks if you're going to buy a one inch filter\nBy one from your local big box store your age your lowers your home depot wherever it is that you're going through filters nowadays and here's the number one rule the number one rule is to get a filter that you cannot see through\nOkay if you can hold your filter up and you can see your hand on the other side\nNot a good filter okay [laughter] that's basically is and sister take that out are looking for gold or something take that to the beach with you we call that a rock stopper it's good for golf balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at filtering your air\nAnd it's not going to protect your heating and cooling system\nAnd you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive okay that's what the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay come on people\nSpend some money on a good filter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money\nNow the correct one for you to buy if you're going to get a one inch filter is a one inch police raided\nFilter that's P pleaded filter\nLook for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip okay goes up and down and up and down\nAnd it's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big span um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive\nAlright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouth\nYour system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and it can cause some damage All right so I buy one that costs between maybe six and Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs that are not no look\nI can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter starts to look a little dirty it's becoming hard to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity\nOperating blower motor and the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor it'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters\nHave zero sympathy for your heat pump your furnace or your air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you\nYou will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on\nSome of these five inch filters will fit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive than the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly have your rock steppers you're saying sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in droves they give you a great return\nOn investment okay they'll look we've only got a couple of minutes left in

are totally justified than harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes and forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist totally totally justified\nSo there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part I think some Democrats do not think that this ... range psychological upset\nIs tied to them\nLet me put it this way if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think\nThat conservatism is made up of deranged lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all [noise] some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think that that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrat\n\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be so I'm too if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it then the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms by what people are now saying Mr certainly\n... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think that we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote in the ... [laughter]\nI Wonder where they heard that I Wonder where they heard that idea\nWell we don't know yet of the issues are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh more intimate during the election\nIt is a interesting question though will any of the passion fade away on either or\nBoth sides of this\nAnd that's on the Democrats' side it's not going to fade away and I think everybody needs to know this on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left\nYou have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\nThey have been mad insane crazy percolating compounding\nCome pressing all of this ever since then they haven't been loaded for bear ever since election\nDay and the day after a two thousand sixteen then this Kavanaugh situation comes up\nAnd I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical and I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\nI mean they're still talking about investigating Kevin offered her policy wants to see\nThe F. B. I. documents released she wants a full fledged\nInvestigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking talking about Jerrold Nadler of a house Judiciary Committee ranking member of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house they're gonna impeach cabinet they're going to investigate them getting thrown off the court\nThey're not they're not going to let this side this cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging in what\nYou and I wouldn't call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I Know it's not even tried like ... ... we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional\nBreakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not ... that I don't I don't want to fall back on that to suggest that this anger they feel is not legitimate it's legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a democratic voters is less than what we think it is\nJust because some people have announced that they accept the money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing and twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being\nPaid I think the demographic rages real and it's been real since election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they are going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the electorate and consequences\nThey censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it they simply cannot deal with it at a rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it rather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why I ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large elected Democrats really are unaware\nOf the impression these people are creating about them and when these are mad in saying this gusting Democrat protesters and they are identified with the Democratic party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that\nI can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not [noise] but for those that don't get it it amazes me that it is possible that these professional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative of\nThe ah the party at large\nHere's Jake Christian Adams writing it PJ Media Kavanaugh photos fills Senate gallery was sounds will be insane so but as any doubt that the opposition to Kevin always on hinged on civil

on their hands down on more word limit lunatics these were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination they were an embarrassment to themselves and their rights pay attention that's what the left sounds like yeah it is\nIn the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit concerned about it the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large doesn't seem to worry at all this kind\nOf discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections\nIn fact they may think the opposite they may think\nThat this is what's going to further inspire more discordant\nMadness which will result in massive turnout\nThey believe it's going to frighten Republicans in tune not confronting them and basically letting them have their way because who wants to deal with lunatics Andy insane face to face\nBut what it means to me is I don't know that they can get more rabbit\nI don't know that there's anything else it can happen to get

interest in and would always say a variation of you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies they're not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it's nothing it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population this is what they all said that every Trump rally privately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing because there's\nNot a one of them on the Democrats' side who could come anywhere close to ...\nThat kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized\nCrowds Obama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies there her book signing ceremonies\nHillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows but\nSeriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death while\nThey would never say so publicly that would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things\nThat attached and jealousy and envy they have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't just in terms of average Americans being interested in in the campaign interested in the Kansas City\nAnd those

be the first guy that try to replicate this then I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they got too much to lose if it doesn't work\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got\nTo be able to show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as\nMuch attention as Trump and draw up till now nobody\nOn the Democrats' side has even given it a prayer until the Clintons\nThe daily wire has the story\nWashington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that they are embarking on a nationwide stadium tour\nTaking the Clintons stage show to Thirteen cities this ball it's going to be called an evening with President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that the actual\nAnd very quickly\n[noise] traffic and whether by heart radios nine Seventy WFL a [noise]\nFrom me for the central credit union free checks\nOr trauma we know that many of them chose not to report to the police\nAnd choose not to reveal their assault because they have no evidence or corroborating witnesses and the fear they will not be believed speaking of which grab audio somebody number ... teams Sally when\nShe is the widow of the late ... editor of the Washington Post Ben Bradlee Sally Quinn used to be a journalist with the Washington Post CBS the CBS in the morning show\nShe probably best known for throwing Washington's best dinner parties during Democrat presidency's during Republican presidents things nobody wanted to go to dinner 'cause they were so mad all the time\nBut she apparently had the best dinner parties at her and Bradley's house\nAnd she was on a understand Cooper twenty nine last night\nNow Sally Quinn alleges that former Texas Senator John tower\nThat's how his name was his name was John Tower he was a short little guy five four pockmarked face acne greasy hair and this guy was apparently\n[noise] Don Juan running around the Senate and just that everybody that got a nice way this guy had more allegations I literally I remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend that while telling him he needed to resign one of them was a [noise]\nSam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget is attempt saving the reputation of John\nTower I knew John Powell\nI think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was only [noise] but I'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a ...\nBy reputation\nCocoa get a picture of a guy put him on put him on Rush Limbaugh got caught I'll Try to find one here in ... show you a little camera [noise] we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n[noise] [noise]\nWell anyway Sally Quinn says John Tower once assaulted her but she didn't come forward\nAnd here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John tower basically tried to sexually assault you in the back of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in senator you don't drive around on yellow cams [noise]\nYou have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she search it happened in ... the John Tower tried to sexually assault you in the back of the tax that you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was\nA nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out but Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything\nDragnet rid of this nightclub and order brandy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and ran out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me and basically I tried to assault and the and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding Adams senator stop and\nI was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father was station he was in general and the army at the time and the cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the car and Senate screech to a halt in front of our quarters and I think then tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shotgun\nBut I went in the house that night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never told my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn or assaulted by John Tower um but but you know she doesn't want to hear yeah there's one more bite we got Times Square here here's another reason why number forty three when I think\nAbout it I thought I'm so glad I didn't do it because I could have been Anita Hill\nAnd Anita Hill's life has been completely ruined destroyed went ahead and going to be the person who was in that hearing and then you're talking about is disgusting that Christine seizing Ford's name came out against her well she didn't want to be there and what I think is\nThat if I had been Anita Hill and I'd known better I wouldn't have done it if I then Christine ... Ford\nShe didn't expect it do public but I Would have not done it\nBecause their lives have been ruined it costing buzzy for just got an alumni an award from UNC Chapel Hill for this is she going to get movies like the hills life has not been ruined or destroyed Sally ... world are you looking at\n'em anyway [noise] ah\n...

have been voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only been one twice didn't last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being this was not a surprise it's a disappointment to white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in\nRight Clinton stumbled and swerved in\nTo a truth except for the very exceptional election year of Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting them white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe ... the left as as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged\nInto so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy arriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way\nAnd there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn\nA language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a\nTest\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans\n[noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell Nineteen sixty five us when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course lend to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd that wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries the Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here\nTo Christian I'm poor of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they have to do was change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly crusty on and on for it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking at\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you've heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal the steak every liberal\nIdea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard\nIce pop culture the laws of the reality today is because Democrats activist judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret\nThem and then pronounce decisions roe versus Wade is the most thoroughly example of this but there are countless others\nThe simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning legislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them\nThat's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says that what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional B. S.\nNot by you in fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere ... did you see any way even a conservative state of college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America\nIs to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Chris you're on on on for\nListening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland and here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face\nThat's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term\nThat's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them\nAs they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it's if it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice\nCannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to be even more uncivil what an irresponsible statement every Democrats should denounced they're not going to denounce or\nThey privately publicly encourage written by applauded they supported that is who they are\nThis is the party by the way that has been railing against all this instability for I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know what happens but it's it's uh\nThe new morality\nFinding backer resisting it we deserve what we can\nProfit and whether by hard radios nine Seventy WFL a [noise]\n\nFrom the train traffic center power by climate design you can expect staffing Traficant I Seventy five south found between something Marion County line in St Louis forty fourth are forced to have an accent\nAnd Seventy five north found in Sumter between Florida turnpike and assumption Marion County line and a half a left wing bloc and selling things down a lot in the area also my teeth and stopping the traffic on ... on the east than direction between Dr King Hillsborough Avenue no other major dailies report on your interstates roadways in Hillsboro this evening math accounting news radio nine Seventy WFL a\n[noise] hot temperatures through the second half of our Sunday and there will be only at ten percent chance of passing shower\nBut wolf noticed the humidity continuing to increase in to the overnight period Seventy six by Monday morning\nBy Monday afternoon temperatures back into the low nineties near Ninety two and we do include another slim rain chance right around ten percent for the afternoon out on the water used when spring northwest tend not to put seasonal lights up on the big news channel a meteorologist ed bloods worth for news radio nine Seventy WFL lay\nOffs news on that behind like President Trump is making additional disaster\nAssistance available to Florida including direct federal assistance Republican governor Rick Scott survey the damage in the panhandle area today he says there's progress but more work to be done\nWhen the most frustrating things I think for all of us right now is there anybody does that power on that's very frustrating but the other is just a telecommunications\nThe president visits Florida in Georgia tomorrow treasury treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin under pressure from some CEO's were planning to attend an investor conference in Saudi Arabia\nThis after the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal could show gate Larry Kudlow director of the national economic council says it's important\nLaw with the president and the general investigation mismanaged and we'll make up his mind as we progress as bad as new information surfaces on ABC's This week this hot new\nNews radio nine Seventy WFL a of\nYou go on the eye heart radio I downloaded now\nFrom the auto bailout hearing aids studios Ninety six seven FM Pashto went up to nine ... nine Seventy W.
