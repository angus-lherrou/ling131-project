portray themselves in Kavanaugh situation but that's just the latest the Democratic party has become the home of the mentally unstable\nWho have used the political system to fix\nWhatever problems they have ... or their grievances that they think they have it all revolves around the age old argument for the purpose of government it really is is you take all of this that's happening domestically\nAnd when you synthesize it now when you boil it all down to its essence it's about the role of government\nAnd it's about the fact that the Democrats do not want to promote self reliance they don't want to promote rug in individual lives and they don't want to promote people dealing with life fixing situations dealing in facing adversity and overcoming it becoming better people\nThey want people to remain inept incompetent dependents grown up in a mass\nThinking the government is the solution and the solution is not really a solution the solution at the Democratic voters want is

reform when one on campus and found some people going to vote for Beto O'Rourke is it would you be surprised to learn that not a single person they ran into can tell them what a single Beto O'Rourke policy it\nDoesn't surprise you at all\nIs it not not not when the media is promoting that whole as middle name Kennedy\nThey're promoting his good looks promoting the woman I think that promote well I mean if you're going to promote Kennedy you got to promote it all\nI'm not accusing about all of that but if you're going to say hey I'm just like the Kennedys then you got to be just like the Kennedys stay away from sixty nine Oldsmobile Z\nOn bridges but I mean ... not a single person voting for Beto can tell you one of these issues because it doesn't matter\nAnd in many of these other places the Democrats are running on issues that are not at the forefront of people's minds or they are on the wrong side\nBut if you're really stop to think about it mob behavior\nBullying the appearance of insane rage in anger\nIs all they have left they don't have any issues or policies to run on for the same old reason they can't be honest or they've got plenty of policies all they got plenty issues\nAll they have plenty of ideas they just don't dare tell anybody what they are\nNot at the run up to election time they have no\nLeaders to rally behind him in ... well we'll look at the presidential front runners at this party\nJoel bite me crazy Bernie who is losing popularity and\nIf you haven't heard Hillary Clinton has all but made it official she is running again in twenty twenty\n\nHillary Clinton me a two time loser wants to go for the trifecta and I'm telling you know there are a lot of people that are Democratic Party hierarchy particularly in the media who don't want her anywhere near a presidential campaign again\nKamala Harris big walk by the time the microscope to get to her\nWe're going to find out how really intellectually vacant that woman actually is and the same thing with Cory Spartacus Booker\nThese people survive on the image and reputation built by the drive by media but when the time comes to find out what really goes on between their ears you learn that it isn't much\n\nThey're frustrated because they've tried everything they can to get rid of Donald Trump and not only have they failed he has thrived so all they have is rage and the rage is actually the anger associated with failure\nThey have failed in every at Tam every effort\nTo get Donald Trump's approval numbers down to the thirties and the twenties so one of the primary parties in America the Democratic party has now become a party of range adding violence mob like bullying behavior it's their only\nAngle and they're actually paying people to go engage in this kind of behavior\nLet's review some things that were in the news twenty four seven\nAnd the reason they were in the news twenty four seven because this was how to drive by media working with the Democratic party was going to get rid of Donald Trump\nAnd yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump\nI I don't think what this has been about is simply waiting until Republicans lose an election such as the midterms I think they've actually sought to have Donald Trump from you move from office since the day after the election I guess what Mueller's about that's what the collusion thing is about that is what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box in twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House that has been\nThe mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders to the enraged abnormalities that make up a Democrat base\nAnd I mean that specifically I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican they want to destroy Mitt Romney or\nGeorge W. Bush same pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all been about\nHaving Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road day how many times that they brought up the cabinet needs to get together and determined this man's nuts if they they want him out of office every day now the failure compounds the rage look at just some\nOf the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks\nAnd then no particular or to hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Kristin balls the forward\nThat was a two for that was get rid of cabinet as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career his past his future no problem that's what they were trying to do\nChristine balls the four Stormy Daniels a porn star became a hero to the Democratic party and her creepy\nPorn star attorney Michael ... who was then towers and as perhaps a Democratic Party presidential front runner for twenty twenty\nAnd Donald Trump's taxes that was an issue that\nWas ever investing below the surface for the entire time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead how about\nThe shooting\nAt the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida and the creation of a couple of new Democratic Party activists camera hog and I forget the other one how long did that story go on how big a star did they turn camera hog into and\nWhere is he now and where is the issue of gun control where is this story that young people high school\nAnd college students in had enough of them are going to take control of the apparatus that government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the on Iraq where\nIs that today what [noise] but\nOh camera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to live there he will be again\n\nMy point is these are all manufactured\n\nTailored people and the issue is based on a happening or a moment but none of it is organic or real what do you mean Russia's neighborhood walk along these totally real but he's a media creation\n\nAs David ... doesn't have an audience David hog did not literally create a bond neither does okay seal ... these people do not have connections\nWith an audience they don't have connections with voters like Trump paths are like other successful people and media do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't

I think many of the Republicans have blocked the idea that Trump was going to be a garner a before now I I\nThey are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the meaning of targets I I think first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him 'cause they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obama\nYou can't repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected and it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a palm payroll left Saudi Arabia after having met when king Solomon and Mohammed bin so I'm On the
