F. L. A. all over Tampa Bay [noise]\nThe course of the many recent months I have made the point that one of the objectives of the modern American Left us to transform America I'm away from its intentions and its designs as founded\nAnd in many ways this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration on both doing in the Snow White Obama couldn't come out and\nSay beyond that his policies were transformative uh it couldn't define what that meant a\nThere would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transferring America man so why did he claimed that man was taking on issues like climate change and health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do with transfer America away from\nOur unique sounding converted to a socialist democracy some of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist back\nLooking is a poll out here today this from the Daily Caller Jay Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials\nIdentify as democratic socialist according to a study that has been taking\nA [noise] you know you'd like\nTo not believe this but the facts on the ground is is that what you see [noise]\nEven though maybe anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify a some kind of socialist and women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would that help can that be\n'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't drivers socialism you know what it is self reliance self reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself being a man just does not jibe with socialism\nSocialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism in communism attempt to her race self reliant people self reliant people people that do not need do not depend\nOn anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat the socialist in Congress or how the hell is this happened how is it forty percent of millennial men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism which has had as one of its targets the the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjure up terms for it toxic masculinity dangerous\nMasculinity they are doing their best to erase mailed natural male characteristics\nFor as many young guys as they can and since guys want there pal around with women whatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course you got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons tell everybody to go to hell\nWhen they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want them to do if the big book\nAs famous and hot women did get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant and it just the nature of things and so they're being\nHighly highly successful and targeting America and its founding not just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept\nThat government is the institution that needs to be the limit the most in a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communism socialist so I have an evidence base here\nNot just slapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by Michael ... a guy\nPublished yesterday the cheers of Brett Kavanaugh is its title [noise]\nIt is a horrible case and it does exactly that which I had been warning people it goes all the way back to the founding of America the trash white men that reminds\nMe hang on here you need a grab an audio soundbite here it's a bit of it but I Do but they would they be every bit of six and seven [noise]\n[noise]\n... quote Kavanaugh has no avenue of appeal do except his own hurt feelings he's in touch with them as he was taught to be and so he seemingly weaponized crying the way a little boy\nDoes when he's in trouble another poll quote\nBut Kevin last performance last Thursday was something entirely different distinctly contemporary it's combined the post war attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings to the point that they make crime with the intrinsic\nAmerican ideal of white male privilege because Kevin ... is accused of sexual assault\nAnd may be denied the career elevation he has long ... he blah bird like a newborn he has plot had his career you'll see he hasn't had a series of goals in a gym for them all know\nThat guy is a dangerous schemer\nHe has plot to get on the Supreme Court where he can no rule against minorities and women and Latino sent this band aches and gays and lesbians and transgender used don't you know this has been a lifelong ... strategy\nUh I realize a lot of people think that that's one so that that's what's in store here\nAnd of course I'm hearing is going to happen I'm hearing from droves of you who say the proof is the timing that she's going to do this after this program and is mean it means rush it can't be anything you're going to like I'm getting emails that say you think that's right too\nCertainly has absolutely things that's right as well well we'll we'll see I'm not I'm not going to withdraw my uh acknowledgement that I think she did the right thing [noise]\nBut I Am going to get to the phones because I've um I've gone to many first hours this week without getting to the phones that changes today especially being open line friday so we'll go to Pleasanton, California first with Chris hello\nNow however that rush a good to talk with you\nI'm this Monica McClain who you were just speaking of the person they contacted Amish Kaiser on trying to get her to possibly change your testimony yeah uh she she's the same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how\nAre those coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle it polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Wheelan Kaiser to change your test those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either of that\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in her Senate and the test of mine she she mentioned regal Delaware was where she was at and that's the last known address of of this moniker McLean\nCorrect yes absolutely that's when they wrote a letter when when when balls the Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was in ... ... ... a Delaware with McLean yet\nSo here's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that hasn't come out yet I I'm Wondering is not as the Democrats oddly enough we're not better off holding this vote now for more of this comes out\n... going to go through at the last minute change one of the people are saying they're going to vote changes\nIt was certainly it goes down and according to then because all of this is about to come out\nAnd it's not about to come out that's the whole point\nYou know it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the lead when Kaiser a\nPressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley reference that end Grassley said there's a lot more there are many more examples of balls before the witnesses being pressured the ginger test them on the Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change and it's not gonna change anything\nThis is not about the evidence\nIt never has been about the evidence\nAnd if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York times website in five minutes and it baby CBS NBC began to report on this but wouldn't change one Democrat Senate vote\nDemocratic delayed about anyway that's up to McConnell a turtle\n... well the question is why when Republicans make make a greater effort for it to come out\nWhy ... ... to ... uh uh [noise]\nUh it's in the FBI reporting to Republicans and Democrats can see it if the the the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report they discovered ...\nCombined knowledge none of the center to grassroots so forth they are not measuring what we were just talking about no\nNo they're not I can't tell you why they're not mentioning\nOkay thank you you bet I'm Wondering myself [noise] um well\nI Know your questions are entirely legitimate and they're rooted in pure common sense\nYou were sitting there thinking if the world know this it would change everything it shows that the balls the foreign side is willing to commit perjury supporting perjury pressure witnesses to change their stories\nWhich then couldn't be standing to conclude that there's not anything that ball Z Ford is saying it's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they have not shown up at Yahoo News the Associated Press New York Times CBS NBC CNN and they want for ... reason the stories are being suppressed\nBut the Democrats in the Senate and all it doesn't matter it's about the seriousness of the charge is not about the nature of

you ... to clear water you two seven five eight zero Wesley capital south yeah when you do for being branded\nThrough and I'm Steve Hall our top story and one ... the age of fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is a great deal\nWith that the U.S Senate cut off debate and started the clock during a full floor vote on the confirmation Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh the gator bowl dressed in with a former senators who are undecided\nLike they're having won but you're not supposed to say these kinds of things\n\nYou know you you know what Trump allude in any way to women this time of the month on all hell is going to break lows\nBut here misery even get to talk about on his lowest common everyday and everybody gets everybody understands it and everybody knows what it means it means to stay away\nLeave it alone don't engage yes ma'am yes ma'am three bucks for whatever and go on\nShe did this\nBy alleging that Republican male senators are acting like the ... mentioned does Senator Grassley the chairman of the Judiciary Committee he has um I've never seen him this animated I've never seen the turtle is animated this week the turtle and Grassley have benefits\nTo be tied Grassley still Grassley sent a letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess the Senate to Schumer you might have Senator Feinstein and in this wider he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by e and Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass when his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations us shortly one producer this quickly is you could but you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so\nYou are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial a doctor Ford's allegations\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even low balls the Ford admitting that she took a lie detector will her warriors did and that that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass when he's been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed the light attacked or we want to see it\nThey won't let him see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations wiped away you have claimed some reasonable thing to say\nThey're out there saying she's not gonna lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details tour therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce\nAnd Grassley said you're must you must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy and now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices and Feinstein Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ ... my ...\nAnd fried Debbie Ramirez Julie sweating representative what what what Grassley is getting at here how much conflict they should have you had with his what\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes them how how much time spent with this witness discussing her testimony or coaching her whatever I mean he loaded for bear this is the kind of ... out of the violation and I shouldn't call it that these are this ... this is the kind of decorum that you you don't see broken\nSenators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphone do run into these on it or are they the\nMedia people as using by us and so forth in fact grab wanting a soundbite number five this was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example\nOf a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen he like it is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged Marlboro\nWhen you hear things about get in their face ... other people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member they coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to mob rule by voting to\nConfirm judges Kevin on the floor\nThat was during his ah southern for remarks today in favor capital he was he was singling out by the way Maxine Waters for promoting this as he called the resistance but he is he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right\nThe leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee and in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like this\nFit to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it I got an email last night from Salinas Ito\nWho has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen\nShe went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned everything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously she went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there\nThat the Washington establishment didn't see\nAnd rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns medium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it\nIf the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or is there an anti Trump or is it's an amazing display of arrogance and by the way the same can be set of Republican political consultant they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left out in ... and made fun of so I get a known for her last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant and what has happened\nOut there in these areas she has studied and she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together now a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six saying that they did so for very specific reasons\nAmong them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six day in that they would not forget that\nAnd if they would realize the need to continue to vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful and she makes the point that it doesn't work that\nSadly\nIn in charge of a well there's a link to hang on let me complete the doctor and get back [noise]\nWay you want me to know\nRadios knives WFL a [noise]\nGood afternoon and I'm Steve Hall our top story and one thirty the senators voted fifty one forty nine and a procedural vote to advance the nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court prior to devote Iraqi memory the Senate Judiciary committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein spoke out against Kavanaugh\n... during the

J. and the FBI and characters who weren't involved yeah and the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Trump Russia collusion investigation how does that\nHappen if you're just a woman out in Santa Cruz or Paolo Alto and you'll see that Brett Kavanaugh\nHas been nominated to be on the Supreme Court and you don't think you should be because you think one time he attacked you you'll send a letter to Dianne Feinstein the next thing you know\nWell no no no that's used and find signed a letter after traveling to Delaware to meet with your buddy Monica McClain\nWho probably writes the letter for you because of the inclusion of Cleveland Kaiser as a he not a woman which she is\nSo you're just you're a beach Bab\nPsychology professor whatever from California and you end up writing a letter after traveling to Delaware after saying you're afraid of flying\nAnd their lawyers don't tell you that the committee's willing to fly out to California to interview you\nI I I Want I didn't know I I ...
