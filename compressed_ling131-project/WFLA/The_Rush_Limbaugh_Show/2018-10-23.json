decision\nAbout the law is Obama told about drawing red lines in Syria the Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception\nAnd the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the polls in record numbers starting of the two thousands hadn't been germs\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody well\nWhere did you think about it ... you remember who started or remember who was\nAnd he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God that like

these people are not right mentally see them protesting Mitch McConnell and his wife having dinner at a restaurant in Kentucky I mean they're not right\nThere's something really really awful about these people and I think they've been driven to various degrees of insanity by professors teachers and the media they'd been lied to for so long about things that the things they expect to happen the things they think are real are so devoid\nOf reality and truth that they're on the table do except to Jim Jim Jim Acosta\nHaving the president whip people up at a rally after rally he says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this is the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job it's covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally and you know people would give you a hard time I'd you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the two guys make campaign\nBut at a rally after rally after rally having the president noted states where people up into a frenzy got attacked the press to me is the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist man\nOh man we're has this guy been to the Trump whipping people up at a rally after rally in having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as a gym you can get but you got all kinds of you could go be a waiver you obviously listen well\nMr Acosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here\nYou know thousands and thousands of people who are willing to join in and do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised grudging unfortunately\nFor bodies slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man who is doing these body slam moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm gonna cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to him after was over and I talk to them about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia or maybe you could find Hillary's emails and media is look at it from nobody can\nMaybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty pounds name was let the media they'd love to hear from me and everybody in the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack Hillary server Hillary's already done the hack\nHillary's already done whatever she's done to hide the emails\nNo sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises the guy for being able to body slam somebody they see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that\nThey think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence\nThey think the Trump is recommending and praising ... girl violence ... but they just I I've never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and absent\nFrom reality from day to day life and how people talk to each other he goes up to this guy and the guys laughing hey man hey Jim Acosta how you do it I really didn't want to see what you're you know I'm just wondering what your dude\nYou're out there trying to destroy everything I Believe in Mr ... I'm just having a little fun with you so these people in journalism they can go out they can destroy anybody they want they can take shots at anybody they want the people at that rally have respect for Trump the media can do whatever they want to try to destroy Trump\nBut you'll let somebody throw it back on them and it said guy give a disgrace that show something terribly wrong with American culture what's wrong with American culture is that the elites of Washington DC\nNot only do not understand real life America\nThey don't like it much they really have I think what they have about Trump more than anything is those of you who elected him I think that's what this really boils down to when you get down to brass tacks more on that when we get back\n[noise] somebody has to have to say Russia's probably by being met for nine Seventy that when you add ballet one or two point nine south Tampa\nAlright do all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance rosy\nOr larger I Want you to get a pen and I want you to write this information them if your age Seventy five year old and I'm a hundred thousand dollar larger life policy did you know you can convert that my policy into cash right now I'm not kidding you can turn your life insurance policy in the cold hard cash\nI Know the economy's been a struggle for many people need cash they need it right away and you can get cash right away for your life ... if you're over Seventy five young one hundred thousand dollar or larger life ... you don't want you to write this number down give these folks who call it's all free\nGet rid of those insurance premium stopping those turned that policy in cash right in this number down eight four four we buy Seventy five use the cash to pay bills medical bills whatever call each word for word W.

shoulder\nAnd he and I don't you for telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that there are different people and all they want is a better life and that we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I ask myself how in the work and this guy vouch

people are beyond reproach and he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does\nTo suggest that Trump or the Republicans might actually be behind this\n\nThey quote Trump from his rally last night the Democrats don't care what they're extremist immigration agenda will duty or neighborhoods or your hospitals are your schools they don't care that the mess\nCalming will totally bankrupt our country\nAnd then they quoted tweet from Trump every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws remembered that meant germs\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats spoke\nAsked about the timing worry them a national Democrats strategist ed in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this even before the caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks said it is very difficult to win on emigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony and the Republican policies like family separation\nAnd deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat on Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter\nThat he made the point the military to the border and threatened to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which she has doubled down on by the way so this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him\nBecause it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] that they think is behind this\nSome of the stuff in the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be\nOn attached to it or disengaged from it when when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are every day anyway\nWhether people show up and groups of two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump\nRight before the midterm elections which it is\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind those and the reason I say this it may make no sense it makes it worth it because this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this smoke they're not rational right now this group of people\nThroughout the media the Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt

got ... out there promising subpoena power saying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as a reason for the Democrats to win back the house they have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality and their perplexed\nBecause none of what they have done has worked in a white has worked its it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nTo
