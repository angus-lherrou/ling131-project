time let's wait for information might be a crazy guy and might be and so it was amazing to just say I'm a lot of people will make a prediction with no evidence on something like this right they'll say oh it was a right wing or or it was a left where\nAnd then when it turns out to be one of those two they claimed victory as if what they did was was a good idea and it wasn't that not a good idea you know the fact that you come out and you say are you blame the right with no evidence and then it turns out to be someone on the right that doesn't make you we're we're process good right like I

... at the very least is at least we can hopefully ... avoid any injury remember there's been literally nothing that's happened with these been a big media spectacle but you know ... much less of a media spectacle that what happened when Trump and many others Madison and others and the government received white powder in the mail\nLast week or two weeks ago so you know I obviously we know why it's a bigger a bigger deal now number one it was a media member specifically that was targeted in this with CNN getting one of the packages and number two obviously\nUh the uh the the chance to kind of blame this broadly against the right is going to be something that the media is going to take advantage of it at all possible\nBut we don't know yet and we'll find out from the person to see if they were ... you know how serious the attempt was when we look at the bottom construction will find that out and we always find this you know it's all you want more information quickly but getting

and he's got GOP stickers all over the uh\nThe window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty this afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients\nBy the way our Cory Booker of New Jersey senator and the former director of national\nIntelligence James Clapper ruby recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them\nThat some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them had been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab\nTo study them they had to go ahead and detonate them a blow 'em up because they might have\nBlown up in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to then there's still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks\nAnd this is typical during events like this isn't everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first news on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on and on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a\nSpeculation law enforcement's undoubtedly going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they like trust or what have you\nSo there's going to be a daily use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe the first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just when they had an assigned this guy as a pro Trump anti Democrat guy\nIdentifying the the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomb or the ... bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide presumption\nThat the bomber was an angry Trump supporter set up at the people Trump is but this is this is the uh [noise] the narrative if you will drive buys attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are what\nAre matters of same thing is happening today with the economic news we haven't GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected\nAnd so the drive by reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression\nAmong the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\n\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic\nGrowth is it didn't come into the ... to predict in three point eight to four percent is I guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath\nSpecifically Google also all of his alphabet\nAnd Amazon have reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive buys to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama\nWe didn't see that much before Obama and see it very often this economy still struggling right along with the drive bodies are reporting the day\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this\nFrom the media light a headline Trump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms nobody talks about this yesterday this was a I fought a left wing media narrative that it created\n\nBut apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump to today complained about the pipe bombs being sent to prominent Democrats lamenting the scare has distracted from news about the midterms and even Sloan Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly swallows\nNews is not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote that this week\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then\nNobody nobody has you might just his I sadly I Wish it weren't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the news\nAnd what is it and if there isn't any\nNews about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or none of this stopped or it's not newsworthy enough anymore so the bomber thing has come along\nI mean it ... the caravan that news stop being reported but more and more importantly all of the news about the heavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling ...

this is the kind of news that is not being widely reported and therefore people in Florida are not being told this\nAnd it's one of these I'm sad reality is that the daily reporting the news does affect what people think their perceptions\nOf ah of what's going on and I think that's what Trump is a is talking about here\nThe way people think amazes me is always\nThe [noise] when you want me to

know that there's no red I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are\nAnd I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house\nOnce the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that Feisal document and that the CIA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen and I think the I think this package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national strike group planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in this election for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing

viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\nAnd to be exam\nFrom having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this man I mean if you if you wanted to decorate\nAnd dressed up a van that says notice me and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable and a

percent is free points higher than Obama's approval rating under twenty ten minute terms does anybody remember what happened to twenty ten midterms\nThis ... a little pop quiz on history now
