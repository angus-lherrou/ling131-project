Lee disassemble your heating and air conditioning system have completely clean\nSanitized disinfected and put it back together and that can get expensive we're talking thousands with an S. okay\nA little piece of free advice folks if you're going to buy a one inch filter by one from your local big box store your age your lowers your home depot wherever it is that you're going through filters nowadays and here's the number one rule the number one rule is to get a filter that you cannot see through\nOkay if you can hold your filter up and you can see your hand on the other side\nNot a good filter okay that's basically is and sister take that out are looking for gold or something take that to the beach with you we call that a rock stopper it's good for golf balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at filtering your air\nAnd it's not going to protect your heating and cooling system and you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive okay that's\nWhat the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay\nOn people spend some money on a good filter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money\nNow the correct one for you to buy if you're going to get a one inch filter is a one inch police did\nFilter that's P pleaded filter\nLook for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip okay goes up and down and up and down\nAnd it's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big span um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouth your system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and\nIt can cause some day\nEdge alright so I'd buy one that costs between maybe six Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs it or not no look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter starts to look a little dirty it's becoming harder to move the air through it and when that happens\nYou use more electricity operating your blower motor\nAnd the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor it'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat pump your furnace or your air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you\nYou will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a five inch thick pleaded filter on\nSome of these five inch filters will fit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive than the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly have your rock stoppers you're saying sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in droves they give you a great\nReturn on investment okay\nThey'll look we've only got a couple of minutes left in the show folks and I've

again they're not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me that if the\nCaravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it and building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is\nAre they just want to come to America and that may yet happened down

because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now and there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid germs at the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hip hip it never was going to happen I don't\nThink anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure\nThat was a media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electorate hasn't happened yet everybody wants to rely on ...\nFrom four sons credit union a free ticket

bill hemorrhage says Mike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them we're also deeply concerned with the violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way they [noise] the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it rains and mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media in a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this\nWho in their right mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who won that right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world wouldn't want that and why\nIt\nMakes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America what ever motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else\nSo Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this and they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall Porsche on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nOne of the world is so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't\nLived long enough to know what's best are being driven solely by a motion\nGovern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense\nAnd because there's some odd quirk that's happened in our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefit from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life\nAnd having a masked a bunch of experiences there is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just raise the border and saint of the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement\nTo the United states taxpayers back pocket\nBut the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do the Democrat Party is calculating that there are more people who want to get into the American taxpayers back pocket than there are American taxpayers\nAnd so the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement\nWe have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any\nBreakup commonsense take a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate\nI don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're

deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said the fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get through it uh in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOutward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion\nAnd thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can use the military because a positive comments out of ...\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military just stopping invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it\nYou would dare you you you he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't this isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way for the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we could make that case what do you think the people will be demanding Trump do stand aside left to seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the joke you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think dogs trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all of it on good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nBecause of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized just a border that if they bomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\n... house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bringing back in for a special session or do what passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that short\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacle that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump\nExactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is the best people plan this thing\nExactly and that's where he can't try to deal with this on his own leads to put everybody else or but on the line good I'm On tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer\nAnd Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot\nOf different ways will

hate\nYeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show\nAt some conventions setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gotten so far beyond you're not expecting the president to pet it anymore but what is troubling is to look behind him and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how as as to who believe [noise]\nAnd he does it I think because it's still works it's still rile people up divides us horribly\nYeah oh it's just it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear every election there's Jeff Flake a who himself has been rejected by people like you and Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling to look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this\nHe does that I think because it's still works at sea so Trump promised he pretty smart Trump knows when he's Trump knows that you're idiots and Trump knows that you're ... and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working his son got like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump hers have resent the hell out of Trump because Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid\nNow you are which takes me to want peace that I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurking brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale his specialty is computer science but we have cited his work countless times\nOn this program over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the Limbaugh letter way back when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist at detach L L C most recent book tides of mind\nAnd his piece yesterday the real reason they hate Trump\nAnd let me give you a simple quotes from this piece every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating for a reason most commentators forget to mention the Democrats have no issues\nThe economy is booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered\nIn the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased prince says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared in contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any on us leftist\nFor future generations the capital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to the shore rains and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan the whole Kavanaugh episode was was\nIntellectually bankrupt it was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it even to the point of tearing not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has none left\nAs this ... says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to stave liberalism from certain destruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the left only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America and hate America it does folks\nNot that every leftists America but the leftist I Know right to alert or at ... they do hate Trump\nThey hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood as they hate his certainty that America is exceptional\nThey hate his mistrust of intellectuals\nThey hate his love of simple ideas that work they have\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable\nAnd worst of all she doesn't have any ... except getting the job done\nHis goals are to do the task before him not be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself in vans and uses\nI'll tell you folks and this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity a day but they sit there and hypocritical claimed to despise Trump's\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blond they hate he is certainty that America is decent than exceptional\nThey hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have had some serious problems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nCertain that I didn't have any doubts about what I believed I've had so many\nPeople it's just not right and everybody is that you you just don't wait too you know nobody can be that kind of an open I Am I Know your full of it I Know you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this or you wouldn't be doing the right thing\nThey can't stand that they love it quid vacation they love people see both sides of the things they he reaching out\nWith the heart they hate certainty especially when it conflicts with their own\nBack to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates him or because he's filthy rich always has been\nAnd unlike other rich man he rebels in well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever he never learned to keep his real opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities guy likes women doesn't see the need to apologize for\nSometimes he's treated women disgraceful you for which Americans left in Ryder shamed of him as they are of JFK and Bill Clinton but Gartner says my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America\nI'm Sorry

reference to the mall but he didn't want to call them all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality\nSaying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the border John's on the ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mark they use what whatever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people well that's good for them but when it's like when they want to use the humanitarian side\nIt's such a disaster that there's you know thousands of the line on they couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\n\nThat oh NPR's at great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to you that for that day listen to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can\n[noise] that you know for we've got a bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here uh\nAbout the only time I've interested in NPR is when they run pieces to translate what I've said oh for the audience and\nAnd that happens when I get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three way\nA lot of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and or ... or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day as I Believe\nAnd they just they just they just they just human beings I guess it can have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB zoo want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an insult base screw with Trump Trump's Hitler trumps the Nazi this there is no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to\nFlood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited and cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of deny the entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but there's no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um\n[noise] I saw a video

past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way folks [laughter]\nThey don't look like the kind of people you'd want to run in to\n[noise] you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at them they're behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's ... he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and then they're decent people and all they want is a better life and we as Americans we owe it to these people and let them in\nThe all they want is what we want we all have these various humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how wouldn't work and this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching\nHim that these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nAnd he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nThen they quoted tweet from Trump every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our\nThat a gimmick racial laws remember the germs\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents of turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north\nHave the Democrats spoke asked about the timing worry them and national Democrats strategist ed in the Senate yeah [noise] what [noise] so in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this even before\nThe caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks said it is very difficult\nTo win on emigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most draconian Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers\nPersuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focus statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border\nAnd threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which she has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration\nWell [noise] if they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway\nWhether people show up in a group of two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in another worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump\nRight before the midterm elections which it is\nThat [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind those and the reason I say this it may make no sense it may as well because this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this once they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media\nThe Democratic party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone\nYou gotta put yourselves in their shoes every\nDay they've gotten up for two years and I've read in the New York times I'll Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with food is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has been goods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop drop in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them and I got ... out there promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality and their perplexed\nBecause none of what they have done has worked in a white has worked between it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nFit to be tied\nOver it they're at their wits candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five

mid term elections this doesn't pass the smell test\n[noise] um I actually think in all ... what's going on barring a the revelation of what really this is about if we ever learn mad I think I'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative\nAnd you've watched everything blow up on your watch cabinet blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you if all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports than at\nRestaurants at all that's blowing up on you and it is by the way it's not working what could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs storm restaurants and harass\nAnd threaten and bully Republicans what could you be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing that really makes any sense\nTo show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system with so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans that other people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans do\nOther words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt to spread the hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got\nIs we hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment\nThat's all they've got and so if none of that work if all of that backfired\nAnd ball leave me and has especially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of words that has backfired on them like you can not believe\n[noise] so what would you do you might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side you might want to do something to make it look likely insane lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact\nOf lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it okay let's get some of the election analysis the midterms are\nThirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly\nWhat what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there\nAnd do something called a real clear politics average of polls and political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as\nAn unassailable source so Tom Devon cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox\nBusiness Network today he said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point me it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top\nOf it here and Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they have a real clear politics and analyzing\nIt's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way and that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing he says the house races are really tight they are race by race\nReal battles hand to hand combat is how he described it he forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now\nBecause they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one the seats they're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five of them so it's two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise] so all of this synthesized and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this\nBlue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing the generic ballot is not moving and Democrats favor Trump's approval numbers are rising\nOver on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change Republicans wouldn't gain or lose any\nTwo weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past week cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise] and Trump is the great unknown as these rallies\nContinue now another retired historian and political analyst sends an email that I received a lawsuit but I've been there but that but there was just this morning\nAnd I'm going to

Russia's weeks in reviews are quick question seriously [noise]\nMany Republicans right now in the midst of this political campaigns on a two thousand sixteen midterms how many how many Republicans [noise] because they have the Clintons or Obama on their radar\n\nNo no I mean how how are the are the Clintons an obstacle for the upcoming midterms the ... no ... is Obama an obstacle in the no I mean what the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar\nExcept they are today I mean the Clintons announced yet this Clinton's announced this nationwide stadium tour third teen locations\nStadium tour they're going to charge admission for people that come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about\nPolitics what\nWhat if there isn't a whole lot of interest in that [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clintons are done anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phone in collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\n\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred in so much anger wife in the mirror here's not sick I just it's just to pet it it's just it's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what in form\n... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is uh we'll see we'll let time\nUnfold here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Russia then within that there was a kid a riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate thank you very much\nRussia you know it's a you talked about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh we have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting\nThese bombs in the mail you know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be on by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYeah that that information is not out there for the masses to obtain you know quite being there were never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right away to point fingers at certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and muggy video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's well it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\n\nThis was going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around\nWhat does it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat in cocaine and a lunatic to do it because\nThings are not working out the way they thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us\nFor the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe their lives remember\nThey believe their pollsters if the polls are telling there is a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it\nAnd they start reporting it and they just compounds itself\nAnd it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trick backfires and these mobs are backfiring\nThey are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention there's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab Lee a\nTweet here is really strange\nLadies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up as a wedge issue\nIt is time for the Democrats the step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as weak and then lose", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city":
