Lee disassemble your heating and air conditioning system have it completely clean sanitized disinfected and put it back together and that can get expensive\nWe're talking thousands with an S. okay\nA little piece of free advice folks if you're going to buy a one inch filter\nBy one from your local big box store your age your lowers your home depot wherever it is that you're going through filters nowadays and here's the number one rule the number one rule is to get a filter that you cannot see through okay\nIf you can hold your filter up and you can see your hand on the other side\nNot a good filter okay [laughter] that's basically is and sister take that out are looking for gold or something take that to the beach with you we call that a rock stopper it's good for golf balls bats butterflies and stuff like that okay but it's not good at filtering your air\nAnd it's not going to protect your heating and cooling system\nAnd you need protection your heating and cooling system is expensive okay that's what the filters for for crying out loud okay and these people they get these little ones that you can see through I mean I can watch TV through it okay come on\nPeople spend some money on a good filter good filters don't cost you anything they save your money\nNow the correct one for you to buy if you're going to get a one inch filter is a one inch police did\nFilter that's P pleaded filter\nLook for one that resembles the ridges and a ruffles or wavy potato chip okay goes up and down and up and down\nAnd it's going to cost you somewhere between six to twenty dollars and I know it's a big span um I don't think that I Would go for the twenty dollar one and the reason why is because while they are great filters\nThey tend to be pretty restrictive alright the machine has a hard time getting the air through them\nHaving one of those little one inch twenty dollar filters on your furnace or heat pump or air conditioner is like your eye running down the street with a wet cloth stuffed in our mouth\nYour system just has a hard time breathing through those kinds of filters and it can cause some damage All right so I buy one that costs between maybe six Fifteen dollars and here's the ticket folks are you ready for it\nChange it every thirty days whether you think it needs that are not no look I can see how that might be confusing for some of you out there but here's the deal when that filter starts to look a little dirty\nIt's becoming hard to move the air through it and when that happens you use more electricity operating your blower motor\nAnd the top that off it damages the blower motor and it damages your compressor it'll damage a lot of things in your system I mean filters have zero sympathy for your heat pump your furnace or your air conditioner okay so change them every thirty days please and I promise you\nYou will absolutely thank us for it long term okay\nNow the other thing you could do is put like a\nFive inch thick pleaded filter on some of these five inch filters will fit right on the side of your furnace or your air handler and they are way less restrictive than the little one inch twenty dollar ones and they do an amazing job and I'll tell you what\nYou only have to change them about every six sometimes twelve months and that people just love\nSo thoroughly hey you're rock stoppers you're say an sisters folks and get yourself a good filter good filters don't cost you a penny they pay you back in droves they give you a great return on investment okay\nNow look\nWe've only got a couple of minutes left in the

Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of 'em and Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host of doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything me remind\nYou of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were every might do it frequently I I I Know one time he gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're gonna have and will fund we're going to watch a horse race you had videotape of a horse race that\nNobody obscene and it was not a big race is that allow the players to make friends leave that send away Andrews on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bets and Donald ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer about somebody who's gonna win\nPlayers go nuts making their choices tape resumes that check stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear\nMaking their bet half the final turned ballot checked stops the tape of horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional beds or get out of ones they've made\nLayers do what they do that much ... resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known at the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to win yet look what you were doing you were making bad humor guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you it was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter half time or third quarter them to\nDo your job\nSame thing here polls in January in front of a November election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything\nThey're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome\nAppalled in July or August would not a contained any of the Kavanaugh news so how relevant could've been answered non ... zero not up\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRaces or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot they've had this in in in the in the can it's been in the bank since last December in their mind it's been over it's just a matter of ... out\nNow all of a sudden house races\nAre tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate but wave red wave and the Republicans could come out I didn't know where at about fine old current and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we don't want anything\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know anything until the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night now one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen I Am the reason he saying this and everybody else because of my viral production of last week that if the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything\nThat production of mine went viral a drive by loved it\nThey love it when the leader of the G O P and their minds me starts ripping the Republicans when I start predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run the sound bites me predicting all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite\nHe's just the exact opposite why all this attention on Capitol on what the Republican is actually going to help them how can that they live on just said they were going to lose\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win and the people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that are really fire 'em up that will fire buddy up no the way you get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the bandwagon the way you get people wanting to be on your team is when\nIncluding winning the capital nomination now let's go to further news buttresses some of this from the hill dot com red state

[noise] well it sounds like\nThe news reports this we had our uh our accurate and of course this this it just doesn't jibe with with any of the news we keep hearing about Republicans being\nDepressed uh\nOn eager waning enthusiasm and all of that\nAnd it's just it just just kind of thing all during the two thousand sixteen campaign remember all of the experts said this doesn't matter you can't judge\nThe way an election is going to go by campaign rallies they ... they don't mean anything I mean every candidate is going to have a rabbit and followers it'll show up at her doesn't mean anything well Hillary didn't\nShe couldn't fill a symbol\nBy comparison but they relegated all of these Trump rallies and the enthusiasm and the the high attendance to irrelevant see and they're doing it again in this case they're ignoring it when they do report on it it's it's always with us mark\nAbout the attendees and where Trump goes and they are forgetting that Trump is not doing national rallies he's doing local rallies for local candidates\nI'm with you noticed if you've watched any of these that the candidates Trump is going into endorsed always endorsed Trump\nEndorsed the Trump agenda they speak\nGlowing lay of Trump I saw story and the drive by media\nCommented on this is a Trump demand that the candidates he's going into support seeing his praises this is a critical piece trying to show Trump as I'm insecure dictatorial\nAnd demanding people on the battle that may not even supportive they have to ... to him they have a great he is or he won't show\nAnd it just it's it's it's more fake news and it's an ongoing attempt to ... everybody associated with Republicans and Republican candidates and so forth\nBut the reality on the ground up this rally in Johnson City or any of the others can't be denied the evidence is there for one and all the seat\nBack after this somebody has to have much to say Russia's probably ... be met for\nRadio nine\nSimply say if there's another one of our great success stories fantastic protection simply safe system is easy to use it takes just minutes to set up\nAnd they're no contracts you know hidden fees twenty four seven monitoring only fourteen Ninety nine a month visits simply safe usa dot com to order your simply safe system now\nMy listeners get ten percent off\nJust go to simply safe usa dot com\nFor ten percent off simply safe U.

Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was a\nAll Trump is still is reminding everybody what\nShe said she doesn't know she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country\nAnd accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious places you can't point out obvious discrepancies\nYou cannot reference or make mention of the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking\nKristin balls the Ford now Trump has a lot of people saying well this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible entered testimony was compelling I have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all\nWays eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that\nOut of the batter's box I have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers are in this case Dr ... foreign he'll color credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility\nIt makes people kind of cock their head and they don't think Trump can be that fair I'm Talking about the meeting on the left are Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility even later to be critical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling\nThen as we learn more and then there's the vents play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on what is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally\nWhy there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense we've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything it's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember\nThere haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it than will do the right\nOh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's\nReally thinks it's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans\nHave not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a stab wished that after he makes it initial statement on somebody and he can make fun of things and what really irritates left he gets away with it I cannot tell you\nHow ... irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has had this continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane it has made them with rage other Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand eight this was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nAnd Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not marketing her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just simply probably she she can't backup she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant\nWhy does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined the can you imagine if there was something going on they can you imagine of men organized\nFor the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell\nRoche women women or nor do we do\nWell yeah yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even ban and set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed and Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and then been ridiculed and made fun of for the rest of his life you could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not\nUh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump\nDid was say what everybody following this\nKnows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of ... and her story\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot of cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed Trump said\nGuilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous for our country that's what this is\nThat's what the Democratic party isn't so and that's what Democrats senators have said that the accused has to prove we didn't do it that the accuser doesn't have to corroborate anything the accuser doesn't have to prove anything where in what civilized society is that ...

Review um\nThe more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activist or not really arguing about politics and all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years\nI have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together is one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics for the solution\nOr the river bed is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ... this this um [noise] ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the um [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible and so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy and then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether\nBoys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nThat's sick ... in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism\nAnd so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in\nFor men who have abused every woman out there he's right balls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter because it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them\nAnd by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think\nWith black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nA all cops are bad every white cop as of
