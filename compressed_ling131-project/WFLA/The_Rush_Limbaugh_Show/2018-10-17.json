it does apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did I said well no because I wasn't aware

didn't do because most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know there and watch will work on why five most people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learned was a wife I network like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone or the

was a teacher I just retired and I have been the biggest Trump supporter out there\nFor for my when does your support for Trump again\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the reasons that I see\nA during the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay\nAgainst the seven anyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and yes and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life\nThat these people aren't happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair\nAnd my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high right now for not only my shelf people in the neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening um he said the Trump ...\nAnd he says the only reason the only way I can get my message out well\nHis choice to good but not that many people really hear it and I can't understand why he does not address the nation I don't understand [noise]\nWait a minute when you say when you say package you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm going to really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which treat tweak most of the time\nAnd the press conference they ... they skew anyway so if he addresses the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done this is the greatest time economically that I can never remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit for the country doing well in that shocks you ride\n[noise] you know not any more at a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen\nHow we can take each bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a national impressed and try to reach people that his tweets don't rich or audio ... that he that he doesn't rage but your real frustration of the U.S\nIs with a news media and many people are in the same boat who are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and they have no idea they hire a newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if the reason\nThere but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a ... wage is going up\nOr might never seen anything my\nPoint is I think you're going to be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you can be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not carry that covers surprised they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nWe take a break for that has to have much about the Russian public ... being met for

the remaining two hours which are streaming have we have a brief obscene profits we do make those\nRight here in the top of the hour and back\nTo keep on keep an eye on after this [noise]\nAnd it's amazing how honest it is about what journalism is now this is not about contemporary events there is nothing in this series about Donald Trump\nOr Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece in other words the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them is\nVery serious take themselves very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise]\nDon't focus on the celebrities the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins is the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is\nDestroying people\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not\nBut it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously\nHave to be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the concerts breaking the rules there has to be something they're mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out\nAnd and and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to us and people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist ... little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a a a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this trans Russian or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved\nTo adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin on it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no one's about it I I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars and I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google any of them but I watched this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ... and I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brave in early on is this is\nOne of the the editor the head honcho of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected\nBy life to him every body is a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the white guy just journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor who has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k.\nNo no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship they not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nArranges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being beat up I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in\nAnd the editor says you don't run me you don't control me\nAnd it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you would have ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like and live with it and the president I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures and the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise] it's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you wouldn't have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief\nThat everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter]\nIt's amazing how this in the eyes\nOf a journalist an editor\nNow I imagine real journalists are going to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women the competing\nEditor of the queen paper the above board and paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day\nBecause she can't confirm the ... story while the other paper puts it on the cover of having confirmed it because the editor at the other members dug don't care whether it's true or not wondering calls that got as a beat up I'll just get it up there and get it on the news stands\nWhereas the female editor didn't have the guts\nTo run it and sell the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking they obviously you're not worried about the me too movement here ever put this thing together so the name of it as press I have no idea it's it's I think it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them so I just compete in completed it's um it's run cycle\nI'm a\nWell rework and so forth to make it look like we're about to fall off a cliff ... we ... that this recovery is just hit a wall\nUm [noise]\nI don't know how effective it would be um but I don't I I wouldn't I wouldn't sit here and unilaterally suggest to you that it\nCouldn't it couldn't happen a\nAnd particularly the areas you mentioned they would love to be able to discredit Trump's tax cuts they would love to be able uh to\nDiscredit a whole bunch of other with Tara ups and what it's doing to trade the problem is\nReality reality on the ground if the if if if the if the numbers are\nAre referring to that extent it just isn't going to jive with reality and it's it's it wouldn't be I don't think nearly as effective as something as personal but I think you have to you have to look at the history of these October surprises\nThey've tried October surprise\nIn October they've tried them in September\nThey've thrown everything they've got at Trump including\nDuring the campaign the Access Hollywood video and that didn't work\nNow he's out there are calling the porn star who by the way is a back stabbing black mailing double crossing porn star is that they're calling a horse race and there are shutters\nAnd the drive by maybe a few Didi of the\nPresident's doesn't next you know what I find interesting about this\nAll of these so called parent kinds of virtue on the left we're wandering perversion has become normal in their world and they demand that we accept wanting perversion as normal\nThey sit there and act like [noise] oh women Austin but we're not talking to a woman we're talking about\nA dual ... uh what porn star double crossing\nBack stabbing woman who has tried to destroy the guy with her third rate lawyer\nShe's not just an innocent ordinary everyday woman the Trump decided to call it a name she is a woman who attempted to him\nBut for these liberal Democrats these people in the media to act like people don't talk to sweat presidents don't come on people talk\nThis way this is what ... what I resent about this the idea that they are cleaning shores but wind driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock\nSimply look at the things they say about us during the course of your average political day from\nYour Hitler through your Nazis to Europe this or that they make fun of people's appearances they make fun of people I mean they're they're comedy has become literally hate\nAnd then they act like one of the greatest social trends question your history of humanity has occurred when Donald Trump uses the term or\nSpace or when he did not mark balls the Ford but simply ... feet in\nThe truth about her allegations\nI just I just find that that just a little bit\nHollow as low take your pick take ... take your pick any left wing or on media\nGriping about Trump's using the word horse race and ask yourself if that media reporter\nNever talk that way and the answer but Russia these people are president and he is and this has been nice the dignity of the presidency\n[noise] well I Know they look at it and think of it that way my point is\nThey can try all day long that's not going to separate Trump from his motors now some of his voters like\n[noise] she showed that in fact that there's so much good going on here and focus on that don't don't need to distract every body with that stuff\nBut he did\nThere also gonna they're not going to give up trying to link Donald Trump to the murder\nOf the uh of the journalist was in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul a dramatic a shaggy they're still working on that but I think they're frustrated to no end that nothing they do works and now\nI have a story I have to print I haven't had the chance to printed yep just cleared the transom here uh it's about Trump's approval numbers are probably much better

Seventy WFL age [noise] and when you went to the Clearwater\nI feel it's big our top story of two o'clock for the attorney general Pam Bondi has issued a stern warning for anyone business owners who may be price gouging following hurricane Michael\nDonald Trump simply took it upon himself to inform the American people what the drive by maybe were hiding that she didn't know anything about the event she couldn't tell anybody where it happened when it happened\nShe couldn't describe the house where it was\nShe wasn't even sure of the year much less than a month she\nIdentified for people over there all four said they were not there she did not have any answer for how she got home what she said that the person she first met after this happened none of it all Trump dead was remind everybody of this or actually inform them because the drive buys had\nNot and that then cause the meat eater run the story of Donald Trump saying this because they hadn't been hiding it they hit it because it was not helpful to their ... their claws which was getting rid of Cavanaugh\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence places\nPeople there who deny that were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer the media not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap and reports over and over\nTrump saying it while accusing him of mocking her mocking is not what he did\nTo mock or he would have had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonator he simply reminded everybody in real world language that she had no evidence\nAnd it was the turning point\nIn the outcome of those hearings make no mistake once Trump\nDid that and caused the media to end up reporting what they had been ignoring\nThan\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls e for advantage jihad no evidence there was nothing to support\n\nPeople with common sense there was nothing that you believe her yeah the basis of what well a set of that one but she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said there were there and say they weren't\nShe became impossible to support and defend other than by partisans and that was the turning point in cabinet came in and of course his his re testimony is re appearance was a subtle factor now the whole thing is happening again\n\nThe story was that the porn stars defamation lawsuit a Trump got thrown out\nIt was a nothing burger\nForum months the drive by media reported that Stormy Daniels\nAnd the creepy lawyer that she hired ever not we're going to destroy Donald Trump they were going to prove that Trump had violated campaign finance laws to remember all this\nAnd there was Michael Cohen in the mix and he'd paid are often Michael Cohen's slipped and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how was he is but the media invested\nA lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform whatever polls she was slithering around the drive by Israel they're making a hero out of her\n\nStormy Daniels became a cause lab even before ball vie for dead\nAnd then that fell apart\nA judge in Los Angeles threw out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump\nClaiming it was bogus it had no merit\nSo in one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished\nPolitical and so did\nThe lifespan of her creepy porn lawyer who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges it that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo old Trump did\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to what news story that the drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was drunk Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact she had been found\nGuilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay his legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here the the the prostitute porn star is paying Trump\nWho among us can arrange it that way folks but Donald Trump can\nThey also ignoring that part of it ignoring\nThat the stripper porn star had been ordered to pay Trump's legal fees\nBut when Trump called her horse space in a tweet all of the media were forced to run the story of his victory so you can sit there and say that Trump is embarrassing\n'cause they were just stopped talking and I'm thinking of ways it makes it so hard to\nRemember what I told you about the white Trump operates and pacing how he his original take or opinion on any issue might make you think he's selling out but he gets that first take on the record\nMedia says wow that's a very reasonable you said that Dr Balt the Ford was very credible American phone shantytowns surprising then after the passage of time with Dr balls the Ford clearly has no evidence Trump says you've got no evidence and here's the evidence that she has no evidence blah blah blah and\nTrump gets his news covered\nThe media was not reporting this lawsuit of it from the media was not reporting and she had to pay him it was legal fees the media was not reporting of being\nTrump win and remember what was this woman and her lawyer we're trying to ruin Trump campaign finance violations and all that so you can say you may not like the methodology but it ends up where he has an email\nFriend of mine said this is ingenious at work\n[noise] trust Trump\nYou mean so but he thinks it calling her horse race was genius somebody\nYes [noise] in an email that I have

our ambassador and three other men brutally murdered in Benghazi\nSomebody explain that to me you realize how much attention is being paid\nTo what\nHas it been confirmed if something happens in this program ... has it been confirmed that ... was murdered by the Fifteen hit men from Saudi Arabia hasn't been confirmed not confirmed so it's still likely or thought to end the story is that\nIt took him seven minutes to die that they dismembered him alive at some point gave him drugs to knock him out and then they listen to music while they did all of this\nAnd of course until I blew up the theory and at the apple watch contain the evidence they ever going to try to make it look like\nProof existed in the form of audio recordings show ... knew what was in store for him and it goes apple watching the recording this stuff and it was somehow is iPhone that very very unlikely\nBecause of it being technologically impossible barring a ... just only two exceptions that I have a tough time believing she'll be even knew to do or how to do but\n\nAll of this concern and remember\nHillary Clinton when repeated questions were asked about how in the world for Americans were allowed to be murdered in Benghazi\nWith no assistance and Hillary Clinton's reaction what difference does it make now she said in frustrates as is anybody see\nA a disparity here in proportion now of course\nWe all understand why the Democrats seriously believe they have a way of blaming Donald Trump for this\nCNN\nAll afternoon has tried to make it look like the Trump knows the Saudis did it and is trying to provide them cover\nThat's it's despicable graphics that they are using to try to make that case\n\nBut I think there's a lot of a proportionality missing here and again I don't think the media realizes how obvious\nThere's subterfuge is the people now anyway you know every uh every home has a a front door with a lock on it Dr balls the Fords home had two ... two doors did you know that\nThe
