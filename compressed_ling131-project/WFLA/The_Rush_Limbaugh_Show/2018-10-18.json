thinks\nThat this is going to watch or gr wells for Democrats\nWere told that George Soros money is a is behind this I don't care who's money it is it's a lot of money to make this happen there are a lot of kids by the way and the magic of\nThe Taliban is the children as it always is there are children\nIn the caravan and that it's kind of like the baby on board science I always hated those I even had one major baby not on board but we're still as valuable\nAs anybody else's inside this guys we had one of those ...\nIt didn't bother you baby on board\nRush maybe on the exact me we had a rush maybe on board little inside that it'll a yellow sign we made it up and it was available at the Rush Limbaugh store but this is the same thing children young children also we must do what we must open the gates we must stand beside we must allow them passage\nSoon got this we have the Mueller\nReport as I say more on that in a moment the ... report is just lurking there there isn't anything really in it in fact we now know probably have a sure bet that there's nothing dynamite in it\nBecause of an audio soundbite I have coming up uh uh never Trump or anti Trump is Phil Mudd this former intelligence official US government\nNow CNN commentator who who is it that would think if you're on the left it think this massive caravan arriving in the United states at our border close to the election who thinks this is going to help Democrats how what helped Democrats\n\nLet's not just Trump separating it was Trump not letting the man\nI go there has to me what it is these people actually are figuring\nThat a massive ... they don't understand that this kind of thing is why Donald Trump was elected Donald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this is an organized bought and paid for invasion image growing\nSo obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here\nVery close to the election and for Trump just sick I saw them and the border patrol on them and to deny them entry or to separate the children from the adults\nSo that's a drive by media can then kick into gear with stories that are already written\nThat are all ready taped interviews with people on the caravan all ready in McCann where these people will say they're shocked they came to America to save their lives were their children and to prove their latest days won't let them and is is unlike anything they ever heard about it and\nCut the pictures of Trump smiling as people are denied entry Democrats think this you know I I Would think that if somebody politically this'll be a conservative group might do this\nTo promote Republican turnout\nThat we don't have anybody on our side who thinks that way but it makes more sense that way\nOr am I missing something\nSomehow a massive group of four thousand people it's growing including kids marching toward the United states with no attempt is making patently obvious what it is these are not people fleeing anything these are not people fleeing the Saudi Government they're not fleeing torture not fleeing\nWill they be playing poverty but that happens every day for thousands of illnesses aren't just treated its plan this morning paper somehow this\nIs supposed to end up making the United states look bad\n\nI'm I'm not ... that's the way these people are figuring it going to play out now we have the mother report\nThat\nWill not be released before the election but we're being told that it is nearing completion and then it is ready to go I went through yesterday what the what the hope here is\nUh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof being released whether we can't do it before the election because of regulations and decency so we're not going to influence the outcome of\nElections but Muller is ready to go and watch them all up and doing well Mueller has been looking for evidence of tropical to go to Russia so if mothers ready to go Mahler must have found the but this is what they want everybody to think\n\nAbout the fact of the matter is it's probably the exact opposite I'll let me find the\nPacific when he finally sounds I hear [noise] that puts this in perspective hang on and I look at this [noise]\nYet won't take long hair folks I as I say I'm having a compressed everything here it is not pretend audio soundbite number tens\nAnd this is this is deep state ranking member Phil Mudd he is a former intelligence official now works as a commentator on CNN last night Wolf Blitzer show the situation room\nHe's a counterterrorism center specials what he is and Blitzer said do you think that Mueller is preparing new indictments\nThe really interesting part of this is a potential report a draft report a narrative if you will from ... and going over Rosen high let me play this out Washington Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation there's going to be some dirt in there so in addition to the diamond I really want to see what's in that in there to report\nOkay so this is one of the mission is going to Mueller report is going to be full of supposedly horrible stuff Trump is none none of which is probably going to be entitled none of which is going to be impeachable although the Democrats win the house they're going to make moves in that direction anyway\nUm but he says the important point of the smaller report will be the\nDirt dirt nothing in which\nThere is nothing less they make it up there never has been any Trump collusion and there never has been the evidence or less they make it up\n[noise] so the smart money is that it's going to be filled with things that are accusatory\nThat blamed Trump's incompetence ineptitude essentially blame Trump for being sold him over his head\nThat it looked like the Russians had worked with him to steal the election despite the fact that there is any hard evidence it's hard to refute the idea of going to make it look like Trump is in over his head doesn't know what he's doing threatens the country with his presidency because of his incompetence\nThat's what it's going to be but let's take a look at an alternative view from Sydney Powell\nWhose work we have referenced many times on this program she has written a\nBook chronicling lay deception and the abuse of power but corruption in the department of justice traced all the way back to the Enron task force many of the same lawyers here we're working with Mahler\nEnter headline and she published this uh yesterday at the Daily Caller Muller is Jay ... is up but that's not enough\n\nMeaning Trump still all the country something here despite the fact Muller hasn't found anything\nThe ... is effectively over writes ms Powell not because Mahler\nAnd not plan to drag this out until they could contact the crime against Trump for a member of his family but rather because the ... up have you noticed how long it's been since anybody even suggested that the president's sit down with the special counsel for an interview\nMueller's reason for existing was the outrageous purposefully propagandize per verification of the Trump campaign and even Trump himself colluded with

insider this tech blog has been misappropriated as a source for this\nIn certain on Google searches they have run a piece of apple insider denying any relation any any\nComplicity in this story so whoever is behind this idea that the murder and the conversations that took place prior to it and during it\nWere recorded by showing example watching her now somewhere on iCloud\nA\n... when you find out that a tech blog that has a famous name hasn't been\nMisappropriated\nAnd has been falsely accused of reporting this in order to give it legitimacy in certain Google searches then I started to question a lot of things about this story\nNot very briefly here's why the the apple watch angle of this doesn't work I Know that most of you don't have apple watches let me just briefly explain to you how they work there are three ways that an apple watch\nCan receive and transmit data and the biggest\nOne the one with the longest range the one that is most capable is not even available in Turkey and that is el he or cellular signals two years ago\nWhen apple in well actually uh fourteen months when apple introduced the series three watch they activated L T E cellular service which for the first time\nMade the watch independent of the phone you can take it out of work out you can do anything you can take it away from the phone and have it operate it would still get emails and messages and their record your workout data and so forth if you could receive a Celtic we didn't need your phone nearby\nSo it was the first time that they they watch\nFailed to me are doing just ceased to be a slave\nTo the phone the other two ways or blow to and wife ... those are the three ways that day they can get to watch and data can leave a watch you take out\nHe out of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey and there there there's no watch\nNo apple watching the world and that it's an apple watch they claim it was wearing\nThe story is that his fiance has his phone out in a car in the parking lot at the consulate there is only one way that watch could communicate with that phone while there's two ways there'd be why and\nBlow to blow to if you have to blow to this week by design it doesn't have much rain sixty feet max you get into an embassy the shielding the I are the protections against other nations being able\nTo monitor and over here and steal signal there's no way that the Bluetooth component of a watch\nWould be able to permeate the protections that an embassy would have to protect itself from just that there's not that couldn't happen so the only other way would be why\nBut that one only work if\nThe wife fine network password of the embassy or consulate had been answered and the wife I connection on one just because the phone connects the wife five\nWhen the phone does the watch automatically connection but not the wife I can next to the phone it's a slave to the phone now if the watch knows a wife I network because the phone it's parents who uses it then\nLike if you're at home or your ... your your phone is inside you have to go outside to walk the dogs you'll come back to the wife I network on your property even if your phones out of range if you've entered the password to the wife I network on your watch as well as on your phone I just don't think she'll be did that\nHe was probably know to do it um I don't\nKnow that they would give them the password how'd he get the password of the Saudi Saudi console don't want to find that the idea that that watch\nWas recording whatever happened to your show and then somehow transmitted up the cloud\nIs just so outside the realm of possibility has to be next to impossible and yet somebody is still pushing this there are still\nPushing that that recording exist that it's somewhere in why fire iCloud into Turkish officials\nLatest vehicle that they think they can get in and\nDrive toward the destination of ruin nation of Donald Trump ...

I should've said acts are should've added this or should I never have that reaction after a radio show every time I'm On TV [noise]\nDamn I should've said that oh darn it why didn't I keep that train of thought going or whatever [noise]\nSo I Want to show you something on a digital camera I got an email here this is about yard signs you know what I've been hearing\nIs that people all over the country are afraid to put yard signs out because literally afraid of leftist knobs coming to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses and so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs that remember\nWe had a call here I just maybe three weeks ago now from a caller who said Russia I'm worried I'm not seeing in the yard signs we saw Trump the yard signs everywhere in two thousand six now I'm not seeing any yard signs at all\nI said well that camp that camp that says it looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist scaring the hell out of a lot of people and if that frightened\nAlso includes scaring them not to go vote\nThere are a lot of people scared to death with these maniacs and that's\nWhy yard signs of not being put out I I just part of me understands it another part of me frayed of yard signs are you kidding [laughter] from the country that stormed the beaches in Normandy we're afraid of a yard sign\nBut it's a different era and these people on the left or crazed or making doing good job of making themselves look that way so\nI have a video taken by it tend crew was worker I Can't I'm not going to show your video on the digital camera so I put it\nTook a still shot that what a pup a pop up here just second this picture you're going to see us from a video\nTaken by cruise worker who was putting up crews campaign signs in uh Houston neighborhood Montrose\nAnd there was this guy get Monica looking guy following the Cruz supporter around ripping up every yard sign ripping it out of the ground and then are ripping it to shreds and at one\nPoint he stormed the Cruz supporter who was a video showing him on his camera\nAnd got this demonic threatening look on his face\nStart shouting till the cruise support or how much she hates cruise despises grows\nAnd I've taken a still shut up put it up there and this is the guy that was running around taking cruise lines down ripping 'em up out of yards and this still shot here storming the Cruz supporter who is holding the camera\nHe actually got within two inches of the camera I didn't still shot that point 'cause all you see is the guy's flaring nostrils\nBut this guy is out there following cruise people around taken a cruise yard signs out and then renting cruise supporters to videotape him doing this by the way this guy so long haired maggot infested rock and roll type you can see that\nAnd Lucian must reds all we didn't think it was a there is nothing [laughter] there's nothing about the stark raving\nMad aspects of today's Democratic Party that is an illusion in his all\nToo real so I'm trying to wonder why even the ... what's the purpose of this piece the left turns not an illusion they want you to know\nThey want readers to know this western is by golly by gosh for real\n\nThe sub bad like many overnight certain stations it has been years in the making what we know this to like go back to the Nineteen twenties in the Soviet Union if you want to trace the beginnings of this\n\nOver the past eight ten years begins Mr Thomas Bee in Seoul the Democrat electorate has moved steadily to the left as liberals have displaced moderates\nSelf identified liberals of all races and ethnicities now command a majority in the Democratic party raising the possibility that view is once confined mainly the party elite have spread to the rank and come on [noise]\nI'm On the ... the Democrat Party elite\nSad to say we're never these radical left is now I'm going back ... Clinton the Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken by the left wing radicals\nAnd that's why some are scratching their heads anyway from two thousand one or two thousand I came to share a democratic voters would describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal\nHe doesn't say that [noise] I'm adding that the percentage of Democrats who say they are moderate has fallen from forty four and a thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen percent\nThat here we go not this is a long piece but this next ... money graph\nReady well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party this they simply leftward according to Gallup\nThe share of white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown since two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this growth white liberals are now roughly forty percent of all democratic voters\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrats minorities identifies liberals those percentages have not been growing it anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrats\nWait a minute\nInto those are the level of white working class was totally go to hell now all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party and the the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is that a record high for Republican candidates\nWhile a substantial percentage Democrat minorities identify as liberal those percentages have not been growing anywhere near\nThe rates that they had been for white Democrat so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nIn fact says Mr Thomas Bee ends all\nWhite liberals are well to the left of the black electorate on some of the social issues take the issue of discrimination as a factor holding back African American advancement white liberals are to the left of black Democrats\nFacing a much stronger emphasis them African Americans\nNow wait because earlier this week we had a story but the Republican Party owns white suburban women right we did so who is who is white\nWomen making up the majority of Democrat liberalism\nWho are back back at them in the shrimp boats were sheltered [laughter] you know I'd be miss work ...\nWhen you add ballet one oh two point nine south Tampa\nFive year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration laws\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight [noise]\nKevin McCarthy ... handed force the lone\nFully funds President Trump's border wall\nExpands kids love the ... and criminals\nAnd insurers lonely of American citizens have the right to vote\nConservatives illusion of America deserves the leadership of President Trump's nice\nThat's conservative God was like\nSo health President Trump visited time for the wall dot com\nAnd tell Congress to best Kevin McCarthy is built the wall and enforce the law\nPay for my safety for the express [noise]\nHey I don't have\nAll right now look it's it takes a lot to get something passed me here we have McCaskill area film reticent in Tennessee and we got to do over ark and we've got this guy tester in Montana and they're all trying to tell us\nThat they're not wild liberal left just sit there centrists and all this except we find out that's not really true or not but here goes Thomas Bee and solve saying don't believe them this move to go after the Democratic\nParty is real and it's solid so Thomas Bee ends all is giving\nHis own Democrats have been a problem he's calling them out [noise]\nNews radio nice Saturdays WFL age ... to clear water\nAfternoon and I'm Steve Hall our top story to the governor he's issued an executive order and hopes of making it easier for people who voted in eight north Florida counties devastated by hurricane Michael\nRepublican district teacher is Liz mayor said yeah yeah it's just another Trump tweet in an on going pattern\nWhen you constantly behave in an outrageous fashion people get immunized and numb to it [noise] and in fact [noise] right on cue I have a piece in the wall Street Journal they're written Mr certainly there's a name Lance tomorrow ring a bell to you [noise]\nLance Morrow used to practically run time magazine back in this I mean he was the premier journalist you not was not an executive but he practically randomly\n\nI met him at Mr Buckley is home here in ... you were good birds but Lance Morrow was a a\nTypical turtles which means means left in so far he's got a piece in the wall Street Journal\nThat is the headline is we've grown accustomed to Trump you always concern is that Trump's\nOutrageousness no longer fuels anger on the left as it should give people just got used to it\n\nAnd then if the anger subsides it's bad because that's the only thing that Democrats have to get their people to the polls\nAnd here comes ... mayor a Republican strategist making the same point but she's not doing it in a positive way yeah you know what this guy's been a river bay for so long and just people who have gotten used to it\nShe says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attacks fuel Republicans like maybe the headline is true the Republicans fear from about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think for a\nMinute here there may be an isolated case of a suburban woman\nThinking that I Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race\nBut this election is really important and people that are involved in this election know how important it is and people that have voted for Trump in the past and have voted Republican know how important\nIt I just don't I don't think the media's learned his lesson yet this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean there's a few votes here\nIt may it may have caused other Republican candidates to it'll\nLose maybe holy elections but but but not Trump\nI just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand that because they're not curious to understand that and\nSo they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults just so totally permissible in American politics\nAnd they assume this is it that zip Trump's finished this has to be it and not even the Access Hollywood video than it\nThis isn't going to do it\nFrom the hill dot com and Trump threatens military action of Mexico does not stop this immigration onslaught President Trump today warned that he may take military action to stop immigrants from crossing the southern border\nInto the U.S may just not take action to stop the also this is the caravan that's headed our way Trump railed\nAgainst Guatemala Honduras and el ... saying that they have almost no control over their population I'm watching the Democratic party land because they want to open borders and existing week laws\nI'm watching a Democrat Party whether salt on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals entering from Mexico to the U.S [noise]\nThese people I don't I talking earlier I'm ... I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help Democrats get votes\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand illegal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\nRight before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying for\nThis somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking things they've got to be using facilities\nSomebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used here I guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who thinks that this caravan arriving within a week say\nOf the mid term election date helps Democrats by itself how does this help that this is what got Donald Trump elected this is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion\nAt the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop\n\nSo what's the calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be\nThat there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on a track there's got to be somebody gets sick there has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incidental violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse and maybe start and by Trump law enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if that's the if that's the game plan but I'm struggling\nTo see\nOther than just the general chaos it's creating and maybe\nThe Democrats thinks that people want to stop this chaos and that this chaos is only because of the Trump that Trump weren't there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this why they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have\nIf this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp let me head back to the phones got time to work some in here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in and this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waiting so you're up next\nBut afternoon rush hey I'm\nAs for the hand of the interview I'm sure being broadcast professionally knocked it out of the park\nUm if you didn't do it and just a second I'd like to say I love it to my wife Kym who's always told me to call you I should call you a call you will finally I got through rush my my point is all these illegals coming up from South America nobody's talking about the fact of the diseases they bring along with them since they're not immunized\nAnd if you've been law reform report recently yeah the new disease out called not a new disease is a disease out this has been out for ... and it's a polio like no it's disabling and also killing ...

I have a different theory on what is going on and why they're waiting I don't think they're ... they're not an accent at all I think if the Democrats for somehow take the house that\nMore will have a scathing report if the Republicans hold it\nLowers report will be much of nothing\nThat's really suspicious of you I mean what do you think of the institutions have your government that there's this big long report that just waiting to be written based on the outcome of the election\nLaw I think they're already written and I'm just I think he's waiting to see which one is you've got to re release\nAll you think you know you think they're both written just determines the election I come to terms which one he turns in\nAbsolutely more is this will all he he is absolutely everything he's there to protect the ... that's ... that's the only\nReason I just uh Clinton things that are protect everybody is hurting you know everybody yeah\nI'm\nOn Russia's been such an honor to listen to you for twenty seven\nYear wait a minute I Need to ask you a question if I Need a given that if you're if you if you think that Mueller has report\nWill the substance of it will be determined by the election outcome why wouldn't modern just just write the Trump did it why why wouldn't they just say that they've found reasonable suggestions that there was inappropriate contact between\nRussia and the Trump got what they can prove it or not why not just do that I mean if there is certainly this this honest which we know they are if they\n... the the idea that one of them are dishonest yeah the idea that we're going to get an honest subset of report from this Munch\nWhich is ignoring the real criminality criminal activity which is Hillary Clinton at whole apparatus that created that dot C.
