impossible\nYou defeat it I've got a chart here doesn't go well on the radio but it demonstrates that since Nineteen hundred\nYou can find with all the charted hurricanes since Nineteen hundred you can find no significant trend in even the frequency or the intensity of major hurricanes striking Florida there simply is no\nEvidence that climate change manmade even exist and there certainly is no evidence that it has anything to do with hurricanes either the number of them are the intensity but that doesn't matter because the New York times and the rest of the drive by an offer to running

control over everything once you the American citizens are blamed and can be blamed for everything that's wrong and you can be controlled to make sure that you you start doing things right and don't keep doing things wrong that's what they want\nThis but in the process\nThey don't even know what they're talking about this guy does know hurricanes from thunderstorms he doesn't know cloud tops some club temperatures and it doesn't matter\n\nI Want to thank Mr surgery for being so sensitive in so concerned about it but I Want to assure you that these kinds of things no longer [noise] bother me other than the I I I Do get concerned that there's so much\nGenuine ignorance existing now in positions that influence the thinking of other people I mean feminist studies\nAt universities I firmly believe has destroyed the futures of way too many women\nIt has just distorted the life it's distorted gender differences it has distorted the concept of happiness victim ... it has distorted the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world\nAnd it's ... and feminism is just one of many elements of liberalism that is doing the same thing too it's other constituency groups for example\nLet me ask a generic question we had Eric Holder out there\nWho is campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia holder supposedly going to run for president himself and twenty funny ah Eric Holder the\nAttorney general for ... same all involved in many scandals himself\nAnd I'm seeing a lot of people on our side and the so called conservative intelligentsia shocked that Eric Holder was saying what he said\nYou know Michelle my bell Obama's out there saying no no my motto is when they go low we go high and holder said screw in that when they go low meaning Republicans when they go low we kick them\n\nSo people's mind God these out their inciting violence and he said no no no no I didn't mean it literally I was saying that we can't take it anymore we have to stop being a nice guys and stopped taking it and he didn't mean it Obama method when he said they bring a knife we bring a gun\nObama met at soldiers Maxine Waters when they're both encouraging people would get in our faces they mean it\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators they're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why\nWhy are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence let's look at the things\nThat they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them we start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house\nIt's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by until we get to a ... day where we can confirm that the Democrats already won that remember we had a poll from CNN a sound bite John King couple of weeks ago\nHe responded to poll indicated the house races are over there are poll said the Democrats are likely winners of the house of representatives over in their minds they won the house in their minds they most won the Senate\nThey have the Mueller report and the mother report is going to link Trump to Russia right they know that Mueller's got the goods\nAll they can taste it folks they can scratch their bags with it they just can't the aid and all that Mueller\nHas secretly collected the goods they know that Mueller is going to issue a report and it's going to tie Trump and Russia and it's going to prove the trumps stolen the election from Hillary Hillary shouldn't be president that should make them happy right\nWhy all the desperation CNN\nEngaging in full fledged one thousand percent racism and directed at\nKanye West yeah Kanye West is what happens to one negro when he stops reading\nThat what they said on CNN with Don Lemon laughing at New York you can get all up wasn't that long ago the cover of time magazine\nWhen was this a\nTwo thousand five the drive by media proclaimed Kanye West the smartest man in pop music\nHip hop's class act\nThe firing the rules of rap Kanye West goes his own way so what would I be Thirteen

photos and why did you do that rally why did you do that rally with a hurricane coming and climate change destroying and why do you can Trump said you know what\nYou have a point but there were people that have been a lined up for a day and a half to get into the ... I couldn't disappoint them I had to go and it was a great time\nTrump to slam dunked him on a number of things in the short little press availability at the White House so now\nA CNN handle calls Kanye West a token negro\n\nWasn't black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the ratio draft don't ... said\nOf a sudden cognac 'cause he's put on a ... hat and he is he's an attention horror like the president needs all of a sudden now the model spokesperson he's talking negro the Trump Administration is ridiculous\nGood afternoon I'm Steve hauled our top story twelve thirty visuals are assessing the damage today there was left behind by hurricane Michael which made landfall in the Florida Panhandle as a category for an evacuees being asked to stay away because of dangers such as downed power lines Senator Marco Rubio\nThe biggest challenge is going to be sort of where do we have people that are going to have no place to live here for the next table for the foreseeable future\nLike all now a tropical storm making its way through the Carolinas\nLending a hand after the hurricane that story comes up next but first to check the traffic would page Herrera from\nThe train traffic center power by climate design where I'm pretty good shape for the most part we are seeing some slow traffic heading south on I Seventy five right near the south and she's Seventy five and should make it into manatee county it's part of thoughts or ... or ...\nRight now there are young people across the world facing a tough choice continue their dream of education I drop outs of health or family put food on the table you cannot change their future in a single mom and the fire support thing going on non dot org page or our news radio nine Seventy W.

don't don't get confused my beef with UPS\n[laughter] I I Know this stuff has lost that is what it is and they're just trying to cover up for it anyway you people are observing out there I got another email rush\nCould you explain to me this journalist named ... show gee let me it's ...\nAnd I'll be ... if if you I'll be glad to\nTell you what I Know about this and it is it is somewhat it is somewhat fascinates name of your mouth is shell game that the president of the United states involved in this now Trump is being openly asked about it and it has to do in many ways with with our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil\nNow ... is Saudi I don't know if he is related to add ...\nNot common ... is is a as a Saudi or Arab name and then your show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity\nBy a a lifestyles of the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer adamant that the source of his wealth which is made to look like a jet setting party animal\nBy Robin Leach so whether whether Jamal casualties are related to him and I couldn't even find outages habit Jamal ... as a critic\nOf Mohammed bin selmont Mohammed bin some on as the crown prince\nIn Saudi Arabia his father is the king king ... he is the brother of the late deceased king king Abdullah their father grandfather uh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many sons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king as such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically\nTo reform the some of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and ah oil\nFocused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends in the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know is wind and dying the Google guy he's winding dined\nFacebook guys met a lotta time an apple\nHe wants to build a brand new city out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off the Arab garb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a really attractive short little stocky\nBut he represents if he is being truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women he is the guy who wants to relax\n\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them all but not being able to drive a go places on their own without male a company but this made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past them last night it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the elite of Saudi well some of them even among the royal family and took over the Ritz Carlton\nHotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding\nA certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it do to corruption and connections and soon as he made a lot of enemies well Jamal ...\nHas as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin Salman\n\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power away from it\nThis reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\n\nDespite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticizing the government and keep your head you don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees\nFor example\nYour mom ... wanted to get married he had to get a wedding lie a marriage license he was in Turkey\nIn order to do that by the end it before that he had supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in the Saudi royal family because of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in is\nSix thirty nine Seventy WFL a the home of lightning [noise] [noise]\nYeah so so not only do we have a female passengers traveling with an emotional

rats at all it is it'll cuter face as a bushy tail out there it's a tree rat it's a rodent and frontier airlines doesn't allow them on their airplanes\nAnd people's that was just so means she needs\nTo support squirrel and I just wouldn't it be great if this is one of these ... lost her mind in Washington over the cabinet and stuff and then there was\nThis Hudson\nValley New York guy arrested after allegedly planning to blow himself up on the Washington Mall around election day because he's\nUpset about that country's direction now do you think this guy is going to vote for\nSkies obviously going to vote for the nearest democratic and find them this is how they're being inspired and further evidence that the Democrats are not about ideas and not about inspiring\nPeople to vote for them because of the great improvements that will happen in their lives Nancy Pelosi [noise] right here\nNancy Pelosi Trump's tax returns a top priority if Democrats win the house now how is that going to benefit your average Democrat voter well I'll tell you how the Democrats have salt poison their voters\nDemocratic voters want revenge\nNot a job not raise not a bonus they want room ... eight Trump and so anything that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promised to make Trump suffer\nYou think that's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't [noise] I don't believe that the country is that it ranged but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is\nOkay to the phones men in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or hide\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I\nSo I was there I was in the for the three days of the nonsense last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I felt was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that Don Lemon and the non said she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan but it's the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this is this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same knocked it and the book in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that hold on here that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind\nThey do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented Kavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked\nAnd so I think you're right they do realize they're losing and you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing a new policies to counter Trump's because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both the right one were silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away at\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media a well some conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the for rats lying\nYup threats lying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs it we don't show up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discouraging us enough to make us not show up that's the only way they win but if Republicans of conservative\nStand up when every single time we just have\nTo show up we have to convince other people to show up and convince them to convince other people to show\nUp you say you were in Washington for three days what did you actually see what kind of activities really engagement you saw I was\nI was right in the middle of it I Would live stream and the whole time but um I went right up to Linda so sour in and told I look at their out there saying I Know it's just

I get a monthly statement ...\nSixteen K yesterday from hey if the if you're an exchange to win a thousand coming up a section of the top of the hour on nine seven WFL law\nBy the way you have seen that millennia Trump set for an interview with ABC not an accident folks\nShe and her husband and the president are teaming up [noise]\nThey have an objective\nAnd I will explain it when we get back [noise]\nSeven that when you have to LA have you ... to clear water you two seven five easy Wesley Chappelle's Show do you do for being branded\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday he will weed out individuals in inside\nHis administration who he does not like that going remarks from his wife the bully millennia Trump about it doesn't say that but you know they wanted to write it\nDuring a live phone interview a Thursday morning with facts and friends the president said it was more true in the past when he was first setting himself up in Washington and he just trust and members of his team\nHe cited Nikki Haley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the great people who now feel his administration he said he's going to do away with people who doesn't like are there are so am I Am not in love with yes we're going to weed them out slowly well she said that ... that this is not coincidence\nThis is not happenstance so ... and Trump both are putting staff in the west wing on notice\n\nA Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get to and I don't want to jump ahead what's going to the audio soundbite starting with number Seventeen sorry sorry sorry uh Thirteen [noise]\nThis is Trump calling in to Fox and friends that I was talking to Steve do see a do see so you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nI really had very little eat other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some we had thousands of people lined up by the time either making decisions on my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours are already\nThat I'm not coming and uh I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has not affected by it we had another great control I don't think really\nThey go to a very hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people are lined up that expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do what it did and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment\nSo the next question in from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder former attorney general said they go low we kick him and the whole room Mr President started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics to be\nCareful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's we're going to discuss things safe and for him to make your is a very dangerous day for older [laughter]\nIs held in contempt by Congress holder went after Christians he went after our great evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle the case\nOr older is they've got some problems\nNot used to be intelligent like this\nIn the old days Eric Holder can say whatever we sat and the Republicans ... whimper away or not even acknowledge or are they would say we\nStrongest term ... we'd denounce rhetoric go out and buy a attorney general holder written in ... but much ... totally totally uncalled for and we we routinely a unilateral condemning\n\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful [laughter] he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I can you better be careful what he's wishing\nNow the stock market's been kinda see song has been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds\nWho I Am convinced would\nWillingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not their wealth but they would they would they would encourage some pain if it meant lowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump\nI have no doubt that there are enough looney tunes on the left who would willingly do this\nI think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it it flies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say well it was a new age ah yeah the economy's\nDoing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that the people don't even leave it liberal even look at our polling data people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThat this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there is a monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump ... pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute if that's all [laughter] when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent [noise]\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression it was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [noise] I'm\nPaying interest at a high rate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well\nThat traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great my whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why and let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so frightening to official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed and do\nThey leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates in what does that do that kills activity\nIn equities markets if these people think the feds are going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy at the time\nTotally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out he's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't drop run to know you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of Tommy leftists as they are many financial institutions are not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning because of Trump\n\nSo that's the great thing a lot of people outgrow it a lot

this not hilarious looking back let's let's retrace steps it was the last debate between the Trump stir\nAnd the hill the beast\nAnd Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them would swear pledge to accept the election results\nAnd Trump said no\nI'm not going to sit here and tell you right now that I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes in and we counted the boats\nThey want it\nI think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for\nDoes your knowledge that you'll accept the results of the election oh of course I'm a great American ... that go sit at that time everybody thought that Hillary was going to win a landslide then they the soundbite would be the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat the upcoming election\nBut Trump crossed them up they said no [laughter]\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans these people are gonna play I'm not going to concede anything tonight Hillary Clinton gets in here\nThis is the biggest threat to our democracy that when you're a member\nDidn't believe me saying there's there's an unwritten sold them Obama we didn't know until\nRecently devised this secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump wins to steal the election away from it\n\nIn October two thousand sixteens senior staff and the Obama White house\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the results\nThey had cause to be worried at that time Trump and openly speculated that the election might be rude during his mind a little bit with Clinton and October the nineteenth you said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would see it\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical\nBetter roads Obama senior aide and speech writer told the intelligence just New York magazine column\nTrump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail than roads seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a hypothetical question what will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and condo laser rice to try and forestall a political crisis by validating we election results so\nThis is not funny looking like there are hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and ... and\nRice and a bunch of ex presidents and they were\nGoing to get them to validate the election result in addition to the official count state by state in addition\nTo the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get Colin Powell and ... rice\n\nIn the event the Trump tried to disputed Clinton victory they would have fun resolved as well as the conclusions rich by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed\nThey hatch this Russia plot way before the election even took place\nAnd no matter what happen no matter what the outcome was they're going to use it for a lost they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was that was going to validate her election even more\nThat was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump She overcame ... she overcame the Olive Garden she overcame Russia and that's what their plan was\n\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russians stole it\nTo this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama this\nStory New York magazine they think they're doing an edible here and they think they're really praising Obama they are admitting that there was a conspiracy behind the scenes dealing with this election and trying to handle whatever outcome\nIn China but I was a smart ass I was a smart alec and I turned I tried to use logic on every example of parental discipline I could\nSo when my mom said that to me after a number of times and I got tired of hearing I said
