the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true\nFor as long as I have been doing this program in the longer we say constantly there's the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges a rule of law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nThe numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not have the numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively other words they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as the laws\nIn America they have to rely on activists jobs just to do it now you\nMight miss it was Russia ... before no nothing new there well there's nothing new about it\nBut particularly its in its relevance its power and it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin a fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are\nIn their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue that these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed\nInto law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that that was forced\nOn the American people by a leftist activist judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise\nIsn't so hates that they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively\nThey need activist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every that this is the point what they believe in the idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\nThey\nCannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about they were in town that they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\nYou have a bomb I had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years\nBut bomb had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you running he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be they routinely\nSoft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of a I'm a general there or is it going to ask who is one of the on display in a leftist district in New York is harmless\nBut you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and massage sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with\nIt they don't have the ability to to win the any of these issues legislatively\nAre you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review this everything they want everything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced on the country\nThe country has been bludgeoned into accepting it\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they sue you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you\nThis is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this is going to lead to this giant gap in blue wave and I don't care even

I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my saying and just world the Democrats are just exceeded in getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king book titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to punish this much ... for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans are not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case for\nDemocrats thinking they're going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election Democrats think the whole country is because if they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that\nThey're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people can be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think this is the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the event had happened and what twenty nine days let it happen\nA true yeah when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is going to be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lot of people I saw him on Fox they a lot of learning puns and commentators oh this was going to be so old by the end I actually heard a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet [laughter] I just have to chuckle\nUm\nNow I can I can see with the passage just be you cannot main thing\nAnd this river passion for long nobody can\nWelded but we're talking about I'm Talking about reasonable people I'm I'm ...

Bush the victory illegally never mind the Florida Supreme Court was out of control the way it was handling all the legal issues here\nThe U.S Supreme Court had to step in and stop it because it was out of control and when they did the Democrats were fit to be tied and from that day forward and George W. Bush was an illegitimate president and he didn't stop being a legitimate and they finally got his approval numbers down to the twenty\nSix years later in the middle of his second term\nWe get the two thousand two and it's the first chance the Democrats have to pay that country back to pay the Republicans back to pay Bush back and they are going to retake the house and they're going to retake the Senate\nAnd they're going to reopen the Florida recount and they're going to make sure that justice is finally done and that Al Gore being duly recognizes it legitimate winner of the presidency even though Al Gore didn't want any part of it by that time\nThey were feeling so up so shore so confident\nThat when it came time for a memorial for their late great senator from Minnesota Paul Wellstone they totally blew up what was intended to be a memorial honoring and celebrating the life of Wellstone\nIt was about three weeks prior to the mid term elections in November of two thousand\nTwo\nThe Wellstone memorial was hijacked by activists Democrats and turned into a pure Paul let it go rally the purpose of which was to destroy George W. Bush and Republicans in memory of Paul Wellstone\nRepublican senators who were friends of Wellstone was due to flee showed up\nAt the arena they did this arena in a place that whole Fifteen thousand people if my memory serves ten Fifteen thousand people\nIt was some time after a while most of them died in the plane crash and it was some time after that but this was the official memorial and it was I don't think it was never intended to be a memorial I think it was a political event from the get go disguised as a memorial\nAnyway Republican senator is not knowing up from down there than I Am Trent Lott and the boys all showed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial\nA religious memorial honor their former colleague Paul Wellstone they worm food and bullied and harassed out of the place within thirty minutes of having a rival didn't sat down\nIt was identical to what we saw the way Jeff Flake and others were assaulted in elevators MBA hallways of the Senate office building\nExcept this was after memorial and this was a Democrat voters going up to the worthy Republicans receded in getting in their faces and pointing fingers at 'em and Boeing after they thought they were there\nTo participate in a solemn occasion they got up\nAnd they walked out and they left\nAnd this memorial turned in to a hate fast\nA hate fast aimed at George W ... a hate fast aimed at George W Bush's policies they couldn't even set aside what had happened on nine eleven for this memorial this Morial took place about fourteen months after nine eleven\nTook place so then the men terms a curve\nAnd I remember I was in my this is the last time this happened I was invited for election night coverage on NBC Tim Russert asked me\nTo join him and Tom Brokaw I Do to fully accepted and I went and I was not on camera all night maybe four or five times while they they cycled other people\nThrough and they brought me and after it was clear that the Republicans had gained the seats on heard of\nThe Democrats just like now we're supposed to win big because Democrats told\nEverybody hated Bush everybody resented the way the Supreme Court stole the election for Bush\nThat Al Gore had won the popular vote just and then the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and nine eleven and Bush's general stupidity and in competence and as such couldn't not wait for the Democrats didn't take back control of what is rightfully theirs\nWashington DC except it didn't happen to Republicans gained ... seats Tim Russert was great broke all brought me out and so what do you think happened here I said the Wellstone memorial\nBut Wellstone memorial is what happened and I went on and told them why and the truncated version of what I just said they knew they were shell shocked\nThey were shell shocked is just not in the formula the party in power does not pick up seats\nIn mid term elections the first ones after a new president is elected so that's a formative experience for me and if it's I like ... if this happened once it can happen again\nSomething it hasn't happened before probably won't happen buddy of mine has then it can happen again and this is a replay of that except this is a replay of even more\nOutrageous behavior but we'll still memorial took place on one night the Democrat Party has been insane on display for two full years\n... longer than that but in the in the context of Trump's election it's been two consistent ears of public arrangement public\nInsanity psychological disorders on display childlike temp by the way I too have sat in the Senate gallery\nAs a young boy [noise]\nMy parents took my brother and me in Washington DC one summer\nAnd the Senate was in session and I'll Remember a Barry Goldwater\nWas among the senators speaking when we were there he was speaking on the farm bill\nI was fourteen or Fifteen\nAnd I remember being in the gallery and I had a it was a pamphlet book some some kind of a a manual explaining what the Senate was in what was going on and I was turning the pages and the Senate page came and grabbed that book away\nFrom me and said you are making too much noise I'll give you this back after you leave just turning up page was not permitted\nThe gallery could not do anything more than ... you were not allowed to chew gum\nPeople were chewing gum and the pages said you're leaving Russia or putting it in a piece of paper and tossing it you're not staying here chewing gum\nThey would come whisper it is to you they took my little pamphlet a way\nI felt like they just stop all had just come and then I'm watching this thing the other night in these in these these these these\nWomen are going batty sounding literally like they are infants out of the boom and they don't want to be there and I couldn't even make out what they're saying\nIt sounded like Christian Adams said it sounded like we were in the middle of an asylum in there and ... my pencil saying over\nAnd over the sergeant an army sergeant an arm to restore order in the gallery there's are done an arms will restore order in the gallery sergeant at arms and having a hell of a lot of trouble restoring order in the gallery\n\nAs I said the United nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the I.
