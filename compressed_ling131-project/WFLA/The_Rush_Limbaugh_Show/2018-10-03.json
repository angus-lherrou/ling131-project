York times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where they got the returns that it's illegal that they have them obviously\nSomebody up the IRS doesn't care I mean the left as infiltrated everything obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has on that that but\nThey've had them now for a year end note when the story runs they ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the\nElection you want to make me wait a couple of weeks\nBut no they ran this thing yesterday\nAnd now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\n\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we got Trump out there they claim he's mocking balls the forty wasn't mocking are well I I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh\nMy God I don't know why president that\nHe did it for some reason everybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it had to everybody has to\nAll this is um investigated and put your but you can't run out there and start ripping on her\nEven if it's desert even if it's warranted last week it could not rip on Christie involves the board there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right even if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate a last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus\nI find a compelling I find her very credible will now she's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible as all kinds\nHoles in Trump just pointed out all Trump did is pointing out the flaws in her story which should've happened during the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't smart\nSpecially with that voice that she was affecting the go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing committee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the difference is the prevailing occasions\nShe can't remember where when who the people she says ... says they weren't that's the only did\nRepublican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't so Trump's given uncovered Trump writing shade for them and let them go out and rip them for doing and if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step and it\nIt might look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big take away the big takeaway for me as this one you know you know I don't it was it's been investigating the trumps for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what\nIs not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess what I often just say\nNo that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint\nIt was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia a tendon for that yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump polluted\nBecause his money came from Russia because his wealth was because in due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left\nWas convinced was true and now here's the New York times story year long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to they're the ones that said that they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump was it totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nActually a reference for somebody somebody and changes are seen mostly are too young to remember\nA bottom line is I Know what had happened to a woman comes for political\nNow what grams point there's there's a lot of young people in his audience it don't remember\nThe Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all of John's\nYou never know what did I don't know when you go to ride a bike with what you're going to come up with just like you're not gonna you're gonna come up with women like New Hampshire aren't\nGreat but it's not a Bill Clinton and that's\nHillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford and that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester with confronted a a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been around to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're\nOne of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday and she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back\nHe asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated Gerges Cassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad ... wait a second everybody there said it didn't happen either rape anybody\nSo why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there her best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it protester\nSo you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second uh you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge\nTo destroy somebody's life if you destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer that question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated would you like that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots\nI'm Glad Cassidy push back but it's a lost cause on the protester the protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros and she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly cast that you know no\nWould you like an on corroborate would charge destroy I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk so that protestor\nOh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up ... you know it's unfair protest I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court Cassie no not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protester no there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\nSo what ... ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript something like this and help people understand if it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them\nI just like you can't persuade the media [noise] you know I'm I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young Web behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk I thought there too they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taken off I thought they were legitimately curious and that's how I went into early interviews I found out that's not at all they were curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger

like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers are in this case soccer balls the foreign he'll color credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far as to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of caught their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be critical and the step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling\nThen as we learn more and then there's the vents play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements\nInto what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense we've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts\nAnd has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did it gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing to do with a look at it than we are looking at it than will do the right to oh so he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique it's a trumped developed\nI don't even open developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a stab wished\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on something that he can make fun of things\nAnd what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you ... irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an is continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you\nHow the lions Lee insane\nIt has made them with rage other Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump has been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\n\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski and Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said it's true\nIt was not marketing her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just simply boy she she can't backup she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me two were all women can joined ... can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine a man organized\nFor the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell\nRoche women women or nor do their search we'd do\nWell yeah yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men\nIf such a group existed and Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he's been thrown off and the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed and made up for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody following\nThis knows even the Democrats are Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n[noise]

all over half a bay [noise]\nBreathing so welcome back Rush Limbaugh but yeah I mean I work for the areas the there's the James them the gym and\nGuarantee quote from a National Review um the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together\nAs one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bed is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it\nIt's what the ... this this um [noise] it it well\nMe too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the um [noise]\nOccupy Wall street movement looking black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people who for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has\nThe Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups with their singular causes\nBecause the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people they capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy and then the big donors come along in underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives\nAnd then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with\nThis no idea whatsoever so we ended up in debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on a girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nThat's sick ... in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept\nOf what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating movement\nThat has been constructed to push all of these disparate various agenda and the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism\nAnd so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in\nFor men who have abused every woman out there he's right balls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who've been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter because it did happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them\nAnd by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard rather than just deal with the specific incidents have happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nA all cops are bad every white cop as a rape\nEvery black convict is in is in every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in bias and discrimination it racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one\nAnd Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never that range and the anger never ends it only gets worse\nBecause the Democrats don't fix anything and finally it doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay whether he did it or not now Sarah Sanders\nWhite House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press\nAnd she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply resign did the fact\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... ... email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\nAnd here it is that ... is is that they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target of attacks from Trump the target of attacks from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target\nOf attacks from Trump trumped an attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the birds we shouldn't have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski ended me in the way they vote or what do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was dating facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second my second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right young cat challenge her so Trump did\nFor everybody else who doesn't have to go ... adds to do it Trump did it\nIn yeah he's providing a little shady and for some of these people to hide under [noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody he did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever him I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed grade to speak to you again a right to have your back ...\nGreat to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into abnormal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them who are coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN while they are like couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this hold me to\nKind of white ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe\nShe thinks she was right when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned women's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine Ken and this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible\nSame time I ever him that the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her but she may literally believe that men don't have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as\nBullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe it\nIt goes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about living rates are also the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nYou\nEver um uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the white hook up and and they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine [noise]\nHooked on it if not better I by the way here's this you're\nAlso right of it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it the me too movement supposedly include all women women\nOn across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will it's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think every

neither here nor there the objective of this\nWas to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination\nOr to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't there\nThey thought that the mere allegation that the cabinet with not sit there and let his life to be destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there and let his\nNominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they thought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been\nSo now it is panic and scramble\nTime so the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Kristin Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story\nAnd the media is all over the place\nNow saying well you know this this may screwed it Murkowski and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay well ladies and gentlemen I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but there are no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heat big reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate not a blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll taken after the Democrats\nBegan smearing Kavanaugh but before the committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent the high camp has opened a ten point lead\nOver I camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana is similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger\nJosh Hawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when wimp out or that some Republican senators wouldn't wimp out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to know the words\nThese three Heitkamp Donald Les McCann what's actually for\nDonnell a McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping that Collins caves\nThat maybe even McConnell would cave and Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states they're held to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh's confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back\nKavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven polling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski but if they\nIf they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today power line Scott Johnson and one of the contributors in power line writes that a reader of theirs\nNoted\nThe changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself\nPresented\nThe power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic he created a chart in essence based on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and\nIt is the dates to varying dates the different dates of the sword did invent Dr ... says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story changed correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second\nHis question why the sudden change within a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months she grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists as they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\nSalt\nThe chart here and try no trucks are difficult to convey but this is a text charge there is some ah some bars in this thing but it isn't titled Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\nIn the therapist notes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties\nWhen she was in couples therapy\nThe therapists notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties in her text messages to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the mid eighties\nAnd\nHeard a letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties\n\nIn the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school all summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could've been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearing she said it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that before\nShe had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties\nEarly eighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to these changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein in an Anna Eshoo endeavor cats the lawyer\n\nAnd hurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional performance\n\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nProblem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if everything she remembers changes that her convenience first Ford's testimony the assault occurred in the summer of eighty two when she would just Fifteen conflicted with both her therapist notes and the text message\nHere is that President alert or your phones and ... yeah I forgot to warn people about this to
