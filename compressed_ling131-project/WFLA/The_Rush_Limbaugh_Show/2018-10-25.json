I refer to her affection Italy is Natasha on a top and Washington Free beacon a senior writer Liz Harrington they're talking about the subject of the package bombs these these a mail order devices that are not exploded yet\nAnd bill hammer\nStarts off I go into Kaylee Mac in any case I mean what are you what you've been watching what you've been observing over the past six hours what do you see\nWhat I've observed a president who examine leader said he condemned the attack he called for unity and then you had a response from the liberal media to then ... the president\nAnd they should instead of blaming the president take a cue from the president\nDidn't leadership yesterday called for the country to come together instead of attacking one another with partisan politics time stand behind the president shameful I that the New York times today tell us to publish an article tend to put them their fascination and the president of the United states we're twenty four hours from me that I can deliver and how painful and the New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fiction piece by a writer fantasizing over a secret service agent tending a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president I don't\nKnow named Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate his gun does that go off\nAnd so a nearby Secret Service agent hands the Russian assassin his gun sincere use mine the times runs this story and\nThey excuse it by saying well we must publishing stories that relate to react to live with the Mueller investigation of Trump Britain\nFor what they've got to do with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there's not and and then they're preaching to us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about\nCivility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying into Donald Trump needs to dial it back in Donald Trump's new security to Donald Trump through the\nMeanwhile they can call him a Nazi they can call him Hitler they can lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now is Natasha on a top response\nI think that the president controlled himself has that taken last night at his rally that he was poking fun at the whole idea of oh I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be a presidential which is essentially saying to his audience you know what I'm thinking and and this morning he tweeted that it was CNN fault\nWhich basically is they can tell if a woman gets actually thought that was it her fault for wearing a short skirt has been completely\n... saying that CNN and was responsible for that because the fake news that they're spreading because no one fall but the arranged maniac that sending those\nType of hope of all let me just advantage and that's what they want to be on the record of metal pipe bomb showed up and not culpable\nFor the pipe bomb culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth CNN you had an anchor on that network indoors to play in Central Park to pick the me assassinate the president\nSaying that the leader right now you heard Natasha on a top there say you really you you want to be on the record saying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about her analogy that Trump blaming CNN is akin to because they got about ... like blaming\nA I'm a ... a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's do you not only to she used okay so so um\nThe conversation continues here and now you're hearing a senior writer for Washington Free beacon Liz Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the pride that and I think that's how things for years he recently commanded that Congress men about body slamming the reporter he has called the ... the enemy of the people have to pay the legal for anyone who got in some a lot about the\nLast what about the language is Liz\nAn outlet and very fast Tom ten times as mild hair Brennan\nAnd CNN had a choice yesterday he saw the president come out saying this is abhorrent what America stand for black man if I Want to see an end to tell can blame that on the president can blame it on Sarah Sanders John Brennan echoing that how\nDoes that move forward forward fighting the low road to President Trump put the highlights what Clinton said last week we cannot have the ability\nRight we cannot have civility so what your hands here yet on a top actually trying to blame all all of this on Trump and of course using this\nI'm from the high road and I'm I'm from ah I I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on the on the left now before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears heard just a bit to talk about the caravan 'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there John\nCase it and he is\nBeing interviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter being interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border\nAnd there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who were legitimately in need of asylum\nCould be vetted before they even get to the border but you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter you know if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal\nNow they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us\nThat we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is\nThe ruse here or the technique here is a moral equivalence there but for the grace of God go live Phil Donahue yes it is all the time Phil Donahue was hosting the show\nAnd when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be start preaching about the accident of his birth\nNo I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's what difference it made for me and if they started at stolen the guilt if he felt over how the\nAccident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on there that was\nTo watch other people in the world as though being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd it may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with this\nThat matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world the answer the solution is to spread our area of dominant influence and to get rid of tyrannical ...\nGoing now wait a minute see this I'm Glad I'm Glad you brought this up I I wouldn't know I
