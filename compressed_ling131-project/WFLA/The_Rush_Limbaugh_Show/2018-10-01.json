made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number then that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of

NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe even longer than I maybe forty five minutes or\nYou know an extended statement\nOnly recently started taking questions from what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocate that he wasn't just announcing that deal got done he was teaching why it was important including the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nUh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi and Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works\nAnd how the United states has been victimized over the course of many many years because of American leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then it promotes good relations with our allies and Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back\nPockets picket\nThere's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy at doesn't mean that may cause we are so much wealthier and powerful that

how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers including farmers and a number of other\nType people about whom Washington thinks not very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question that Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process\nAnd in discussing this substance and the details of this new agreement does it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame\nEverybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good and you know teaching as well as announcing is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it made the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative\nAnd so when they began to announce this caught that cut this reform that reform a lot of people that know what they were talking but I got scared to death at lesson has been learned by none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next bite\nTrump saying it is a privilege to trade with us this kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking and but both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nOr to earn the\nRespect of authors it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump is turning this a hundred and eighty degrees

feel the need to apologize\nFor it or to downplay it\nAs some sort of a new definition of humility rather than having it used as a teachable moment if something inspiring\nIs this Trump points out we want every country making that country great we want every country putting our country first we want everybody doing it that way that's the whole point for\nEverybody to do better but not by piggy

that we get a poll in June or a poll and mayor even July and it tells us what the\nPublic is thinking of doing and the November elections in my point was this is silly this pulled us I mean anything there's anybody remember the polling July it's with thousands sixteen or in August that doesn't mean anything 'cause it's not when the election is and I said the ... the events are going to shape the

of it brand new trade deal\nThe drive by as were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA started entertaining the are the questions and what we had one through four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin ... things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression polls are posing or aren't very accurate [noise] we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be a positive outcome\nBut you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election [noise] they were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that ended up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a a Cecilia may go ABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin ...\nOn your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is that\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's been out of bed statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class and yeah he was number one in his law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible so\nI Want the FBI this is now their seventh investigation so it's not like you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer it let me let me at least sound bites them got to be yeah number thirty coming okay [noise]\n... this whole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in Lebanon the pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flight was not going to vote well I'm a floor vote for final confirmation silly FBI that's been at least a lot of weight walking out of this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake nose claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI it was a set up it was a it was a trap they lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things\nLater trap accusing Trump and the White House I'm trying to limit the FBI scope because you see there are things to find and Trump wants to cover it up\nDonald Trump who's had so much control over the FBI the last three years same FBI that's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out off somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation so Trump person\nI'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at okay thank you Mr solve it needs to go to waste is going to go to waste so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC in Hawaii of course they're lying it was a set up\n\nSo now it's out there but we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news\nAt the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped\nUp tomorrow but then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking everybody to talk to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that that they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on\nOr just tell you if this ends tomorrow if this was all accurate\nAnd the Democrats are but the Democrats are going to be fit to be that the thing didn't go on friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be reading and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was read they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday\nIt won't be long besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why did I stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels I went to the response as well they found nothing in a hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n\nOr let's say look let's skip forward here to um\nA source familiar with the conversation says Ramirez provided a list of witnesses who she says couldn't corroborate her allegation that

the break at\nWhat do I say what is the lead a headline on the Drudge Report let me read it to your White House expands FBI problem is not what the hell is that so I clicked on the lake here's what it is [noise]\nRight here my formerly Nick at the same fingers in the New York times working in tandem with NBC News headline of White House tells FBI to interview any one necessary for Kavanaugh inquiry this is because of what they claimed Trump said\nAt his press conference today where he's now I don't want to limit anything I said guys that that\nThat they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigations are not that's fake news so then they've got a record Trump not limiting invested in which means you can go on and on and on and on\nAnd now they're broadcasting and everywhere White House tells me I interview when it wasn't necessarily [noise] and right on schedule CNN reports that the Democrats have submitted a list of twenty four\nPeople they want the FBI to talk to\nThis after Fox News had it earlier today that the FBI is about to wrap up tomorrow\n[noise] this is going to have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all\nThis is is delayed delayed\nLaid away and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen there is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is\nThat the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nAs somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say it's the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides that needs to make the point that this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box\nThat's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made\nBut there's only so much you can do with a woman who doesn't remember where or when what ever happened to her happen and there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promoted it needs to be spoken for\n\nThis has got to be stopped because the it's not real the Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go\nSubmit names they want the FBI to talk to they dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows\nEvidence leads at when they don't find anything on my Bob Mueller they stop Mueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years in hasn't found any but he's still going and that's exactly what this is going to be\nIf somebody doesn't stand up and stop this somebody on the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start voucher thing\nFor the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh somebody needs to speak up for him somebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand\nUp and say they have been thorough and they haven't found anything or you wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\nBut that's not happening somehow weren't letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the Kavanaugh has been half baked lukewarm and or incompetent\nBecause of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence no cooperation and nothing yet she's credible cabinet is not somebody look we've got a caller earlier how do you stop a bully a smack them in the face\nSomebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up\nThat they've gotten everything they've asked for this thing and there just isn't anything there and go home the idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been rendered is absolutely bogus another making things up the Trump is going to limit it either no such thing\nBut he sure Fela for debate I Am not limiting and the thing I it's totally FBI to take us wherever it takes them promptly Democrats well here's Twenty one people we want\nYou to talk to if you called the FBI and say look there's there's some people in my town here really really screwing approach and I need to get something done about an IRS in when you go talk to them but it doesn't work that way does it\n\nLook rush rush this was the United States Senate clearly that can happen to know is that\n[noise] and one other thing you know one of the one of the movies I have recommended over the years that people rent they haven't seen that go watch what's called the lives of others and it's a movie about
