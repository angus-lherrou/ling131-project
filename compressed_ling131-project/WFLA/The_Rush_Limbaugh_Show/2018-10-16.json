have you seen\nDocumented genial logical praise organizations that you'll find I have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing\nAnd that story I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\n\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA in any of this but\n... the media of course has a role here because everything they've reported about this turns out to be an abject lying separatists inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA and by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test from a little kitten with wandering around you can\nYou can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present herb ... take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate a future debate and that's what he meant that she wouldn't\nDo and he kept that she wouldn't show up as the Indian if she did do it but you talk about\nTalk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this Trump is literally causing these people who lose their cookies compass causing them to go in the same\nAnd I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and for out in the American left and I have I have developed an even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously\nKnown and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion\nAnd my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave\nThere's no question about it there has been no question about it the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can and this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up\nAfter two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point that we are going to take the Senate but then if you\nLook at the reality of voting\nPatterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense\nThat orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave the trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right and it all started with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten\nDo you remember how many times I reminded you that during the\nFirst six years of Obama go through the two thousand fourteen mid terms\nThe Democrat Party lost over twelve hundred feet nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses governorships are you even go to\nA local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost\nWell over a hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dead set lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got me in a near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother election where they were going to sweep big never going to wipe out the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination\nSomebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixteen elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power\nIn terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties now the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago so from two thousand\nTend the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nIraq Obama singlehandedly\nMy friends has destroyed the electoral prowess other Democrat Party nobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what\nEvidence is this going to happen what is it that has stopped the trend the people in this country had been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean to having the fewest number of electoral states\nSince the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people had been voting against you so what is it that's happened that is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump\nSo says the media\nSo says the Democratic party well on the basis of what\nIf you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth is no reason to vote against that in common sense there is no real Trump hasn't done anything to worse than anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today but you're not gonna see widely reported let's see if the [noise] probably put CNBC ... survey soaring economic optimism\nPoints to no blue wave in two thousand eight Tim\nThis is the CNBC polar survey America is experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do

vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen now we have an historic seven point one million jobs open\nThat means employers are looking to hire that many people\nThat you will say roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one with that many job openings it is and employ ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employees\nCan set the terms based on their level of expertise and experience on whatever it is they're applying for none of this in the world of common sense suggests that people would be unhappy by or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly\nWhat we're being told that the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were very by their vote\nAnd yet\nThere isn't a federal Lincoln bit of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat including the two thousand six to ... president\nSo telling you it's eighty twenty both sides but they

on and some places should by hurricane my dilemma panhandle Rubio says she's seen some pretty incredible destruction there\nNothing has gotten rid of Donald Trump nothing has turned the American people against Donald Trump can you imagine the frustration\nThese are people who get their way every single time they target somebody for destruction whenever they want to take a Republican out they are guaranteed a Ninety percent chance of success because\nThey have the drive by media working right alongside with them and if they set their their crosshairs on somebody there as good as gone already damaged beyond repair they haven't lay the glove on Donald Trump\nThey're running out of weapons and then the process of running out of weapons they're losing their minds they're losing their rational sanity I Believe and this latest debacle over cabin on don't\nDoubt for a minute that this thing was orchestrated unplanned from the get go\nAs a late breaking use only if necessary event they didn't leave with this because they knew it was flimsy\nThey didn't lead with it because they knew they couldn't prove it they didn't leave with it it was it a central part of the Kavanaugh hearings because they knew there wasn't any evidence for it and they knew that ball the foreign could not pull this off under pressure\nI'm Still in shock the balls he showed up to testify I I think that took everything they had to persuade her to get there 'cause I don't think she ever intend to do and I don't think when they pitched her on this whole thing was every part of the plan that she would ever actually have to testify\nAnd does anybody believe\nThat uh fifty one every year old woman literally talks as she talks that way in her classroom teaching students if she does\nThat mean that just and I guess it's possible I guess she does but I I I don't believe that either\nI don't believe that's how you talk to the balls before and you run into rather beach Santa Cruz that's not how she's going to talk to you you're running around the beach out there uh and she is not going to be talking to you like he's in perpetual fear of being hit or damaged or harmed her yelled out or whatever\nAh anyway the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things the the\nReal objective from the get go from all of this the cleanest way for this to happen and would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him\nIf they have been able to do that get Trump's approval numbers ... to the thirties them to the twenties then they could get rid of him\nThey failed at that all they\nDid was cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly and then the process Kavanaugh thing they actually turn some people who are sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching\nThe most powerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying a human being and a wife when there isn't any evidence\nThat want to warrant such a thing but the Democrats didn't care that there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always relied on the seriousness of the charge working with the media to create an daily image\nThat whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse\nThan poison and must be dealt with as though he or she is poison well none of it has worked and even in their\nOwn post Trump's approval numbers hover in the mid forties Rasmussen Trump's at fifty one\nThey see the approval numbers for Trump of the African American community they see the economy they ...\nI I'm telling you that they are teetering on the brink of being hold it altogether being able to hold it altogether\nAnd it's in this universe framework contacts I just I don't see this massive blue wave that they do and I'm not sure they even see it I think they're hoping I think it's a birthright to them it's the way things ought to be should be\nAnd I got to do everything they can to make it reality but these are massive ... elections all over the country and it's going to be a challenge for them [noise]\nWe'll see I mean look it's possible I I'm like Nate Silver I have no idea what's going to happen only difference between that silver and me is that I make no pretense of knowing what's going to happen all I'm doing with you today are sharing how I break this now using common sense\nI've got\n... two thousand twelve to six years of on the ground actual experience of Democrats losing elections of people turning against the Democrats having fewer seats\nElectoral seats in Washington than they've had since the Nineteen twenties and I don't see anything is going to reverse that Iraq who's saying oh\nSinglehandedly made this happen for rock Obama's presidency is what turned to people against the Democratic party\nAnd it was based on substance because Obama was a likeable guy and he was African American in check off a box I'm not racist look at this I voted for Obama and still when people had the chance\nThey voted against every aspect of the Obama agenda they could whereas Obama by the white campaigning for all these Democrats trying to retake the house and Senate\nWhere is the worst plugs\nBeto O'Rourke heard about this Beto O'Rourke is following the Obama a mold Beto O'Rourke\nRaise thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter he has been asked by Democrats to share some of that money for other races what's your clothes and that dog has told them to go pound sand\nThat has told them if you're elections or that important when you go raise the money or self I'm going to bend is the way I Want to use this the way I was not my job to raise money for you\nExactly what Obama's Obama\nPeople remember this he resented the hell out of having the goal campaign for house races he thought it was sold but need him he had he wanted no part of campaigning for house races and very little to do with campaigning for Senate races\nAs it was but he the office of the presidency to go that low real reason he didn't want to do with his mom didn't have confidence of coat tails\nAnd that ... is not going to want to share any of his money not being good socialist\nGot all this money it's not fair that that the oh who's by the way what does he down seven or eight points now the latest poll\nA it's not fair that Beto has more than ... and won't share it with other needy Democrats but that's what he's saying that he won't do\n'em yeah outlook also have the um the cuss chunky situation and there's

United states is trying to say\nTry to report they're trying to say that there is recorded evidence of the interrogation and murder because Joe ... show he was wearing an apple watch\nHis fiance was outside in the family said Dan she had his iPhone in the family sedan that she had instructions to call\nA man I've got his name here I'm not going to bottom look at it up she had instructions to call somebody didn't come back out he was going to get you know divorce officially recognized sort of get married they fiance that's waiting outside of the families and and and she had instructions to identify mutual friend if he didn't emerge meaning he thought\nHe was lord and married bought something could happen\nAre reporting that here's ... was recording\nEverything that happened functions not possible in the first place an apple watch is a slave to the phone and apple and even if if the show he had a new watch the series for which he didn't because it hasn't been out long enough\nBut even if he did if he if he bought it in the United states and had it it's still not capable of L T E operation in Turkey apple has not yet brought LT each service to the to the I watch the apple watch in Turkey which means\nThat there is no way his watch could have worked independently of his phone now there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch it's just a giant red button that you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the concept was no way\nYou\nIts its maximum twenty yards is Bluetooth that connects watches to phones twenty yards twenty five hours I'm trying to think of the golf course when I lose the range of phone stops talking to the watch\nIt's maybe twenty or twenty five yards and most of which will be Seventy five feet on the tops on the outside sixty feet more like it there is no way his watch\nWas recording anything and transmitting it anywhere so there there can't be a recording of what happened to us\nBesides that the Saudis would have seen the watched by taking it off a and they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it the watch is still not an independent piece attack even watches that can operate under LT they still need to be fair to the phone\nThere's not enough storage capacity on the watch to store the data of a recording it doesn't start yeah it can store I think up to a\nHundred songs maybe more now but for the most part that has to stream them it's not an independent device so the ... there probably is no evidence on the guys watch or even on the phone\nIt well the [noise] except for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be at some point put back in ranging connected to the fun to watch would need to be back into close proximity the phone\nFor his heart rate data to show up on the phone\nIt's simply ... it's simply not possible what they're saying\nThe way they're saying it's it's not possible to watch is not independently capable of doing what they're reporting it needs an iPhone and Android remain paired to the iPhone you can't be more than [noise]\nI Wish I knew this exactly I'm I'm I Know when I lose my connection
