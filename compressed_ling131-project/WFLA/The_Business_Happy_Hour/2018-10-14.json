I think I don't think that was it ... it wasn't fully investigated okay so you know the\nThe the FBI has first of all we know legit jurisdiction whatsoever that was a democratic concept that they just invented out of thin air the Senate Judiciary committee they investigated it and they they have way more power than the FBI as far as being able to subpoena witnesses and stuff like that so\nThey did their investigation none of the supposed ... witnesses even ... court corroborate\nDid a film variation how many weeks well hold on now that ... look I Know what you're saying but I say like I I\nI don't dislike capital I'm just basically telling you what everyone else to say well I'll tell you what ... what do you like it or not that's the truth is about this was a democratic hit job I don't do any ... and I don't disagree with that but\nIf if you're on the fence of being a Democrat or an independent I mean just just do the right thing\nTo do the right to the right thing or an independent for especially here longer and Democrat or a it is if you watch what happened and you you still kinda might be a Democrat just get your foot out of the water\nHow fast of a process is that supposed to be I mean obviously Hitler he tried to exterminate at the same time doing his breathing so I it seems to me it was trying to speed up the process but you would think that if you're trying to breed a superior race\nOr something like that it's going to take more than a generation to do it so I have a question that I I I have my own pathetic scientific or you know knowledge in in visualization of is it possible that Hitler\nWas somewhat successful in what he did it before we take a break the back up to that question is\nLooking around I ... and they call me crazy but I see a lot more blonde hair blue eyes people right now and including my own children which which my wife isn't even blue eyed guy you know and and we have to blonde hair blue eyed blonde and brown that would do\nA kids like that and see I see I feel like I see that everywhere now and I'm Wondering\nDid this guy has some sort of success or am I just crazy anyway we're going to take a break John as soon as we get back to ... the author and director of human zoos I wanted to answer that crazy question and then we'll get into more of a serious stuff here on the business happy hour on WFL and don't forget to after lax at a play the business happy hour podcast\nTraffic and whether they will lie hard rain he always nice to have any doubt on your Web ballet\nFrom the ... credit union free checking traffic center or right now we do have an incident on two Seventy five north bound and bay way\nThat on ramp is closed due to crash going on there and we also have sixty Fifth Avenue north than a hundred and first way there was an accident or a lien is blocked and watch out on ... road possible police activity the intersection there with Dr King board Alex ...

African American ministers some white Baptist minister but the New York times defender there uh the American museum of natural history still to that one of them\nLeading world museum of natural tree found it a leading scientists to found it\nSo it was sort of the Democratic mayor of New York at the time the end of it so the power structure is really the founder of it but there were people primarily African American ministers and some white ministers who so you know humans are monkeys and\nBox on my case like this year and he actually put in the in the Bronx zoo they actually put out a banker the aftermath of the Congo in a cage in the monkey house where a monkey\nWhy would think most most churches probably disagree a hundred percent I saw that the Catholic Church from what I could tell was was one of the major major a day though because they don't believe in evolution yeah I I watched your documentary twice actually I watched it last night John and I watched it about a week ago um I thought it was very interesting I thought it was well done to the extent or or you know ... it's\nBasically telling the story of what happened the ... the thing that I that I wanted to ask you about was that connection to the a so called a white supremacist movement\nThat that that's happening now and that has been happening uh since the beginning of time basically um and the thing that I that I really I'm having a hard time getting too is that there is a rise in white supremacy what what evidence did you have that\nYeah so the very end of the film and if it's All right um I'd say that the you know I actually think on hold\nTrue that is still the French in America but having said that uh just from Internet debates and from surveys of people who for their like identify as All right\nI think there is certainly a pocket of more aggressive more more a rabble rousing\nSorts of things and you're seeing this in some demonstrations like in Charlottesville uh last year\nAnd for them to bury wanted to add this because some of his anecdotal but then there was a study that would have published last year but uh for hundreds of self described people who are affiliated with All right where they asked them you know do some questions do you think other races are closer to\nOur ancestor the apes and yes there are good and so\nI got really why are these are the same sorts of arguments that were married in the early ... century and the sort of social Darwinian argument if you will and so I thought that was\nAn interesting time starving time but some of the things happening but I Would like to think and I I I think it's true that is still quite a friend in the American public but there are so for us and and some of them are very highly educated with ... and a lot of background and you know intellectual fought\nSo what was the ... and how's how's it how does it relate to the scientific racism\n[noise] okay so your race goes back a long lines and for the scientific racism but\nA Darwin theory did add a wrinkle because in in ... the only reason why any human population or saw population or any race got the capability of it is because that they were subject to a certain pressures in the environment that they grew up on him for about ...\nYou know so if you're a different were selected to different environmental pressures you might have you would expect this is the ... says in his book and something that\nYou'd expect significant differences and so that really did play into\nFor at least you know several decades how many people at the top of the science community view the issue of race they thought well based on our view of Darwinian evolution different races were subjected to a different selection\nPressures that had different survival maids therefore we should expect significant differences between the races and mental capacity and other drugs and then they started to look for them and that was sort of a narrative through which they viewed race and so\nThat's how the tie and you don't have to tie things in that way but that is how it was tied in back to ... himself\nYeah so go going back to what you're saying about uh\nAbout the ... the white supremacy and whether it's on the rise of it I think that that if I I watch like I said I watched a documentary twice", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Business Happy Hour", "city": "Tampa", "day": "14"}
