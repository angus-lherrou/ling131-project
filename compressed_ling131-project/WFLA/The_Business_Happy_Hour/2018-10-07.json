I only write up already\nThat police officer or how we were making fun of them for a couple of days and I was like man I gotta tell ya oh you're a huge apology\nThat I was making a buddy to your face it was even worse all the big buddy behind your back\nThe best safety ... that was probably a different police officers that the other one wouldn't have seen it but\nWhat I never even thought of that so I just\nI thought it was probably the same guy but you know in hindsight it probably was sick you're you're running for a first sheriff of Hillsborough County but you worked for ... for twenty five years yeah correct so we ... our listeners mean what's the big difference I mean county to county and you got to make fun of each other you fight each other\nYears ago there was a huge difference I mean ... you know one agency was a lot different than the other but now\nWith radio communication and everything else we can talk to each other it's truly truly I Believe that Tampa at some point in time will become like Miami and be a metro area and it probably should be right even though the city used to be\nAll the high crime and all the uh you know the big buildings obviously but the the growth and now the county's same way I mean right you can do from around the county and be like am I still in the city or I'm not in the city right at the Miami Dade metro like your dog yeah yeah absolutely I I Believe that it should turn into that at some point in time\nYeah makes a lot of sense there was what half a million people and Brandon alone right next county right\nOh yeah that's what I found the ... when we first started showed such a weird sliver of we're city of Tampa is because it's downtown but that's also by us F ... that does all of your Democrat but he's also have a new the new era of the doubt\nThat the strict version of it I think there was a sliver for the whole ...\nHarry Potter how they how they they deem that they call that gerrymandering\nGallons itself was not to name him no absolutely yeah yeah yeah right right that's yeah\nThat really weird how the damp has an agreement in Hillsborough County sheriff's office where they can actually stop cars right tickets are and investigate accents on ... self isn't in the city\nIs that we're so ... saying they have a honeybee down\nThere were times that we would argue about that or we meaning the city would say well we're not going to write accidents on there you know because you just make people mad when you write accidents but uh and so they said\nI Would think that Nike would have chosen someone who is about bringing arming the ... with the police department with the black community not creating more the Asian\nThe kneeling thing that got me the most ... when he was that the police officers the ticket as peaks\nOn it oh I thought that was just so disrespectful to them thousands and thousands of many police officers who are out there who truly put their life on the line to help their community of course we do have some that police officers have it when I was a cop in Miami I Would\nSay probably Ninety nine point nine percent of the men and rainy when in Chile did care about their community and they ...\nI think that's probably true around the entire country so scary what what do you what do you think about the how did you see a law enforcement locally here react when the when the Sox came out\nOh a lot of disrespect to all the way around um was obvious but you know the the most important part as we talk about the football football team allow that to happen for him to Neal and I think what we don't do\nAround the nation has got to remember law enforcement you can't have a football team without a law enforcement officer there you just couldn't\nDo it for like ... ... or like a thousand yeah oh yeah ... Louis think\nAbout that think about how you disrespected law enforcement how about every time you come and playing Tampa we don't send our team which would be ... county at age ... none of those teams show up are you going to have the lights are you going to have the game no games over I've just canceled game just 'cause I didn't show up\nRight so guys we're going to it where it went by segment

thought I see what a lot of people don't realize is when you're trying to market your product like you see the celebrities and you know they they get on national TV 'cause they did something wrong LA Times are doing it on purpose because they're bringing attention to their their descendants Rodarte\nSo I think like you do because they're trying to bring attention to their product you know it's just a actually gladly agreement than I make way of marketing I may not be a smart decision because they are dividing our country but as a marketing company as a marketing ploy it's a genius about the money\nTo keep in mind the biggest market now is overseas so you know that's a big part of the cells so they show that uh you know professional athlete but the big ... so you know a lot of people
