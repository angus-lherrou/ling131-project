I Believe in the seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point is obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be\nUm the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts in time and um you know I spent ten years researching this was a and you know after you are not quite that much for sure but um there's this the information in the book is is pretty compelling I Will check it out\n[noise] uh Easter the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi Martha good morning welcome to coast\nHank it Richard thank you for taking my call my play the\nIdea that the pond originally made their money to the ... trade that for a day a wet I'm more a humane way to make money and the Rockefeller ah\nStarted out lighting houses with kerosene that fly that combat stumble engine that guy's a gasoline like a byproduct than that cannot days ran they got down nice guy\nThat I never have no idea how the relatives out well and you can be\nYou have a clue as to how they made their money ranching right\nWell I Know that I I yeah I Do\nActually in the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with similar and South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when they came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the\nStock market was not as big as it is today and there were only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influenced things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic as you can make a fortune pretty quickly\nAnd Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the SEC the security Exchange Commission and FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote it takes the courage to crush across\n[laughter] really interesting stuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I Love to hear it but their their their money came from or\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family ah probably it's all money so you know just kind of keep the stimulation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those they used to call them the Boston brain than those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be some of that as well\nYeah I had heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging and these guys are never written a book on let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour\nI'd be lucky [laughter] by the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach your name 'til you wants to be as best they can you know ... as far as I did I I still get fascinated by stuff somebody will call in and say hey that you know the ... and because it wasn't that long ago really this Seventy plus years ago\nYou know one girl got a hold of me and her her mother\nOr her aunt was the cook from Warm Springs Georgia\nAmazing it's just absolutely blew my mind\nIt is so we're not not that long ago I mean a grander scope of things

I Would not be getting it now the time to get in was two three years ago before they\nTalked about because they always say they once it's being talked about it's already built into the way to make way too\nLate I mean you can if you grow looking it up to twenty twenty some it was all up to thirty billion dollars in market cap and they have\nNo Taylor I still have all the news that much money Jamie Kennedy growth is forty forty eight dollars hasn't that I I mean ... I Am thinking of ... when I was not so into three hundred yeah and then it went down to lay down what's that no one fifty\nYeah so it's worth about Fifteen sixteen billion dollars still I have no money they make no money they've lost money all they do is lose money every quarter well sort of test us ...\nStarting to finally catch up with Tesla that may desolate elite where they can drive that you know ...\nYou must do this you know he he said when he started Tesla that he wanted to raise awareness for the electric car um and the change they wanted to make sure that if it was brought to mark ... so testing them and announcement\nMhm that you can now get a car for thirty three thousand two hundred dollars after survivor ... rebate\nSo forty fourth out forty thousand or less than thirty three or ... they say they got the ... runs out the end of this year end of this year yet\nYeah I'll save hit there what two hundred thousand cars or the ... of the particular ... Senate right now is exploring a changing that a good good ... increasing the number of vehicles that can be produced take you'll be eligible for the tax rate promoting\nYeah that's a big reason people buy of course I mean that you're talking twenty percent of the of the price of the vehicle the ...\nDo you drive a work car do you what do you do you I mean as you do something for work separately a regular for one car for the edge but for ... for nothing fancy like you know do do you like that idea of Seventy five hundred dollar credited that could incentivize you have to buy a car I think that isn't sense of I mean you're a business owner\n... about forty thousand dollar car getting you know almost thirty three thirty percent off and all of the problem is is the tax credits is is\nKind of deceiving I mean you know you if you make too much money you can make too much money and not\nQuality that happens you they did it and and that and by the way too much money is not a lot of money you don't have like a millionaire you know the sooner millionaire and without the million\nMillionaires like a thousand ... really a millionaire that any of the ...\n... it's called the alternative minimum tax when you hit a certain bracket depending if you are married or single filing um you you lose all those four hundred thousand\nNo fighting foreigners out I Want I Want to say it's like two or like a high high one hundreds if you're single file no it's not a lot of our tax brackets for years and people are really skewed be they they're they're actually skewed against\nYour your typical doing well business or like everybody sitting in this room I'm sure does well right well we're by tax code as soon as you hit that\nThat threes and fours you're getting tax the same as the guy's making millions oh I Know that you know it's yeah is it that that's the ... if they're gonna move something moving a little more and I'm not one of those guys tax the rich yeah but it's it's disproportionately on the lower end of this of the scale yeah\nI mean anytime you Rob in any time you steal from someone and give it to someone that didn't deserve it oh yeah it's not going to help the economy I was watching the show last hour documentary on Sweden\nAnd they did they went ... extreme socialism um and then they had to back way way off of it in the nineties there like whoa whoa yeah there was one of them were being taxed almost a hundred percent of their income because they're they're the businesses were being taxed on so called prophets even though they really weren't
