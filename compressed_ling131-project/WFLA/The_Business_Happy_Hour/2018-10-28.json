he he didn't\nHe didn't federal it ... it would create some crimes up north when it was warm weather but not never been happier with limited to South Korea or\nThe or that area is a interesting because it it it's always been a hotbed of um a reformist motion or a move on to it as you no doubt no a a\nA a one of the foundation areas of the women's rights movement the uh uh is is that the exact area upstate New York but also many\nUm religious movements from the banking century actually I'm a native from that part of the country I don't know what it has to do with my book but uh it is a very interesting area and I I'd like to know more about it\nYou know there's an argument and true crime that the ... the ... murders and unjust unsolved\nCrimes like that seep into the soil and then did they tend to also then grow back out of it again which I was from kind of poetic they're interesting Doug is in New Jersey on coast to coast am east of the Rockies for Bill James go ahead\nYes

different a show about ... among solve something or other\nAnd I'm not sure but the date sounds pretty familiar war or the arrow but this one this was going on\nThere was a hobo camp a in a train yard in Chicago and ah [noise] along the shore on this one particular train ride and I came in and out of this yard um\nThey had four or five of these ah ... degenerate hobo is that stayed there in the yard that were actually killed and they found out that they were all killed by actresses they were they were chopped up the axes were supposedly taken off of the trains and there was I Believe a total of five bodies found\nAnd um I Believe at one point Eli mass uh when he was first getting in to his position he was asked to go ahead and look at this and this is one of the things that he had never solved and they said it bothered him greatly\nTone he white you know till he retired do you know if that has anything to do it or are you familiar with that case at all\nYeah they um uh I I I Know exactly what it is not Chicago attached to Cleveland the Nineteen thirties\nI I'm sure that's the case you're referring to it it's a Eliot Ness a after the uh what was hired to try to solve a series of a\n... and I'm blanking out on the name by which the yeah Brian is crime series\nIs known but they've actually started in Newcastle Pennsylvania Nineteen twenty two and then spread to Cleveland in the Nineteen thirties I wrote about that period of crimes at some length in in a popular crime but that is it's not it's not ... they were\nThey were axe murderer as they were connected\nTrain the but it it's twenty or the or it's twenty five thirty years after\nThe crimes that I wrote about it and I it is not connected\nYou know I'm not sure about that here's would um I I I I knew the case you speaking of ... to become the public\nWould have to go to public safety officer public safety commissioner of Cleveland after Chicago um and those I thought were murders mostly of women again that they were talking about this as being sort of an American river um and that they\nWere ... they were all man they've all been voted one woman was a victim of\nCoke and the rest of ... will get very interesting I we have time for John in Long Beach California and then we're going to have to wrap it up or go ahead John\nOkay thanks I'm not going to go about a nice to see again but but I think hey bill the guy in a in Cleveland out here in LA I'm a longtime journalist out here they think he might have been a suspect in the black guy you're killing a LA enough thought that\nUh and I just real quick about a Lizzie Borden she killed or a she if she did it she used the later the act and you said the other guy used to be blunt end so that would be I guess that'd be something else against it but I Want to ask you real quick\nDid they ever have a picture of this guy somebody could have had to if\nYou're given a description of 'em that you know we had newspapers back then you know we had a you know we had a Morse code and teletype and stuff like that I mean there had been some sort of a picture circulated or something of this guy right to the people knew about him later he just\nBlew into and out of town and do whatever I Want to know who he was not when you're when you\nBuy it that's a really big boy but first crime\nEverybody knew everybody knew what he looked like it it was a very unusual looking man but for some reason that we can't figure out no one ever did that we can fine no newspaper that we can fine ever did a drawing of\nAm and posted it and I don't know why they didn't do it it was common practice and and the wild west and the same era\nThe it was ... it was common to do drawings of criminal in that case there are drawings of the a police inspector in charge of the\nCave drawings for the house and he tried to use it oil can set the house on fire and there's a drawing of the oil can\nBut none of them are very ... lifted Bill James I Would just running out of time but that's why this is why people should listen to the show and then go by the book the Mets and the train discovering America's most elusive serial killers so enjoyed this conversation so grateful that you make time for us\nUm and uh and I look forward to in an updated version of this if you ever decide to the ah but in the meantime they look forward to bumping into you and Kansas on my way they're going to take my friend ah Nathan again and also to Richie Florida is who's been kind enough to host me here in\nThe ... day your chance to win a thousand bucks\nIn St Petersburg featuring ... are headed music can\n\nMayor naked ladies fan so as\nAlly ... I've never done that before you know who is close to the equator Ecuador [laughter]\nI got it yes yes it was a lot closer the caravan having thousands of arts and it was seven thousand four thousand it's up to ... I think I heard if I asked her people keep dropping out well they just got a brand new shipment in Nike's and\nLeaders name was a ... is there for ... over there huh [laughter] yeah\nSo I Do I Do have a question about it I mean how can you organize that many people and expected I mean someone had organize it\nExactly so last week on the show I said something everybody looked at me a little squarely face that the guys I think maybe the liberals or somebody is is behind this there has to be money behind that something's going on and and and now it was pretty damn ... see I'm not going to go but then after I thought about it for about ten seconds and I\nAgree I agree that could be possible it's all the new you nailed it it is it's all over the news now they're saying that there's these two guys and and I haven't had time to look it up but there's two guys I think one was a Ecuadorian or Guatemalan or something like that and\nThe other was a Mexican guy and they're they're they're a ah a event coordinators are one\nIs for immigration needs and he's like a well known political figures and the key coordinates these giant\nAh rallies and these giant marches right and from what I understand one of them got arrested on the border I think of Guatemala and the other on the border of Mexico are these two separate people there's video of it you can watch it on line of the guys literally getting taken away got seven thousand people in a single one guy out and take them away he was the organizer so that guy got the money from Soros or someone else I'm where\nAnd that guy basically prime minister is unlimited re fried beans and\nRice or along the dirty is that I Would doubt plus you get Nike's every hundred mile per se what what how long it takes like sixty or Ninety Days or something a walk what they're talking about it\nMaybe even longer they did they they did I was Fifteen hundred miles so people can walk what Fifteen miles a day yeah if you continually walk down and it's like a hundred days I mean the point is they're not getting here before the midterm election no but\nI you know this is all this controversy I mean what do you do I mean some of the size of the Democrats are saying you know what what are you going to shoot him at the border\nWell no we're not going to show it man I mean it's all about the other day is you know we have military military protect our borders right but if they're saying what if they rush um what if all of a sudden you got a military standing there they Russia they should ... or something something water ...\nWell I don't know what's really ended up happening is they're going to the same thing that happened the last ... they're still here and they're still going through the system and its costs and our country billions of dollars\nYeah that's what's gonna happen but it's you know if it trumps he's talking tough about me saying it's a it's an attack and it's an actual attack it it kind of is I mean\nYeah in this case it is I mean do but they they they they come here and they're under the guise of asylum right\nI mean all you have to do us a reporter for America has to go down in the care of and integrate themselves and and find out what caused all this it's very simple to figure out why is going to be done that yet I I don't know why I think that's how they figure it all this I actually did you hear Pence sat down with Lucy\nSit down with the president of Ecuador Guatemala Guatemala or something like that and he literally was told that this was all a plan that it was all put together to tell America's sovereignty yeah wouldn't I wouldn't say I mean what\nIs the difference if you have five thousand Mexican Army guys just don't have guns and they decided we're going to just walk into America [noise]\nSame as going on is another thing they well they didn't they they appeal to our compassion right on the fact is is that these countries are war torn there's massive drug violence you know horrific conditions living conditions in some of these places and I mean I make the joke about the re fried beans and rice but in reality I mean\nThat's not that far off and I I was talking to someone earlier I'll get fed to I was talking to someone at the gym earlier today and uh they got this guy he got his citizenship\nI'm finally not officially but he went through the whole process of getting his citizenship and when you when that happens you have to go back to your home country and then you have to apply to come back into America legally having the right documentation and all that okay so this guy's from Honduras so\nHe has a ... a wife that was is is American\nAnd they they went to Honduras\nAnd his wife could only take it there for one day she had she had to turn right are are around and fly back because she could not take it she he had to stay there for two weeks oh she was like there's no electricity there is no running water there's no proper sanitation\nOh gosh she turned around and came back home so I mean that's the\nThat's what we're dealing with you know well yeah and I feel terrible for the for the people there I just it's not that I don't think it's the right way to do it right\nNo I mean just because someone is doesn't have the same luxuries that we have doesn't mean it's a silent but [noise]\nYou know if you if you're into an area that's war torn and you've got bombs and stuff coming to Syrian refugees righto there is a different yeah that's the difference now this that they can uncover that um there is an actual left his motive behind this caravan of people\nTo me it just shut the door I mean right yeah that's a whole different ... yeah you don't show up here with brand new Nike's that are in what everyone wondered how they do that at that isn't true yeah it is and look at their shoes\nReally I thought that was a joke that serious there's Nike hell or high I\nVenezuela's are the ones funding it\nA guide and I didn't hear that you Venezuela I saw\nI look I was looking at their shoes 'cause I was curious about that in their shoes looked awfully nice to me out a lot a lot of them\nSo I don't I don't buy it man I don't know speaking of bombs\nIs hear about this whole thing the uh the bomb showed up at CNN a Soros his house Clinton's house Obama now work\nA whole Eric Holder's house yet Deborah Debbie Wasserman Schultz was more or they're coming around all over the country as you watch the news feeds here now there's something happening in California San Diego I'm\nWith the return address the White House [laughter] Donald Trump's apartment and ... and in a New York hey we do have a really good gas coming up I Want to talk about this bomb thing for a second but we do have a great gas coming on um it's a mess up his name but it's it's a re but sorry that I think I got that\nRight I'm actually bashed jury ... I think I'm pronouncing it wrong Saudi Arabia Sherrie I'm anyway it I I Love the what he's going to talk about the topic is how can boomers baby boomers I don't know is that us selling business as\nSo what's the best way to to transfer the equity in the business with the with the least amount of tax liability\nOh that's a really good question I think it depends what the one where you're at but you know trust are very good mechanism to do that but sometimes just gifting it just depends\nWhere you're at I mean there's parts in Europe that you know tax at the taxes so high that it's better just to sell the business but there are parts in the middle east for example and then to us and then count them particularly on the east coast where it's the best way is to just give it\nThe trust match gifted trust is what this cold and that way you can save yourself the attacks complications in that regard\nAnd old you have to think of yourself you don't want to give something without getting something out of it right after all the IRS dug in Frank and grind work and then they pass it on to the kids and looks out for them so that has to be sort of a process where you are saying what am I going to get out of this as well\nRight and you're not going to be something that's out on for sure\nYeah we we built it up for a reason so we've got to take a quick break a re a minute hang hang on to the breaking get right back to you know we've got a couple of other questions for you if that's okay it's a re a by Sherry any of the uh the author of interrupted entrepreneurship embracing change in the family will be right back on the business happy hour\nTraffic and whether by hard radios nine ... down on your Web ballet [noise]\n\nFrom the train travel to empower by Burgess heating and air we've gone curly or whether overpass rather right lane is blocked there's a crash germ pass go also on Bachmann highway or chancy road net earlier crashes all off to the side and traffic's getting ... boulevard that accident has been cleared and we have\nOn the refunding Fort Lamar road is completely shut down\nAt the intersection their Alice ... newsworthy United Seventy WFL law firm clouds\nAround to the rest of our Saturday then as we head into the evening it overnight period the clouds will scour out we'll see mostly clear skies by Sunday Morning and a cooler started fifty nine degrees high temperature Seventy eight on Sunday afternoon and there are plenty of sunshine\nWill start warming up Monday low sixty one high eighty two continued sunshine in marine forecast northwest wind up Fifteen not to deport but sees a moderate shopping a high risk of rip currents\nOn news channel a meteorologist ed bloods worth for news radio nine Seventy WFL lay\nMy ...

A.\nS. S. I. R. I. dot com I and we're talking to him about a family businesses and transferring it to your kids ah what do you do I've got a couple of questions I Want to ask a re about the employee in our kid but picking up on where Ryan and and uh and I were talking with ray it uh Ryan had a question about how to transfer\nThe business to your kids with the least tax liability and re was mentioning a trust\nAh but yet and yet in another thought Ryan and as it out of the business owner will make\nWhile I mean if if I'm going to do that I Want to do if my if my kids or my ears aren't going to pay me for the equity in the company that I at least want to receive all the distributions and to the day I die after I die I mean as long as my wife's taking care of and make it you know that I'm I like like a pension\nAlthough I mean just I Want to I Want to retain the profits of the company until I paid for the equity and then what about your son who's running\nFor you you get paid wages you know you get paid you get paid to work so well I tell them what am I made my eye and in the middle of the new ways because you work do you get paid ... home ... in a business that's the that's where most people fail to understand I mean they're two totally different thing right wages are different than profits of my friends\nWhat he's doing he has a daycare and he's selling a daycare and [laughter] just family and their car is basically if they are when it's worse than any given their kids alone for a ten Fifteen Years on it\nSo they're essentially by the business but over a period of time do I know this daycares and you probably do okay right right what do you think about those two strategies\nI I I think it's a good strategy I think you have to use those to add on to the mix the management fee\nEither you're getting a management fee for running the business as the next generation so you don't feel like I'm working for that even though that's not hero mom is not here\nAnd you know that's going to take ten years 'cause you don't know what the you know the results of the company than it would be over the next ten years you've seen the last ... years as spectacularly miserable in some industries so I think if you sort of like being the kid in and say look at it you know I've grown up and take a salary and hit the management fee for you being inside the business\nYou have to also remember you might have five kids and they're all going to inherit the business that one kid is going to be ...\nWhat's the difference was that kid coming into the business working like a donkey and then getting nothing or getting just a salad and feeding liberal you know what I could have got it anywhere else\nAnd I have to wait five or seven years until I pay that back if you put that in the mix then it becomes okay if they're the let me\nTake a little longer for the first generation or the entrepreneur to get back then money but it will be a an amicable relationship so Thanksgiving dinner would be something that's fair to go for every one of the news on dating\nApps that that's a good point I'd like your guy idea to Doug about that thing where you're just giving them alone you know as well as long as you're able to some people when they build their businesses they look at it as a retirement\nYep I'm doing a business that's worth two million dollars I get that money back and that's part of that that's on my retirement jogging you know my ... my dad buildings business over fifty years and he ended up in the end\nHe he didn't have an exit strategy which is something re brought up in an earlier his he didn't have an edge an exit strategy so he ended up yeah many opportunities to sell it and make a good chunk of change but he never did and then by the time you eat decided in the seventies he's gonna salad\nYou know he had a salad you know almost for pennies to somebody I didn't want to take over but it it goes into what ray was saying I was never made interested in it I was never made a part of it\nIt was you know I knew my dad ran a business and had a business where he sold in the seventies in his seventies\nOkay it 'cause I thought that just sold it and I know I just recently yeah hey turn in eighty one actually this week but uh yeah it's ... yeah I Know right I got to tell them that that if you're listening as tomorrow\nUm but it does so right what do you think about employee in your kids um when should we employ a kid you know some people think you should bring your kids even in in where there are six or seven\nYears old and then start employing them and getting them used to tell his legal to do\nThat I mean to me in to visit the offers to get a sense of you know what you do that they can understand why dad or mom away from the house you know Eighteen hours a day seven days a week especially when you're on your business you're twenty four seven right so that gives them\nAn idea of that as they get older maybe you know when you're going to go to college genuinely asked you to have you know or some place where you get an internship apply when you go to university so you know give them any and inside of your work and then let them go and work at somebody else or maybe you dry and consensus gets dark and that can send that gets to Frank\nI Know that way the old the other side that you know is it so\nIt getting on the other side as well as you know it might be better to be working with that and then after they come out of college it's always good to get a few years experience I only did one year and then went back to the family business my brother the pen\nAnd when I spoke\nAt noon hurting me when he spoke it was like he was sick you know speaking you know a ... so it was like you know I could not understand that there was just because they felt like he had to learn more and he spoke\nAt corporate language which I didn't speak I looked on as this kid who just came in and you know carry on and he was lucky to be part of the business so it's a good idea to get a two years and then they can be given the choice of coming in or not one the one thing that I Am so got lucky with was the family and set in investment fund what they said that\nIs an investment fund can be used for all these creative ideas for all the kids and this isolated from the chicken that leaves the golden ... the business\nAnd the way the voice was heard and we found that we had to engage with each other as a gender issue for in our case and that the same time we didn't hurt the business so\nSo as it is out there was this plan not just to get us involved in the business or be interested in it but to feel like we can live at least have a place where we can take the business into some of my ... now my dad passed away four years ago this December and what we're doing the last four years is a continuation of what you did", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Business Happy Hour", "city": "Tampa", "day":
