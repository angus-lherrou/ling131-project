I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kinda look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to ... conservative commentary and things of that character and uh after a doctor forwarded testified the the son of Mike Wallace Chris Wallace said\nForge testimony is extremely emotional extremely wrong extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listener delivery delivery of those words and talk about these sold in the impact it at our life and not have your heart grow up to her this was a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon\nJudge ended up ... generally I respect that I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible Karl Rove the great political theorist said forward as the credible unbelievable\nSo when when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done\nAnd then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and the ... the Democrats showed toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flipped completely\n... but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have an Android Apollo Tono and Karl Rove saying that a woman is credible\nWho providers witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all\nWhen you have a Christine Ford straight up lying about her in capability of flying which you flew everywhere but every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering and the woman wants anonymity to testify\nTurn down the opportunity to be questioned in private and then we find out her lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all\nSo every time I tried to test her credibility\nMaking bart that turns out to be great grossly lacking so when conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't it we completely lost our way\nRight I think we were paying to Colorado yeah completely lost our way because he went to one telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning\nThe people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to your testimony that the women and then I found Brett Kavanaugh people even though there was such a notion from falsely accused innocent\nMan who end up in a court of public opinion in the days leading up to this quote unquote hearing his life was completely turned upside down his wife with getting death threats and his career with looking to be highly sabotage and destroyed\nAs well at this reputation and here we have Christine horn and I do believe that something happened to her she\nObviously has been in therapy for that age I she said herself she has two front doors you know anybody that has to doorbell no there's no snow\nSo obviously she had issues now it just because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples that or that it just because she starts Brett Kavanaugh raped or maybe not but all the evidence that she for that so far fall short of being out of it and\nIn fact if you presented us in a court of law in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in God's or\nWho have no motivation align are allied all who said I don't even know where I'd given all\nThe all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did now they'll get discount mark judge saying okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did then wheeling Kaiser her best girlfriend\nSaid they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know\nI don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that well I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the president's being twenty sixteen\nBut the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list fact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running that didn't happen though November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh getting the Supreme Court what his name one on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned crisscross Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know because ... exactly what were they watching\nAnd hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case it fell short of being an assault case however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility to in order for a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had a beat the post let me tell you something I wasn't given lawyers\nFrom the defensive side that treated me with kid gloves no okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing solve this talks about equal right on gender equality what are you know what\nI was treated not as a woman that as a man as a person and bringing bringing forward charges against another person so to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as though she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily cold cold and the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly than we find out she lives all over the world", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "city": "Tampa", "day": "01"}
