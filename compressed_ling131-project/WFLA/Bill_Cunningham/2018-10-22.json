them the numbers have swelled to about ten thousand and every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them they talk about a gentleman by talking about what Trump wants you to do\nAnd and the F. word all these things are shouted against our president\nThey're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn off for them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop the let them clamor aboard to go north and so over the next several weeks we're going to have\nTens of thousands of individuals from the most violent place on Mother Earth make their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically the media is telling us we should encourage it an outlet and and let it occur\nLike Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them well there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice\nSouth America and Central Americans and Mexicans somebody like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million what would that do to our guts\nAre meant to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million want to come here\nAnd because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they will permit that because if you're from other than Mexico too you know the words from Central America and you may go to America\nThere's a magic card that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins a legal process it will take years in the meantime you're inside of America waiting for hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled to have enough camps\nThey have enough judicial officers do you have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border\nSo far this year until October first which was what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions\nWho adopted her jet and so the game being played by the Democrats as extremely serious if you're from Mexico here illegally you're going to take and right back immediately if you're from Central America you have the right to hearing that goes on and on and on and never stops so\nUh I I'm interested to see\nWhen and if the media will change their coverage to provide objective information\nThe damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminals societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals and the rest there is no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California\nTexas ... New Mexico through legal migration ... there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders of rapes et cetera it does not exist\nRemember that nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border\nSixteen of the twenty most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI said in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration federal judges and the economy right now with Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable Trump has everyone from North Korea to Russia believing we're about to bust\nUp every new treaty necessary to keep to get America back on even track the trade

that's the world you live and you want more individuals here with a third grade education\nEighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak at the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community please bring them according to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue\nOf unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan the vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way\nThrough the magic wand that we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans\nCentral Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have we're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through press says these we've taken legally one point one million\nForeigners to come into America take the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together we already do that one point one million but I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here\nAnd watch hordes of young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply illegally make their way somehow into America\nClaim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five to ten years from now that will

the Senate if that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist\nDo we have the do we have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people are the schools coined in such a fashion other hospitals ready to go or other bridges the roads the expressway he's ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how\nIs this possible that's the most violent places on earth is sending has largely young males to come into America\nI got a Kevin Jackson coming up later an African American leader of great note there is no race or a group of people more hurt\nBy legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males\nThey figured out that this is not benefit them at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit American public education doesn't benefit the hospital systems that we have this benefit any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy\nAbsolutely not we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that we are a nation of immigrants but there are legal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join the country\nCome in and walk into a country which you don't belong to a not a citizen up men demand rights are you kidding me oh last year the question tonight is that the issue that's going to cause\nMillions of Americans in two weeks

probably going to be down at the border in a week or so they're trying to get over a hundred thousand I Hope I said before you know by the time it's spring hits him than Trump has already said he's not used in the reserves you used to that real army and I think the plan is they want to be like another state kind of ours\nBecause our troops on the border\nThe immigrants are being told don't worry store of it like a storm the Mexican border a few days ago max out oh he put in a token effort to hold them twenty four hours or ... the U.S and share with Mexico because Trump has got a very good Mexico why'd you let all these people on our border\nThe troops are going to be there they got to be colder stormed the truth\nI think there's got to be a lot of gunfire a lot of Democrats are going to be there they're\nOh it's going to be here to mediate we're this is all court\nOffend them and that's why you're from a Dick Blumenthal he used a war hero a state of Connecticut but in Connecticut which is a deep blue state in financial difficulty\nI does this play well with residents of Connecticut because when I watch CNN or ABC News I'm thinking they're thinking this is playing horribly for Trump\nWhere I live in Ohio we don't want ... will happily take one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together as legal citizens who take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals come and go ... most violent places on earth we don't want the is this playing well in Connecticut\nIn ... in Connecticut there's so many people fleeing the

to see the eagle illegal immigrants here in Connecticut\nAnd you know it's disgusting and remember\nRemember here's the deal if you're from Mexico and get caught you're sent back immediately because of the law if you're from Central America and you said the magical words I'm a refugee and I want to hearing\nYou get in line with a couple of million others and you never ever hearing venue released

added no Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd then add welcome to the bill Cunningham show ed please go ahead\nYes first of all the FBI or us national security establishment should investigate and find out who's funding the current current boys or that\nOr whatever they are called uh they can't have that capability and they should find out who's doing it also kind of Obama drone American citizens like this hour we eat guy kill them all up you know ... and then the media doesn't change you know they really do much later they killed as a sixteen year old son\nAnd it's because you know ... if ... if in the view of CNN ... can be used as a club or against Trump to do it\nBut they're out of whack he's being killed by Obama's no big deal the Iowa college kid raped and killed by that a legal immigrant uh that was quickly dropped she's gone ah cops that are killed on a regular basis no big deal in fact\nThat ... that kind of behavior not part of the world is regular that's what goes on there and I don't like it much\nBut I think CNN doesn't like the fact that Israel has become friendly with Saudi Arabia I mean when I heard Trump\nSomehow I hear Trump's comments about journalists and then I hear about ... ... is the Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN get do and why why did why more valuable than a cubs like\nNPR is that what you're subsidized by the taxpayers is the same I end up look at the head of the past it goes back to stand in the oil as political up on a boat\nBush and Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the other way at that guy because we needed a bass their supply Afghanistan\nPlus ... says the African Business conference that Obama held ripped fifty African leaders and I think the daily mail newspaper looked at it and it was the ... gallery of human rights violators and corrupt officials\nBut you know the media like CNN and MSNBC and and the are they just falling over how the great Obama was reaching out to Africa not looking at the human rights background of this spot\nFor tourists African leaders so the whole thing is sick\nOr not and and you went over that quickly but use backers than had a leader\nWho would boil ally ... political opponents and while that was going on Obama and Hillary replace you putting around with this guy and the media that that was no big deal right there boil alive your political opponents that's okay because Obama\nIn fact I was even that does this get off the site or a little bit I was thinking it would be good to ... the first state of you know like oh my God\n[laughter] the reason why is because people if we if we could come and run their country and get rid of look at it with people would jump to that and they would be more patriotic\nAnd you have a gym thank you but here's some

Research Center ... well ... all one of my buddies\nEvery few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough the good\nThey only report the bad and miss it ministry under the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working than any other time in our nation's history conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about I here's a great example just last week I think it was\nA President Trump getting interview with Leslie stall for sixty minutes she interrupted him sixty five times during that interview to put that in comparison when sixty minutes during an interview with bronco bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him\nMore times have their own agenda their agenda is to make the president look bad not to give him the credit that he deserves for the successes that he said because they no longer in the business of reporting the news they're now in the business of making the news and the big change over the last two decades\nCorey Lewandowski the president or the other night in Montana framed it as mobs\nVersus jobs the only difference is the Edmond J and I think that's brilliant on his part because well look at Brett Kavanaugh all\nAlong about a trucks that ever trumps sticker on getting burned I look at congressman getting shot I look at a Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with tens\nOr I look at how you're confronted and airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs and do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose him there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because what the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the the cost of violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's\nA Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break you know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember\nRepublicans or conservatives for that matter going after members of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with\nSarah Huckabee Sanders we've seen with secretary Nielsen\nThe I guess we've seen with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life because the mob violence say antifa is so out of control here and there you go on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better this president has created\nI think over for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want this president if you didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences\nThat Democrats I hate to say this and they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the culturally is acceptable to me the fame and to make fun of and dismay or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper that I Will watch nonetheless I saw him and TMZ and I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump\nWas stripping nude in the oval office performing sex acts in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure he might sell a lot of lot of his songs and records from that can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad to pick the Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office and performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\nIt wouldn't be front page news for a week on end that wrap that the the country artist would have had his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his\nRelationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her\nNew you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was\nNo it was appropriate because she was an adult president that the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the the converse if Donald Trump\nWhen he made that statement but he gave the Democrats exactly what they've argued they wanted for a long time and they said no we're not going to give that to me want to have the political football they don't want to continue to make sure that the people coming across the border\nIllegally and going to sanctuary cities in century states have the opportunity to vote we now see this in Texas and we've seen in other places that they're targeting individuals who are not us citizens and asking them to go and vote they they are\nBought and sold by the Democratic party those illegal immigrants coming in here and they want to keep that flow to continue it doesn't make sense to me is our first obligation is to the people in this country to make sure they are safe and secure and we\nAbsolutely need immigration there are jobs that we need them to come and fill on a temporary basis\nBut you're exactly right it come through the system your check you are authorized to come in you pay whatever fair share it is there is either vacation and then when your job is done you go back to your country that how it works that that was always work and we just need to know better job and forcing that\nCorey Lewandowski Leslie there's been some speculation that a\nHillary Clinton is making Iran and twenty twenty you know I think Hillary Clinton did a great job as first lady she was a wonderful United States senator she was a fabulous secretary's day and she was a wonderful candidate for the Democratic party in twenty sixteen I Would encourage her to run\nI Would help her get signatures maybe raise the money for would you encourage Hillary Clinton to become the Democratic party's standard bearer standard bearer and twenty twenty would you do a great job\nWe love this look hundred and thirty two electoral votes two years ago that number is only going down she wouldn't be up for the greatest loss of an election since Ronald Reagan's re election effort when he destroyed his opponent and I think Donald Trump would end up with north of four hundred\n... he beat Donald Trump\nBeat her by Seventy four electoral votes and what your listeners remember but then when they woke up on a Monday of twenty sixteen the New York times and all those mainstream media outlets said Hillary Clinton as a Ninety nine percent\nChance of winning today Ninety nine percent when we get to more than there's only two people on the ballot so I Want her to run I run we want to go\nBack through all of her email scandal all of the money that she's gotten from foreign governments when she was the secretary of state in the Clinton Foundation and all the fact that she's lost her security clearance let's go re litigated all let's put it back in front of the Democratic party\nNo car she'd be a wonderful candidate I mean I could not thinking of any one more qualified to represent the Democratic party than Hillary Rodham Clinton that would be a beautiful thing\nWell look if if if if you have my help I think you and I can encourage her to get on the ballot will clear the field critics I\nThink all the superdelegates maybe you've heard of the that's how she stole the last election from Bernie Sanders right we'll put those back in place shoring a system just like she did it last time I lose worse\nShe did a great job great job by Corey Lewandowski will do it again give me your production in about two weeks house in the Senate give me your production\nUh I think in the head of the Republicans gained four or five seats are increasing the majority and in the house I'm going to say that it's a bold prediction the Republicans are going to

want to watch somebody be destroyed over a thick ideology known as left isn't and I think it's pathetic and the far reaching ramifications\nImpact the guys like Bill Cosby\nWho sits in print than at the age of Eighteen years old and American icon\nSits in prison in his eighties over allegations that date back for five decades meanwhile a guy who vowed then I mean you know denial sex abuser Bill Clinton runs around here campaigning\nI tell you it was amazing ... you had a situation where he actually raped a woman who told at that one eight of Broderick\nWhen Clinton raped her what what the bloody lamp told her a room mate what happened the roommate solved the blood on her lap saw her pantyhose was torn she actually had four or five corroborating witnesses as the event took place and then they also had the so called uh Arkansas state troopers confirming the fact\nThat the one eight abroad ... was actually raped and then you have while he's in the White House is president sexually groping and molesting Kathleen Willie in the White House\nAnd that was well known and corroborated but the media completely ignored both of those events because it didn't fit did it but it did good to go to Brett Kavanaugh\nAbsolutely and so that that's the double standard and then the bigger double than it has to do more with men\n... me too movement and trying to to learn how the left tries to migrate thing how they try to get us to take ownership so the ownership of me to\nGet a bunch of left this led truth Hollywood lefty okay it's the Harvey Weinstein is of the world with all these young on the news and these old school actresses and all these pop political feminists\nTaking pictures of Harvey going to his party's extending its virtues that awards dinners and so on while enabling him to do exactly what he's been doing for women for a decade\nDating back decades and all the the the trail of women who did exactly what Harvey ask them to do getting their butts ...\nOut and then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but then what's interesting me two\nEnds up being the bill ends up being part of a\nWoman being used against Kavanaugh being used against ah\nThe high powered CEOs of companies [noise] this movement is born of the lectures activities of left us in Hollywood that and and and the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy and suddenly a guy like Kavanaugh they want to make him the\nPoster child I mean it just it bores me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters on summer in terms of physicians would somebody\nA Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama is elected Harvey Weinstein to to take their daughters ended the Hollywood scene when they knew or should have known exactly what was going on from all their connections but they couldn't care less Harvey Weinstein was a star\nHarvey Weinstein had access Harvey Weinstein was are making millions of dollars and giving millions the Democratic party including the Obamas so they set their own daughters end of the carrot custody in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nKnow they didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are untouchable\nBut you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people there the daughter that you know that you got to be concerned about because Harvey will take advantage of them but the ... what what rock Obama's selling us\nI have so much power I Know that this guy that led to his left this who will take advantage of women and every time but I can put my daughters with them but don't you dare put yours\nThat's exactly how the left stacks up I can do it you can't because I'm covered but you're not\nAnd and look at the lesson it ended up precautionary tale\nFor many many boys I said many times what harmless thing is your kid your son going to do at the age of Fifteen 'cause some woman's gonna come back twenty five thirty years later and say oh look at what you did to me more if he's not even going to remember it he is not going to be insignificant to him and her\nBecause something may be important in life she decide I'll take him down for what\nYou know it it was hanging by a thread two weeks ago and now he's on the court and I think the other issue I Want to get your perspective on this Kevin Jackson and the black sphere which is the what's happening now with the Honduran migrants\nComing through a Guatemala into Mexico there right now is three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward the Texas border this was a terrible event for the Democrats over the next two weeks before the election they have the video and the pictures of thousands of migrants\nWhenever I watch MSNBC all I hear about is women and children then I see the video of these migrants coming to urban areas in America and they're almost always young males and the young women tend to be raped or sexually molested the men are drug meals and I'm sure there's good family members among them\nAnd Kevin Jackson of you and your wife and your children were in a\nMore in Honduras in a bill Cunningham and my wife and kids were in\nAnd we're in Honduras living the horrors of socialistic left wing military hunter regime\nThe first thing I Would want to do would be to get to America I understand that completely but along the process it gives billions of dollars and Thirteen other gang bangers to provide the passage every time you go through some other drug infested area Mexico you got to pay\nHomage you gotta pay either sex or money to even pass through and and live by the time you get to the northern part of Mexico according to sixty minutes about two months ago there's hundreds of dead bodies because some men did not want to participate and becoming drug meals to get drugs into America\nSome women were killed because they did not want to be

Brett Kavanaugh having been\nConfirmed for the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the road of the five of the five member majority would be interested in raining in the administrative state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they are able to make\nCan you give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think the FCC I think the IRS\nBut you're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats\nAbout about one point two million strong new every day meeting offices mainly in Washington but our little all over the country and then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they sort of not acting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers\nAnd then they issue these three thousand new rules that day that must be complied with how much harm is not causing is\nWhere I think it's causing a lot of harm in the sense of for businesses of course it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with\nCompliance activities are very extensive for business is one of the estimates that I have in the book is that each year it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nDo that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on through all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that we could do\nThat an important factor in fact a trillion dollars this more than the government actually tax uh either from businesses are from individuals each year this is a very significant thing but it\nCan be turned back towel and be reduced give me\nThe idea here and described in the book is that the court can step in and begin to review carefully the legislation under which all of these rules are made and very frequently\nUm the rules are based on laws that were ... years ago her time generations ago and they are perpetrated by the administrative agency to get it and the authorities if she will be in a room\nAnd the court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute\nWe've gone too far that Congress did not give you the authority to make this rule and there are a number of examples in the book where um you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorized do it\nThe court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called conditional forward it to they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agencies then we can actually beginning to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time does not hot summer in Philadelphia and Seventeen Ninety seven article one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instruments ... government because of the best reflects the will of the people", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "22"}
