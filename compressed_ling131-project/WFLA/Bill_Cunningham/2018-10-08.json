Ramirez shaking his junk and her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either\nAnd then one of the silent heroes of this has been the porn lawyer Michael ... boy did a great job\nFor the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous antithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact they cast light away from away from a from a doctor forward and Debbie ... and put it on sweating to nobody believed in fact here's a quote from\nSenator Collins on Saturday quote some of the allegations Lebanon against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important I'm thinking in particular none of the allegations raised by professor forward\nBut at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls and use their weaken state to facilitate gang rape this outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parrot it\nPublic statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process\nIs a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote so said a Senator Susan Collins\nAnd that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael ... is doing a great job representing the Democratic party and needs to keep doing it plus uh\nAs far as supporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin ... I read some way of a expert from the independent women's forum Julie gun coming up later on but Patrice Lee ... spent on my show many times\nWrote a column a sudden this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kevin Oh she said those who promote the slogan\nSet up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you that you then must believe the allegations\nOf Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kavanaugh was lying and you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman\nI can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case\nIf I was a member of a jury sitting at a rape matter my sympathy would be what the victim however I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others\nHave exonerated through late DNA testing rape rapist to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory counts\nAnd Van Dyke Perry who spent and combine thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied or how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from Hofstra their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow student and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that are allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done\nPlus innocent projects it got an innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated of rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate\nBut ten percent or more are not accurate in other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock of American Jurisprudence\nThis writer goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement\nThese fires are not in competition to treat men fairly all victims deserve justice\nBut justice is not one sided due process in fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men so when you look at the allegations of professor cursing and afford\nThey completely fall apart they don't exist\nThere is no cooperation and so you can't say we support the me too movement and we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict\nExcept in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist\nTo chase down Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that his wrongful activity she couldn't say that in fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans and show you where we are\nA judge third part of the sixth circuit us

American I'm not I'm not felt this good in so many years I Can't stand them\nTo rely upon Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham\nTo be the key voices the United States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold beginning the night she was brilliant going over forty five minutes why she was going to support and then I I Try to listen and Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all it seems like slime ball tactics\nHave good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason\nShe could not listen to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd and maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees when the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of ah Brett Kavanaugh as his wife his mom and dad as girls and what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness in title nine\nThat's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl up some sexual assault the most likely did not happen they get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness\nConfronting your accusers all that kinda stuff doesn't apply so in the minds of Democrats this was the title nine case in which the allegation was made\nAnd therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford once investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything Ford said fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses\nIncluding her real version of the facts from er twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapist notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was\nI'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing and so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends\nAnd she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for reelection and two years but she ought to\nBut now a clowns and fools to come out of the woodwork like Valerie Jarrett up in ... the fame to run against or in Maine have added must continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThanks bill I appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party to the pornography industry if you don't mind sure yeah do you know the Democrats claim to care about women but I'm over the years\nI wanted her largest supporters has been the pornography industry and I'm just wondering if they're really cared about women why did they take money from these people who would like women that way\nAbout Michael ... to porn lawyer and I I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael ... he is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky Michael having any run against ...\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they did have one criminal ... should against pornography and open the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this bad stuff this pilot stuff you see out there\nDuring the porn stopped a porn industry has given millions of dollars of the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies and subject getting women July for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they cared about sexual assault or women\nThan their leader would not be the U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota if they really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton won\nBeen a nominee in ... if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and do you do but actually are doing a lot of harm to these people because of you know the old effect of the boy who cried wolf now nobody is going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nOr if a woman comes forward with the probably eight or nine times out of ten it is correct\nBut every now and then you have Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UBA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges\nFrom false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time but I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor forward I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow did you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me about the second door telling me about the fear of flying all these things Lewis turned out to be a lie or misstatement or not true you know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen\nWhen she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth and she said and twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist\nThat she was a attempted rape by four boys in her late teens and the Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kevin all his because he was one boy\nAnd by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he had moved to Connecticut so she had to tell the fib\nThat it was ... but the but the notes of the therapists clearly indicated it could not have been bred to Kevin you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help\nPsychiatric help or medical assistance you are incentivized to tell the truth not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when it's really your left foot because you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen\nWho made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said and twenty twelve now for boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and made Nineteen eighties she had flipped out on Kavanaugh and changed the story

of feeling step towards your husband and your dad\nYour brothers are male what kind of feelings damp toward them and you may have male children or grandchildren you want to live in a world where because of your gender your automatically just believed or believed in other words\nEvery now and then a woman lies and every now and then the man is not guilty of rape or sexual assault happens all the time so you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because a man is charged he's got to shut up and it was a line to be\nMurdered merged between the me too movement on one hand and wound up ... percent acceptance\nOn the other the fact you want to believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do is a criminal defense attorney\nA take off my hat and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen or a person says my house was burglar eyes or a victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault\nI naturally want to believe that person but then if a person is charged I Want to live in a world that says that person is due process rights because that is the rigorous\nReaction of substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor forward through a any rigorous process\nThat determined voice you were saying was accurate now here we are several days later after she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people got attacked or what had happened how it happened\nThat how old she was the timeframe that happened in the two front door was the ... the fearing to fly was ridiculous and her boyfriend came out and says she was a safe and some of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute\nMaybe what I heard originally is not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News\nAfter she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself\nNow hold up on that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says is if it's accurate but two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and at one end not because she needed an extra way out but because a small business owner a therapist want it to rent a part of her house\nAnd she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door that had nothing to do it cost her phobia\nThen the board friend follows the affidavit saying we flew little planes all over French Polynesia and to Haiti and uh Hawaii we also went on trips to Central America to South America and and the euro\nShe had no fear of flying it was a lie in fact there was nothing she said ... that turn out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about finding the truth they had a ball face\nMitigated allegation that could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you want to get into\nThe veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said that she has mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and and the person with the Y chromosomes\nThat's a liar but then the truth came out and it's like well don't don't bother me with the facts\nThat's what caused a writer for the call bears CBS late night show to say quote aerial doom is said quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote fat is reflective and indicative\nOf what the Democratic Party things today about Brett Kavanaugh we ruined his life were ruined his wife were ruined his mom and dad and were ruined his daughters so aerial do most of the

in Wisconsin Mike in Wisconsin welcome to the bill Cunningham show Mike how are you\nA great really how are you good really I think we need to learn from experience and you had an earlier caller I think it was Brian from India that that was an inspiring phone call because he like he was a traditional Democrat and he's now come over to our side\nHow are we going to get more people to come over our side I think there are three ways number three I think there are people like Brian who saw\nNot only dishonest they are downright evil they will do nothing to get a power number two that Democrats socialists progress is incapable of analyzing facts whether it be about climate change whether it be the lives that that Dr forward presented in front of the Senate tradition\nProvable lies that still are ignored by the mainstream media provable lie\nI Want to be ... say they're misconceptions but damn it they were alive because she lied about flying\nShe lied about that second front door she lied about the four boys became one she lied about her late teens now it's Fifteen she lied about the fact that was the mid Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty two because Greg Kevin all in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nAnd and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that\nWe Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to fight them is by\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yeah I talked to a college hats off to Lindsey Graham about political forces the only way that we are going to be cut and we can avoid a civil war as your last guest said how can we do that by Bruce waiting for my beating them at the ballot\nGot away and you got to vote you got to you know Schumer said one thing Saturday and that was correct you got to vote in the ... if you take away the Democratic party from the coast and about seven or eight major cities\nThere's no Democrats hardly anywhere there's this sea of red from the the shining see it say irrelevant minimalist party but the problem is the mainstream media is there a megaphone ... and the major media will not cover objectively this president nor any Republican president they didn't cover Alito correctly that didn't cover Roberts\nAnd look what they did a cabin all look what's next to Amy Coney Barrett ought to be the next Supreme Court justice\nFrom Notre Dame and when that happens all hell is going to break loose and Barbie gene ... made certain maker you watch that fight\nWe really didn't need to thank you today to hear Eric Holder who scale contempt of Congress to say that now we have to call into question the legitimacy of this of the Supreme Court\nLet me see Billy for the last forty years since Nineteen thirty seven says conservatives had a majority on the Supreme Court we never question but let me see if the promise but now all of a sudden when we go through a legitimate process of confirmation all of a sudden they stand up and say we've got to question the whole legitimate you process do you recall outrageous\nDo recall in the third debate that Trump made a Trump was asked whether or not if he lost the election if he would accept it\nAnd the media has a meltdown when Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept the results ed ... elections if he felt it was rigged against him and the media Hillary Clinton New York times jumped on top of Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone thought a core Salinger was going to win\nAnd then Trump won and up to this point Hillary and a major media has not accepted the outcome and the election and so they became what they criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said I may not accept the outcome of the election because it looked like it it's ranked however\nThe media went after him Hillary one after him Hillary said let's be clear about what are you saying and that means he's talking down American democracy and I'm appalled that someone is the nominee of one of the two major parties would take that position quote unquote Mallory Clinton but then Trump won and Hillary never considered the election\nShe never accepted the ballot box\nNew York times never accepted the fact that Trump won so they became what they criticize it it was nothing but nothing short of a ... and thank you for your call let's continue now with a show in New Hampshire it's been there for about an hour show and New Hampshire welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joe go ahead\nAnd Mr Cunningham thank you for taking my call um agree with everything that's been said prior to ... and your summation of everything so
