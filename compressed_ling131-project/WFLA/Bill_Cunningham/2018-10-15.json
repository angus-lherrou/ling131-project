silk or I think fabulous and diamond in silk reminded me\nHit him on two or three months ago\nAbout how dangerous it is\nFor an African American to step out of line and not to be a liberal Democrat there is no more loyal part isn't\nVoting bloc in America than African Americans especially African American women they both like Ninety six percent democratic African American men vote about Ninety percent but there's no more loyal partisan group for the Democratic party\nThan African Americans especially every American women some as diamonds silk about that but\nWhat happened Tuesday and Wednesday I think a ... was in the White House I might have been Tuesday or Wednesday and CNN honored Jeff Zucker viciously and racially using pejorative racial terms racism attacked Kanye West\nBakari sellers is a former Democratic office holder and South Carolina now he's a paid contributor to CNN said about Kanye West quote Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nSo he's said he's illiterate stupid he went on to say quote Donald Trump is going to use it in pervert it and he's going to have somebody who can stand with them and take pictures\nBut then it gets worse CNN said terrorists set Meier who's a coins herself as a former Republican said quote this ...\nThis is an African American woman talking quote\nBlack folks are about to trade Kanye and the racial draft they've had it with him he's an attention whore like the president he's the token negro\nOf the Trump Administration unquote so you have an African American paid commentator saying\nNumber one she is speaking for all black Americans black folks are about to trade Kanye the racial draft they've had it with him as she spoken to thirty five million blacks and that's what they tell her\nAnd and it really couldn't have got much worse so racism was used by CNN\nShe went on to say quote no one should take ... seriously he clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized unquote Jimmy Kimble said that he's irrational on a madman snoop doggy dog eat dog eat citizen Uncle Tom\nAnd so entertainers comics late night comics have gone after in the past Clarence Thomas\nAnd Jesse ... Peterson and Colin Powell\nAnd Benjamin Carson in ... and others for being disloyal to the Democratic party when the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them practically every chance they have ... ... it's incredible to watch what's going on back for the past half century\nNinety percent of black voters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest the Democrats have consistently opposed go choice\nTrapping kids and failing public schools for generations they've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which has destroyed black working class jobs\nAnd champion Bill Clinton's crow NAFTA policies which have led the massive levels of unemployment in black communities they've also Democrats or crippled a black families find bracing welfare writes the penalized married couples who get married it goes on and on and on\nAnd this was all said in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon\nWho laughed with venomous Lee and what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican\nHad called some black guy a house negro or use other racial pejorative against them they wouldn't be kicked off set but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history with CNN did\nThe Kanye West borrows from an ugly\nUgly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly punished any black man or woman\nWho sought to educate themselves and think for themselves the Democrat white slave owners in the south\nHad their control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats slave owners head to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan\nAs a terrorist arm of the Democratic party\nTo intimidate murder Lynch suppress and destroy any political activities\nOf the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard later on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy test\nAnd other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line to protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats because the ... media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS\nControl black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control where well I watch free thinking African American men and women be personally destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media and Democratic Party and so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration\nBlack unemployment historically low\nCriminal justice reform is coming he's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers\nHe's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter of black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity and so\nWhat happened and Kanye West is the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas\nTo Jesse ... Peterson the Congolese arise to any black who steps out of line they're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're caught on called Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill by Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed\nAgainst a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints that's why CNN working with the Democratic party much destroy Kanye West and and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith\nThat African Americans maybe in three weeks we'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party\nHas done to them and not for them the truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee the schools are completely dysfunctional\nThe black family is completely broken there's no job creation the average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years\nWith no discernible results yet when a black man like Kanye West steps out of line and it begins to express support for a different political outlook he has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book because it fits the idea\nOf the Democratic party keeping blacks in law and they want to dissuade other African American men\nFrom thinking an acting independently of the Democratic party\nThat is cause such harm\nCan you think a worst cities to live in one control by crime and poverty single mothers\nAcademic failure racial inequality that is the result whether whatever black city it is controlled by Democrats what occurs when you think about how badly the Democratic party treated blocks the relevant question isn't y\nThe Khan family Kanye West Jim Brown whatever it is right now it's all about ... some al media want you to think the president's not responding correctly to the murder maybe\nI'm a Saudi Arabian and his damn bowl as if the six or seven hundred blacks killed in Chicago every year can't be used at all by the mainstream media against Trump's did they ignored or the four thousand shot they can't be used\nIn Chicago to attack the president so they ignore it but whatever the media can find some ... some club they hit the president what they're going to do it let's continue with more coming up next to this my interview with the president\nThen at the top of the last star with Bill O'Reilly O'Reilly factor is on tonight also in about an hour or so\nWe have diamonds Silverman are going to call in from the Carolinas to talk about how to black women support someone like Donald Trump when the media attacks blacks who get jump out of line much like a southern slave owners would keep blacks are dumb down and illiterate that's the goal of the modern\nDemocratic Party to keep them in line Let's continue thirty minutes after they are still counting of the great American live with you [noise] every something [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] profit and whether hard radios nine Seventy WFL a [noise]\nFrom the train traffic center powered by millionaire no reports of any major lays on your inner Satan Bradley throughout his friend from Dallas County the evening I for two Seventy five Anthony five are checking delayed for half the time\nThe court became ...

have a long distance relationship here I Do I have had ... ships I had swift in\nWith my father a long time ago and we uh we did a good job we fix it up\nWe uh eleven hundred and sixty four you underserved remember the exact we fix it if I worked here for two summers sick of it by ... that's right right by since I don't even know if it's still there now and knocked down about six months ago a really yellow and gone the whole thing including the garbage day everything's on what's going to happen with the\nMaking of housing development oh okay good but it was great for us we fixed it\nAnd sold it for more money and ah it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city was talking about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I it we got back many people actually if you look at it it's like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and I know president\nAnd the pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion and uh we got them back and he's going to be safe for short leaves in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll in the in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody

to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal in what was accomplished with Maloney\nIn Africa well she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very Saturn and other kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you are going to continue\nTo give a lot of money because they needed is not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it just sits on a human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had\nA big impact on me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what'd you do not cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be happy and an South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the trade deal\nAnd we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nomination so what happened over here with you still have building's empty without just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were sick and so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making our refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just need to deal with South Korea which is much much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said that's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with south where so\nMany jobs and talking to my are we talking about Canada and Mexico are we talking about a million\nMore energized sees me Lebanon they lined up yesterday morning I see there's twenty thousand trying to get into two thousand yeah it's a problem with the size of the right way to see what happens when you're not going to believe the energy\nBut we had it in Pennsylvania the other night with twenty five thousand people outside of a twelve thousand it already and it's been amazing and if that kind of you know action shows up in three weeks and you imagine it's just a little more than three we\nGot the energy for the next three weeks because you're like Elvis a lower and that\nMight think sixty eight yeah I Know it's a good old I've got three more weeks loved three weeks they have\nTwenty five days and twenty five days I'm Out campaigning for many of those days I Do all of them\nBut you could only move this big equipment

making it's just ridiculous how the media coverage that you know media Research Center and my friend Brent ... says that Ninety three percent of the media coverage of Trump is negative I\nThink it's higher than that I don't recall with all these great things happening the media objectively covering the Trump Administration give me fifty fifty somebody's talking the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC\nOr the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper Hollywood movies too late night comics are all one way and and I said\nI guess it's group think because they all live in either Hollywood or New York\nBut but can you imagine if CBS or ABC would say you know what we're going to go a different direction we're going to start covering the news objectively we're going to have conservatives from top to bottom in America is a conservative country right thirty two states are controlled by ... or a Republican governors\nHouse the Senate Supreme Court we are basically a moderate to right wing or conservative what CBS what's safe from top to bottom we're going to resolve well we're going to reflect conservative values\nAnd cover the news objectively I think those of us who are normal would flock to CBS News and that ABC NBC and CNN would take one alibi hit the only one that is conservative more or less right now is Fox you know if they're leaning left quite often was Shepard Smith and people like that\nAnd you see what the ratings have Hannity are every night Sean draws about four million viewers every night so those kinds of interviews I just conducted was their regular event on CBS Evening news or ABC I give up any hope for NBC\nThose ratings would double and triple\nAnd it would become the dominant evening newscast if somehow one of the other ones would say you know what from top to bottom we're going to reflect the values of people in this country that that are pro God pro family pro military pro police and we're going to reflect that\nAll you got to do is look at Newsmax TV or a one American network and you'll find conservative values in the news that reflects the American people so let's continue\nWhenever calls from California Texas North Carolina Louisiana and Ohio have long becomes available number to call his eight six six six or seven seven three ... three seven and about thirty minutes\nDiamond in silk those

persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and who was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many

the sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible the level of

a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I look at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be right in and South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat us that way what did you do with the trade deal\nAnd we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come and then Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told them look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada that just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominees or what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S MCA and its works good but we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we're just men to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so\nMany jobs and talking to my every time I can or Mexico we're talking about a million\nTalking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff to make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall\nBecause if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states
