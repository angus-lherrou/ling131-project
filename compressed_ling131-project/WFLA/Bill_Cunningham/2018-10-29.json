too I Would cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG device in just Ninety nine dollars to order visit cardio dot com and then we have\nAnd not a doctor is Jewish and the two nurses who first arrived at the scene to save the rotten filthy life for Robert Bowers are Jewish how\nSerendipitous\nThe Jews save the life of Robert Bowers and if I was in charge I Would a deal with all the other ones first to deal with him last know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor my God\nAnd so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months and I like to know where are the people he communicated with was\nHe on friend that was ... who else knew what he ... he was saying the things he was saying and and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great\nFriend of Israel and Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history Deb Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka has become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner is a ah\nOrthodox Jews the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish religious functions is I have and so this guy who ah hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill\nNo criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews\nWhen Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had a few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit to attack President Trump\nThe evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo one headline Saturday yesterday and the Washington Post said\nBomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump so the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump to put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and\nTwelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried\nTo assassination attempts and the murder of Jews not by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post\nThat are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not\nIn fact on the day that CNN received the photo bomb in the mail from ... the New York times ran\nA progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself\nAssassinating President Trump with Russian help it it's unbelievable on that day and in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor\nOf the play in Washington park that simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar\nThey had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and the performance and uh\nOne of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN now can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent companies or Fox News had a play in Central Park that simulated\nStabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama I Want to know the immediate reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar\nThat had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death in fact after James Hodgkinson attempt at the masses assassination of Republican members of Congress\nResulting in the motor wounds ... the Washington Post the next day\nRan a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow\nSo instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the cap and take the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC the Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by\nRight wing talk radio\nOver the last several weeks much like the ah the photo bomb sent through about fourteen people\nThere have been at least twenty examples of left wing or ...\nSending envelopes filled with white powder so many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like secretary defense James Mattis the president himself\nThe vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail envelopes containing white powder simulating rice and\nIn fact the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home\nOf Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it because all of the news that fits they print and if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there is a political violence\nCommitted by James Hodgkinson\nOf Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an ID cruise chased out of restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant a Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance\nOf Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio\n... and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media doesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor Brett Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote an word one other example\nWhenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence\nBut win largely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all\nAnd so this is a long history of radical leftist and some on the right committing acts\nOf violence that is covered completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion is Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up as Trump stabbed to death and people apply in fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam on big at the anti Semite\nOut a large rally that Jews are termites in thousands in attendance applauded and cheered calling juice termites that is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and Brock Hussein Obama stood next to had pictures taken with at the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency and overweight\nNot to allow the public to know that it was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago and that that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan\nAnd Obama because it was bad politically so this whole thing disgust me I Hope soon very soon\nBut a few hours is killed either a by lethal injection ... heading\nElectric chair shooting whatever it takes powers has got to go the way Timothy McVeigh for violence and Bowers was a Trump hater but the Washington Post has somehow implicitly tied Trump to the murder\nOf God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh\nThe whole thing is disgusting when you get your reaction plus we're going to have later on David re a fair to talk about what's happening on the southern border is anyone thought about the public health crisis caused\nWear those southerners who wanted to keep southern monuments\nAnd the other side where those protesting he was not referring to the white nationalist carrying tiki torches shouting racial and ethnic slurs at night in Charlottesville there's no good people among that group you cannot be a good man or a good woman shouting racial or Jewish lawyers\nAnd the southern city at night carrying torches there is no good coming from that that is blatant racism and that's wrong\nLet's

not associated with these people it it's all [noise] um [noise]\nWell I Know I just I just Google this\nDecember third the Nineteen Ninety five the Reverend Al Sharpton apparently referred to the Jewish shown or uh Freddy's fashion martyrs they're white interlopers in a rally three months before the Harlem massacre\nNewly revealed tapes show Sharpton is not named Freddy but mentions the least dispute and calls out his audience Nineteen years ago Al Sharpton and cited the massacre at Fridays furniture Mart because a Jewish a\nSmall business owner moved into the black community and so I I just Google it\nAnd how how does he get away with it\nThat's what I'm saying I got away with it that Middle East is going on and on it it's the people for this crap\nAnd you know the other thing is that the guy who sat right to the White House and it wasn't the right thing he actually got the castor bean made rice and\nMrs you're calling from Utah and this is the guy who's now when they're an indictment now this one's in a large media stories that fair to say in other words maybe it\nWasn't even a larger comedians story here in Utah\nAnd second hey it's below the fold and and and all the white powder sent to the Trump children not much of the story at All right now I don't know just being concoction would have actually\nCause any damage but it was like a fake pipe bomb in other words it was intended to cause fear and if someone would get that and you open an envelope and you get a white powder all over your hands impose on your lap believe me and it's a fearful tear filled event\nAnd this was a regular event that the left does to Republicans and the media doesn't cover it do they\nCover it and you can make rice and [noise] I don't care if they're being and and there's a real\nHot in the ... well can you imagine if a bunch of Republicans have done similar things to the Democrats when Obama was in the White House\n[noise] [laughter] [laughter] oh no you\nCouldn't even bring up\nYou're going to bring up anything you could say a word\nWell Time Warner did this to Trump well what if the parent company of Fox are sponsored a play in Central Park\nThat depicted the murder through repeated stabbing of Iraq Hussein Obama look alike saying twenty ten what would the me I'm number number one Fox's parent company never do it but Time Warner sponsored they play in Central Park Shakespeare is Julius Caesar\nWith a character looking like Trump being chopped the death toll on stage and the and the media loved it and the audience cheered every night now\nWhat did the same thing happened to Obama sponsored by Fox\nWhat it would add a comedian who pay rock Obama and held his head bloody head on stage\nBut Cathy Griffin now is touring the country to slow\nDown

that this afternoon on CNN is the best place for you to being anywhere in the world\nAnd so what happened to them yesterday morning cuts at the soul of every Jewish American my boss is a Jewish carpenter and no matter what happens in political discourse in America that brings violence\nAnd the American media depressed CNN and their allies always lecture Trump\nRepublicans and conservatives about our anger our rhetoric and our violence but one progressive explode which happens on a regular basis like stabbing Republicans setting Dutch trucks on fire that say I support Trump sending a fair is sending a\nRice and in the mail to numerous Republicans including Senator Susan Collins\nWhere the children to the president whenever that goes on\nAt no point or progressive ever lectured by the press somehow it's twisted in turned in the Trump Republicans conservatism\nEven when the president is the only one in American history to have Jewish grandchildren and even though the murder in Pittsburgh\nHad postings saying how much he hated Trump because Trump a Jewish grandchildren and Trump supported Israel somehow CNN still twisted this thing and the something's wrong with Trump never mentioning the hatred the radicalism of the left\nWhich exceeds what happens on the right the whole Ferguson and Baltimore all of the race riots\nThe shooting a cops in Dallas in Baton Rouge all came from black lives matter from the left never any connections river may\nBetween the cop killers in Dallas during a rally a black lives matter and then meeting in the White House with those same leadership of black lives matter saying what a great job they're doing and civil rights by the president Brock Hussein Obama\nAnd the media never said when the wait a minute Mr Mr President\nHow do you meet with the leaders of a group advocating the killing of cops\nWhat are we went dead cops when you want them now\nPegs in a blanket from like bacon there's never a connection made it doesn't exist but Republicans and Trump are lectured constantly whenever violence takes place it's always Trump's fault Trump's rhetoric Trump's tweets the Republican Party conservatism wonder where Republicans speak up\nHave you ever heard about the guy from Utah\nWho sent rice in to the president to kill him have you heard about the white powder the rice and attack on the home of Senator Susan Collins by a leftist after she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh nor all the attacks on Trump's children\nHow big of a story would it have been if Republicans had attacked the children up or rock

objective accomplishment abroad Hussein Obama give me one of them for a mate\nWhat is it Obamacare which has gone tacky it on Israel the fed up next door on the fact that they allowed ISIS to proliferate the fact that North Korea sent missile over Japan I mean give me something Obama did that has stuck anything\nAnd I'm not I'm not a fan of a Trump fan I've never liked it\nWell and and I got him running around but Louis Farrakhan who says her mind on that\nIf Trump the mother's\nHouse not possible health yeah I'm\nLooking at a tweeter sent out by Sarah Sanders ... this evening quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post will not exploit to attack President Trump the lack of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because\nPresident Trump is such an unapologetic defender\nOf the Jewish community and the state of Israel and so you're a Washington Post\n... there's a headline on Saturday that said bombs suspect found an inspiration and Trump so you get your Trump inspiring bombings and Trump indirectly involved in killing Jews and the ... and ... supposedly is object of\nAll it's unbelievable yeah\nAre we going to run things for

afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all\nAnd I hid menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor\nA woman said boy he was quiet kind of shy and he said oh goodbye no difficulties he had posted online for quite a while and I submitted ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president\nBecause he thought Trump was too uh too nice on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren are Jewish and he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless\nUh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's responsible the Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon\nAnd today did ugly reporting saying that uh that in fact a Sarah Sanders put out something a few hours to go to the set is there any tragedy of the Washington Post were not exploit do attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward\nWho hated President Trump because Trump is such a on a public defender of Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective some have said or the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying to Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should've known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is\nOn social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nI not as of yet I've seen\nIs you know there's always twenty twenty especially in the long course men or the investigative world when I Can't believe [laughter] no one else was honoring his tweets his social media is other things that he was posting couldn't have alerted only\nWent one way you know when you say is your mom thing say something\n[laughter] this case you know someone had this scene and could've alerted the police on the police we find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about Bowers\nAnd do something or look to see if this guy does have guns or potentially follow him\nWe can criticize the police but until that time\nPolice and law enforcement agencies intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the bandwidth\nTo be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting in Broward County there was a woman or call FBI numerous people had caught about an Eighteen year old a punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even though call in or an FBI people call it in that wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nNo production on horse you're only as good a shift today and was on course is very easy to do after the same law enforcement is tough on so I Know my experience with the NYPD\nWe always look back we oh we used to it at review of what had happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing with the case and the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back and figuring out what we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a Bowers said a posted it just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media somebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating\nAnd I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said because I'm sure there's several thousand individuals sadly in the country like ... hours\nWaiting for a trigger moment that social media exacerbates highlights these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate\nBefore social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people of like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against uh against Jews\nAnd against African Americans over several hundred who did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump he he he'd previously road I never voted for Trump nor have I ever owned Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\n... but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president\nIs one of many causing it so when you were in NYPD or you go back right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say what did he do when did he do it who didn't send these messages to and investigate them as to why something wasn't done\nI totally agree and take what you said even further this president has a son in law who is the orthodox and a very religious Jewish guy he has a daughter who converted to Judaism and as you said his grandchildren or Jewish\nSo you know I I don't think it's a matter of\nYou know what is said it's a matter of how we're saying and it's a matter of law enforcement standpoint of it has to be the outback because you're pressing police departments to there and the gray right they have to be ready\nTo respond to a ... guy goes into Times Square for no other reason that he wants to kill innocent people going to the theater in New York City on may fifth a bunch of years ago [noise] and thank God he had failed terrorism school\nAnd couldn't blow up his own car because he would have killed if not injured hundreds if not thousands of people but there are not like this around the country is what keeps law enforcement people up at night worrying about this lone wolf the guy who's not really talk to someone the guy who was sort of alone\nA guy who thought of in this neighborhood capable of having his gun and go into a place in killing innocent people for no other reason is ideal has probably been\nElements is out there all the way but Thomas Russian foreign pd NYPD officer thanks for coming on the bill gonna show

and David Wray will once again welcome to the bill cutting em show and David how you doing\nDoing great my friend that you\nLet me share with the American people something you of a put forth in one of your missteps\nAnd that is what's going on with all this stuff going on with the mailing bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and then the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is uh something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in his article the caravan of an estimated seven thousand some say it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point\nOf Central American migrants is now\nYeah well in New Mexico with the Claritin ten of reaching us border where the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not a humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately described by the wall Street Journal and organized stunt by political agitator is an activist\nWho are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add it to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of a sudden seven to ten thousand a Honduran just showed up together in one place\nAnd let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that so what happened with the political agitator isn't the activist who got this together explained that the mainstream media won't do it\nWell you know build a thanks for highlighting this and this is a is a nother example of a you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill ah Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population is a way to destabilize and disrupt a you know competing country and once again we have here\nWhere we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of their Congress\nA who's a according to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states who has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many as Thirteen thousand people\nSome of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a\nGang members deportees there's also\nA man of working age from Asia and from a a East Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming in this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they tried to say oh this is you know people are just are are coming along and doing it on their own\nMeals are suddenly appearing tents are suddenly appearing medical care suddenly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me why don't you take your wife and kids and try walk in Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the\nFree hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here\nIs that a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election and your in my lifetime you know I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo the guy who won it in the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone to the Democratic party explain why now here we are getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place in the same time with precision began marching together ... along with food and I'm an army marches on his belly along with water intends met her and care all these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will uncover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate\nUh caravans that are formed the largest one that we're talking about now and then to ... to smaller ones in El Salvador one that hasn't even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of up panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen\nPictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed obscene medical supplies and so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift\nAnd not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably two or Jimmy Carter's a election downfall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by leftist government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "29"}
