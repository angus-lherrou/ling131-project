R. E. E. free\nNow I only do this on the radio and I'll tell you why because I Can't send a minimum wage worker to your house for free and make any money at all frankly the U.S government the IRS says that it cost fifty three cents a mile last time I checked to send a vehicle to your home just in gas and wear and tear\nAfter that there's the technicians wages the chemicals and heck the ordinary cost of doing business so we're talking about a loss on this first appointment coming out and doing it for free okay\nWhy would we do that well here's what we get out of the deal ...\n... I Can't tell you how many times it's happened where customers have become huge cheerleaders even before we're done there running around telling their neighbors making calls to family members and say you've got to try these guys out\nThat enthusiasm is why the average radio customer provides us with three to seven referrals folks\nThat's the power of doing things right for people that's the power of doing a good job customers seeing appreciating it and then spreading the good worried about your business\nNow look I'm going to get this two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation

deal folks here's what you're going to experience when I send one of these guys out first off he's going to park his truck in the street\nWhen he comes up to your front door he's going to knock on the front door and when you invite him and he's going to reach down and put on floor savers or shoot covers over his shoes or boots\nHe's going to start his own voice and then he's going to ask you to see the thermostat he's going to ask if he can quickly click it on and when he does he's going to make sure that the system is actually working\nAfter he turns it on he'll then ask you to show him to the outdoor air conditioning unit and then the indoor heating unit and once he's seen those he'll go get to work\nNow his very first task is to remove the top\nOff of the outdoor air conditioning system after that he's going to get the leaves and sticks and mark\nAnd debris out of the bottom of the system because all of that stuff holds water when it rains it's going to rest the bottom of your system out prematurely okay so we're going to get all of that junk out of there that alone is going to extend the life of your outdoor unit\nThe next step in my opinion is the best okay we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your out door coils from the inside out\nNow that's going to force all the leaves and grass clippings and dust and whatnot that has been sucked into it over the last six months back out of the coils it's almost like lifting a sweater off of your air conditioning system\nYou're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so can you see now why I say that the other maintenance is our drive by maintenance as if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test all the electrical components in your system to make sure that you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nYou might have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad\nYou might have a pending motor failure because you've got to filter that's all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're gonna check all of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all so repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or your furnace we'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure that the exhaust is venting properly all of your hoses\nYour drains your flame censor most importantly we're going to check the heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and delete carbon monoxide do you see now\nWhat is that what is your son\nOr your daughter or your wife or your husband or your father or your mother when do we usually realize that we have a health problem after it's become strong enough in our bodies to become serious\nDance scene now why I say it's so important to keep up on your maintenance and keep Dirt's and molds and ... out of your air you probably didn't realize that your furnace or air conditioner getting dirty or getting mold and it could cost you your health\nThe good news is that if you have any of that stuff we can share some of the things that are other customers have done to completely get rid of it okay\nAt the end of the day it's about making you more comfortable in your home and saving you money okay so get it cleaned up it doesn't cost you anything I'll

one three\nNine nine nine zero seven zero six\n\nAll right let's talk about duct work OK duct work actually is kind of exciting when you get to learn about it he did you know that the department of energy they've done studies that have concluded that the average duck system in a U.S household\nLeaks twenty to twenty five percent of the ear that travels through it\nOkay so there's two different kinds of Doug leakage first there's supply leakage that's on the side of your furnace or air conditioner that bolo who's the cold or warm air out at ya\nSo eight twenty to twenty five percent loss means that twenty to twenty five percent of the air that has created at your machine that's blowing toward your bedroom or your kitchen or your family room is lost on the way\nThat's like fives intends and twenties just floating up out of your dog work flipping through the cracks\nThen there's the other kinds of leakage return leakage now this is a little more serious because our returns sometimes go unnoticed because we don't ever feel them doing anything that's because the returns don't blow air out they suck air in\nWell returns are the worst leakers instead of blowing cooled air out or she did air out into your attic or you crawl space like supplies do\nReturns suck addict or a basement or crawl space air in to your system and then blow it into your house\nWell what's the first thing wrong with that other than sucking Erin from those areas how about the fact that if you're a doctor works in the attic\nTemperatures can easily reach a hundred and thirty degrees sucking in a hundred and thirty degree air into your cooling system is like running your air conditioner your heat pump with all your doors and windows open\nYou want to know what else is bad about sucking an addict recall space there\nWell in the attic and sometimes in crawl spaces too how about the fact that it's got all of that fiberglass insulation and it just take yourself a bright flash light up there in the middle of the night sometime okay you'll see what I'm Talking about\nIt get sucked into your returns and circulates through your heating and air conditioning system some of it lands on your coil and it gets you coil all clogged up and then when you're laying there sleeping at night with your mouth open it's raining down on you it's going into your lungs\nYou breathe it all in a\nYou know that stuff's says that it causes cancer right on the role or the package that it comes and don't you\nAdd to that all the toxic rap poisons and bug poisons that the bug companies spray up there and then cross spaces that we find sucked into these duck systems and you've got yourself one heck of a case to seal your duct work up\nMaybe you're out there going I just had my furnace or heat bumper air conditioning system checked out and they didn't say anything about my duct work and they never have\nOr maybe I said something in the last five minutes that resonated with you and do you want to make sure that your ducts or not creating a financial or health\nLiability have must come out for the total system rejuvenation for you and we'll do it ducked pork inspection and pressure test
