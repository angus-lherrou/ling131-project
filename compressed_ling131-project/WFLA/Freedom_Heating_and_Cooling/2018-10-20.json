I have one thing in common and it's chronic information chronic cellular inflammation and\nMost individuals realize today the number one cause\nOf disease in death in North America is chronic

of the show but she talked about cellular health cellular\nRespiration but she talked about how how good she feels how clean she feels light on her feet and the way it's your rest and sleep in your level of energy but really tapping into that fountain of youth\nOne of the keys for me is the fact that you know this isn't a program that is based around something like pre packaged foods because if you're doing a program based around pre packaged foods you know the programs only as good as you consuming those pre packaged foods you know what this does\nThe fact that I was able to go to my regular everyday grocery store and it it gets me in a routine and it's something that I can take with me regard like maybe I'm move you know what I mean or maybe I have a different job where I can do pre packaged foods for whatever whatever the reason is\nThis is just changing the way you live your life and it's something that has a more long lasting impact you know in my opinion based on my

hurt anymore my sinus conditions that we get that almost every single week my sinus conditions have gone away but my hands my fingers my forearms\nBut it's so anti inflammatory but I Want health restoration I Want patients to feel good I Love the weight loss I think it's tremendous again you put into perspective forty short days these are patients once again losing\nTan in twenty and thirty and forty plus pounds during this forty day process\nAnd sometimes you know we've talked to a number of different patients we we have a couple on every single week or ... that are off their medication and that is so valuable from the side effects they don't have to deal with based on medication\nCosts ... the cost of the just the gas driving back and forth to the medical doctor I talked to a patient yesterday she goes doctor show when I go to play cards with my girlfriend is all they talk about as well\nNow at some point in every interview I Try to compare our moral compasses so sometimes I got to get a little sneaky okay so here's the seventh question I asked him\nI leaned in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nDid you hear that folks how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nNow brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all\nI don't have a problem with it at all and the reality is that he had been around and worked for enough other air conditioning companies in the area that operated that way that he thought that that's what I wanted to hear\nFrom the table I shook his hand and I said sir the interviews over we won't be offering you a job but I think you for coming in\nThen I interview another guy same questions he's doing a pretty good job and when I lean in and ask him my little trick question how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nThis guy did hesitate to kind of dropped his head and then he looked back up and then he looked back down and then he said I can do it and if I'm being honest I have done it\nThe company that I worked for required that I'd bring back a certain dollar amount on every single call that I went on sometimes they didn't need anything but if I didn't sell them anything\nI was going to lose my job and man I got kids defeat but then I got to thinking am I setting the right kind of example for my kids so I had to quit\nNow I'm unemployed and the market is flooded with heating and air conditioning technicians and it's been hard to get a job\nThat's an example of the type of competitors we have out there guys\nI told stories in interviews about heating and air conditioning companies training there technicians to jump wires on two thousand dollar compressors to sell new systems and there are hundreds of heating and air conditioning contractors in this area last time I checked\nAnd chances are pretty good that a technician like the one in the story\nIs going to be coming to your home\nOr your neighbor's home\nYou know you might look down the street today and see an air conditioning technician heating technician and it might be that guy I'm certain that he didn't decide to quit the
