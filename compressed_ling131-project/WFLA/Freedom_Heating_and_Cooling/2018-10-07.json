it cost fifty three cents a mile last time I checked to send a vehicle to your home just in gas and wear and tear\nAfter that there's the technicians wages the chemicals and pack the ordinary cost of doing business so we're talking about a loss on this first appointment coming out and doing it for free okay\nWhy would we do that well here's what we get out of the\nDeal\nFederals I Can't tell you how many times it's happened where customers have become huge cheerleaders even before we're done there running around telling their neighbors making calls to family members and say you gotta try these guys out\nThat enthusiasm is why the average radio customer provides us with three to seven referrals folks\nThat's the power of doing things right for people that's the power of doing a good job customers seeing it appreciating it and then spreading the good worried about your\nNo look I'm going to give this two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation away for free right

here's what you're going to experience when I send one of these guys out first off he's going to park his truck in the street\nWhen he comes up to your front door he's going to knock on the front door and when you invite him and he's going to reach down and put on floor savers or shoot covers over his shoes or boots\nHe's going to start his own voice and then he's going to ask you to see the thermostat he's going to ask if he can quickly click it on and when he does he's going to make sure that the system is actually working\nAfter returns it on he'll then ask you to show him to the outdoor air conditioning unit and then the indoor heating unit and once he's seen those he'll go get to work\nNow his very first task is to remove the top off of the outdoor air conditioning system after that he's going to get the leaves and sticks and mark and debris out of the bottom of the system because all of that stuff holds water when it rains\nIt's going to rush the bottom of your system out prematurely okay so we're going to get all of that junk out of there\nThat alone is going to extend the life of your outdoor unit\nThe next step in my opinion is the best okay we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your out door coils from the inside out\nNow that's going to force all the leaves and grass clippings and dust and whatnot that has been sucked into it over the last six months back out of the coils it's almost like lifting a sweater off of your air conditioning system\nYou're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so can you see now why I say that the other maintenance is our drive by maintenance as if they're there and gone in forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test all the electrical components in your system to make sure that you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nYou might have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad\nYou might have a pending motor failure because you've got to filter that's all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're gonna check all of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace next\nWe're going to check your indoor heating system or your furnace we'll check the burners your pressures which is make sure that the exhaust is venting properly all of your hoses your drains your flame censor most importantly\nWe're going to check the heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and the leak carbon monoxide\nDo you see now why I say that you have to do these two naps and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWill go to your indoor air conditioning coil after that and inspected for any sort of biological growth that might be growing on any dirt and the mole mildew bacteria viruses things like that I mean you've heard that mold grows and heating and air conditioning systems haven't you\nThe

concluded that the average duck system in a U.S household\nLeaks twenty to twenty five percent of the air that travels through it\nOkay so there's two different kinds of duck luggage first\nThere's
