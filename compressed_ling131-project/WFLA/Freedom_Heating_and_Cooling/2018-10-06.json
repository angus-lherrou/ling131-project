I mean on\nMr rash\nVote tally now stands at third round the thirty five it will take a simple majority for confirmation of bread around\n[noise] which are Rubio [noise]\nI'm not sure John decker if you heard the interview with Mitch McConnell on a Fox News channel a little bit before the Senate but he suggested that he and the president had talked an awful lot after that second hearing and never wavered\nOn on their ... um supportive of Brett Kavanaugh um it was no talk between him and the president he set of of pulling the nomination I assume that's pretty consistent with what you're reporting without the White House has handled this show very unique nomination a nominee\nWell that's right the White House digging in its heals over Brett Kavanaugh all over the course of the past few ... even a one at times over the course of the past few will his nomination was in doubt I was outside during a for the president's departure when that interview was played on Fox News channel but you may know\nThat Senator McConnell gave an interview as well to the Washington Post I read that interview and in that interview he again reiterated that at no time were you any doubt that they would stick with Brett Kavanaugh as their nominee Van Hollen [noise]\nAh Chris Van Hollen of Maryland a casting his votes is Warren [noise]\nWhat's up as Warren of Massachusetts the White House prices are no votes um we're waiting for for the sister wicker\nNumber here to to reach majority simple ... with Ninety nine senators voting as we expected to be honest the Kavanaugh sitting at forty nine right now [noise]\nThe vice president presiding over the United States Senate\n[noise]\nAnd that should be my vote senator from Montana\nAgain in ... we got her a gambling island ...

Tuesday when he's sworn in\nAnd of course you know this already chaired the Supreme Court a session this term the Supreme Court has already gone began the first Monday in October this past Monday so a judge soon to be called justice Kevin all will have missed much when he finally takes us places the ninth justice on the U.S Supreme\nCourt probably will be able to catch up and it's too old but I think that Supreme Court justices have to take not just the one that you are\nCorrect that's correct and so uh we'll see a public oath that the uh\nBrett Kavanaugh will take that will likely be here at the White House if they follow the same form and function that we saw with Neil Gorsuch last year when he took his place and of course there was a big ceremony and the rose garden here at the White House when that took place I Would imagine we'll see the same thing take place for Brett Kavanaugh\nIt looks like many of the Republican senators have started to walk around shaking hands I see Bob Corker the retiring senator from Tennessee shaking hands with majority leader you\nAn indication John that ah they believe their their work here is finished\nUm regardless of of the outcome that they favor or oppose\nUm it has been interesting to watch Lisa Murkowski the Alaska Senator or the one Republican opposed the Kavanaugh are sitting at her desk watching all of this continuing to speak with colleagues are shaking hands with it looks like a West Virginia a Republican Shelley Moore capital or\nThat vote was considered key to his ultimate confirmation here's a little bit of how Susan Collins explained how she got to her position of yes uh yesterday on the Senate floor\nThey said it's complicated further by the fact that the Senate confirmation process it's not a try\nBut if I'm getting nano legal print a bad deal threat\nThe current stance and in and and there and do their on my thinking and I cannot stand in that [noise]\n\nThat was Maine Republican Susan Collins talking about the sexual misconduct allegations that have\nBeen leveled against Brett Kavanaugh he has a very defiantly a defended his name and said that those are unequivocally not true uh brought out a second hearing\nA in front of the Judiciary Committee with him and uh a woman who made that accusation Christine Blasey Ford 'em and ultimately you heard that they're having a big impact on on the ultimate decision of of\nOf ah the Susan Collins the a Republican from Maine now one of the other undecided up until yesterday was another a moderate Republican Alaska's Lisa Murkowski or the one Republican who ended up uh stating a negative position on confirmation and here's her explanation\nI Believe ... man [noise]\nClearly a learning channel [noise] my [noise] my country [noise]\n[laughter] well I have kids into the gate with my country [noise]\nI did not include that he is the right person for the course of time\n[noise]\nThat was the nation of Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and again the one Republican who would have voted no she ended up changing that both the president to a pair it with Steve ... Montana Republican who wasn't here but the outcome remains the same Brett Kavanaugh confirmed to the United States Supreme court by a vote of fifty\nTo forty eight is one of the narrowest boats ever for a Supreme Court nominee though we expected that to be the case that vote interrupted at times from\nProtest a shouting from the gallery but uh at the end of the day that Brett Kavanaugh will join this United States Supreme Court or you want to talk about close divisions in the United States Senate we've seen in recent opinions John ... a pretty closely divided Supreme Court as well but\nA dead or soon to be justice Kevin ... will become a member of\nWell that's right over the course of the past few years we've seen quite a few five to four decisions by the U.S Supreme Court a largely breaking down along ideological lines of the swing vote over the course of the past I Would say\nAlmost two decades has been Justice Kennedy who's a place on the court of justice soon to be justice capital of will take the place of and uh it's bought that cabin all will be a more solid conservative vote and so perhaps we will see that swing vote emerge\nA during his tenure on the Supreme Court which could be for the next few decades given how young he is\nAnd we talked about this during the confirmation process uh justices are difficult to predict sometimes you don't always know exactly how they will rule on on issues that we may not even be able to imagine a a pure before them\nWell that's right now just just a soon to be justice a cabin on now judge Kavanaugh he sits on the U.S circuit court of appeals for the DC circuit or he was asked quite a bit during his confirmation\nProcess how he would vote on numerous controversial items that may come up before the Supreme Court he refrain from answering those questions but he'll certainly be tested a and it will be interesting to watch his first year on the Supreme Court he will be cut", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Freedom Heating and Cooling", "city": "Tampa", "day": "06"}
