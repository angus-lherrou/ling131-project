Guantanamo people would break immediately this is like a a rare bald ... however you say a frog and a dog with a log a yeah like when you you the song just builds over time uh leave a there are there was a tick\nThat are going to leave leave for the brain to the rest of the tree to tree to hold on hold with about about down in the valley I don't remember how it goes but it's close to that\nAnd uh what was the one where the fat lady I'm with ... mile minds you slow to fly all going to die and then I read that whole thing for the first time since I was a child morbid\nMore me a lot of that stuff is just like you're going to die I keep reading that line over and over again\nBasically this was about a disabled donkey but ah the walk your dog you song it'll stick with you a little bit let's go to some dispatches to see what's happening where you are very first ... days for 'em robots robot so there was a news junkie a\n... first time this badge comeback Sean hey ah glad to have the team back together and say Sabrina wife and I\nWent to your short slam on Sunday yeah awesome awesome however I Am slightly disappointed you must have taken a limo to them premier\nI walked up and down that parking lot looking for a news junkie magnet had no luck\nGetting wasted in violin military movie Vermeer I did\nNot I uh I took myself to the movie premier but it is worth noting that magnet do not last my car ... ever was there a red carpet at the movie ... um I I don't know because I got there shortly after the festival had started out as an inch black but I Will say that you weren't here for it\nNow at some point in every interview I Try to compare our moral compasses so sometimes I gotta get a little sneaky okay so here's the seventh question\nI asked him I leaned in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nDid you hear that folks how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need now brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all\nI don't have a problem with it at all and the reality is that he had been around and worked for enough other air conditioning companies in the area that operated that way that he thought that that's what I wanted to hear\nAbout from the table I shook his hand unless it's sort of the interviews over we won't be offering you a job but I think you for coming in\nThen I interview another guy same questions he's doing a pretty good job and when I lean in and ask him my little trick question how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need this guy did hesitate\nTo kind of dropped his head and then he looked back up and then he looked back down and then he said\nI can do it and if I'm being honest I have done it\nThe company that I worked for required that I bring back a certain dollar amount on every single call that I went on sometimes they didn't need anything but if I didn't sell them anything I was going to lose my job\nAnd man I got kids to feed but then I got to thinking am I setting the right kind of example for my kids\nSo I had to quit and now I'm unemployed and the market is flooded with heating and air conditioning technicians and it's been hard to get a job\nThat's an example of the type of competitors we have out there guys\nI told stories in interviews about heating and air conditioning companies training there technicians to jump wires on two thousand dollar compressors to sell new systems and there are hundreds of heating and air conditioning contractors in this area last time I checked\nAnd chances are pretty good that a technician like the one in the story it's going to be coming to your home or your neighbor's home\nYou know you might look down the street today and see an air conditioning technician heating technician and it might be that guy\nI'm certain that he didn't decide to quit the heating and air conditioning is this just because I Would hire him and remember there's more guys were that guy came from he got his training at one of those unprofessional heating and air conditioning companies\nThat listen we'd go out to customers houses all the time that have air conditioners with corroded coils or blowers that are all credit up and we have to help them out in that predicament I mean for crying out loud that's what we do\nWe make furnaces heat pumps and air conditioners last longer we lower energy bills we give you cleaner fresher error we increase Airflow we make systems run quieter and cost you less money to own about we're not\nGoing to try to sell you something you don't need okay\nNow look in about two to three minutes I'm going to open up these phone lines and if you can get through when I give you the telephone number I'm going to do your entire system both heating and cooling not for the two hundred and fifty two dollars we normally charge\nBut for free that's right F. R. E. E. free\nNow I only do this on the radio and I'll tell you why because I Can't send a minimum wage worker to your house for free and make any money at all\nFrankly the U.S government the IRS says that it cost fifty three cents a mile last time I checked to send a vehicle to your home just in gas and wear and tear\nAfter that there is the technicians wages the chemicals and pack the ordinary cost of doing business so we're talking about a loss on this first appointment coming out and doing it for free okay\nWhy would we do that well here's what we get out of the deal\nFederals I Can't tell you how many times it's happened where customers have become huge cheerleaders even before we're done the running around telling their neighbors making calls to family members and saying you've got to try these guys out\nThat enthusiasm is why the average radio customer provides us with three to seven referrals folks\nThat's the power of doing things right for people that's the power of doing a good job customers seeing appreciating it\nAnd then spreading the good worried about your business\nNo look I'm going to give this two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation away for free right now to the first five callers freedom heating and cooling is going to pay for it all we ask is that if we do a good job for you\nThat you consider becoming a regular client and you tell other people about us that's fair right\nOkay you have to be one of the first five dollars so grab your telephone so that you can get the number and I'm going to give the first five away right now the next five callers are going to get this to not for free\nHere's the number get your fingers dialing be quick because they go fast eight one three\nNine nine nine zero seven zero six that's nine nine nine zero seven zero six nine nine nine zero seven zero six that's eight one three\nNine nine nine zero seven zero six remember there are only five of these available right now so call right now eight one three\nNine nine nine zero seven zero six beat your neighbor to the punch okay eight one three nine nine nine zero seven zero six that's nine nine nine zero seven zero six nine nine nine zero seven zero six last chance eight one three nine nine nine\nZero seven zero six\nNo look if you can't get to a phone right now but you can get on the line be the very first person to go to clean my AC dot com\nFill out the radio discount requests form click submit and will reserve one of these just for you but you got to be the first person okay that's clean my AC dot com\nNow here's the deal folks here's what you're going to experience when I send one of these guys out first off he's going to park his truck in the street\nWhen he comes up to your front door he's going to knock on the front door and when you invite him and he's going to reach down and put on floor savers or shoot covers over his shoes or boots\nHe's going to start his own voice and then he's going to ask you to see the thermostat he's going to ask if he can quickly click it on and when he does he's going to make sure that the system is actually working\nAfter returns it on he'll then ask you to show him to the outdoor air conditioning unit and then the indoor heating unit and once he seemed those he'll go get to work\nNow his very first task is to remove the top off of the outdoor air conditioning system after that he's going to get the leaves and sticks and mark and debris out of the bottom of the system because all of that stuff holds water when it rains\nIt's going to rush the bottom of your system out prematurely okay so we're going to get all of that junk out of there\nThat alone is going to extend the life of your outdoor unit\nThe next step in my opinion is the best okay we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your out door coils from the inside out\nNow that's going to force all the leaves and grass clippings and dust and whatnot that has been sucked into it over the last six months back out of the coils it's almost like lifting a sweater off of your air conditioning system\nYou're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so can you see now why I say that the other maintenance is our drive by maintenance as if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test all the electrical components in your system to make sure that you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires you might have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad\nYou might have a pending motor failure because you've got to filter that's all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're gonna check all of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or your furnace we'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure that the exhaust is venting properly all of your hoses your drains your flame censor most importantly\nTotal system rejuvenation appointment managers who's going to get your name your telephone number and your service address and help you schedule your appointment\nHere's the number gets your fingers dialing be quick because they'd go quick ready eight one three\nNine nine nine zero seven zero six nine nine nine zero seven
