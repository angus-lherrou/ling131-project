weight loss our I'm you're flying warming with me in Studio is Dr Sean and you know we've heard the story today we started off this hour with Lara she lost thirty pounds\nIn just forty days and what I thought and I'm curious to get your thoughts on this doctor or something because I bet you hear this a lot when I thought was interesting about her story was how the habits that she learned during the course of her forty days on your program\nTrickled down to the rest of her family you know they didn't go through the program but they picked up healthier habits because of it\nYeah it's a big part of what we do obviously a large concern of mine is what's happening to the the American family the breakdown of the American family and most importantly or specifically is our level of health chronic inflammation but the food consumption\nIs off the charts individuals do not know how to make the proper choices in life it's a big part of our program run you know this it's not a weight loss program it's a beautiful tremendous educational experience but as we take you through this process I Want to show you how to reintroduce\nThe proper beautiful nurturing nutritious foods for a lifetime I don't want to share to lose weight for forty days but I Want to she had to do this thing for the next\nForty years and when you think about it regardless of your level of health your age group you're demographic you and I were making choices today\nIn either we're building health for the next ten twenty thirty or forty years were guess what we're aggressively going in the wrong direction our body is breaking down it's the premature aging process but we're slowly building disease and\nThink about it this way that's house around the waist line that toxic dangerous\nBelly fat Lara made mention of that but she talked about the visceral fat right this is the dangerous the hidden fat that surrounds the heart the lungs deliver\nThe kidney the pancreas this is the dangerous aggressive fat that surrounds the waistline but in essence it it compromises those vital organs of the body but it creates high levels of toxicity a crate higher levels of chronic information and you know this chronic information\nIt's the number one cause of chronic degenerative disease and I'm Talking about heart disease and cancer and diabetes and stroke and all the time or Z and dementia bin ... but in essence it's the premature aging process and so as\nWe take a patient to the program I Love the weight loss you have to understand and you've been through the program\nThe weight loss is awesome it's tremendous\nBut the weight loss it's just a byproduct of the program I Want these individuals' reaching their God given health potential I Want energy homeostasis which is the highest level of health but it's the way you\nRest it's the way you sleep is the way you breathe that's the way you move but it's your level of energy but it's getting your system your body\nInto the optimal state of healing again not so much a weight loss program\nBut this is a gets you healthy program and that's what I Want our our our participants to understand that's the experience that I Want them to go through and it's so unique and\nI Love the feedback and responses from patients it's so much fun working with him and I do I love my team my staff you know each and every one of them but not so much my employees but they're truly my my family members and it's a unique opportunity for us taking these individuals to the program being a part of the Tampa Bay\nCommunity and watching these individuals get tremendously healthy and I do I want you to feel good I Want health restoration and so if you're listening to us today I Want to reach out to you I'd love to meet with you I Want to work with you\nAnd I know everybody says some day we'll make that some day day one and get into our office you'll experience a tremendous\nForty day life transforming process and I do I want you to feel the weight loss is great but it's a package deal it's kind of a side effect of the program\nAnd you know going back to the visceral fat that you you talked about something that you know it's just it's a really bad thing to have in your body or you don't have to be massively overweight to have too much visceral fat correct because you know when I went into your office and started the program I wasn't massively\nOverweight but my visceral fat levels were in the red I mean there are no more good yeah everybody\nWants to understand how that works and there's a term that's\nI guess quite popular today but it's called skinny fat\nAnd you have to understand visceral fat if you're tuning in right now I Want you to Google visceral fat look it up but when you come into our facility was beautiful about it we're going to take all of those measurements it's a computer generated body composition analysis\nBut my goodness on a hard copy on the computer screen in essence run you know this you're looking at a blueprint of your health but your body mass\nIndex your specific body fat percentage this is your body's percentile of fat storage I Want your body out of fat storage I wanted in a healing state of fat metabolism and Laura said gosh Dr ...
