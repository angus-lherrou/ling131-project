preparation for your health for the next five ten Fifteen Twenty years and I do along with everyone else I Want permanent see but quickly let me\nKatie any words of encouragement or inspiration for some of the young ladies that are listening to our program\n[noise] you know I live in\nThe beginning really scare tend to die then and and get to the program I wasn't really sure electric back and I like nervous that might you know I'm not going to be allowed to eat that and I can't do that and it was so much easier than I thought and every day when I stepped on the scale that motivated me to\nKeep going and my focus changed to get\nIt right plan my mail the what I mean it took ... and it was so easy and Ayelet ... encourage\nI leaned in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nDid you hear that folks how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nNow brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all\nI don't have a problem with it at all\nAnd the reality is that he had been around and worked for enough other air conditioning companies in the area that operated that way that he thought that that's what I wanted to hear\nAbout from the table I shook his hand and I said sort of the interviews over we won't be offering you a job but I think you for coming in then I interview another guy same questions he's doing a pretty good job and when I lean in and ask him my little trick question how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nThis guy did hesitate\nTo kind of dropped his head and then he looked back up and then he looked back down and then he said\nI can do it and if I'm being honest I have done it the company that I worked for required that I bring back a certain dollar amount on every single call that I went on\nSometimes they didn't need anything but if I didn't sell them anything I was going to lose my job\nAnd man I got kids to feed\nBut then I got to thinking am I setting the right kind of example for my kids so I had to quit and now I'm unemployed and the market is flooded with heating and air conditioning technicians and it's been hard to get a job\nThat's an example of the type of competitors we have out there guys\nI told stories in interviews about heating and air conditioning companies training there technicians to jump wires on two thousand dollar compressors to sell new systems and there are hundreds of heating and air conditioning contractors in this area last time I checked\nAnd chances are pretty good that a technician like the one of the story\nIs going to be coming to your home\nOr your neighbor so\nYou know you might look down the street today and see an air conditioning technician a heating technician and it might be that guy\nI'm certain that he didn't decide to quit the heating and air conditioning is this just because I wouldn't hire him and remember there's more guys were that guy came from he got his training at one of those unprofessional heating and air conditioning companies\nThat listen we go out to customers houses all the time they have air conditioners with corroded coils or blowers that are all credit up and we have to help them out of bad predicament I mean for crying out loud [laughter] that's what we do\nWe make furnaces heat pumps an air conditioners last longer we lower energy bills we give you cleaner fresher error we increase Airflow we make systems run quieter end cost you less money to own about we're\nNot going to try to sell you something you don't need okay\nThey'll look in about two to three minutes I'm going to open up these phone lines and if you can get through when I give you the telephone number I'm going to do your entire system both heating and cooling not for the two hundred and fifty two dollars we normally charge\nBut for free that's right F. R. E. E. free\nNow I only do this on the radio and I'll tell you why because I Can't send a minimum wage worker to your house for free and make any money at all\nFrankly the U.S government the IRS says that it cost fifty three cents a mile last time I checked to send a vehicle to your home just in gas and wear and tear\nAfter that there's the technicians wages the chemicals and pack the ordinary cost of doing business so we're talking about a loss on this first appointment coming out and doing it for free okay\nWhy would we do that well here's what we get out of the\nDeal ... federals\nI Can't tell you how many times it's happened where customers have become huge cheerleaders even before we're done there running around telling their fevers making calls to family members and say you've got to try these guys out\nThat enthusiasm is why the average radio customer provides us with three to seven referrals folks\nThat's the power of doing things right for people that's the power of doing a good job customers seeing it appreciating it and then spreading the good worried about your business now look I'm going to give this two hundred\nAnd fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation away for free right now to the first five callers freedom heating and cooling is going to pay for it all we ask is that if we do a good job for you that you consider becoming a regular client and you tell other people\nAbout us that's fair right okay\nYou have to be one of the first five dollars so grab your telephone so that you can get the number and I'm going to give the first five away right now the next five callers are going to get this do not for free here's the number get your fingers dialing be quick because they go fast eight one three\nNine nine nine zero seven zero six that's nine nine nine zero seven zero six nine nine nine zero seven zero six that's eight one three\nNine nine nine zero seven zero six remember there are only five of these available right now so call right now eight one three\nNine nine nine zero seven zero six beat your neighbor to the punch okay eight one three nine nine nine zero seven zero six that's nine nine nine zero seven zero", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Freedom Heating and Cooling", "city": "Tampa", "day": "27"}
