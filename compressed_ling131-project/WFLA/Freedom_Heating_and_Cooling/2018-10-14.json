{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "Through the panhandle as the day rolls on here\nTalk about this a while ago I could not working but I'm Glad to have it now\nIt made me think back to a lot of things and it made me think back to my first ever drink\nWhich was I think what I was Thirteen or twelve or Thirteen probably twelve\nAnd it's the same story that everybody has where you go up to your dad and your dad drinking a beer it was my dad drinking a beer with uh my uncle\nAnd oh God like an old Miller light or something and then I go up and I go way why couldn't you drink that I Can't drink it he goes you want some of those that go yeah took his if I got a grown man I'm never drink that I don't care how old I get\nAnd that turned out not to be true but ah I remember that first time I think I was I think it was Thirteen but I didn't my parents didn't go hey if you want to go grab one from\nOr the refrigerator I never had that moment\nNow I Can't say uh we did maybe when I was a little bit older I'd be able to get a glass of wine but just like the bottom of that like with dinner you could drink a glass of wine yeah or like it was a special occasion the family lives in town or his New Years I can have one glass of champagne that's half filled and we're going to take out a little\nBit more at what age would you be out when that was allowed\n... for ...\nFor ... what about you the first time and and what did you ever have the opportunity like she said that actually sit down at dinner and have a drink\nUm it was like her like glass of wine every once in a while and a special occasion or something there was a a wedding reception like my mom was a little more lenient than my dad about that which is ironic because my dad's on ... and a bunch\nOf but uh there was one wedding rehearsal dinner where they had just had the wine in ... in my private room at the restaurant and my dad didn't realize how much why not to drink and they should have to go to the\nBathroom when I had a few\nWind today you are just getting bounded hammered but but how was that this was I was in\nLike high school I don't I I might have already started drinking with friends at the time because a lot of people are listening to this and gone that that seems way too young but LeBron James was during a press conference in of all the things that they could have talked to about Los Angeles\nBasketball cetera and they asked him about you know what do you pick up from your teammates as far as pop culture goes\nAnd he mentioned do is image look I pick up a lot of things from my kids is like what my kids are mature they even drink like my kids drink\nWine okay and they're all Lebanon fourteen eleven [laughter] and he's\nNow he's obviously joking 'cause there'll be driving next week too but this made headlines all over the place Syria's [noise]\nOr she really\nOf your driving is where\nIs obviously a job at a number on my\nMom's a\nGod so you could barely hear behind all the dribbling there but\nHe said everything they listen to this day\nBy for Daraa these days my fourteen and my eleven year old they watch to I got very mature fourteen eleven year old Dwight fourteen eleven year old drink wine\nThat's not mature they are there'll be driving next week to is that whatever dads and moms having put it on me though don't put it on mom put it on dad put it on to those that law yeah we have a drink at the table\nI'm sure this doesn't mean that eased allowing who's eleven year old to do keg stands a he's probably just having a sensible glass of wine\nIn the hour and the debt goes till a legal it is it a legal can they get arrested parents can get arrested for one of the charge or providing alcohol to minor is a contributing to the delinquency every miner or the other civic charged for the uh ... can be both\nBut yeah there's a there's plenty of like pie essays and billboards everywhere you know every once in a while they ah remember parents it's illegal to give your your kids alcohol and and we've had stories where I'm\nA a like a party has been busted or one of the neighbors or got upset with one of the\nThe the parents in the neighborhood that had allowed an ... person under Twenty one to have a drink and they called the cops and the cops had become arrest them I think are there in California so let's see what is over there it's illegal in California for a minor to be in possession of outgoing any public place\nOf liquor is not the case in the bronze\nMansions of their okay now in order to prove the elements of this offense they must just average the defendant was under the age of Twenty one of the time of the fence blah blah blah blah blah let's see\nUnderage consumption well drinking out of that matters here here to his parents are prohibited from permitting their child or anyone else under Eighteen years of age from consuming alcohol or drugs in their home\nAnd the child is under the influence of drugs or has a blood alcohol content a point zero five\nAnd the parents knowingly allowed the child the drive a car the Charles cause an accident the parents are responsible a conviction for this offense can result in a fined up to a thousand dollars in jail time ... here\nBut it's very confusing whether it's worded because it was just a giant like kind of run on sentences or it went from like allowing them to drink alcohol under Eighteen to being drunken driving\nYeah I mean I I think that that's probably when it comes to\nKids drink and their parents house it's not necessarily a rule that they all die by knock on doors make sure no one under Eighteen is is drinking or that they're not going to be\nGetting outside of the house anywhere on top of that if they really wanted to investigate this claimed by liberal and yeah it easily say that he was joking around yeah and that's it up on and on the on the security as that is\nThey're not going to go knocking on his door I Would I mean they got a I Would hope they had more important things to do I guess you could also bring it to the delinquency of a minor charge California prohibit the actions that causes a monitor behaving in ... in a legal matter\nThis offense maybe charge wanted adult furniture's alcohol to a minor a discharge can also be made against miners who furnish I'll go the other miners\nThis offense is punishable by up to a year in jail in the final two thousand five hundred dollars so he says that then people just take a look oh my God look he's drinking these kids are drinking I think a lot of people do that and I think different backgrounds depends on where you're from if your parents or Italian\nOr if you are from Spain like there's a lot more cultural drinking at a younger age with those people and it's not seen as\nUm thing nearly as bad or nefarious or so he mentioned that at a press coverage getting a bunch of attention today another thing that is getting attention today is an upcoming interview it's air this Friday at ten pm on ABC I think that's in the Nightline slot\nAnd it's going to be called being ... the first lady an interview with first lady Melania Trump\nAnd they're they're airing this and and teasing it as no holds barred but you can go in there they can ask any questions no questions off limits the trailer alone is getting a bunch of attention and they allegedly asked ... about the state of her marriage\nDonald Trump's infidelity\nHer views on me to\nUm different things like the the the jacket or the the shirt that she was wearing when the uh children migrant thing was going on with the kids were in cages and it said I don't care to you all these everything we haven't heard a lot from ... on this front\nThat you're not see the what happened sixteen I wasn't sixteen months ago way longer ago daily mail came out with that breaking news or it must be from that interview that she says the meat you victims need to have are you getting ...\nAnd I I ... that was I saw this morning where she said they need to have evidence the back of their claims from the interview that I think all of this is from the interview\nI think every thing that's coming out about this because a lot of the Trump is not done a lot of interviews she I think the one with President Trump\nOr she's done just really minimal interactions and then she does like little events but nope the press they'll have like a White House cookout no picnic tables and like cook outs of going on and the press is not going to hard ball\nThe first lady and the vet like that so this is a pretty big get for ABC let's see what they hit on and the trailer here because this is what's making\nThe rounds friday night on ABC finish the sentence for millennia Trump is first ... Toronto you did agree to the center of your credit with no preconditions going that there could be some some tough questions asked the exclusive\nCan win in the me too movement call us for this Friday night no student is awesome and you're not the first first lady to have to deal with her husband's alleged infidelity is has put a strain on your marriage the exclusive deal is talking about the jacket [noise] they said [noise]\nWhy did you wear with the first known gay because of its conception of Russia\nBeing alone yeah the first lady the NBC event special friday night at ten nine central on NBC voiceover\nGuy Rubio man ain't the scene so we'll see what happens I'm sure they'll they got a whole lot more\nUh ... some interesting back and forth I'm sure to be had between ... Trump and the ACC reporters covering things up but that brings in big numbers I Know people are interested and or if they ask the right questions that might be onto something there\nYou're listening

submit and will reserve one of these just for you but you got to be the first person okay that's clean my AC dot com\nNow here's the deal folks here's what you're going to experience when I send one of these guys out\nFirst off he's going to park his truck in the street\nWhen it comes up to your front door he's going to knock on the front door and when you invite him and he's going to reach down and put on floor savers or shoot covers over his shoes or boots\nHe's going to start his own voice and then he's going to ask you to see the thermostat he's going to ask if he can quickly click it on and when he does he's going to make sure that the system is actually working\nAfter returns it on he'll then ask you to show him to the outdoor air conditioning unit and then the indoor heating unit and once he's seen those he'll go get to work\nNow his very first task is to remove the top off of the outdoor air conditioning system after that he's going to get the leaves and sticks and mark and debris out of the bottom of the system because all of that stuff holds water when it rains\nIt's going to rush the bottom of your system out prematurely okay so we're going to get all of that junk out of there\nThat alone is going to extend the life of your outdoor unit\nThe next step in my opinion is the best okay we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your out door coils from the inside out\nNow that's going to force all the leaves and grass clippings and dust and whatnot that has been sucked into it over the last six months back out of the coils it's almost like lifting a sweater off of your air conditioning system\nYou're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so can you see now why I say that the other maintenance is our drive by maintenance as if they're there and gone in forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test all the electrical components in your system to make sure that you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nYou might have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad\nYou might have a pending motor failure because you've got to filter that's all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're gonna check all of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace next\nI'm going to check your indoor heating system or your furnace we'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure that the exhaust is venting properly all of your hoses your drains your
