Tuesday the country will head to the polls for the mid term elections and offer us\nJust first nationwide report card at how both parties and the Trump Administration have been doing and joining us to discuss is the protest Fox News contributor and former head of President Trump's Hispanic advisory council thank you for being here Steve\nHey You're welcome thank you so much for having me I appreciate it\nSo Steve tell us right off the bat how important are these midterms and victories for the Republican Party to read to retain control\nRight listen I I think it's crucial for those of us who supported President Trump in twenty sixteen I really think even though he's not explicitly on the ballot or he is de facto implicitly on about this time I think it's his first real lack the main reason I say that\nIs if we get control of the house to the Democrats and if they have Speaker Pelosi or someone like her we give them the keys to the car I have no doubt that they are going to drive that car\nOff the cliff each been\nI really I mean I guess I think that the\nCabin on hearing where the dress rehearsal for impeachment or not that there's any ground not that there's any legal or political or watch for that but that's that's where they're headed\nMost of them are to fly into court actually tell us that some well like Maxine Waters rats in Nazi aided um so to me it's just you know it really couldn't be more crucial\nSyrian you can impeach due to just having a temper tantrum\nHearing well unfortunately I find fathers didn't make many mistakes but I Would argue they might have made a mistake\nIt's a simple majority in the house there's no review your whether or not the teacher was valid so if if they impeached for whatever reason high crimes and misdemeanors in the constitution are not are not define a so they can impeach really unfortunately for almost any read and I look I don't know\nAny stretch by the Senate than a much like Clinton if we did go down this road would actually make ... stronger as president but let's not go down this road is much more important message you know we've already made enormous\nProgress over the last couple of years we have a lot more to do particularly building the wall in twenty Nineteen so let's keep the house Republican let's make the Senate more Republican and more conservative and ah there's no telling what we can do with Trump's leadership if we give him um that kind of cooperation from Capitol Hill\nAnd give us some of like sort of the key battleground areas that are the most important to the mid term she sure\nWhat was it I think the Senate even the most optimistic Democrats I think conceived at the site is not going to go their way so um it as a matter of fact some seats in the Senate sided they thought were say for instance some of them and then does up in\nAh in New Jersey is no longer considered safe route so I think the damsel even admit that they are probably on the defensive in a sense of the house I think is much more where a it's a coin flip probably two Republicans perhaps being slight underdog my honest view\nTo maintaining control national polls aren't that relevant here you've got to look at the battleground polls in districts that are really competitive and in those districts Republicans are well within striking distance mostly down a couple of points I'm so we've got to work really hard he's closing days potential questions geographically\nIt's mostly Republican congressmen who are in blue states so it's districts that lean a little bit Republican or you're just basically moderate districts but within heavily blue states\nI'm So Peter Roskam in Illinois for news which is where I live in Chicago is an example of that there are several\nIn New York in California I'm In New Jersey and in Florida is always of course important and much a swing\nState there's at least two districts that looked to be very much up for grabs a book about low and then the open seat hum that were done usher letters right on the Democratic side\nAt those two districts at least you know are considered battleground tossup states so um it in in the deeply red states are you know Texas uh the Dakotas those kinds of places we don't really have a whole lot of seats are terribly ... red representatives in blue states for the most part\nSteve I think some of the concern is is the between the liberal media and the talking heads had kinda ginned up that liberal base the Kevin Hall situation with the accusations of sexual misconduct it seems like the the liberal base is definitely ginned up however\nAnd when we went into the presidential election and sixteen Hillary Clinton at all had planned her victory party and then on election night everybody was dumbfounded what do you think the chances are that the polls are have just miss the mark once again and America will speak loudly at the polls\nYeah no it was I think you're onto something there I think that there's\nTrump has tended to have a quieter support mainly because I'd ... who support the president and then twenty six to a movement we don't have a complicit media for the most part the vast majority of me that way yeah of course is totally oppositional to the president they've stopped being journalist or their opposition advocates against the president you know I always say\nThe president walk on water I think MSNBC would say we see we told her he can't swim\nAway and it's a great that's just the reality that we're fighting about ... years why I'm optimistic I'm number one year you mentioned the cabin on here and I think that the Democrats really showed their hand they reveal\nWho they are and and the the underhanded despicable tactics particularly Dianne Feinstein ... in front of the whole country because it got so much attention on that really galvanized a lot of support on the right as well you are right to by the way it was I think both sides you usually as him for a midterm sky high\nBy historical standards for sure so the left is energized no doubt about it and I think partly because they can't stand how much we keep winning\nEggs in Louisiana and I think
