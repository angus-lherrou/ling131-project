[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome back to the bulls bears have it's a blast over to the head over to Facebook Like is that ... radio see some of the bloopers behind the scenes of some of the educational stuff yeah there's mostly bloopers [laughter]\nSee what has always made me ... like the but you know uh the stuff that doesn't make the production is ... does it does it worthy of making the production of this a lot of there's a lot of fun to go watch his head over there like us on Facebook a check in with us if you ever in the academy you know of the studios of ... as we got a lot going on so excited to have you listen to us and\nWe're really making that big social media push to try to get\nThe word out ... one of the things that we always talk about um ... and bears understand that the financial markets is not a game it's not a hobby\nIt uh it it can be a business they can pay as a business you know early we're talking about training for income trading as a business truly setting us up where you can receive monthly income where you can get the tax deduction or you can do this where you can build your business for you and your family that's what I Want to talk about I Want to talk about how someone can utilize the market and trade as a business\nWell let's talk about the American dream build a business land of opportunity is not the land of a secure job with benefits and the opportunity comes with people that take advantage of the free market and so there's a lot of ways to do that you can buy a franchise you could start a ground up as you can run a restaurant I mean there's a lot of ways that you can own a business in America but think about this\nMost small businesses are not successful and the reason is because there's\nA lot of liability this cost this hard causes fix cars you know you have variable costs you also have employees and benefits in insurance an inventory to house and lines of credit\nAnd it can be overwhelming and for a lot of people it's basically what causes them not to have successes that they have to deal with all these day to day incidence of traditional bits\nIs now managing another business imagine if you could\nNot have to worry about inventory if every time you needed a customer you just posted online something to sell no somebody there to buy it or if you need to buy something at a lower price at a wholesale price somebody was there to fulfill that over and sell it you never had a housing been tore never had to deal with employees workers' comp liability ... building\nDidn't have to deal with employees that right there what's that worth\nThat trading that setting up your trading and investing as a business you have all the tax benefits of a traditional business and yet you got a lot of the non traditional headaches taken out of your business when I saw that when I started trading is a business when I first got introduced to the financial markets [noise]\nIt was just amazing to see because I had run small businesses for years and I had some success some failures lots of failures and when I began to realize that I could do the same thing as far as income and potential income without a lot of the daily daily grind and stress of running a small business\nFor every day when I'm Out on the highway or I'm driving down the road I always get behind that truck with letters on the top and I talk to that guy all the time here at bowls and bears radio and I always say there's a guy right now driving down the road with a bunch of letters on the top ... going from one job or the other is Jason money's good employees that are trying to ... people that aren't showing up for work he's got people that own money\nAnd my heart goes out to that guy 'cause I was that guy then I found them financial markets in this as a business is the dream and when business owners get exposed to understanding how the financial markets can be treated like a business\nIt's a game changer an eye opener for them we see it all the time it's so many of you you don't understand that the markets can be treated like a business you have these dreams of owning a business\nSeriously inquiring to looking at trading for a business because what's important is the long term results are still there but a lot of those traditional headaches at most visit deal with you can get those out of the picture and guess what the sky becomes\nA limit well and that's exactly it champion a lot of individuals out there that want to start their own business they don't know how to get started they would love to utilize the business from home and that's what the markets can do for your online training academy\nThe sponsor bulls and bears I teach a class specifically on trading as a business now there's a five hundred dollar values taught right at the campus every time we give it away your ... and bears the phones what up we'll live a few seats to give away we're going to take callers ten to twenty pick up the phone right now in call a four four five on trade that they for four\nFive on trade for callers ten to twenty to get a five hundred dollar class on trained as a business from our sponsor online training academy\nIf you've always wanted to start a business and you don't know how to get started in the financial markets this is a unique opportunity for you again for callers tend to twenty pick up the phone and call them eight four for five one eight Seventy two thirty three that date for four or five one eight Seventy two thirty three for college ten to twenty\nInflammation and things of that nature and it's it's short term your and your pain they resolve it gets to a point where you're working can't really use that ... because there's so much pain\nWhere maybe in a way to help for their for the short term until your body is able to create the information and get rid of the creek the information to repair and then the information you\nGot your party's new coke and and then you can get back to doing what you're\nDoing it for you the acute pain is wherever you want to use the opioid in that short term setting but what we do know that the longer you're going to know more dictating that can be kind of course we have different types of addiction are are different types of drugs are different types of opioids which have different very different decree in action\nAnd oxycontin anoxic code on have the highest what's my search the highest likeability of friends that are readily available\nEnvy chronic pain sector as you mentioned it's usually a pain that person is going after three months and that usually that's a result of pain that is trying to call 'em but maybe didn't feel appropriately\nSo now you have some sort of you to the uh the tendons perhaps you know\nThat's a more long term nature and when we get past that one of a pain we start to understand that there's less chemical use about ... meaning that tissue injury that we talked about earlier and it turns into something else where there's there's a very strong emotional component of that pain whereas\nThe pain itself the chemical aspect of\nIt is a much smaller part so you're you're cooking what you start that acute pain is where we really need it for and that's why a lot of states are seeing the\nPrescription habits of certain positions to three to five days for those acute pain opioids right help prevent some of the addiction or did you find them to us so a tour towards the medication right and then the chronic\nPain realm we use you know your options long time ago was that I should say a long time ago even like ten years ago than the number one option was great because we didn't have anything else\nBut now with individual opinion we have another option to either not get you started on the opioid or reduce what you're taking currently and get you off of their whole life finding other targets that could be the source of those ...\n... ... well we only have about a minute left 'em I wanted to kind of circle back to this lawsuit because one thing that I read in the right up about the lawsuit really blew my mind the lawsuit contends that Perdue the company that owns toxic counter makes oxycontin told doctors that there is quote no ceiling dose\nFor that pain killer and that of patients showed signs of again enclosed pseudo addiction adjustment that the dosage needed to be increased\nThat's insane increased raised so these are these ... you know the shady marketing tactics yeah basically telling doctors oh no no no they can take as many of these is they want and it's not addictive so\nYou have to be healthy always can really do and if they start\nTo get addicted given more yeah exactly yeah yeah the ... more on unreal rational\nThe rationale behind that I I it sounds it sounds very very silly but if you tell people who are not trained in in diagnosing the pain correctly and they're treating your correctly as well\nThen they kind of get some of their news from these ah these companies are the companies definitely have a lot more money to be able to put out the amount of information that they're looking for but yet the concept of tolerance for\nThe more the water and to take a medication that same dosage of medicine will have the same effect as it did when you first started taking it so they're or that's what they are and how old are your doctor okay they're going to develop tolerance just increased\nThat goes but the problem is we're not looking at the long term effects of all these things\nImagine all the issues that are associated with a older coal mobility to use or other problems let's say you're up COPD and you're taking opioids and increasing their doses\nWhere you're going to cause problems associated with those other National Center happened so that the lawsuit is justified in the right way I Hope they win a producer pharmaceutical has been going through a lot of soul recently because the U.S government themselves have been cutting back the amount of\nTotal ... Coto in the United states by twenty five percent every year you've actually look at that number that's almost as\nGood and thank you so unfortunately we're out of time but thank you so much Dr Jackson ...\nAn intervention all pain management doctor who's made it his mission to get as many people off opioids as possible thank you for being on the prank you double them make sure you stay tuned kids coming up after the break a story every caffeine you were a family member is experiencing headaches nagging\nBack pain called the ... sign Institute been to a doctor today after the ... sign Institute our positions insurgent aren't internationally Clinton airfield didn't have the education Marion and expertise mount mount than many others mind centering Martha ... he's finding new patients benefit\nNice mild starts your Saturday but temperatures will warm up quickly again will top Ninety three which would tire record for this Saturday only ten percent chance of passing shower late in the day overnight part of the ... guys back down to Seventy four Ninety two on Sunday afternoon ... back at twenty percent but temperatures will stay warm\nOut on the water northeast wins tend not to put seasonal lights up on the bay on news channel a meteorologist ed blood worth for news radio nine Seventy WFL a\nNews radio nine Seventy WFL a of\nYou go on the eye heart radio at download is now part of a job\nDown pound five to not on your cell wall that's all\nFrom the odd about hearing aids studios Ninety six seven FM Pascoal went up to nine FM south of Tampa nine Seventy W. F. LA all over Tampa Bay\nYou are listening to American medicine today presented by the ... Institute featuring internationally acclaimed inventor of the ... procedures Alfred been odd EMT once again your host Kimberly ... and co hosts Ethan euchre and Jeff whack staff\nLettuce stuff's going on behind the scenes here in American medicine today I Am Kimberly ... joined by my great group of friends and you happy to be here ... hello everyone hello and world renowned orthopedic surgeon Dr outfit than I Am high so\nOn President Trump recently signed legislation into law which wouldn't grant terminally ill patients access to experimental drugs before they're approved by the FDA and here to discuss what's being called the right to try law is Raymond march research fellow at the independent Institute thank you for being here raining\nLike ever having now for those that don't know and I actually didn't know what this law was until I read the story recently or explain what right to try is\nSure right to try is now national legislation as finding by President Trump look is going to allow patients with her mental illness says where do either don't have a current remedy or treatment\nAvailable at ... at all previous treatment options now are going to have access to medication which is in the high point of the FDA approval process so it's not fully approved by the FDA okay but it's gone through phase one showing at least some initial prompt us\nMhm now many criticized this Dell why would that be because if you're a terminally ill I mean your option is in Des Moines more something that may help you why would anyone ever be against that law\nAre there are several reasons and a few of them come to mind primarily warn of I think a lot of um individuals are concerned that pharmaceutical companies are drug providers will take advantage of these laws and\nFor lack of a better word experiment on terminally ill patients another one might be the fact that it because it's not fully FDA approved it might be exposing people who are terminally ill too excessive levels of risk I personally don't find either of those arguments convincing but those are the ones that seem to talk of the most often\nYeah I mean if you're looking at a gas square in the face I probably will win every you put in front of me\nYeah and and just to some of the quotes a that can really was mentioning some of the current criticism criticism I Can't talk today some of the criticism people were calling it a cruel joke\nOr some also said that are present prevents false hope which could again in quotes undermine public helps\nNone of that makes any sense to me and to me if anything it's not a false hope are dying and somebody said hey there's a drug glimmer of my work for you that to me that's hope regardless of if it works or not especially if you go into it knowing okay it might not work but then at the same\nWay you're any better off you know if it doesn't work you die if he never tried it you die Mm\n... so the fact that there are a lot of these people will be looking as you say the hope and we'd be moving to other countries to what the experiment the drugs shouted re experimental and then get submitted to dust ones then they also failed\nBut did they remove all of the fortune\nThat these people need to pay for this for these exposures in other countries India abusive that happened is it is amazing to see if you go with Paso and then then they used to they did the Mexican C do right there the clinics just to the suburbs these type of\nPopulation and they they kill practically that people are the drugs and you didn't medications that they are practically\nNone approve at all and that experiment in disarray runners at least he says in drug that it'd be ... by by by the federal government here an action or his his real surge in ... I I really think he's he's unbelievable good idea and\nIt seems like the FDA would have a a middle ground for for these drugs that haven't been approved but have shown some promise to help patients that they would allow a terminal patient to try it rather than try nothing mhm the FBI\nActually does have a current program like that it's called the compassionate use program that's been around and its current form loosely since Nineteen eighty seven and the idea is just like you said so there's a terminally ill patient we have a drug that's not been fully approved is somewhere in the approval process we're going to grant this patient special exemption so they can try this experimental measure medication\nMhm and that's a wonderful program I actually think it's kind of humor is that the FDA itself wasn't meant that it doesn't need to be fully are proven certain circumstances\nBut that's a good it's good that it it's\nA great program but the issue is that it doesn't cover enough there's roughly twenty five thousand patients each year that will die in the United states from that area is waiting for the FBI to approve a certain kind of drug\nExactly actually ... the compassionate use program currently only services about a thousand cases a year so that is well short of what could potentially be done to help these patient\nRight nine thousand patients from two thousand five to twenty fourteen I mean come on seems like the under utilized program in America\nIt also sounds like a lost opportunity because I Would think the FDA could gather incredible information during testing by actually using these drugs as they're testing them on human patients and I would think they can gather so much more information much more rapidly than traditional testing\nAnd I could provide for better information to a lot of times when they have clinical prophecies are clinical trials going on sometimes patients who are especially ill or actually voted out and not put under these process because they're going to skew the date and make the drug with less or more effective\nNow right and this is actually something we've talked about on the show before but I guess my memory is failing me why does it take so damn long for the FDA to approve things especially I mean I get they got to cover their butts with law suits and things like that but\nI mean why does it take years many and most times for them to finally approved drugs that can be saving lives right away really ...\nUh well I'm an economist so I'm gonna tell you the story of incentive the FBI has every and send them in the world and make sure drug is as safe as they could possibly be before it goes out to a consumer mhm but suppose the FDA is wrong and the consumer actually doesn't get better they might actually get worse that immediately comes back into the FBI is based on looks like you're not doing a good job\n... drugs that never get approved which could potentially help patients never show up in the headlines because we never see the effect\nSo what did you have an effect your perverse incentives or the FDA is going to be very hesitant to ever upriver drug has even flight risk whereas if they have a\n... that would be true in fact if you had private institution providing these drugs they'd be going to provide the risk if the consumer was interested\nThat sounds very odd considering I watch on commercial breaks and a lot of them are filled with up to ... to help maybe somebody that's kinda runny nose and they can have sudden death they end up with tuberculosis cancer Weprin weird rations I mean come on right\nNow yeah fifty percent of the commercial side effects\nAnd warning precautions and all of a sudden you know what what was the initial use this drug suicidal thoughts\nYeah that's a common for depression or to avoid a runny nose no less than actually yeah that was\nAn interesting point the FBI is particularly conservative and approving drugs but at the same time it may not be that effective in finding effective uses of drugs\nA lot of believe it or not all go read them but people develop privately can accurately predict what drug the FBI is going to recall\nHim for five years and even though they have good intentions in their conservative in approaching the approval process and along which drugs to get on the market they may not actually be that affect them and figure out which drug should have gone on the market\n... do you think there's any exchange of money there no not at all it's all we have several billions ... just the two and a suburb right exactly no collusion Jay are\nJust like we learned was the opioid crisis ... is always the money that's right\nNow ... is the state of this bill because as we mentioned at the top of the interview 'em it's already it already exists on some level on the state level but ah the bill that Trump just put forward and I think it's still has to be voted on right would make it federal really signed it",
