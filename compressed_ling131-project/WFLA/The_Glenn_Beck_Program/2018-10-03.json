[laughter] say for me to ask them to tell me how he feels name\nIt's person asking person asking how there was a lot easier than it's better than what we can't pronounce the easy word yeah it was going to be the there's a lot more than ... did a lot of there's a lot of confidence there I don't know how you doing there and I'm doing well how are you\nGood I'm I'm a I'm I'm really fascinated by how we make the turns in our society for the future and a ownership is a big part of this because in the future I don't know how many people leaving on cars I mean it's just it's just all changing\nBut do we really own things when we buy them on line\nSo I think there's a real concern here that consumers go into transactions when they're buying things digital goods are especially digital books movies music\nThey go into the transactions assumed they were the same way they do in the in the world of tangible goods where if you buy a book you can give it away to a friend you can lend it to someone you can leave it in your will\nOr in the future and leave your book collection or to or your loved ones and the rules that control these digital transactions when you buy something on your Kindle or my shows are very different from the rules that we expect in the physical world\nAnd consumers don't really understand that distinction and I think that causes of your disconnect between what we all expect to happen and what happens in fact so to give you a a quick example I'm just [noise] a\nA couple of weeks ago\nI'm a consumer uh a customer of the apple eyes gyms a movie store found that three movies purchase had ... had been deleted from his account they were no longer accessible and I think that shocked a lot of people\nUm those of us have been following these issues closely for years would remember ten years ago when Amazon remotely deleted\nBoth off of people's candles and including\nA ironically George Orwell Nineteen eighty four [laughter] so these these issues have been happening for a long time but I think people are are are now starting to really a sit up and take notice\nOkay so I I remember it gives us that it's easier for me to read everything on Kendall um but I and I have a a large collection uh in my library of of of hardcover books\nUh and I read so much I read it all on tend to but I have recently really been concerned not just because I don't actually own it and I can't have it in my library and I can't pass it on but also because you watch things like that happening in China\nIf you're ... if you're in China and the first they wouldn't sell the book but if they did sell the book\nThe government can just deem that that book is you don't need to burn books you could just overnight just take all of that every copy of that book out of circulation if it's only digital that's really disturbing to me\nI think it's a real concern um it's a concern I'm from the perspective of censorship and you've just described it it's also real concern\nOr from the perspective of preservation and sort of archiving our cultural history if these books are ... are are stored on these centralized servers and only the hands of\nYou know the the the two or three companies um that dominate these markets\nThen there's a real risk that uh we are going to be able to ensure a cab to widespread distribution of copies that will allow us to uh to to uh to archive and preserved um these works\nIn an air and it was the movie it wasn't because they found it objectionable or anything else is because that particular provider they lost the rights to that movie right and so they they had to pull it from people's libraries because their rights that expired\nSo there are number of ways that this can happen this most recent example I don't know that the facts are totally clear on exactly\nWhat went on so one way this can happen is that as you described um the deal between the digital retailer apple or Amazon and the copyright holder expires may no longer have the rights to sell that product\nIt can also happen when a record label or movie studio decide that they want to put out the new updated re mastered the director's cut edition of the movie and when they do that they pulled the old version\nTo alcoholism I knew [noise] um\n[noise] oh my gosh so they almost force you to I mean 'cause they they've always done this where you know it's the masterpiece collection and it's you know additional footage and and uh you know fully restored but you still have the old copy\nNow that's right you can't ... I mean even for thinking this even just for comparison you can't if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed our war huh well I Want to see what it was like\nWhen they were originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that what'd you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and the and the problem in this most recent case in part was that the consumer didn't have a local copy stored on their computer or their device\nUm and and this is a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you can do locally many services are often trying to encourage consumers to rely on their own\nOn the on the company's own set of cloud storage solution\nAnd sometimes I'm for with the Apple TV for example or the Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of the movie you have to access it through their ... servers exactly I'm Sorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship as\nIf I downloaded a something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\nOr so\nIs it allows you to store those files locally on your own device\nBut cars that Kendall is tethered through software right where connections to Amazon Amazon has the ability as as they showed ten years ago to block it would move those files strong\nMuslim ... ... you're talking about or go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years do chew and a very different way I I'm sure [noise] um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way David forced everybody to have it exactly\nIt's bizarre you write about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce there is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making for my tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\nYou say it sort of an open ended thing where they are constantly knowing what you do with that product and you\nHave that ongoing relationship where they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk about a little bit about the change their cars that is a that's a real change I don't think people have considered an air and before you answer that we're going to take a quick break and then we'll come back and get you to answer that question a and just the\nChange in in capitalism change what does it mean to enter a world where\nThere's really no ownership of anything\nFor years now relief factor has been helping or my team here in the studio\nAlleviate pain late last year um oh school mine\nWell I Want to tell you about really factor really factor take it it's really good [laughter] um are and you can buy really factor with gold one thing you can I don't think you can ...

I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and ah and I think it's his background as an engineer or ... or and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film is saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company and making money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did in which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about saying yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premise of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlenn they're using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the Kavanaugh case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a ... there is this overwhelming ah understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen that\nRight yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it's secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun yes it's a verb auto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving
