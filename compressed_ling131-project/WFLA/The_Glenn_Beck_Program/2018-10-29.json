story\nOf the Jewish people just survive\n\nThat's why the nation of Israel exist if people don't understand that is why no one ever wants them no one ever stands for them they're always the last in line and so\nThe world decided let them have this scrap\nOf land and they say well is there is because of the Bible let them have it it's uninhabitable it's it's just nothing but a desert there's no oil there's nothing there just give it to them\nAnd the Jews happily took it restored to their homeland as the only nation on earth to be wiped off the face of the map and then to be restored to two thousand years later exactly as for told\nIsraeli exists because no one seems to want them Israeli exists because they have a right to live\n\nSo let me go back to Russia and our musical friend\nIn Nineteen eighty nine forty years after the battle of Stalingrad the Hebrew immigrant aid society was helping Jews get out of the Soviet Union and go to Israel and the United states and they provided lawyers money to find homes food even language classes to help them assimilate in their new country\nFor the first time ever Gregory and the rest\nOf the Jews that he had known that had survived both Hitler and style and couldn't concentrate on something more than just surviving\n\nThey had a right to pursue their happiness they could practice their faith they could be proud of who they were they could finally live\n\nThe group that saved him the Hebrew immigrant aid society it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world let me say that again it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world\nIt was established in the Eighteen hundreds and they're responsible for assisting thousands and thousands of Jews\nAnd a few years ago they open up their services not just to Jews\nBut people of all faiths all face that are persecuted and need to be rescued\n\nTheir currency a CEO was asked recently why they decided to do it\nHis answer couldn't be more perfect\nWe no longer help refugees because they're Jewish we help refugees because we are Jewish\n\nReason why I'm telling you the story is this is the organization that I'm mad man went into Philadelphia\nTo try to stop\nThis is the organization that was attacked on Saturday morning at the tree of life synagogue story never seems to end the eleven people were killed and the deadliest attack on Jews in our country's history\n\nStories like Gregory filled the synagogue that Saturday morning the horrors that collectively endured unimaginable to most people\nAnd yet here we are again\nThe group of people who now have to concentrate just on one thing\nSurvive\nAnti Semitism is evil anti Semitism is a disease anti Semitism is as old as the world from the moment\nGods said I Will make you my people there has been anti Semitism and it is on the rise as it always is in times of nationalism and socialism every time the Jew is the canary in the coal mine they are always the first\nAnd if the world doesn't pay attention at that point it's washed in blood\n\nIf the world decides they need to come for the Jews I proudly declare myself a Jew\n\nSo world makes promises all the time and they don't ever intend on keeping them\nBut I Do\nWe said never forget\nI told you you are the audience that will envy and restore the republic save the republic and it's not going to be through violence the world is going to become more and more violent\n\nWe must be a unique and pull your people because the vast majority of Americans know this is not who we are\n\nThis is not who we want to be\nAnd we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish brothers and sisters\n\nWe will stand shoulder to shoulder with her Christian Brothers and sisters in the middle east we will stand shoulder to shoulder with a Muslim that is being rounded up by the Chinese\n\nThe cycle of hate\nHas been gone again and it's not Donald Trump and it's not Iraq Obama\n\nIt's a cycle that has been running since the beginning of time and the world always acts the same way because it always comes in a time of chaos\nIt always comes in a time of fear it always comes in a we cycle when the forget the individual it's what's best for all of society if why our\nFounders came here in the first place it's why our founders defended the Jews\n\n\nWe're a different country where a different people we're not better\nThan the rest of the world we just see things differently\nAnd if we don't shame on us\nOur pilgrims came here thinking that they were completing the journey from the red sea\n\nOur first gray seal of the United states was the pillar of fire and pharaohs horses and the party of the red sea\n\nI don't want to just survive I don't want to\nDo something to earn a living I Want to live\n\nFDR said this generation

Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of very slowly gradually but he's like you know did he he didn't go there to help with today is the first question was ah you know\nWhat about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I live in a country as a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning center in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt them and anti Semitism my entire life\nHe he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah [noise] this is a terrible tragedy then they're like well\nWhat what what part of of that you think this is the the climate of today and and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make\nVery clear that this shooter a outwardly heated Donald Trump\nYeah we did a lot like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or has nothing to do that don't tie him to be a ... more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall are just courses pretty terrible at the moment but again has nothing to do with this and all\nThese cable news networks are ... that were telling you that it does\nMhm they're obsessed with telling your wife well\nWe don't want us to blame it on a do Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nRight [laughter] that's really is really that's what they're doing never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever that guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot\nAll of the geo ... and another guy and tried to tried to bring to kill thirty Republican seat that's tenth of the Republican was working\nFor Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault no we never said that and neither did I say and either do today yes of course not but they didn't even talk about it because they\nThey had a very balanced view of that one for a understood that individuals who are responsible for their own actions that time that's right he understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them in and they always complain about this course isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes\nWe can sit there and both of these things right when if a Republican and now the python think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt 'em\nBut you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie Sanders situation\nBut both situations we said the individual is responsible the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individuals shootings and I'm going to do with it and you do not ... discourse does not commit murder\nDoesn't happen so the reason why Rob ... pad in this morning is because uh you know he he sees doing more on trivia and uh and pour a trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh\nI had a meeting and a man in and thank you and me for up to the rafters because that is something that we have been feeling for a very very long time and for someone in your position to actually said out loud\nAnd don't you dare apologize for that\nSo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know and that when I'm never going to end on that one\nAnd in fact repeat it uh it it consistently just repeat it and it was fabulous and again it was you know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nBoth thank you thank you so are you coming to the show in Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's on Sunday becoming\nNo because we're going to be out of town is going to be out of town really 'cause I'm going to be free tickets but seriously oh now all of sudden you're interested maybe can change I I ... you change your plans I've got free tickets for if you want if you'd like them are you serious I Am serious goes my ... that\nThat would I change my plans okay All right All right good thanks Suzie we'll see you are\nWhat ... Sunday or at least my guess Sunday yes it's going back to accomplish tour by the way for the tickets and the details on we're going to be ... it's got to be find there's a lot of elections stuff to talk about ... ah ah stuff\nYeah they were given gift from the gods as far as serial yeah we do the dishes turned completely insane so it makes the comedy fairly easy\nSaid it does and Pittsburgh we've got something special for you there were going to have laughed and\nAnd comedy but uh also uh I Am taking all of the proceeds from the I'm from the event and um we're giving them to\nI'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to or to\nUh the refugee I'm Down here a group I'm not sure we're going to give them to yet but we're we're uh we're we're standing with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going\nUm to a a local Jewish um\nCenter perhaps the the synagogue and I'm not sure and I sense from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I noticed you went back and forth at a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was a she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever ... uh criticized I think it was George Soros stream into\nA and I remember and you came back to this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know and then she posted here's an example of ... supporting the Jewish people and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros or as as an example of how much you hate the Jews\nNow I did respond because I found\nAn example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard\nA that was I thought but rather national award what are the highest um ... most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people cry but beyond that uh it was just it was just presented\nBy the the prime minister of Israel though\nBump that well that's it [laughter] okay that's not a big one that out of it is not a big one so it's just amazing you know 'cause this is not just the criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros\nThat you are an anti Semite is completely insane if you are a ... a conservative\nAnd the people in this audience I Would leave all would fall into this category many of them would criticize drug stores but they criticize him because he's a liberal or progressive policies he supports\nA policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him around him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he has a very shady history or around the world that but\nAnti Semite patriarch source to ... in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew\n[laughter] the way they don't like been Shapiro because you're in front of me should hero [laughter] reporting the policies you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx he was Jewish\nI don't like him not because he was and you know but because he came up with the idea of communism\nI I'm not a man no not a fan of it and the ...\nLike you're in these liberals have never criticized Ben Shapiro before is that because they're anti Semite it's because they don't like what Ben Shapiro said they will love ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal and they don't like him because he is a conservative is this distinction\nDifficult for people can you really not understand I mean we all know they cannot do it and I it's not all understand\nThat they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives are anti Semite we you're telling me the way they uh you know Sheldon Adelson right here's a guy who is one of the biggest financier the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic\nWhat it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas are they racist\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas is legal opinion because they don't support what they believe it's not about it it ... trying to make these into cartoon arguments ... is such a a ... ...\nAgain this is another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're calling everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they say\nIt anyway 'cause they don't care [noise]\nThat that that is exactly what they they they claim to be against and they do it every day wow I didn't hear solution there to\nGo to a battering I don't know what I have a good point and ah we're we're going to talk about one when we come back\nWhat news makers film world shaker everyday news radio nine Seventy WFL a\nSo let me talk to you a little bit about um [noise]\nBuying or selling a home if you are if you're buying a home

enough is enough\nWhen America will enough be enough new polls Americans fed up crave for unity admitted violence now\nThis one should terrify you because\nFifty seven percent now say they want a third party they want unity that number is even higher but I'm not sure people actually mean this I'm not sure what unity even means\nAnd they say that we no longer really ah agree\nOn the core values of our country which I think is actually true we don't agree on core values\nBut what are those core values\nAnybody know\nWhat are the values that brought up what are the things that were actually arguing about now way things are going in the United states twenty five percent are satisfied fifty eight percent\nDissatisfied the state of politics nine percent satisfied Seventy seven percent dissatisfied Thirteen percent are like a ...\nPercentage that say Americans are United in agreement about the most important values Fifteen Percent Fifteen Percent of us they were United on the most important values my question is what are those values\nSincerely what are we fighting for our we are we fighting for lower taxes\nHere's what the the here's the surveys the shows where we divide on our quote the most important values\nPolitics in this country it's politics of value um moral ethics in our country\nIs that a value\nRace relations gap between rich and poor the state of the news media\nThe way things are going in the U.S the environment the way things are going in your state rights for algae beat the status of religion homeland security\nWith an exception of a couple of those aren't values\nThose are issues that is a political campaign and perhaps that's what we're missing\nSee I I firmly believe and I I I wrote this in the book addicted outrage we have a few things we have\nTo decide we have to decide one is the western World War saving his freedom as our founders saw it is it worth saving yes or no and I don't want\nYou just uh you know jump off and yeah absolutely why why why is it worth saving who can articulate this\nWhy is it worth saving how has it changed the world in specifics\nWho can make that case among us\nWho's making that case to their kids at dinner at night in specifics\n\nIs America a good place or a bad place\nWe have to decide because half of the country says it's a great place half of the country says and I don't even know if these numbers are accurate and half I doubt they are have but let's just say half the country says it's a bad place half the country says it's a good place\nWhich are way sincerely which are we we have to choose deli because it's a binary choice isn't it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one\nNo no you don't\nIt's not a binary choice the answers were both\nWe're both\nWe've been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hell is paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions\nWhat are we gonna do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them have you heard anyone actually make the case for America and\nNot just in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important\nWhy is the constitution worth fighting for because if we don't know let's just get on with it man just move on I I'm I\nWe cannot sit here and argue about our greatest issues of our time we don't have our basic living rooms I Want to make sure I have this right our our basic essential values in line like climate change\n\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each

are the problems that we're trying to solve their different\nPeople are now saying that you know the problem is is that Americans don't agree on basic values and principles anymore well I agree with that but nobody even is talking about those when's the last time you heard anyone really talking about values or principles\nIn the mainstream media tell me last time you heard that talked about on Fox or on CNN or MSNBC tell me\nDefending basic principles what are those principles well American principles we used to find self evident that all men are created equal so you want to talk about the ah the the shooting\nIn I'm In er\nPittsburgh great\nThat guy has violated American principles all men are created equal an endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights one of those rights

mental health\nAnd that would be something else that would be a very valid target the topic we gotta talk about mental mental health in America Americans are feeling more and more alone more and more isolated communication is going through the roof but none of those are principles\n\nDo we take care of one another well that's the golden rule isn't it\nThat's the golden rule\nSee we we just assume

Manuel and like when\nOf who voted in the two thousand fourteen midterms have already voted already down or so you know this is going on constantly now in the last couple of weeks these elections is totally different way of thinking about this and of course you know these campaigns like it because it gives them a chance because so many chances to get people to go and get people to to the polls and\nForce them to go early to get all the activists out and they could have them go and you know go pass out you know go take down Ted Cruz signs or whatever the heck they're they're they're a volunteers are doing on that particular day but there's an interesting way of looking at this we talk a lot about a district that have changed\nFrom Obama to Trump people who voted for Obama and then changed to Trump\nAnd there's the other side of that is people who voted for Romney and changed Clinton and there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a let's see if the Thirteen districts that voted for Mitt Romney and two thousand twelve and then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand sixteen\nSo two thousand twelve on average ... according to five thirty eight had about an eight point advantage for Romney\nIn two thousand sixteen it was a five point advantage for Democrats\nSo what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling as of right now\nUh we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in those states\nSo if you look at it kind of ... to summarize those kind of lost three points are well well\nThree points Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six to ... less passionate into two dozen sixteen but a big big move from two thousand twelve got it so they're kind of in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand correcting now they were Twenty one districts that voted for Barack Obama\nAnd then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one\nOr so in two thousand twelve with Rocco bomb on they had about a six point advantage for Democrats for Obama or end\nTwo thousand sixteen that's swung from all the way back to seven points Republican for Donald Trump so it's a huge swing there is that you would think of these real swing districts so far polling is showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half points that's big the big change though and that was that's almost equal to where they were voting and roam around ... time\nSo if you look at that the people who were voted for a bomb and then switched to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for Obama\nWith Romney or the people who voted for Romney then went to Clinton they're in between those two positions but leaning towards Clinton [noise]\nThat's where these districts show up there is also five states where this is a where this occurred\nFive state of Florida Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin where they voted for over ... been changed to Trump\nIn the Obama election that had about five point advantage for Obama no state in the Trump election there is about to point advantage for Trump\nRight now those states are showing a twelve point advantage for Democrats now now that part of that is it a little bit different than what you would say in the house where they're broken up into little areas and there's so many candidates and their up all the time\nWe're this is some of these races are just they're so popular Democrats already Pennsylvania's like an example of that where they have been just a big lead or not because I don't think that's necessarily solely because of some ...\nTell me what all this means from last week or the Democrats making is is the momentum start just they're just starting to swing back towards the Democrat\nI Would say it doesn't tell you much about the Senate but it's I think it does tell you something about the house which is\nThere was that I Hope that there'll be some movement in the house towards Republicans these numbers aren't showing that I mean it right now ... seems like the Democrats will take the house uh and the Republicans look pretty solid and the Senate right now when will we see\nAny movement at all are due to the shooting in the bombing\nWell the polling wouldn't even start probably if you weren't real polling reaction that at least till today so you have three I mean you're probably not till later this week Thursday or friday the earlier the case I Will look for this\nElection by numbers [noise]\nOn the Glenn Beck program [noise]\nThis weekend as you know a gunman opened fire at the a tree of life synagogue and Pittsburgh he shot and killed eleven people during Sabbath services injured six others for where police officers\nThe guy was insane he hated Donald Trump that doesn't make him a Democrat doesn't mean that he was\nYou know following I dunno Cory Booker whoever it just means this is not political\nAnd should it be we keep jumping to politics first I Can't imagine what these families are going through\n\nPennsylvania has taught us before with the Amish how to deal with killers\n\n[noise] if you've been listening to me um for a long time you know what I Believe is coming and have said is coming for a while and I'm always wrong with timing\nBut I don't think there's any way to deny that what I've worn was coming is here now we're seeing the beginnings of it now\n\nAnd it's only going to get worse and it's going to get harder it's going to get harder for you to stand up\nHave they taken gab down yet I think the\n... the service provider for them has taken them down or I don't know if they're back up as not gaps fault gab is is that kind of a\nShorter competitor I guess I Would say that they found up are becoming a\nSafe haven for anti Semite so I guess and and and you know\nI don't want that nobody wants that but we either believe in freedom or we don't and yes I don't I don't like the poison that they put out\n\nBut I also don't like the silencing of voices this America man this is American principles you can't silent voices\n\nSky was a deeply disturbed really bad guy\n\nYou know you watch TV and you see the victims the faces curling across the TV screens\n\nAnd you might think that things are getting worse\n\nAnd I guess historically speaking this is the worst anti Semitic shooting we've ever had in the history of our country eleven people\n\n[noise] on the positive side that's nothing compared to some countries\n\nI saw some reporters say you know the problem is is a this is Donald Trump I Hope you I Hope you're happy that you have your uh your synagogue or I'm Sorry your ah your embassy in Jerusalem really really that's where you're going\nReally this was caused by moving the embassy to Jerusalem oh my gosh\n[noise] wow\n\nYeah Jews were killed in Israel like terrorists last year a hundred and twenty two hundred and twenty two was that Donald Trump's fall too or is that just the evil Jews full how many of France\n\nFrance they're moving out at a record number because they know they've seen this movie before\n\nSo tired of the west to being the blame for everything that there's nobody worse
