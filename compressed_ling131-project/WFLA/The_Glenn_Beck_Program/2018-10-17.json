the van and what's the phrase the pace [noise]\nHa ha hey hey hey I'm Tampa Bay uh-huh hey hey hey Tampa Bay [noise] that'll be one for the books\nTo protest right now ah hey hey do away with a in Tampa Bay obliterated am Tampa Bay we're\nGoing to get rid of all that stuff um a couple of things that are going to be hanging over tomorrow first of all\nWe're going to be broadcasting in um well we'll be at the it's called the Anna Maria oyster bar\nBut it is on ridge street at the pier there yet and uh you can Google that bridge street or just Anna Maria oyster bar\nThere's a couple of them and make sure it's the one I'm British liberal um I think they're about four or five of them but yeah it's the one on British street by the pier and that's inland farther than the\nUh ... beach and all that stuff\nYeah stop by some at some breakfast with us some extra crispy bacon jak\nWell I Hope hope they got bacon that'll be good ... hey the again the death toll stood at Twenty one the latest we heard in Florida only and they had about seven deaths and they kept in Virginia and deaths as well in North Carolina and Georgia\nBut um we had let's see clay county had\nUm one death and then four in Gadsden county twelve people in Bay county that's where it hit Mexico beach three people in Jackson County and also a storm related deaths in Gulf county but those numbers\nAre going to rise because they still level we're a thousand people that are not accounted for\nAnd they're cut off a lot of people are cut off steam it hasn't gotten into some areas emergency management crews haven't gotten into some areas so we're definitely going to see that number go up unfortunately\nAnd these people are for the most part going to be without electricity for a long time in many cases it could be months before they get electricity back\nUm which we were talking about earlier I mean not only no lights and you can't cook and things like that but you can't charge your cell phones and that's going to be one of the biggest hindrance is to people and you can do it in your car if you got a cell phone charger that works in your car you can do it there\nAnd thankfully they were starting to get a lot of the cell towers back up and running yesterday because families haven't been able to reach out to their loved ones to see if they're okay in the panhandle\nYeah my brother in law I Know a first of all nobody could get into bay county and he got cut off there so he couldn't even go and see how his house was\nA because they're trying to stop looters one looted got killed by the way which is good to know I I Can't believe I remember a somewhere up in North Carolina I think it was they showed pictures of all those looters going in there they were just running out with everything and the mayor had told the police to let them loot stay away from\nWell not in the pan handle this mouse install a police vehicle actually and as they were driving away was yet or yelling I'm looting\nYeah ... well he's not anymore is a dead duck and that's a good thing they did a a ... up there they told you if you try to get an ear and engaging looting you're going to be shot because it was the way they want to handle and um\nAnyway the other problem they're trying to do is\nFind a way that these people can engage in the election because a lot of people are not going to even be back in time for election day coming up November six\nAnd I know are Republicans are concerned about this because a Trump was very strong in the pan handle some of those areas as high as Seventy seven percent of the voters went for Trump in the election so it's a very red part of the state of Florida the say the\nLeast run to Santa's going to need the help especially with Andrew Gillum being in the mirror Tallahassee\nAnd all you better believe it for sure but um it it really is a mess up there and they're going to find more did I'm sure over the\nCourse of this thing and it's going to be it's going to be decades before they fully recover from this thing because in as I said and we drove through the panhandle from Pensacola Tallahassee the woods or all torn up as a result of it and it's gonna be a long time before they grow all the trees and everything back\nAnd as far as their agriculture took a huge hit and it's going to be a long time before they get that backs and if you rebuild on the\nBeach you have to really build a house that will sustain a hundred and fifty plus mile an hour winds\nAnd that's almost impossible to do and an awful lot of people did not have insurance because they were taking a chance not wanting to buy insurance\nWill get flood insurance yet is different than regular insurance completely different at all yeah so it's the flood insurance has killed everybody\nDid they didn't get yeah they didn't get it because it's very expensive and they decided they'd rather not have it I don't have the\nYeah and there's also some things that it doesn't cover in there for hurricane hits\nYeah well for ... year old the forty fifth floor to you have flood insurance\nWell not quite that that'll kinetics hundred and forty fifth well if if we get hit on our

got some extra spending maybe that they could consider some slogans necessarily think extra spending as possible or what their support them as being a boy or get a job that I don't think they've taken every dime true I yeah I mean\nDifficult to find more to spend ... ways to spend them ... millions remember the classic documentary or from the Nineteen eighties and would share Richard Pryor was forced to spend thirty million dollars and thirty days\nAnd if he did so successfully from a from a inheritance even received the full inherent it's a three hundred um this is an important moment uh in our culture\nUm but it was difficult because he couldn't take it ... so he couldn't buy thirty million dollar car right yet at zero after it's at the end of it and the idea was kind of like the thing where you do with your kids were you\nUh you know they don't actually do this but like in the legend of like you have your kids smoked three packs of cigarettes you get sick and never wants to smoke another cigarette right around that kind of make sure you get sick of spending money so you're good with money from then on was the idea in in a documentary\nUm but how did he wind up actually this is a spoiler alert for Nineteen eighty three but how did he a wind up spending all the money he decided to run a political campaign it was the easiest way to get rid of all of a buddy at ... or so I think ah you know this is kind of at the aspect where the uh the the Democrats are which is\nCan they figure out another way to spend\nMoney we may even do a little roosters millions or where you come up on stage and you are a\nDemocratic socialist [laughter] and you have to spend sixty trillion dollars do it is harder than you think it is harder than you they can you do it\n... the socialist

to look away at it they they don't want to engage and um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out\nSolidly aligned with the most progressive the most and arts elements in our society the press sympathizes with all of them they sympathize\nWith open borders they sympathize with legalized narcotics they sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes and there's the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive\nCauses so ... that's a big\nDifference we didn't have that what was that a left wing press but we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's why we have now\nLet me let me ask you this um\nUh I beg to differ with you on the and the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties or some of them we don't have it we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say a a you know some group with standing in the community\nUh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... for justice and non violence or whatever I um and they followed the king I'm a rules where you just never swing back\nAh that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties the press played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody else\nWill take a cell phone video and throw it out there\nJust what happened is that an over the weekend is that in the group\nViewing that would have to hire security they'd have to hire people to protect them um you can do this it just takes it takes leadership\nIt takes organization but but on the first thing I look let's let's segue into Saudi Arabia now because the press is actively trying to go you saw it on sixty minutes you solidly still try to do with\nTrump into basically dismissing Saudi Arabia All right well they want to not trade with them they want to crush\nThat nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad\nOkay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad but Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran in the middle east it's the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt Iran is terrorism\nAnd destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading that charge so why on earth is the American left wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we outlawed ourself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that\nEverything they're good at helping you actually figure out what to do too yeah I don't know why for that you do you have a really but I Can't I'm\nI when it comes to something big like the drapes and stuff I just I that's one step that I I just I'm like I don't I don't know I don't know yeah because\nYou can take pictures and send them to them and they they'll actually look at them and help you design\nYeah and there do you think would look good right and then they'll put the drapes in the picture and you know you're like okay that's great leveled the blinds and they'll show you and when you see it it's it's totally different I mean it it really if you don't have the imagination or the eyes to do that which most people don't\nThey'll do it and it's free right now you can

Oregon yeah they are you are telling me that you were trying to organize a mattress people yes and you were going to bring them all together slowly\nAnd I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago and met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run\nA stuff across the border and\nThey they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to how the ... marine funds help okay now this is a group of Christians yes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist looking out all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe\n'em and they are all all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning and at the end and it's it's it's a really really good thing\nUm [noise] and so I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in their ... or done several trips with the ... fund in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to have us because\nWhen I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the um civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with the ...\nAnd then the the bottom are removed all of those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people alive so\nWhy why are they doing this why are they doing this these\nTribes [noise] it's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic burns who control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma they want to control all the high lands they want to control the entire region and so if you're a different ethnicity\nYou can ... they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject or surf class you have to basically serve the ... and also the for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus\nThey don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just adds a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because where there's ... there's liberty right and these and so because of that the Burma Army attack them even more\nTell me what you wrote me so I brought ths abroad with me several photos\nHave somebody I'm over his mercy pass their apologize I think okay so I brought with me\nSeveral photos of of\nWhat I see all the time when I go to these places [noise]\nAnd these are ... I bought I brought with me photos [noise] sorry of\nOf one particular um attack that happened\nUm this is actually only from this is from two thousand ten writes it seems like a long time ago but this is these are the only photos that they were able to get out to me I was asking you had any photos of what's happening and what's going on\nAnd in these photos you see dead civilians you see kids dead a baby and these are not accidental collateral damage is or intentional executions of these people\nThese are some of these are it's that's a that's a baby and that's a baby\nIntentionally and killed and that baby didn't die right away I Survived for about twenty four hours and then died\nAnd this just looks like it's in the woods\nYeah they're out in the jungle and these people have nothing and the ... still wants to attack them and take more from them and\nSo every time I go there every time the ... shows up\nWe're stopping that from happening and I'll tell you I'll tell you a quick story back in back in may I was there and I can't I Can't divulge exactly what we were exactly the idea for security operations exactly what was happening\nSuffice it to say we save a lot of people's lives\nAnd a villager who had been pushed out of his home by the arm army him in his family have fled the Burma Army and they and they had built they built a a a new hot out in the ... out in the jungle in the middle of nowhere um\nHe he heard that the ... fund was there and he came and found me and said hey I Want to I Want to I Want to thank you please come to my house for dinner tonight so they get me on a motorcycle and I drive at this man's house in the middle of nowhere\nWhen I get in there his wife is cooking pigs that for me to eat because that's the big fat and rice and ... and ... and so we're sitting there and he's like hey I I when I was like I Wish I had more to give you a he's like this is all I have for a snack and he pulls out a bag and it's literally tree bark it's bark from a tree\nAnd he's like this is all we have a snack on while my wife prepares food and he gave me\nTree bark to eat I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark with this guy and he has nothing had literally nothing and she wanted to give me ...\nBecause that was the best that he had and so I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark with this man and\nI I was I was so overcome was just like I ... his gratitude is the level of gratitude he showed for us for that for the ... being there it was it was unbelievable it was so touching and then later on as I was leaving as I was leaving the jungle another man barely speak any English\nUm he's um I'm On a motorcycle and he's driving me out of the jungle and he ... he as he's driving he turns me he says thank you and I said oh like oh good English or what I'm trying to pin him and talk more about um [noise] um\nI'm about what what use more English and so I was like oh like what what do you what are you grateful for what do you know and he's like is that this is amazing he said thank you for giving my people hope [laughter]\nThat's what he says to me this kid who's maybe Nineteen years old they know nothing but slaughter and ... and he's terrible things but\nWe're there to bring help and we're there to bring help and it's it's an honor to be there it's an honor to represent the ... it's an honor to do what I Do every time we go out we save people's lives and it's it's it's an incredible thing that we keep things like like those photos that you're looking at you can't even show them\nWe keep the ... happening or in on\nIt doesn't become real to people until they see it and then you don't want to show it\nBecause it's it's awful it's awful it's horrifying mhm um\nI don't know what to do with them ah I think I think I'm not sure but I think we have them on than as a marine fund dot org if people want to go over there and see first hand like what's happening I I Believe they're up there if they're not and make sure that they get on there today they're over\nThere yeah don't go for um you know if you if you um I mean it's a it's their children and the baby and it's not pretty um but if you are if it will help you wake up to what's happening\nIf it will help you wake someone else up then I'm pleased go but we would sure who we're sure appreciate your help um the misery and fund has turned into this global thing

Warren thing is is interesting because you can be running for president it's a day or two story um I think it's at this point I'm I'm done with it but it was interesting to see her I mean a real flop here but we're talking about when the all time political flops yes she's tried\nShe can get ahead of this or again it is a ... it's an important political story for somebody who is going to run for president there but really with Saudi Arabia [noise] going on right now with\nThat and what that possibly means should we take a pause and we'll get some of the stock market anybody know why yeah
