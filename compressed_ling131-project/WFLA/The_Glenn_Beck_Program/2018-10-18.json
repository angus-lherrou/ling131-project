I think he just he contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff member of the Washington Post columnist was any or he's written it's relatively new yeah because he had left there was a lot of problems over there\nHe realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness what's going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new and you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... first of all places in the American media that is just straight like I'm In Portland that we are able to air those things\nAre but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them and people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven was the one he's made like he's tried to capitalize on that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now\nBut they're in it and I live in the first one the biggest a political documentary of all time up\nIn that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like fifty you'd rather go all out and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven um right so this is not a new\nAccusation and when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with them for very long time and it's something that we've been critical about for the business\nOur allies since Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to the FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been\nA\nFriendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but\nBrickell bomber was plenty friendly with them to exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there was no way that Brock Obama would've done anything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point no longer and it wouldn't have done anything about this it's a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of\nMedia coverage today the difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker\nWho is expensive right I mean remember good I'm bringing in Fahrenheit nine eleven again the big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the\nRoom remember this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time\nYou know like what they saw Bush as the bad guy who who was who's incompetent Brock Obama waited what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything\nAnd it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years a sense of what we are living there was this decision you made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get worse criminal on earth ah what is is a tough decision and in the minds of people who want to praise the decision\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risking their mission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military member especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason they got into it yeah I mean you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options and and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump\nYou know that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on let's investigate this before we act irrationally\nIf for rock Obama was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's not being reactionary with Trump it that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just the you know\nThe ... the the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who is a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's ... or Donald Trump but ... you know CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC certainly on this board and and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is our this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nA potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your bones ... something happened there ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't fair and more of a story here maybe that's the story run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIs it the story now much more about the details of the incidents are and what happened there were still in that age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now um Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nUh\nActually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ...\nUm Saudi Arabia publicly pledged the payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into oh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paid us a hundred million dollars\nOf course there are always paying a hundred million dollars [laughter] relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that is kinda I mean look at it it's not completely in significant to the relationship right I mean that there there are these considerations\nAnd that is why when you're making a decision of the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do\nRight like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day of American interests are harmed long term\nI'm by a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority for top priority is not a ... murders in Turkey right like the you know I don't know if anybody knows this but we ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to talk to some degree anymore so studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things\nAll over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a journalist or a columnist is a big part of the reason why are you know I think the media care so much about it\nAnd they're prioritizing over you know some slaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia\nRight like it's this is you know this is a a journalist that they knew that was from a you know that wound up working for an American newspaper\nSo it's a big story and and the details rounded are so crazy like such a twenty four storyline that I can understand why it captures the interest but it being patient and making sure you understand the actual facts of the situation before you act is not a negative and there's a lot at stake here a lot at stake\nI mean if you if you just start willy nilly throwing on sanctions on Saudi Arabia they're going to retaliate and it's it's going to cost a not us as much but the rest of the world is going to suffer in oil I that that's

Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment on how to remove a Supreme Court justice ... are just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when there was no ...\nAnd no evidence yeah and you know wow first of all I think once we get past this election\nThat Brett Kavanaugh stuff is going to die down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time you see ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't hear he occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story\nYou know the those debates still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest hate Brett Kavanaugh\nBut I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations it was always about the the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court because they thought they had a chance of winning the Senate and could block the block the next justice and maybe they wouldn't have to deal with another conservative on the court\nWould that was one hundred percent of it for every ... every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and certainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was definitely part of her calculus there [noise] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story\nWe don't know um but\nThe other people in Cory Booker do not care for one second about what happened to this one not it's not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him so you could call themselves Spartacus or and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty candidate\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all\nUm and yeah and it's and and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it\nWhich is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and and again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but if you're judging by the standards that they're putting up\nIt's totally different ... let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating after I think of how recent is Brett Kavanaugh thing was an ... story back in your mind for a moment\nAbout what we were trying to find\nThat Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people are they were there none of those people say that they remember this this incident\nUh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there is no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she went back what happened what mine of it it happened right none of it right [noise] um and we were basically the insinuation from the media was\nIf let's say one of the witnesses she named instead came out and said yeah I remember that party I remember hearing really shook up and she left and and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know very distant and I I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on or something like that just one person\nSaying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident which just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party occurred yeah none of the incident happened just at the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of late talking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this uh Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he's she said no I'm not going to tell my story so she had an opportunity to go down this president did ... did not decide to do so\nShe lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth in Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president\nShe told the story because she thought she was getting like perjury charges or something against or five people said ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred wow so not while for one person who is at the hotel or at the party in the cabinet case\nShe had five people that she told about the rape immediately after it occurred or a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick with a bloody lip and torn panty hose in their shared hotel room\nBroderick explained that Clinton had just raped her Clinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband then her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days of the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape and that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel the Camelot and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar\nShe also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked for rape is like a by the way I'm going to renovate that was another ... ...\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended newspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred\nThere was a prison outside the hotel window wow that is ... times the amount of even alleged evidence yeah that occurred with ah with Dr Ford and\nBrett Kavanaugh and yet that was ignored for ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats\nAnd now yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment that only happens now after they never want to hear or either one of their uh stories ever again\nTo them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump and that's why they have no more used for them\nBut I mean Bill Clinton goes on and still makes a big levels speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there it's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so\nBizarre and the fact that they that the media actually thinks we should take their current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when your report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system\nWith actual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened I mean that is what that is the system we have it's the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we are now supposed to go through these kinds of records and and even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it\nIs now or standard that didn't sanity it's insanity\nAnd yet you have Hillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh and defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband\nI learned from that I Will never forget that\nAmazing that the\n[noise] when you want me to do\nHard radios nine seven WFL

should be allowed back on stage ever ever\nUm well you did things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah and that and they said yes at odd part of this dug up with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him and doing something\nThat against the the motives will write like he would ask they say yes or or um there was one case where\nUm he\nAgain like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure in himself while on the phone with her because I guess he was breathing heavy or something\nAnd ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics our dynamic absolutely yeah the power to make you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian he's in ... he wields incredible power right in this country now mine credit ...\nFired at any job in the nation and giving any job you're a sarcasm is just reality and the situation that they're kind of like well why is that what they were saying they're saying they show it some of them\nPeople were other comedians and one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian\nEr and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there is something invited her back to his trailer to do his thing in front of her which apparently was because this is ... ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife and a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nAnd that's the center of the allegation that he didn't\nDo it in force or to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation ... learn to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously icky\nYeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I've I've issues I'm Sorry say that is is that sexual assault and the accusation there are no matter what show which she answered\nA diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievable you know so I ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right man he admitted in such a general way that people kind of\nA make it easier well he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make the make them right and I think\nThat what I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing however the crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no and and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible but that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's not evidence that he did this to anyone\nSo it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again just making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was supposed to scares away from right you're not supposed to just as the other people will commit crimes in the future\nAnd listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar is famous New York comedy club like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedian you never heard of they're probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks in it doesn't set or Jerry Seinfeld comes into all things that are loosely gay woman and it doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he bounced around to several clubs around New York since and they let them under the age so the New York times of the ... report about try to talk to the club owner about why you let him on stage\nThis is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision listen\nAll the people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy said he's a comedian and like okay when do you think he could come work that he's like never mhm might never say never\nSay well can you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence that never work again he says I don't care never this is an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as you\nAs the left has made forever that people who go in felons you'll be able to come back and vote you should be we they have programs to give felons in convicted felons and murderers jobs yet but when someone's accused of something much less than murder they can never work again and not even convicted just accused of ... yeah it really doesn't make any sense\nDribbling

I certainly know them\nAnd they were against Kavanaugh because they believed or you know Dr Ford ... ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially and everything that they're saying which is they accuse us of believing\nForward\nIn a roundabout sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want him on the Supreme Court and like no right well no thing is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want them on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... ... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over that line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her is your prerogative but you don't accuse me of of bull of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I I think I don't think it happened\nYeah I don't either and they haven't even I think it happened with somebody else\nMaybe but even that is is this is a\nI don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't there but the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens with any big public official or in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades\nThen talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who were there and they can't remember the party like\nWater we and the person who's making the accusation has an overt uh dislike\nFor the party of the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist is march that women's march rallies as as an obvious Democrat like\nYou have to take in that motivation forty years later into account\nI always started skepticism I had this idea that basically I think people almost it's like it's going to sound bizarre\nBut I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of seeing about it yeah I Know I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you die and leave the survivors no no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor that indicate that this is this the vets occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the events occurred I Would never call the victim I called them survivor but then I wouldn't they Levi ...\nSurvived this assault by this man\nYeah but if the salt didn't happened they didn't survive and [laughter] yeah I guess we can all call ourselves survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us so far life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... a million things are possible what you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make\nIt up why would she lie about it\nThat's a good question because I Love this one mhm possibly could lose your motivation [laughter]\nWhether they should like this I don't know when I taught at school we talk\nAbout uh yeah I Know we talk about the the women's right to choose it is to fend\nDid as if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one I wouldn't defend my children's lives about as strongly as they would they defend their right to kill their children hit is the most important thing in the universe to how many millions of Americans\nThe idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy who you think is going to overturn that right that you think is so vital is insane we seemed far crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week were five five\nAccusers accused the high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him yeah\nWe have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle on receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against the being anti gay\nThis happens all the time you know why people are horrible many of them are awful their women are awful men are awful they do terrible things that you can explain it happens all the time\nAnd the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing a swastika on their door for nothing you can like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot one of the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused which they can do we know for a fact the fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them\nWe know the ... the fourth accuser didn't even bother to write any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or what had happened we know that the third accuser went to Michael ... and no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusations we're littered all over the store\nAnd the only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats were the first to\nAnd and in the second one is it is that there's a ... they're writing when they the person who made the allegation\nSaid I I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them\nAll right well I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate the person and that person said no it didn't happen\nAnd she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember it even happened exactly the failed to act\nOn sounding corroborating evidence on that one either and there's and look the Ford won was only ... I think taken more seriously than the others because there was an obvious\nPerson saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people there was no evidence proving that had happened here\nIn and of course obviously people like have it on his uh his are witnesses were saying no um\nBut that one was serious because she went in to you know took the step of going in front of the of the hearing and and and doing it relatively credible job recounting what she believed the story\nWas who knows if it was true or if it was completely felt fall the idea that you can't pull one percent of the United states who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation against someone but it's completely false it's just an eight yeah of course you can do it I mean that as we heard with Hillary Clinton\nShe said there was a vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this like the media access if it's entirely foreign world where someone could lie about politics [laughter]\nI Know of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five cases and probably and all of them\nAnd you brought up to high school situation in California where they called the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accused is one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault\nAnd they they asked the first accuser uh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault\nA and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk\nI don't like to look at him I just don't like him that's why they accused him credit didn't like him to really encourage\nOr how about the Ohio University student who ah got threatening notes about how they didn't want her in her\nG peachy lifestyle to them to be in the students' Senate anymore at Ohio University\nUh she was a angry and frustrated and disappointed she said I'm a shoe you may find my me revolting and worthy of a threat of my life but in reality it's your beliefs that a repulsive you need to get this through your head you F ing a whole I Am proud to be who I Am and nothing could say or do or ever change that\nBy the way they should of course admitted to sending the threats to herself ... uh or the woman\nThis school none of that\nVery bizarre
