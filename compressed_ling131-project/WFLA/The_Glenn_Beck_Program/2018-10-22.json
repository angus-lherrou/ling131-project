smoked two thousand ten or you had a sixty six percent Republican\nA percentage of people who are really interesting the election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked\nUm you said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to\nI Would say Brett Kavanaugh you had the same type of thing playing out again\nThis time in favor of the Democrats started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... since ... that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance\nOf very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight would be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are at Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two thousand six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nHow relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican law in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if they were able to sweep all of the races there favored in\n... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happened the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place and whenever the down by five in the polls they'll want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that than losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans move the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way they're these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power gonna have subpoena power are going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from\nUm you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation of [noise] [noise] yeah well we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again I just that is one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance that this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all taught supper and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the cabinet thing now I mean I think it's a real ... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling\nAt the ... there is an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten where\nAt fifty percent independents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest then partisans because partisans engage more like generally I'm the type of course a blanket role but it's typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until ... when I was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because they're overwhelmed with it and they don't they don't like either side and then they just want it makes them want to withdraw from\nPalo yeah but I Wonder 'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know with that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent Jim I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independence that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever be ... that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes ah people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in ... or\n... one could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent ...\nYeah I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything or they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting boost outta here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\nWhat which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen was forty one percent very low or in two thousand or Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October two thousand ... Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while they were not as high as in two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that with a wave election for Democrats [noise]\nOnly thing I can think of is the Guatemala\nInsights is the new one on the U.S campus we're\nGoing to have a new location at University of South Florida and the ... center really excited about it you know there's about sixty thousand people a day that impacted by that camp and it's going to give us a great opportunity and of course anybody in Hillsborough County can come vote at that site also\nEarly voting also begins in Pinellas County the early voting sites will be open from seven AM until seven PM through November fourth election day is November six\n[noise] migrants caravan growing that story ahead versus get an update on the roads here's daisy ash\nFrom the train traffic center power like climate design less than I force from us three in one end to just less that Dr King and pushing fifty feet when it crashed maybe blocking the left lane ...

Crist Franklin or top story at ten o'clock Florida's top candidates for governor faced off on national TV last night during a debate on CNN Democrat Andrew Gillum and Republican Ron dissenters argued over President Trump the future of Florida's economy and experience\nUm as far right as they come on the right versus left continuum but it's very important to remember that the purpose of politics is to maintain a framework for ordered liberty so that you can go live in the communities of love where you're actually raising your kids and built limit\nOur mouse trap or ... or where your worship bank because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics is in the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left\nThey are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are they're anti constitution\nSo you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics but at what point do you see good people say enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end what what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did or to Nancy Pelosi in California one hundred centigrade aware does did to Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao in Kentucky Zach latter day because there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up and violence\nAnd this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do but screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off the table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually have\nPersuasion as any goal the the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch headstrong pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book that different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta and taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... of phenomenon is really\nBuilt for short term media collapse that is what they're doing that I'm In\nI'm In the middle of a little downtown sort of ... restored downtown in Omaha right now and ah there's no end to fire here and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media college in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that many ... basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but\nIt was shared content ...\nThere was an American way when you fall with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two\nThey're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world\nIs so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignored them\n[noise] so what is our\nOur we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our even our own them\nSo yes ... a ... I'm Out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest\nAll of those things flow from the fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans\nWhich is we believe Margot day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with eternal souls and with dignity that way\nBigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there\nIt's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest and statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers\nDo you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do\nIf those four things are true or even if three of the four true\nYou're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less\nAnd so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work um ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about with deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this a and a year looking over the horizon and we want to talk about that we're talking to Ben Sasse\nHis new book is

often the leadership I'm Talking to an average every person who votes they just know\nWhat's happening now isn't working that's why people listen to me when I should talk I talk about ways of making people better I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life\nLiberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about this I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness sorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there there are many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal I'd hang of it before it surely start let's start with me I should go into education absolutely on them when talking about getting rid of all of a centralized testing prior to high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because they're testing is unfair way of getting teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well ... and there's no indication of success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons is family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests and feel stupid and to be some become successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined way you should go where your book liberties are not a bad idea but ten years old why it is to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do know that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and it was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really wasn't a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information ... ... they really do anything ... somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read write survive in the world\nWithout at at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school districts did a good job somehow that worked\nOut of the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nAnd they give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some localized central and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready to analyze testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not in the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here when we lose at four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings\nWhich means administrators go away and then it shows while riding granted measures were checking boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why\nRegulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one saying these things because I crossed the entire state might say that the the two counties across all if you to get the full sharply by the way\nFor you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminishing makes over a hundred and fifty ... you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done\nWhy in the world we have K. through twelve ... K through ten the last two years of high school for too many kids\nIs Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirty eighth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college was terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we used to say\nI Wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one uh ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is will be able to show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system that I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey gotta has a plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally and the lie is\nThe only way to have success in this country is they got a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind the desk and it for a new computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen let's not make some decisions if I think called you right for me I go to a two year ... to ... is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years\nAnd take advantage of internships are incubator life is good I don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid\nWho you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who goes back to the gate not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nDown okay yeah so um so that kid who's really smart that could take the SAT right away and goes off and get to a degree why should they be bored in school and they should be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things now worries go to a two year trade school\nGo to trace could become a plumber carp and do whatever you want to be a mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I Love my ... year old I'm fifty a ... year old\nMy problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough in New York City doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that go get a job why not go learn to work work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people in my generation if they do go work learn what it means to have a boss\nLearned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nAllow it sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelve right I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here you're sixteen you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use good luck\nHis ... his wife ... going to happen\nA bunch of cool prep schools will pop up a bunch of great trade schools will pop up guess how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars ... going to say well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what bank love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will absolute give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere's the best part when these schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year for the last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each\nTwelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders is more than four billion dollars we saved all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers\nA ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIs the norm and we put up against this Web against is constantly and here's the the worst part with all of this we're still growing and they're still going down that's that's that but they don't they don't they don't realize that when I was thinking ship mhm or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate how they're doing\nLottery shop
