out of here a rest in peace Twenty one years since John Denver passed away this day in Nineteen Ninety seven next week on Monday guess who's going to be in town to discuss the me too movement and time's up\nNone other than Monica Lewinsky really that's interesting\nYes I actually do want to go check that out if I can get immediate past that I'm very interested in you know with the climate today what would you do and you want to go\nOr you know like a three I Want to remind what my wife would love to meet Monica Lewinsky for some reason she loves her if I bring her a blue dress thinks you'll see in a\nFour mile ... oh my gosh I Will do what do you want like well what do you want I'll go on the ride along or what do you want [laughter] and I'm not I'm not going to need somebody is here too\nSo we can go see what I'm just so excited to be said sign up for me 'cause I thought that was going to vary\nDirection [laughter] gross now just seriously like let's\nJust try to imagine this imagined Jeff ... walking up to Monica Lewinsky Ibota go with a blue dress and a sharp in\nOrder to know that's one thing right but think about where he'll be thinking about who else will be there I think about the atmosphere we may actually see him get murdered by a battered women have\nTo chase me down for the I'm always getting the right way to do that before the women who have visual\nBy love time's up stitched on the back of the uh the blue dress 'em man just your ideas fantastic uh Kanye West at the oval office yesterday entertaining and a lot of reaction this morning let's go to Steven taboos been waiting for a while the morning Steve [noise]\nAh ... he put me on hold an hour ago you'd barely finishes unfair\nOr knew who it was like what's up man I'm short version when they uh the thirteenth amendment was passed a slaves were\nGenerally property that were very well maintained and repair 'em and afterwards they were considered more public property and not human beings and nuts and not civilians and therefore they were generally whip lash and beating much more that period was called ... and back from\nThe European they basically they were slaves flavor under slavery under a different name\nI have a feeling that you're talking about there was a story on this I don't watch TV as much as I got a good one on that one\nYeah and and we're all and thank you for the call it's hard to decipher what tiny was talking about because he did he talk there was a range of issues and topics that he hit on\nIt that I mean as somebody who's been in a situation where you do you get a little nervous when you have to deal with a lot of people like that the entire country watching you I think he had a lot of things to say not a lot of time to say it he had the president's ear and he was just throwing it all out\nThere that's just ... he just says whatever comes to mind is just like rap rapid fire just says whatever\nYou know when he found it though right ... never this time of the ...\nI think about it I mean you got to he favorite line where is that going\nHe had the president's ear yesterday for ten minutes say what you want about the ... and the craziness of Kanye West but he does have the president's attention and that could lead to making a difference\nI'm saddened that we got to the very end of the ... show before I thought of this but like what would you say if you're at ten minutes of the president's ear I have no idea I could've been a great show I have no idea we could have had a great Joe\nIt's really easy listen the formula to being having Trump's support you and having Trump be a fan of you it's pretty simple complement him no airport um is the president the United states and you'll have your back\nBut you and I can complement him all day we don't get ten minutes yeah I'm not going to the\nPoint is um he is willing to play ball if you're willing to support him back him up and I don't mind that so I Wonder what they said this building and boy I'll build the wall\nI Will be ... and I will be you\nKnow I mean seriously he had to say something that everybody that Trump supports you hear them say amazing things about him in public and they have a they back him up a hundred percent that's the way to get ... Donald Trump to support that we have a what do that I'm not see\nAnd that's and you know what that's a great question too 'cause Adam putting them from the beginning was a huge supporter of Donald Trump or will plenty of more next week when we get into 'em I'm sure when Jack comes back will have some fun with Kanye West jak we'll be back at some point next week pat ... sitting in for Jeff ... offer Katie between Oprah myself Aaron Jacobs and have a great weekend\nS M A s\nOff to see the world so it's such a very words is limited\nThe international pronouns day website explains referring to people by the pronouns they determine for themselves is basic human dignity you know [laughter]\nI Am a I Am a one wing purple dragon and you will referred to me as that from Iran now from here on out

really kind of guy in my life and then I read something\nLike this and all I can think of is shut up shut up [noise]\nSo I Apologize in advance for even thinking that oh boy I Hope I'm not the platform and oh my oh geez if\nGoogle could just start installing FM our eyes in all of our devices they would be able to read our minds and be able to see who is good and bad and who should be the platform in silence didn't quite quite frankly perhaps liquidated\nNow or the director of the ethical college L G be T I don't know if you're a cue and I how you feel about this place but the the L G Beatty center says this holiday is not just important it is required\nIt is required that we all call people by the pronouns they wish to use\nTo confer basic dignity and respect so compelled speech we're no longer in to freedom of speech you can't speak your mind but if you don't speak someone else's mind hostility pasta\nOh my gosh yes I Am just appropriated both Mexico and Italy for a minute all\nIt is required now so\nI don't know if this holiday comes with a handy pronoun guide but it should never be written down on paper because it is going to change every single day impossible for those of us who are stuck in a hidden she were a ... year no show ... years\nSay a man he's a man or woman\nOr shorter church who are in danger is ... is that right\nNo international pronouns day make

who is with us today\nI was thinking\nThat you just get his name right I don't know any more oh it did happen I think that I don't know any more major day yeah right that we're right at this point he screwed it up so many times I don't know what I Want to sound mind yet now you know the world I live here but I get it right [laughter] Glen is the one who gets it wrong\nYou know I've known him for five years with my name what\nWhat's the name I don't know [laughter] you're either [laughter] sorry Jason is a Jason's\nOur guy who ah you know ah it's kind of a wannabe spook and that is can I say that any more oh my gosh my apologies to\nActual Halloween spook ... and to the CIA I Apologize I so I'm Jason is a guy who watches ah international affairs for us and I am fascinated by this story of ... a from a from Saudi Arabia\nOr and I want you to bring me I Want you to bring me the news that no one in the news is reporting on this but let me bring everybody up to speed if you haven't been following this guy in a nutshell he worked for the Washington Post he's a revered revered reporter which makes me ... suspicious immediately\nBut he's a revered ... a a reporter Washington Post he is a Saudi citizen\nHe was over in Turkey he's going to get married and so he's like I Need my divorce papers from the embassy\nAnd so he goes over to the Saudi embassy he tells his fiance weight in the car I'll be right back she waits right in front of the embassy hours and hours and hours going by she's calling his phone no answer on his phone he's not coming out she calls the embassy and they say oh\nNo he left he left just the oh he came here and we gave him the papers and he went and she's like I've been sitting outside oh not sure if he went out bill did he go out the front door yes so\nBill and the other guy mock moods says yes he went out the front door well CCTV cameras show that he didn't ever leave the Saudi embassy at least by the front door\nSo [noise] the next thing we find out this was yesterday as the Saudis are the Saudi prince lands of gulfstream his gulfstream ... at the airport there I'm In turkey\nAbout an hour or so after the guy goes into the into the embassy\nThese guys get off the plane with what appeared to be a lot of empty suitcases they piled up in the back of the vans they're driving to the embassy they decide for some reason or another they need more empty suitcases they buy some more empty suitcases\nThey also stop just a real quick you know I don't know maybe the chef needed at the embassy but they needed a bone saw [laughter]\nBy your bones saw Oh thank you so much now we can have soup and uh so they get the ball and saw\nGod only knows what they do in the embassy but they're seen leaving about an hour later with really heavy suitcases they throw them in the back of the van they throw them on the jet and the jet takes off\nUnited States says we do have a we do have a an encrypted a messages showing that the Saudi prince was trying to in trapping more tried to trap him and get him into the embassy or get him back to Saudi Arabia\nOr and today and I don't know if I Believe this because it's turkey but turkey says that they have either given to the United states or show\nUnited States this video and audio they say they have surveillance in the embassy of him being questioned\nAnd then tortured and then murdered we don't know if that is true but that's the latest today so ... we're going to find out\nWho this guy is and was possibly ah when we come back because this is the part of this story no one\nSurely CNN and Christiana on a poor would want you to have this information will give that to your next [noise]\nLet me tell you about our Palm Beach letter taken to Ari is cryptic course Ninety seven percent of the people who take his crypto course give it a four or five star rating and these are people that range from you know people like me I didn't get into crypto currency hum at all because I thought\nHave you want to see the place where the next ah Arab Spring might happen Saudi Arabia the the demographics point to it I Would not be surprised right all so how do you keep Saudi Arabia under control though without a thug\nYou can't ... I mean it's like Russia really either right groups like countries like that you really can't here's a disturbing part ... most likely most likely this guy was killed by Saudi Arabia yeah um it just it just feels like a man and maybe all of a sudden he pops up and I'm like\nNo I was a chick fillet and nobody in the news media wants to look at chick fillet so I was invisible for a while\nMaybe doubtful here's the problem we are ... we are pushing through a major arms deal with Saudi Arabia we should not be doing that now we should not be doing that that should it be canceled today I can tell you however what is being what is happening is\nYou know the United states was supporting the Muslim Brotherhood now we have some people who know exactly what's going on in that part of the world and they're probably being talked to by Saudi Arabia go and look look guys guys\nYeah I Know you don't like what we're doing here but ah it's the Muslim Brotherhood and its a caliphate you what you want the whole region to be in the Muslim Brotherhood caliphate\nHave at it yeah and that's the decision our president is is having to make it's why we should stay out of other people's businesses and stay out of their business\nCan I make a production yeah so I think that Saudi Arabia will eventually own up to this because I think the evidence will come after them I think they'll they'll blame of very familiar a photo and they'll say it's the deep state the beach they did this no shelter salmon get him out of their [noise]\nWay you want me to no\nHigh hard radios nine WFL a good morning

yeah and the the photos coming back of her were beautiful I mean it was a Ralph Lauren photo spread and all the press could do was if\nThey published any of those photos\nOr they just tore her down for colonialism and all this crap alone I Know uh and then I came here she is where the hang on the most beautiful woman\nIn the oval office with the with the greatest style since Jackie oh they love Camelot and her style she was on the cover of every fashion magazine\nBut no fashion magazine we'll put millennia Trump on\nYou know of course a few minutes and they couldn't go out\nTo their cocktail parties and all that it it it there you do your commentary on the political correct ... percent but back in ... you left out some really big things could never have happened without the ... in support of the media\nYes I play the media hinted at eight percent correct\nAs hey let me just tell you a quick story okay All right so this week I've been doing a lot of a promotion for killing the ss which came out on Tuesday\nAnd in that promotion I'm basically saying\nThat we in America are seeing a rise of hate an evil and I tie it in a number of ways one of the ways that I tied it in was that George Soros at his crew have bought up about twenty packs political action committees\nAnd they sent they send them out on missions and one of those missions was Senator Flake in the elevator with the CNN camera right behind a woman's screaming at him\nA because she was a victim of something and he was an idiot for not the siding with her who's the woman the woman is an activist and the Soros pack making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year [noise] All right so I tell that story which is a tire early accurate a hundred percent correct\nAnd media matters within a half an hour says that I compared the woman to the third Reich okay\nNow that's what's going on here that that's what's in play so the eight percent progressive zealots fanatics couldn't never\nHaving pose any thing on this country without the media taking up their cause and actually doing the dirty work\nI put the media in that eight percent it's the it is the reason why it has swept the country it is you're right because of the media but they are part of that eight percent\nLook what happened and Kanye West my favorite guy of all time\nOkay yeah so Kanye West who I I I didn't really made him I was an elevator with him at Madison Square garden went around me I'd short pants on and he was brooding right okay\nSo he goes on Saturday Night live which has staked out territory to destroy Donald Trump because it's good for Saturday Night lives ratings that's why they do it\nAll right so ... goes gets invited to go anywhere is to make America great again hat and and no one likes him and he ... he's he's brooding again 'cause he's being bullied by Saturday Night live okay fine um then\nBecause of that Trump invites them to the oval office work ... walks in with the hat and and uh does little motto if the president or whatever they\nDid mhm okay now why does anyone care\n[laughter] thank you for sale CNN on his whole day yeah I Know he's talking about what do you want\nI Kanye West right now Taylor Swift she comes out against Trump All right and she's told everybody in Tennessee I\nFound it gets them so Taylor Swift and Kanye West do I care what they think about geopolitics in any regard back\nThe answer is no I don't no one else does either this is a tremendous example of political correctness that tiny tiny it was just going against the PC so he must be vilified\nSo I Want to go I Want to I Want to come back because you I Need to you maybe you should get a cup of coffee in or something I Need you to\nGet a little a little more animated here ... uh but when we when we come back I Want to ask you about because you follow ratings\nThe ratings are falling apart let's look at the numbers of you know from like Beto uh and and others that are running in the Senate the numbers seem to be falling apart I think that there is a change a foot and the Democrats don't see it\nAnd when they get their head handed to them or by the people I think they're going to double down yet again we'll get Bill O'Reilly's comment on that coming up and just a second Bill O'Reilly from Bill O'Reilly dot com his new book is out it is a killing the\nS. S. and it is really good it's worth or read a pick it up and uh and read it is really really good [noise] alright zipper critter\nZipper critter is smart technology and um it is it's really brilliant what they've done they have a really brilliant CEO a and he's a high tech guy and it's you know when when separate could it first came out it was a way for you to not have to have an H R department or you\nCould you could post a job on all of the different websites well since that point a separate critter has become the number one website\nSo now they not only post everything there but they have all of this internal data\nAnd they really listen to the smart technology really tries to find out exactly what you're ... or what you're looking for so if if you have you know a big job open up and you know PR director or whatever it is\nYou don't mind finding you know seeing the right person if they're in California and you're in New York but if you're you know a Starbucks and you're looking for a brief\nYou don't care that you know you're in New York in somebody's in Santa Monica you need the person right across the street\nSo they don't just dump every body or onto your onto your plate\nI'll add one more to that I lost my faith that day to go and um I had\nGone to church five days a week during the week and every Sunday uh September he's twenty seven team was the last night I went to church um\nIn the day and it's been through a long time going back and forth with Fox with lawyers trying to figure out where it's going to go forward what was going to happen and we we came upon an idea that we're in a separate separating from Fox they said the amicably separates\nAnd bowling and Fox are ethnically separating [noise] um and I looked at it on that day as a as a new beginning\nGo start and go find another job somewhere and life's going to be great and you're going to sue\nI didn't know what it was going to do and Clinton I I Will tell you that I ate whatever\nWas written about me was false patently false and it was a lie it never happened in ... no one has ever ever come forward it was all anonymous sourcing\nBig long story short my lawyer said it's probably time to just cut ties with Fox and move on to go find another job this could just go on forever and ... like there was going to be my family is going to be dragged through the mine for a long time so I decided that that was the thing to do we cut ties around three o'clock in the afternoon it was a friday before long weekend\nFor Labor Day uh I took my wife out to dinner that night\nAnd we're celebrating the owner of the restaurant came over and say hey you know congratulations new start and then I drink on the way home [noise] we got the call or we're driving home\nAnd look look my phone rang it was a young man on the other side of the fallen sang miserable and call\nYour son call Eric right away so what's wrong is just cleric right away I called over there and I'm a girl answered and her name is Kayla he had been seeing her on and off she was crying and for some reason I just went right to um\nIs he alive [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] she said no [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] that that was a that was a rough day the next state went to Colorado\n[noise] and ah the president called me as anything we can do for you I said no thank you [noise]\nUm but at that day I realized that he cared and I'm so for the next few months I made it my mission to create awareness around a opioids American or what his antics\nOn campus [noise] [noise]\n[noise] and I always ... ... so yeah so that was that day [noise]\nUh and so now we are a year in two days after\nThat and it's been rough tell\nYou we can stop at any time if you don't want to talk about anything so um [noise] I think it's just important story to tell 'em when you said is he alive\nWhy we're there indications or was it just a bad feelings of feeling of who gets called ten thirty at night and it's told the call your son right away without explaining why I had\nA hunch and sure enough knowledge turned out to be true so I'm\nSure is out he was a he bought his antics on campus that was laced with fat no it wasn't a prescriptive ... she didn't know he passed it was an accidental overdose\n[noise] um so the question you asked me was I going to sue Fox I at that moment I had no flight need to do anything [noise] so um we spent my wife and I just got very close we spent the better part of the next year\nJust talking to other parents talking or any opportunity we could um do you get the word out that it's an epidemic excuse me and a and a ... parents need to know that that their children are at risk and it's a it's a a\nMassive epidemic in the in the country young kids need to know that one pill can kill you and that and sure you're ever taking [noise] the parents need to know that your child isn't too smart to popular to athletic to be exposed to potentially dying from an overdose it's a\nVery emotional and I think important um interview there\nThere are places that I Want to go and Eric has promised to come back but I didn't want to dog pile we recorded this on uh September I think ten of\n'em and it was just a few days after the one year anniversary and he was very very very raw um it's the first time that he is really spoken out about it um and what his thoughts are and I think everybody\nNo matter what side you're on the opioid thing I mean I I um I got an emotional whole yesterday from somebody on the TV show that said thank you for speaking up for opioids because there are those of us who\nWe cannot live without them we can't do this woman said because of her disease she can't even sit up in bed and she's bed ridden without the opioid there are you know\nAll of these things they're double edged swords they're they're good when they're used properly and they are\nDeadly when they are abused and uh it's up to each of us uh

R. T. V. thing but he's doing a two hours of for us every day to if anybody if they don't know who you are explain who you are [noise]\nI I think you know we have a slightly different way of doing things uh than what you were probably typically here in conservative talk radio a wine is we're mindful of the things we're actually trying to conserve is kind of nowadays conservative means I'm not a communist [laughter]\nThat that are just moving in with pat when you say the second best when we did have had it he's number one and in space by our space butter space by your\nNumber two [laughter] how moving that I understand why this is why he is a genius [laughter] do\nYou know I we actually talked about the things we're trying to conserve the values and virtues that made America exceptional and where they came from in the first place it we we like to start arguments even more than we like to win them ah because we think that one of the big problems in our country you know there's this idea that we're really divided and were arguing all the time because we're not arguing at all\nWhat we're doing is we're grabbing Seventeen burner accounts on social media calling each other anonymous names\nAre returning to the uh uh the fart factory of of the the smell that we prefer of our own tribe and uh and didn't never retreat from our own native sweat lodge convince for right about absolutely everything over lobbing verbal bombs and our neighbor over there we never talk to and we're calling that an argument okay\nI I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out\nAh you know I kind of I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend and I am perfectly fine having a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them myself I had doctor or a diver so ah in Studio this weekend or this last week\nUm we had Dave Ruben who else a stew here recently Michael wrecking walled that Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter and we don't agree on everything mhm but I'm looking for the people who you can't have a conversation with somebody\nWho is who's goal it is to say rights apply to certain people right and not to others is there isn't there a there is a line of who you can have a Congress\nSerious and you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentleman we need to understand the distinction between an opponent and an enemy and liberal in a leftist an opponent is someone who disagrees with you maybe even Vietnam and will do whatever they can within\nThe boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas and the arena of ideas\nIn enemy is somebody who wants to end you an enemy assembly has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with you literally game with you or an office building with you are and then you look at what's the difference between a liberal and a leftist ... you know a liberal is somebody that wants the government to permit you to do things God's says are immoral and dumb\nThis is somebody that wants to government to compel you to do those things\nAnd if you will not do those things that God's says or immoral and dumb than us Erick Erickson likes to say you will be made to care the full course of power of government will be brought down upon me\nAh because you it it's you know resistance as few tile and you're watching this existential transition happening on the left in our culture and we're we're there aren't really too many liberals anymore and the reason why you're struggling to find people to have these conversations with in the media arena where we work is there's not too many of them left\nI think there are though outside outside of the Haiti\nArena I agree that there are you know I see\nPeople people think that I Want to have conversations\nWith you know I Want to your you're going to bring in so and so and they're going to have a conversation with them you can't talk to them no Nancy Pelosi I Can't talk ... she has no interest in she has the auto industry wants to end you want to share a country where the best it's the best thing is\nIs that you could possibly say the most charitable thing on both sides is they just want to win ... so they'll do anything to win\nAnd some of them will go so far as when they leave the room go\nThat guy's got to be stopped um and that's dangerous but that's not who I'm Talking about not I talk about my mom a lot\nBecause she had me at Fifteen she got pregnant with me at fourteen she found out she was pregnant with me Christmas break Nineteen Seventy two and\nWrote the way it happens a month later and she decides not to have an abortion\nAnd so my mom and I literally grew up together and you know I become this Alex peak heat and want to be a kid of the eighties and she's your typical single mom government should do for people what they can't do for themselves you know and and and it has a different view of politics than me and for many years we couldn't talk about politics\nAnd so as I started growing more and conservative media we disagreed we wouldn't bring it up when we got together as a family has gotten away everything funny things happened the last few years they'll guys she's bringing it up now to me and she semi retired now because of medical disability and so she watched a lot of what's on your screens I don't watch any cable news at all or England or I Can't I Can't and\n... do you watch them never except for when I'm On the air that you're there for a new India and unless it's ... hang on just a second I Want\nThe audience to know that's unheard of in our business that that you could not have done this job great without watching cable news you know three years ago\nRight and I mean I keep up on clips that go violence ... feet long form it's just toxic ingestion and that the vast yeah yeah my mom watches a lot more of this she actually likes your show quite a bit actually and he's a brilliant woman but one of the things she came to me one day before the twenty twelve election\nAnd she brought it up she started bringing politics up to me um you know unprovoked and she said you know I was so happy when Brock Obama won in a way that we had shattered the racial ceiling and out of the blue she said to me she goes I I Wonder sometimes when I watched the things he says and he does if he's actually a communist [laughter]\nLet me away while I'm and I watched the way you know my mom is one of those people that is fine whites Obamacare\nThinks that Medicare for all his okay we need to be up to provide things like health care for ... she's not find with if you don't change your religion for the government we shut you down and put you in jail and she's not fight we we get five hundred million dollars a year your money to Planned Parenthood so he's not fine with\nStyles so I've I've recently come to this feeling that we have caused problems of communication\nBecause we have seen Obamacare and we know what the we know those who designed it we know they want single payer health care okay we know that they are socialist that are ... drawing this up\nBut the people who like your mom and the regular people on the on the liberal side on the Democratic side they're not for communism they're not for the end of capitalism they just believe in more welfare they just
