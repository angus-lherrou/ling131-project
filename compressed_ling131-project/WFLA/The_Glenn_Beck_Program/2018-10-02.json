Brett Kavanaugh that he ... through frozen water at someone\nFor the first of all or can it can be heavy um you know what it means people are like oh it's not a big deal so what do you through ice frozen water can be dangerous tell that to the people of Peru work twenty two thousand people were killed in an avalanche in Nineteen Seventy to those people family\nSee this is why he's not on the Supreme Court look at look at his temperament you don't have the temperament to be anywhere near that microphone\nMr ... I Do have the um the temperament to be on the ... the a team however all you know ... I can jump right into that role oh you're dead dogs have that they spent\nGlenn fifth teen minutes on this bar fight on CNN this morning Fifteen minutes where they talked about how they look it's it's certainly on its own isn't there fairness on its own it would not be disqualifying\nOh really a bar fight in which he's not charged or arrested with anything and his the accusation is he threw ice on someone wouldn't disqualify him forty years later for the Supreme Court said for all the wonderful or the room you're giving him what leeway but here's the situation where they're just like what but what it does say\nWhat to say is that it plays into a larger picture of this man he was in his anger when he was drinking and the shows that he's capable of doing these things so if I never met anyone reached further\nI Know if he would have come on and he would not have been angry\nI Would have thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to meet my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges\nAnd smear my name without me at least responding forcefully and then if you don't like the anger I Want you to hear me clearly I did not have sexual relations\nWith that ... yeah he looked and they praised him\nFor being angry about it they praised him for his forceful as\nYou can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the American people so no matter what he did it would have been a problem\n[noise]\nThey keep moving the goalposts\nNow here is here's my plead the Donald Trump\nFirst of all I don't believe any other president in my lifetime with an exception of Reagan and I'm not even sure Reagan would have done it\nNo other president in my lifetime would have struck a stuck with Kavanaugh all the way through those hearings there's no way they would have said that cost is too high\nThey just wouldn't have done it\nSo hey points for Donald Trump for having us fine and go and this is garbage\n[noise] be\n\nWe're in this situation now and if there is nothing if there's ice fights\nDon't give up the ship doom not move\nBecause if you move now they're going to do this every single time and you cannot cannot give any ground\nWithout being sad and I don't think this is a chance at all if Ford\nIs those those charges turn out to be right you noticed you notice the media is not furthering the Ford and testimony\nThey're no longer on that yeah nobody in like a she's been abandoned already right she's done she's done she served her purpose\nShe bought time they used her as a pivot to something new okay\nSo there there there's nothing new there there's nothing new or the press would be saying do you watch what's going to come out and the FBI there they're not saying that they're not nobody has come out and said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was\nAnd I wasn't going to say anything but I Know that that happened none of that is happening\nWhat is happening is people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything but in [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\n[noise] I remember him drinking so that's what's coming now and they're going to go after perjury\nYou watch that it by the end of the week that's what they'll be talking about\n\nIf Donald Trump please please Donald Trump the only chance you have and the only chance the Republicans have if this thing goes awry in any way\n\nYou have to have a plan and announce it in the same press conference that you say\nYou know he he you know quit or vote went downhill went down in ... ran down whatever it is whatever it is whatever it is that press conference you must say and here's my next nominee and we're going to have it done before the election\nNow the only in my opinion the only one that can stand that is likely because you don't need help\nSomebody to do take the due to the ... sessions ah well\nAh I mean he was he brought in January ... he was inaugurated and then a February Athie was the vote went down so let four weeks three four weeks for an hour we could probably go to the factory and other things going on\nGay so you have four weeks to do it that's what you have now for the election you have four weeks\nThe one who can get that the ... the one who doesn't need all the FBI checks and all of that is likely\nIt's

understand how you might emotionally connect with her especially if you were a victim I can\n\nBut she is possessed with this on ending hatred and there is nothing anyone can say or do anyone who says I Know Kavanaugh didn't do it you're fooling yourself anyone who says I Know he did it you're fooling yourself\nYou're filling in blanks that you cannot unless you're God let me check\nYep no I'm not God today might be your turn unless your God you don't know that you cannot know that I mean this is one of those cases where it is so crystal clear to me\nJudge less you'll be judged how you judge other people\nI'm telling you if he did it he's out\nIf he was perjuring themselves I don't want a guy on the Supreme Court was perjuring themselves\nBut that requires evidence that requires some sort of of case to be made not accusations but a case to be made\nHere destroying a person's life see here's the problem with this particular professor at Georgetown\nShe's looking for social justice she's looking for ... you are to be righted somehow or another\nAnd it doesn't matter all men are guilty all men are guilty well I'm Sorry was Gandhi guilty was Gandhi guilty\nReally\n'cause he was a man\nWas Martin Luther king was he guilty\nYou know the both of those men were flawed both of those men had things about them that I don't like both of those men\nUh it had been one was the alleged land or\nThe other was it clear\nRacist gundy\nI still think they were great men they were just flawed\nWhen you go into social justice and you believe in collective salvation or collect the justice\nThat I'm going to right the wrongs of the world because men are collectively evil because of all of the wrongs that men have done in the past they are collectively evil\nYou go mad\nAnd I am warning and begging people to calmly and rationally explain this to their neighbors when you go down that road you always always end up killing people\n\nNow a few years ago that was hyperbole\nBut today if you don't think we're on the edge of a civil war\nOf people like her saying we should feed their genitals to the pigs tell me the difference between that and Nazi Germany rate rhetoric\nAnd

will change no one's mind if you don't believe me\nHow many minds did we change did we change the course two thousand ten and I I Want you to know I don't think that um we did the fight as much as the press\nTried to convince everyone we were these evil monsters saying X Y and Z and demanding violence\nSo I understand that but because of that which we don't necessarily have this time the media has changed it's not as important social media is much more important than the regular media\nAll right so\nWhat's the best way to get people to come on our side it's never to point the finger at them it's it's never to call them names and I know this from experience I Know this because\nI'm going to be honest with you I did that to you because I was so convinced I was right\nThat I did that to you I instead I didn't listen to you I just saw you're crazy these are the earth you're flushing down this and that and blah blah blah and you're wrong no no\n\nYou saw things a different way and as I have said on many occasions on this program since the election\nI was wrong on multiple occasions but what\nAmazes me\nIs when I say those things\nThe number of people who just want to rub my face in it that's okay if that makes you feel better but I just want to tell you that's foolish you do it to me all your wide please don't do that to others please don't do that to others who say\nYou know what I think you are right or you know what I Can't take my own side and and while I don't like your guy that much I mean you guys are released\nIn some sense please do not rubbed their oh well we told you so well really remember when you don't do that please don't do that will come them\nIf we're going to heal the nation the first thing they have to do is peel the right\nWe're going to heal the nation we have got to put our differences aside and begin to open up our circle\nIf I Believe in eighty percent of the stuff you believe in great I don't even need to do that I just need to know do you believe in the bill of rights do you believe in the bill of rights if you believe in the bill of rights and you'll stand for the bill of rights I'm In\nI'm In we can disagree on everything else

I think it explained so much about what we're seeing with a capital case right now\nI think it's I think it's absolutely in line with ... well it's amazing because I think a lot of people if you're trying to look at it and you're and you're just playing team a lot of people would just be like all the Democrats are the worst and they're insane but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats\nAnd

explained in the book and you'll see the times I look at it so I'm like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things this doesn't make any sense and it's easy political explanations for all that but it's not real the real basis of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book because I think it is the perfect example maybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories in the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah\nUh you can find it in the book addicted outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way\nA and the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university

there's some reason and you don't understand why would they do this they blew their job why they do this they blew their marriage all those things why would the left act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and and you know you spend a lot of time in the

we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist\nOh thank you very important it's so important is very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold a role that really closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr a or I'm a\nGeneral general attorney general ready to go one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's a certain candidate who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused a by a woman or he was\nBeing now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this mhm there's a separation between the cabinet case Neal is a case of the cabinet case happens or thirty six years ago by the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's one difference on\nA professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nIssued a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort between a word and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that really got both of those so the other little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay does\nWhat did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course\nWell yeah well in their words case they both have a notes from there do they do get around those cases are the ... the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which she referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now and never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction\nBetween those two things one has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll usually meeting\nMe yeah and so she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident and has photos of bruising on her the other one of course does not um being forward she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with though of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening than people\nForward named cannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way or the thousands a girlfriend has also\nAre named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax I'm writing um pictures and are those are things that she showed two co workers\nIn real time in real time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had to Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at that time yeah\nBut ... lives in I mean you I mean you don't have videotape well there was\nA videotape now we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the\nWith the ... and we don't have that evidence yeah I mean we have a a a ton of evidence and in fact I don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the forties so we I mean like we came out more we have a preponderance of evidence in in the Alison case however um", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018",
