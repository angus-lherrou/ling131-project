{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "Let's go political trivia\nAnd who is drawn to send us running mate that she's running for governor [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYes and no and yes from my I'm a state representative by the way and what does she went for that one dating cans\nGone to check out the Florida architect I got a couple of ticket to defeat in the event\nAnd watch the phrase this paves [noise] every day with the ballet that's concise and to the point and you got it [noise] but\nYeah this crazy video the surveillance video that I keep watching over and over again of the uh the Lakeland ah city commissioner shooting the shoplift or ... years old I'm only going to be on a little trouble for that yeah Michael Dunn I'd say so to jak yeah the in case you hadn't\nHeard about it just goes part owner of that business or had an interest in it and he was he shoplifting oh he was ... I'm\nAn ... or something like that one yeah he was trying to he's swipe the hatchet swipe the hatchet and he got a bullet\nAnd you could say well he had a hat should so that's a weapon and but if you see the video it doesn't look like he really threatened\nThe commissioner what would Grady judge say here in Lakeland I don't know the answer she tried to get a hatch it buddy left with a bullet [laughter] I think that might pretty well sum it up I was looking\nAt a this was in like I said to then in turn all polling from the stress campaign um conducted a couple of weeks ago\nAnd it shows the race between a straight as and Jane castor\nFormer police chief\nThirty four percent to thirty six percent which basically put some of the statistical tie\n'em and\nName recognition cash or is it eighty percent stress at sixty five percent a\nBut he's moving up on caster and I think caster probably I don't know if you'd consider her the favorite or not you got trench you get a lot of people that are running right\nNow I think she's the favorite caster yeah I Would guess so um the big ties to law enforcement in the community\nAnd a poll that was conducted with five hundred likely city of Tampa voters as Andrew Gillum leading Rhonda Sanders for governor sixty percent to twenty nine percent\nBeginning to sound like a Gillum might be a shoo in also the local tax referendum these are favored in the city again that does not include county voters because county to county wide\nTransportation taxes but in the city or the transportation tax and the school tax polled the same was sixty five percent in favor\nAnd only twenty eight percent opposed that would lead you to believe that this was going to be a runaway victory for the transportation tax and the the education\nTax if you believe the polls yeah what do you think it's going to happen I don't think it's now I think the half cent tax might pass for the schools I think people are so sick of transportation issues\nAnd yet we have desperate needs for transportation improvements but uh it just never passes here and again it's because they won't let them have a city wide vote for city wide transportation improve much has to be countywide according to the state legislature and\nCatty why'd they it's never going to pass you can forget about it so we'll see how that goes\nSome incredible stories coming from the panhandle I saw family that's spelled out help with logs and they were rescued because they spelled out help and then it was caught on this year you have the satellite images caught it\nYeah I mean it's amazing what's happening and the people working up there by the way the death toll is gone up to Nineteen now\nAnd that includes the pan handle all the way up through Virginia North Carolina and Georgia and Virginia are included in that a note here from Curtis Holmes who points out that um\nThe liberals heart too happy about his signs in his yard what did they say says every Scott ... brand this yard sign was stolen\nOr the other night I guess and uh\nHe says that's the new Democratic Party at work like holders should kick 'em or sweet Hillary only after we re take power\nDid they don't have jobs who has time to steal a yard sign yeah what are you\nKnow stealing the yard signs that's incredible but it's happening but he said they're all going to be replaced so\nYou don't have to worry about it\nDid we cover everything here got it all big day to day I think we did go to seed Ted tonight will have webs world tomorrow that do you think will be talking about oh I don't know there's so many things to go over we had him jumping yesterday for a couple of minutes when you were out talking about Trump on sixty minutes\nOh yeah I saw I didn't see the sixty minutes thing or you know saw snippets of it until it as a stall on President and you're not [laughter] I can do it well then I saw a thing\nWhere and this is the right wing organization a partial is things like this that he was interrupted sixty four times in mid sentence\nAnd when Obama had an interview with sixty minutes he was only interrupted six times so that's the way it goes I guess anyway we'll see you tomorrow\nMorning at five on wonder if we'll get our paper tomorrow morning pope ... remember come see us Thursday morning Anna Maria island at the Ana Marie oyster bar Brighton Beach\nYup that's on the pier Brighton Beach eight fifty eight on AM Tampa Bay\nAnd and uh and\nThere was a radio knives seventies ballet [noise] and when you went to the student to clear water\nAnd as of today that page has raised five hundred and eighty six thousand dollars so to everyone who just donated you just paid President Trump's lawyers over half a million dollars and as the kids\nAs the kids say nowadays [noise]\nIn October ... pulled [noise]\nGoing back program we need to have a power about Elizabeth Warren to about ... we need to make that a oatmeal do that she made in Palau town don't know whether we should try that I Hope that somebody smoking peace pipe on this whole thing because\nThis is this is just outrageous don't you think yeah she released this big uh basically I Would say presidential audition video yesterday and show everyone that she was for Native American\nYeah super duper NATO she was ah she's Cherokee she's Cherokee and Delaware\nYes ah which is a is something that does not seem to be backed up by the facts now they first came out and said well the DNA test shows her to be one thirty second uh Cherokee\nAnd then they revise that you won the ... the media revised that can they actually looked at the report and says one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve and then they realized loops deep sea we made a a map there this is a serious correction they didn't do see in the corruption but they pay they should have\nA cause that always makes everything better sure but it was between one uh one sixty fourth in one one thousand twenty fourth I Believe it was\nYeah one one thousand twenty fourth now that of course in and of itself so he got the human body up to what one thousand twenty four pieces that one of them one of those pieces would have a little bit of Cherokee\nNow this theoretically right I could at least give her a technical defense of her bull crap over the past fifty years right where she's lying and saying she's\nA you know she's a Native American and she's uh getting benefits for this and she's getting her stupid super recipes in Palau chat which is the goal of almost everybody\nHow how much how how some wild child and they want to talk about appropriating a culture powwow chow that's what I'm going all ... I'm going all full I I'm I'm\nJust I'm going to I just thought let's all complain about the names of out ball teams but what's ... I don't want to hear how ... from here on out our our audience what's called our tribe and we mean it in the Native American sense it's a tribe to trial it does\nThe I mean there are studies that show that the average person of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing in her study average person the average person because he I mean look this is not it\nIt's a very DNA is a complicated matter and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to ... they just didn't\nShow any DNA from an actual Native American yeah what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not participating in DNA studies we don't want\nAny DNA studies so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans\nTo test the DNA against we\nHave to use people from Peru Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well\nWay and there's the the theory is that they those the same people want to migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she is Native American blood and it's not even what they tested\nOr and even that if it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you if you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed and like to point out over the years he would not show the his Canadian blood\nFight like that not only did they say oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian with DNA does is it shows that lineage against shows it's it can be interesting in some ways show migration patterns and\nI Wonder if he would it would have his blood would show that he's a thousand times more Hispanic than a hundred friends disorder or if it's true it probably would show that\nUh but still it's interesting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and falling flat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing and second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was\nUm it was her great great great great grandmother I think a several generations back\nAnd um when she registers in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white now the theory again as put forth by the the war in a campaign and and and then this is true\nThat she would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of saying you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right ... and they were able to get away with that there'd be some serious incentives to do that\nNumber one obviously well that's true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with hit her great great great great great great grandmother ... secondarily yeah but what have we learned from aggressive we have learned that if you identify as something you are that thing\nThis woman identified as white and now or\nDenying her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she's not\nThat was what I was really were not allowed to apply to any money we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee so we have to accept that she is\nSo we can't accept look what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous this story is just ... I don't really care I don't care either I care that she's lighting and the\nPeople you know she's lying or let me just like looking I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face more than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those yet those got um you know we've got to start making them or I Want one more than life itself okay\nSo you know where I'm coming from however you know we all have things I have a story in my family okay\nOf ah one of my great great great grandfather is now my my grandfather actually took a horse or be a full size of course he was a he was kind of a vet\nAnd he talked to him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else ... and he took him and he punched him in the head and\nKnock the horse out okay so ... my family my on my mother's side they're big people are [laughter] and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't have okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather or was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept\nA jumping over and getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this and he picked it up and threw it\nOver the fence I don't know if that's true I gotta go in and say it's not my family you don't know [laughter] so he could be truly it might not be true oh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing you oh yeah this\nIs what it was but it was the was it was not true somebody advantages through your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls and I was ... I almost\nMade it into WWE but\nHow many times have you told a story you been on the air for how many years never never I've never to lose you you've you've yeah yeah yeah I get it again if she is ... trying to play identity politics and if you're going to play identity politics you better be right on these things and that's why it is I can give you that I got what it's about is I give you that you're not a huge story I mean ... you know\nWe will you know what is a huge part of this story\nIs the Cherokee Nation came out yesterday and said\nQuote a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA test can be used to determine lint lineage such as fraternity or to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a da and ... a test to claim any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses wildest honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of ... okay look not a good look\nYeah they're they're not uh they're not offering the piece by peer to her or she should\nProbably zip it and it does this not go on this whole saga of the last two days with the ... as you point out ridiculous story does this not ... the whole uh serve as a gigantic warning signs to Democrats to not nominate her visit\nA oh no no no no I look and I want to know no\nThis is this is science to show she's ... years are really really she yeah she's great she's great\nGet the the minority vote she'll get the Native American vote and vote and uh\nPackage investigated west finally allowed to set the fatty content that have any ... last night the president said today that they're looking into toxic materials inside the Daily Show thinking anonymously had already tell ... killed inside the ...

wanted to end up and say it's because nobody else is am I right is that what what's happening\nYeah well look at those to those two versions or wouldn't have been that different on friday night\nThe the guys who are looking for a fight they got in some extra kicks right and so that's maybe five seconds of violence that wouldn't have happened if they went your way that's five seconds out of three days of terror\nOr antifa was was threatening the venue they were giving death threat to this old lady who answered the phone they're\nHang on hang on we're starting to let's go back to what you were doing what the venue is what I had and you have to hit on the poster because uh [laughter]\nI think the poster is just a entertaining but go ahead\nWell I Will try it again the coach you kill a socialist samurai sword in Nineteen sixty\nAnd it's a funny troll that a lot of right wing guys do it sort of like the tennis shaping rewrite the helicopter rides for ... and early early satire right right so it it it's that kind of set up I announce it on Tuesdays call myself a toy again like Gabby\nAnd I bought a shop myself into his my shot\n'em that second we announced that and and they want to know me too now is that a satire and he goes all the blast they start attacking the venue attacking the old lady there\nCalls are coming from all over the country by the way it so this was a planned attack that anti for his work I think than seeing the people working hand in hand traditional as well organized and well funded\nSo then that those attacks continue that before the venue totally trash windows smashed ridiculously pretentious manifesto nailed to the door that says\nThat we put the Republicans on notice a this is only the beginning we are not civil which by the way the Hillary quote a but then I get to the venue that night for the next night\nTotal in outer chaos because we made signs screaming hurling bottles of urine which one of them hit my car on the way out a ... ... organized rallies like there's this kind of met set your if you really\nDeep end of the the foxhole where he is calling in the front thing you know you guys go over there over there a citizen journalist get beat up they take his backpack their police to arrest him and then\nThey they arrest the citizen journalist\n... no no sorry they arrest three of the of the end who mob this guy okay but I had\nI interviewed him today and he was talking about coordinated attacks it seemed very military so this isn't anarchy is anarchist or calling us\nWell you you know I I don't know if I'm sure you are\nUm and to FAA Austin is a on their Facebook page has called for a guerrilla style tactics they've they've called for a\nWhat did they call it a black shirt army or something I read a a red shirt army I Can't remember 'em but they're calling for people that just want to go out and do what ... normally does but they're also calling now for a an actual standing army\nAnd they were looking for people that know military tactics that could teach people so that's that's happening of course Facebook doesn't have a problem with with covering that but\nI must be the Mets hat guy the police are looking for that my citizen journalists told me about 'em so yeah that those guys were charged with assault Enron operate because they took his backpack so now you know when I by the way peace for ... uh Martin Luther king guy mock right there I saw the same experience right up till now and it's been days\nAnd then when it's time to leave I come out\nThere I've got my plastic sword I make a choice that you know what can you choke and that's when they hurl the Internet may I jump in the car\nAnd then a group of Proud Boys are are the last wants to go they they leave and the video just came out yesterday I'm breaking nine one one on Twitter they were attacked by antifa fully clad with all their gear and they throw a bottle at them and a huge fight breaks out and\nNow the newer world that fight would have been you know hey cops cops or something like that\nAnd then I'll come actual it's a little bit longer but again five to ten seconds different so we're splitting hairs here you know the real issue is we're up against\nHomicidal lunatics with no gender ... plan and it felt like they know where we're going to get you know our our gas and oil from after the revolution these guys just want to burn America to the ground and the media is on their side\nYou know so it's so frustrating because um we had the same kind of thing happening out in in Portland, Oregon\nAnd ah you know Portland has I don't know who this mayor is what I mean what the hell is he doing where that they're already directing traffic ... the police are standing a block away than they do nothing\n[noise] well my understanding when the super laughing towns like Berkeley in Portland is\nThe mayor allows anti for re chaos and then he can say\nSorry Trump's supporters are trouble I mean look at all the chaos that happens with someone who likes Trump shows up on on Republicans and conservatives are around so well that's just you know if you don't want to antifa around stopping off that's their sort of Monaco and it works\nIt's interesting because ... because the initial video seemed to indicate that you guys were in the wrong that they had they started this and and they started the violence\nThe second video that was released however shows clearly someone from ... throwing something a at a at a the ... the Proud Boys and and the Mets won the fight breaks out it was not something that you guys at least ... the main one that has been covered it was not something that you guys instigated\nIsn't it strange how quick the media is to run with the evil Nazi narrative without doing any research whatsoever and isn't it strange to how the media ticks a five second clip and makes that\nThe total story when we have days and days and days of subterfuge stays in is a domestic violence\nIt's almost like I'm at I'm at a point now I think they don't just like antifa they aren't you so I think a lot of these journalists these little hostile bloggers will go to rallies the masks on I'm convinced\nI Will tell you I I ah I'm having a very hard time defending a the press which I have tried\nTo be more moderating or on my on my words with the press but the the deeper we get in to the violence on the streets and the calls for kick them when they're down in all of this stuff\nAre you there is no excuse when when when the when they will not Cole a mob mob an angry mob when everybody knows what that means\nI I don't know what I I don't know what to say I mean how\nDo you and I can't go to restaurants sucker crossing just today said he can't go to restaurants and no one and only conservative can go to a restaurant today that's a new one and it's because the the media will throw around a white supremacist\nLike it it means absolutely nothing oh it's a crime is this is someone who is white people as above all other races just inherently better and wants all the other races out of America that is that we're markedly esoteric view to have it it's a crazy if you have and they just throw it on us and it sticks like glue\nAnd it affects our families affects our lives affects our personal lives there's gotta be some culpability there\n[noise] okay so Gavin hold on for a second I Want to I Want to take you over across the breaking and just\nAsk you what it is you believe what is the America then you see and that you're fighting for [noise] back with Gavin McGinnis coming up and just a second let me tell you a little bit about gold lying\nIf you think this stuff is going away quickly it's not a if the Republicans lose one or both houses of

[noise]\nYou know in the in the book addicted outrage I [noise] I\n... some people who haven't read the book I think that it is about um a surrendering or or just making friends with the left and it's not that's not what this is about at all\nIt's about knowing what you believe and then taking a strong stand but with a different approach because times have changed and um and they're getting more and more dangerous and I have talked to you about Martin Luther king for a long time or\nA somebody who wrote a read my book who [noise] um I really respect they they read it and they said a\nYear about a year to to a head I'm not sure um maybe maybe because I think more people will look at this as things become crazier and crazier maybe\nBut it's not about it's not about reuniting with the left because I don't think you can unite with the the left the left has gone insane I think you can with a lot of Democrats and I'm not talking about the ones in Washington I'm not talking about political people I'm Talking about your neighbors\nBut the first thing we have to do is unite with each other we have to unite to\nPeople people who are are on the right\nPart of the spectrum need to come together we have to come together\nAnd I'm I'm really I I'm I don't like the hey you're on the train or you're not on the train what are you talking about what train where's the train going here's the train that we should all be on\nThe declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights because that's why people came here in the first place\nPeople die in the middle of the night in the desert to get here because we have a a rule of law be we do not have a class system you can break out if you work hard you're smart\nAnd you're a little bit lucky you can break out you can change the world you can invent something in your garage and become Bill Gates\nThat's America that's great that's why people come here and we're losing sight of that until the first thing they have to do is ask are we worth saving\nAnd I think the answer across the board I'll bet you eighty percent maybe Ninety percent of America Says yes America is worth saving so what does that mean well capitalism capitalism but not necessarily the way we're doing it\nNow where it's playing favorites the constitution but we haven't been on the constitution or the bill of rights in a long time but we do need a rule of law\nLet me start asking you know just a few questions and I don't care who you voted for I don't care what side of the aisle you're on just answer yes\nOr no do you hate men\nDo you hate white people do you hate black people do you hate Jews do you hate cops do you hate capitalism\nDo you want to shout down others that have a different opinion do you want to shout down God or hate God\n\nDo you believe street violence is the way we solve things in America\nIf you answered yes to any of those things I don't think I have much in common with you but I don't care who you voted for I'll bet you the vast majority said no to all of those things and it wasn't hard well I don't know it was no no no no no no no no\nThat's who we are\n\nThose are the people we need we need to unite with but the easy ones to get by the ones on our own side\nGathering the Guinness and I may disagree on a lot of things we disagree I Believe that it would be much more helpful to take the Martin Luther King pledge\nAnd go and walk through Atlanta FAA singing hymns and let them club you in the head go ahead let them club you in the head I Know that's not fun I don't want that\nBut that video of not breaking ranks and not punching back\nThis guy is a liberal so we have several different says regarding President Trump as you mentioned he's a he's a liberal\nAnd he uh comes as he had strong relationships with financial markets in Brazil so this is the man that he points that out\nAs a base of the trust in his government but uh he said he\nUh ... it's not clear how he will manage his own team he has had some trouble controlling or his advisers that have given a interviews or saying things that he had later to a unauthorized them so\nUh it is possible that uh he will close down and keep a very closed government regarding the press for example he has been using social media as his basic communication tools [noise]\n... this is the kind of ... ... tons of the same thing that you go job is said\nWhen he was running the first time he said oh no it's not going to be this way I'm not going to do and he immediately came in and he started taking over the media and and the nationalizing everything is ... is there a ...\n... is that we're we're looking at are we looking at a uh a dictatorship possibility with him but as the military and is it\nWhen you say he's liberal is that is that mean a socialist Marxist or what does that mean exactly in Brazil\nWhat we expect here most analysts are don't see any mediate a risk to democracy as hey we'll take office and immediately he will shut down Congress that's not what has been a discussion here at this time\nWhat is expected is that maybe he could uh promote some change\nIn constitution and it is not clear how he would do it he has a suggested that he could create a council that would uh create a new constitution for Brazil and\nThat would be submitted to a vote for ah after it so and in ... to to people to a electors in general\nSo it he had to to take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will bring it back once he takes office because the fact\nIs that he's not going to debate he\nUh is giving I'm just a few interviews and usually he ... the process has been speaking mainly through social media so he has no conversation from the press and\nThis ah creates a and unknown territory we don't know what's coming but\nA analyst most analysts don't expect something so drastic ah right at the time ... clothing because uh in the legislative elections he got a a strong a performance in ... from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some level of\nGovernance ... he and he will be able to do some of the changes that he intends to but we still don't know exactly what would be the oil is changes\nCome it can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\n[noise] uh that ... son it ... and he posted on line a while back a photo of him I'm next to ban in and said that Bannon has said he would\nBe glad to help in the campaign or something like this\nAt this generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved and was responsible in a great part of a bull so not a strategy but a lot of himself a case of public afterwards and said it was fake news that has nothing to do with it what do we know for a\nFact is that Bannon has given some indications that he considers a ...\nAn expression of this right wing movement that with the uh in other parts of the world and he includes a Donald Trump in this a movement so he understand that it's a it's a clear wave in this\nDirection and both so now that would be an expression of this but we have no a clear indication that he would be involved there's a picture of him close to the president's get a presidential candidate son uh and some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow but we don't know exactly at what point\nAre close to when the when is the election finalized when do we know\nAre now at the end of the month a ... on Sunday twenty eighth\nOr will have the final result it's very likely the considering the current polls that bill so not a we'll be elected uh we uh yesterday we had a recent poll that gave also NATO fifty nine\nPercent of valid votes and ... that is the candidate from the workers' party only forty one so it's a big difference\nAnd a ... a poll after poll has indicated that uh his delight there's are very sure of their votes so eh we we would have to have a a new fact something that would be strong enough to change the scenario but\nUm it's very likely that hit he wins the election\nClarissa we'll talk to you again after the election and to find out some more we'll be following okay thank you so much ... appreciate okay\nThank you so much for having me you about\n\nWhat is deserving about this is his history or he has\nA he has a a very very strong history of um of dictatorship a love and passion and uh he is not\nA Donald Trump he's not he has time in the government and he is on record now he says he's changed demand\nA you know but this is the way things\nHappen you don't come in as a dictator you know even Hitler didn't come in as a dictator he came in as a public servant and um and things are bad in Brazil the other thing that has really should pay attention to is Steve Bannon Steve Bannon is flying all over the world and he is\nA helping cobble together this um populist movement and\nPopulism is neither good nor bad it's what are the Ames\nAnd uh what are they what ... what's you know what to someone use populism to get through\nPopulism is the Patriot act make it so it sounds populist make it so it sounds popular make it so it sounds like something everybody will want that's populism and you can use that for good or evil\nAnd I'm In my opinion Bannon is on the dark side of this one and he is definitely someone to keep your eye on and so we're all the candidates that he chooses and chooses to engage with\nUm because I'm In the rest of the world\nThe the believe it or not softness and a tempered Donald Trump doesn't necessarily exist\nAre sponsored this half hour is simply safe simply safe
