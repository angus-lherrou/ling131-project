but but I I I I I I Want to spend some time going over it with you [noise]\nYou know the saying may you live in interesting times they always say oh that's a Chinese curse [noise] it's really not that's not\nMay you live in interesting times is not a Chinese in fact the first place that we can really find that being said\nIs in the Yorkshire Post that's in England in Nineteen thirty six\nA guy stood up and parliament his name was a sir Austin Chamberlain and he was um uh he was a meeting with union is and uh he spoke of the grave injury to collective security by Germany's violation of of the treaties so\nHe said look I'm not so long ago\nI spent ... years of service in China and there there was this old Chinese fellow who told me of a curse may you live in interesting\nTimes and there is no doubt that this curses falling upon us so it's not a Chinese it's this this guy is the only one is the only place we can really find this but I've always liked that because I don't think it's a curse it's a it's a [noise]\nIt's just the saying and you decide if it's a blessing or a curse I personally think it's a blessing\nMy dad taught me what I was really young that no matter what happens to you there is no bad\nNow he taught me this when I was really young but it took it took me hitting rock bottom alcoholism divorced everything else my life completely falling apart before I really learned that\nIt took a dark chapter in my life that that taught me there is nothing that life can hand you that is in itself bad\nIt just depends on what you do with it\n\nIs this going to change you in destructive ways is it going to make you angry are you going to be filled with bitterness and despair are you going to be looking for vengeance blame\nOr will you allow whatever calamity has come your way to strengthen you through enlightenment through correction new understandings humility\nIt's up to you so living in interesting times I think that's a blessing\nAnd we're going to learn this one way or another we can either learn this the easy way like with my dad telling me or we'll learn the hard way like I actually had to take hit the end and learn through just total collapse\nBut one way or another humility will rain again because we have we have an unbelievable lack of humility in DC in Hollywood Story today to tell you about Michael ... play who's now quitting the music

there is truth\nBut I don't think any of us are really looking for at least a large section isn't looking for it we are indeed living in interesting times\n\nBut he is ... is our crisis is our problem of them problem because that's what the world is trying to sell us\nI personally think it's an ... problem all of us\nBoth sides all of us and maybe we don't see it because we're so busy staging and filtering and enhancing the colors on our Facebook or Instagram pictures that we can really no longer recognize\nWhat what is true even about our own lives because\nEverything that we print and post most of it is ally one way or another subtler bold its ally\nAnd why is that\nBecause we've been marketed to ever since we were born all of us you were born after Nineteen fifty you are marketed to

you have\nYou have all of us are honest and we really look at our situation we all know we all see the same symptoms we all know that we as a nation or sick were really really sick\nAnd we have we have each of us have doctors and their each prescribing the opposite medicine\nAnd each of us as patients are also desperate to cure or what is killing us killing our\nSociety\nThat we will follow these doctors directions because they know better they know better they know more than we do I that they've got the answer and we become more and more vested in their cure as our friends and family say that's not the cure\nBecause we're taking this medicine and we believe we just become more vested in our doctor are doctors write yours is wrong\n\nWith the same time the doctor is not going to get more humble because the doctor will know he or she has everything to lose if his or her patients begin to seek another opinion another diagnosis another remedy it's in their best interest to keep patients busy looking at the other side\nSo they're not questioning what he's doing\nAnd while we're all fighting over the cure none of us even if stop to ask if the diagnosis is even correct were just too busy fighting what our doctor\nSaid\nI don't know about you but I Know you know we're sick I Know you know this society is sick we are sick and we are in pain and and when I Am sick or in pain I'm usually at my worst inner personally only I'm not good at making friends\nAt that point I don't think you are either we snap at each other we act as our lesser selves because what I'm sick I'm I hurt and I am full of despair or I'm fearful\nOr I just don't have the patience and every time I'm really sick or in real pain it usually is followed by a time where I have to begin conversations with I'm really so sorry I I was just in really bad pain or I was really sick I was having a really bad day and I know I'm not alone\nAnd judging by our society today we're having a really very bad most difficult day every day it seems and it gets worse every day\n\nI Want those doctors to know I Want those I don't want those to know that actually do just want to watch the world to burn I Want you to know that it's true\nWe know there are dangers in difficulties crisis that lie ahead of us\nBut don't just assume that we're just going to lie down and watch our country burned down it's not\nIn fact many if not most of us who voted for Democrats and those who voted for Republicans have a ton in common and I taught in common with those who voted for neither while the parties and the politicians tried to convince us otherwise and\nMany of us may have believed for a while or even engaged in this warfare it's becoming more and more clear to more and more Americans that our

target\nYeah actually you know a little over a year ago about a year and a half ago I heard you on on your program reading out from the paper I wrote previously with Peter Berg ocean like ... as a social construct\nAnd I ended up killing one of these pay pay\nOr to publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low um review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned it was really fun there you know a fun right um yeah he misses\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight [laughter] that [laughter] um but yeah so we learned our lesson we we took the criticisms we got from that\nTo heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use paid published journals in any sense\nA secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge\n[laughter] I'm like a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope people continue to\nAddress it a secondly we decided that um we would use the highest ranked journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if our if we had gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong but it's it's not what happened um and uh early on in the process not just to keep us honest 'cause I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already so he's on the recording us for a year his name's Mike ... to ... and since he's been recording us I mean clearly what ever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took\nMay be that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I know you talk to hell and the other day yeah\nAh so this was in in in the men's amount of work required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers of typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work there was an insane\nAmount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and note that Helen has a little bit of background in some of this\nBut this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers and striking us are only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of the the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do and the research side of their career is to get papers published in well established journals\nAre for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper and and I paid ... is a feminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure um our paper spanned\nThe ones we wrote spanned Fifteen sub disciplines of ...\nThe ones that got accepted spanned seven [noise] and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know un un twelve in the pipeline that look like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet\nAnd I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven and Thirteen would have gotten in in the end are we not gotten cold\nOkay so when we come back we'll we'll go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so so are we as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA hand to hand honorable way they got a little gold star for [noise] alright are sponsored this half hour is zipper critter zipper critter is just as\nGreat company of ah of dreamers the doors you know when they first started they were ... this company that uh you would send in you know what you were looking

we're going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual\nMasturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive stack\nJames tell us about the progressive stack\nThe progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal was inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just said this is this an act says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are it recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege\nUm then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means they\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level\nThe the knowing field to\nThe ... the classroom learning environment and\nThe problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way of this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes and they said watch it with compassion\nThat re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed\nAnd there's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being comforted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make a terrible scary idea properly evil\nAnd that's the worst part is is it's only a small step\nFrom what I already exist in a great\nDeal of the a feminist and race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah first yeah and then later they were a bit concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine things that you would expect out of a scholarly papers they claimed for example that we grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter and so on\nBut um the the idea that that giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over him interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was question\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published what what would that mean to the university system would would want to send me and\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm there would be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom and got in trouble for it a late last year so they decided it didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some\nSome uh educators primarily working and social justice\nSide or the\nFields topics courses I guess as the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to\nHow things were going for you under Obama's time and I thought that was huge\nThat was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation is on your on your

come back from the from the edge\nAnd we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people in general I get a lot of sense that people send me emails about this now all the time especially um\nWe're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back the production politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media is here as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't really remember you know you are an American I'm an American your person I'm a person\nWe have ... most of the things that we think income and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences\nBut I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society and a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working out the details and I really hope that you know that our project kinda reaches reaches that point does that

Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and does endorse Medicare for all\nAll the big names are for it already there but many of them were cosponsors of the bill uh it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are ... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care\nI think credible yeah we were scare mongers in races for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stores will go through this tomorrow but I just signed\nUp to ... um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college you know that is a fundamental um [noise] a a a fundamental aspect of what brought the states together in the first\nPlace the state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything well then ... what do we have it can't be that way\nSo we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter\nIt will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore that's pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected right\nI might have to do is just just appeal to the big cities\nAnd by the way this is a this is an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college I Know Trump's sports at for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but uh there is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe\nThis is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country road by cities I mean as you know it'd be which I mean that's the one that like as a Republican I certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ...\nAgain like it shouldn't be that way right should run themselves in the cities can run whatever they want and the rural or you can do what they want why do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live\nUnder a farmer's some no farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them but I also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous\nAnd it's why the house and Senate both exist to give balance to that so that ...\nNot one side can tell the head out right\nIn a no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could have race the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThe way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things could be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed\nQuickly then the next ... the first check on the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York ... says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was senator Brock Obama was center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they wouldn't be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it on constitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it was\nWay no that's the opposite and it's the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed\nOr you just arguing for king right with these the several ... around with the ... give you the argument for it came\nRight I mean okay really they failed or have we not been using them properly\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife and saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and split lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed or no you're\nNot using it properly that's not what it was meant for and I would also argue the failure part right you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane\nAbsolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland\nMayor who the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland but Portland but that's how I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry\nSo you know the ... and last week\nThe Portland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nFusing ...\nCan anybody just get up and started directing traffic in Portland and they just didn't I just go out of the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City if you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared [noise]\nI mean especially it was a union job really they wouldn't be you'd be in the bottom of the river [laughter] what what what laws do you even have in Portland now you can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window\nHe's driving and he's like no I'm not gonna you're young wherever and they break his window and chased him down\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the N word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland this weekend but they had a a a law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff started beating\nKicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and and the mayor ... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I I don't\nHi Michelle mountain here one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was the trial of abortion doctor Kermit costs now how the woman goes
