it to their address\nAnybody knows anything about these public figures knows that their mail read for them and check uh the fact that uh\nYou know they were a detonated by a bomb squad does\nKnow much about what are you know some of you know about this\nBecause it's real world you know you think about it I mean you see stupid criminals doing stupid thing\nAnd a ... and they don't think it through

ingredients I Want to see them taking apart you know I Want to see that these were actual device it no I Can't say I would have shed any tears had one of them that that's why I won't name you know or maybe George Soros perhaps but\nWhat would you what would you like well you did let me ask you a question what would you speculated if a Republican or a handful of Republicans like this had been sent these these devices would you guys be saying the same thing that it was a set up\nTo it it could be a you know without actual evidence and an improving speculation they really are and I don't want to\nPoint any fingers but\nIt looks really suspicious not one of them went off not one with the number one and and not one of them went to where the target of the places where the bombs were are places where the people who\nLive there are hardly there any way they're doing campaign stop they're out on the road there's nobody there except the people who read them at a new\nAnd you're right you're ... and Richard you write and thank you for the call we're going to be speculating and actually get some hard evidence yeah\nYou got it figured out a good show\nThanks Richard hey by the way we

pipe you have an\nAn acme style bomb none of them have gone off and you took the time to print a medium that has the ISIS flag and underneath it it's a quote from Larry the cable guy that says\nGet her done except none of your bombs get it done and\nThey they've had zero chance of making it through security screening\nAnd Wylie coyote I think must have known that at some point the coyotes got to go this dam road runner keeps go getting away maybe it's me\nDo you think Hillary Clinton actually personally checks her mailbox every time you know to see her Amazon Prime order came in and do you think George Soros does every person that has been sent one of these package has mail screening these devices were not designed to kill but to me\nBe detected caught and seen\nWylie coyote wanted a media circus and boy did he get one now I Am not going to speculate whether Wiley really is from the right or from the left\nI Do know there's a lot of not jobs out that are looking to change narratives before the midterms no one knows yet this could be a kid they just thought\nThis would be funny\nAgain there's no chance these bombs would go off so maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who's so screwed up he just doesn't even know what he's doing\nThere's also the possibility someone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other\nThis however is not stopping the left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste by noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday\nPaul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's all wonder that it took this long it's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about his rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\nYou know what this coming from the same\nGuy that if it is ever found out that it is a left wing guy or just a crazy person they will never report that\nCould I ask when the president has actually called for violence\nNow you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\nCalling the media fake news is not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence\nEncouraging your electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business Maxine Waters\nIsn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility Hillary Clinton I mean I could go on\nBut we all know the left narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms is\nIs over or that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue many of our friends in the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked\nThat this kind of attack occurred one person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first of all that would\nForce one to deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to the Mike Pence\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep\nIn your memory bank you might need a hypnotists gr therapist to bring this memory back at it so long ago\nOh wait a minute no it was just a couple

John Richardson did you just happen\nTo forget all about all of those or should I take you back to the baseball diamond which was way but I mean how old were you in twenty Seventeen\nHe barely remember was I walking at the time I don't even know\nAnd as far as the identity of Wylie coyote\nFor those of you in the mainstream media it's really best not to speculate\nIf you don't know you should say you don't know here's who I think this is I don't know there's no evidence on any saying\nEverything is speculation\nAnd if I Would say Ari ... versus ... wife Dwayne person trying to Iran for everybody up\nWhat would that do that would choose\nThe people listening\nAnd they'd say oh my gosh that's exactly right\nSo why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters and blaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\nYou know [noise] if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts\nYou do something like that\nAnd something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny cold credibility\nBut you'd have to be you'd have to be interested in having some credibility\nTo be able to gain it\nOver twenty or ... well\nFor the second day in a row Jason ... who is with us it it it he is I'm\nA former [noise] I'm a former\nMilitary intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I eat these Jason how ridiculous\nIs this bomb the most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever seen it sort of when I when we first looked at it I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder and um I I was looking at it and I was like no not\nReally I mean it's a ... you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the shrapnel was what's dangerous and a pipe bomb the explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need [laughter]\n[laughter] right [noise] um but there's another ingredient that they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it\nUm that they said they did detect some of that in there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again the everything is spec is is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing\nA lower or\nSomebody who didn't know what they're doing but they didn't want it to work\nRight it had no I mean you're looking at this thing there is a you know and I've also spent some time in some insecurity all the people that they sent these are these packages to\nThey have screening services whether it's the secret service private security or like places like CNN all media companies have the same thing you you ... you would think that this person would no well I was no chance just gets to\nThe coverage I heard yesterday was this was a sign of how advanced and serious the situation but there was a level of sophistication level is supposed to get him because\nHe had vent or or or she by the way he or she had a ... um some of these bombs to home offices\nAnd and read that in ... where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional uh mail service which would definitely be\nSchool until I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out in her bathrobe and her fuzzy

you put a a sticker on a bomb\nLike I ... I guess I've seen pictures of people in the military for example who are about to fire a missile and they put like Osama bin Laden name on it or something like I guess in theoretically possible but if you know of bombs going to explode why would you put a sticker of a right wing me mom and ...\nAnd less and less again potentially a you've thought maybe they wouldn't blow up and that people would see the right wing me\nYeah right like what's almost as if they put on the outside of the envelope open with care this is an explosive so that they wouldn't explode it's not one of the nine has gone off\nBy all put they also put glass in instead of ball bearings or anything metal you walk metal as your as your shrapnel you you you wouldn't put glass in the bomb would just\nDisintegrate the glass

usually you'd be able to do it okay the same thing applies I Believe two white powder arriving to the president whenever I hear that whenever right wing or figures are hit with a bunch of white powder in the mail my first thought is\nWell okay obviously you'd think it's someone who is opposed to them but what take a ... minute here and considered that someone is trying to make the president or some other right wing figure look like they're under attack especially when it turns out not to be rights and and just white powder\nWide someone do that well of course there should be skepticism we've had these these things have happened a hundred times unbelievable\nI've been so much just listen to this I suppose he thinks the communist didn't set fire to the ... dog as well [laughter] I mean of course take a moment to consider and and there's no reason to come to a conclusion because we have no idea at this point but you see these statements that have come out from CNN\nAnd ... you know people just outwardly blaming the right and Donald Trump for this\nLook I don't we first of all you can't blame Donald Trump for the ... unless you think he actually was responsible does anyone think that he actually sent the bombs and brought them to George sources how well no but I think of a mind of [laughter] unless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions we know that\nBut beyond that if you're going to you you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's an obvious incentive to make America ill that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs to go off\nStrikes you're

is the last one to this Trump is already it's so boring it's been done to death\nThat is amazing observation of where the culture has gone because we have at that point it was a big deal when someone came out and essentially advocated for socialism in America\nI mean even when we talked about what Bernie Sanders and twenty Thirteen coming out with Medicare for all he got no co sponsors on that bill and twenty Thirteen now every major democratic candidate is pitching for that pause and they're not just talking about social you know there's a there's a problem in America where\nWe look at Canada and say that to socialize nation does not that's a capitalist nation that has socialized medicine and has other thing all sorts of welfare state yeah I had you know as welfare state that's not a socialist nation and they're now on the left pointing that out\nThat we're calling for an end of capitalism I mean we've gone we've gone further than just saying yeah were you know where socialist like Canadians no no they're now saying no we want an end to capitalism and they're still getting elected\nTo read like the\nWorst in a in a leader of the parade for a while but now he's kind of ... and ... it's ... it's kind of gotten ahead of the closest movie of capitalism a love story with the communist uh at them you see the Soviet Nashville handsome and and I that kind of thing is is not that special anymore as the whole Democratic Party has gone so far left\nSo what does that say to you does that say as I say we're\nIn a lot more trouble than people might think\nWhat does it say to you that this isn't shocking at all\nI think the Democratic party is not doing themselves any favor by by moving way to the left about Obama at the time was seems like\nGehring Lee far west but that's that's about as far west as they really should Barrett to go they really should stay out of all this transgender stuff they should really stay out of this open\nBorders stuff they should stay away from abolish ice they should stay away from the Medicare for all of all the stuff that they're doing is not helping them at the polls and as a Republican Party as a result is is in its strongest position since the Nineteen twenties\nWhich is astounding which is astounding for the opposition that it is had 'em and the the the flaws or that it is that as well it's it's amazing that it is this

myself\nYou know\nOne of us is deeply deeply mistaken because he was saying you know this is this is this election is about Cabot all this election is about the caravan this election is about um ah shutting people up\nThis election is about tax cuts\nAnd I thought yeah that's that's really what this is about that is what this is about\nAnd they of course are saying you know those are just dog

what's wrong with you\nYou just don't see it\nOr are you is your philosophy sill upside down from traditional American or economics in philosophies that we are now on the other side of the fence

is a there is a procedure that you're pushing for 'em to hold these countries responsible and get them involved in stopping it can you explain\nWhat happened was that the Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley and I sent a letter to they had took a department of homeland security and the department of state suggesting that they work out like cream it with Mexico\nA whereby a\nMexico would require people to enter Mexico let's say from Honduras or from El Salvador or from\nAny of these other countries in Central America where a lot of these people are going from\nWhat the intent of claiming asylum that they would have to claim asylum in Mexico rather than the United states\nWould be similar to an agreement that we already have in place with Canada and a rule imposed by the EU refugees are arriving in Eu countries from Syria in other words when people were fleeing\nA ... a country that dangerous to them that is particularly hostile towards them or some particular racial such that they have an asylum claim\nThey ought to apply for asylum in the first country they reach that could be potentially safe here that should be Mexico\nIsn't that normally what happens I mean I thought that when you wanted asylum I thought I personally I think the United states government should be running ads do not come to America with your family because you will be turned away if you're in danger come to the closest to us embassy\nAnd apply for asylum I mean why are we die thought that was what we always do\nYeah it should be more like that and that's not really how it works and that ... in order to these people end up applying for asylum with Mexico or\nSort of going for the long bomb ill Mary pass and try to make it all the way the United states but this jury is itself a interest this journey that so\nI'm right with opportunities for people to be exploited uh it it can exceptionally dangerous journey for many people especially for children and for young women many of whom are sexually assaulted\nDuring the ... and a lot of people claiming asylum turn out not to be able to make the case that they're even eligible for asylum but once they're in the United states it makes it\nMuch more difficult to get them back and we think at the asylum application that they're coming by land from Mexico ought to be made to Mexico as they enter Mexico\nI talked to a great guy but the other day and he said that he thought Mexico was working on something with the UN to put some sort of a camp there in Mexico for these refugees have you heard anything about that\nI have not but I don't think that sounds like a a great idea I think that could become a another potential magnet agree for bringing people here um if the idea is to facilitate that journey specifically the jury\nFrom somewhere else in Central America to the United states that could become more of a problem again ... you nailed it quite a few minutes ago and saying that the humanitarian crisis that we have to be focusing on here really is a crisis with the refugees themselves having to make this long dangerous journey and then knowing that when they get\nHere the odds are pretty high that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event at this creates a whole lot of headaches for them in the process\nSo Mike I gotta I got an um an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and then a born and raised native or in Honduras\nSaid been following the news or on the caravan here locally or been also a fan of your show watch your show and I have to applaud
