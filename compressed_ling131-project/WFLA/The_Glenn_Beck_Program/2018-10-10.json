I mean 'cause I felt a lot of tea partiers going to the Supreme Court in banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the walls of the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things because they're both were supposed to be in a civil society\nRight I Am I trying to remember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers uh chased down with their children you know and the homemade signs how many people they chase down in restaurants and surrounded cannot think of one exam in fact\nIf you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do during the health care bill\nShe and a was a John Lewis marched out in to the crowd in to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't do you remember\nThey tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things\nThrow gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to they were trying to get the Tea Party to become of violent mob they didn't\nCan you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington D. C. would not have been pretty it would not have been pretty and by the way I mean you know you can\nTalk about some of these things I mean ... ... ... that's not a mob they're charging cities and they're taking over that's ... that's a riot that is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob police look it up in the dictionary find though let's let's make sure we\nKnow what we're talking about mob\nMob a large crowd of people especially one that has this orderly and intent on causing trouble or violent okay and and the quote is a mob of protesters that their usage so\nIs this not a disorderly crowd of people that are trying to ... percent on causing truck in tenth on causing trouble\nI mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not the only thing trouble I mean if you're going to go down that road I guess in that ... that doesn't does it say there and unless you're right\nIt just says intent on causing trouble right it doesn't say you know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying\nThough is that the media does not see harassing conservatives\nAs causing trouble correct that is the issue correct they see this as a correct that that's like the you know there it's basically a you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good for the people you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that [laughter] things better yeah [laughter] I mean they are by the Irish guy who runs this all ...

how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books and outrage kind of a nice time to talk about outrage\nWe did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime and rage an outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about how Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is Dan's response is I mean that just said I'll just say I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of\nPeople feel like I Know you are there's a lot of built up\nOutrage that is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center\nA well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage or and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your\nComments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world like for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again I I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution\nAround the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture the whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll do he was in the end victorious\nBut he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution\nUh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings they're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts\nOpened we're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment and you know not every we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation of space there challenges\nBut this is our moment in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart and some stats we observe new statistics and each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian ... a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nAre outraged cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our\nCable news network or we don't need to be a shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he he was in the temple and he turned over tables\nBut he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around they give us American Woman at the well\nAnd I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to get like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know we don't stand up for things don't I mean when you said\nYour fight but you fight or I you know for example or you can't war at a people\nAnd reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're user title were addicted to outrage right now\nAnd I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly to not participate in creating photo and false crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\n... you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know are trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate we're actually making progress\nAnd somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are ... it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us and I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life you know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the goes those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them yeah and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot\nIn Christians in the age of outrageous is to I used to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some\nApproach and and and gun for what's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenge a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important that we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all\nJust strategic lean new losing but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses and Jesus and\nWe take Jesus Moses out who are we modeling remodeling who are we striving to be we cannot forget our art type [noise] back in just a second\nFirst let me tell you about gold line a President Trump has been a warning about the risks to every American if the Republicans lose one or both

global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate goes you know Victor is right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about trying to hold back the advance of course that he's a
