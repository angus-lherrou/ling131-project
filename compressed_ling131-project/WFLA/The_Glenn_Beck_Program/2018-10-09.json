Mike\nA navy veteran who just retired here in twenty sixteen and then I'm assuming open to the store bricks and many figs tell us what bricks and many figs is all about\nWell first thanks for having me this morning a bricks and manufacturers of lego store we buy sell trade everything lego where the after market for all lego products and birthday parties to ladle theme birthday parties\nOr when I was in the navy and I'd go on deployments all time not have young kids when I got back from deployment they wouldn't recognize me I'd be a stranger living in the house again but we use lego to reconnect\nOr there is a bricks and many figs located in Hawaii So you take my kids to the store and I you know just the way for us to bond together when I close my naval retirement I thought hey what can I Do that I can do with my family you know so I said hey why don't I Try starting a bricks and many fix by\nThe way this was on Facebook Katie is a video showing it right now as we speak and you'll get a look at it at um ... right now\nSo what was that bonding process like to go through and and what made it special for you you know putting together these ... which takes a while it doesn't happen just you know in a couple of minutes is a pretty a pretty big pieces of light or whatever you have your ships and and monsters\nWhatever that is that from Star Wars it looks like a we have the the eighty eighty\nFrom Star Wars and that's actually motorized so it uh let's see if we can get it walking\n'cause that's not something you can just build and a couple of minutes with your kid that's going to take some time and you really get up on that thing is moving correct and that's one of the good things it's a so when you get back from six months away when you're a kids are really young you really are stranger living in the house again and uh but when you when you have a have a activity\nThat takes a lot of time like building lego together then you slowly go from being a stranger that's living in the house and being their father again 'cause it's a it's an activity that kids can do on their own so it's their thing but they also need help and that's where the stranger slashed father comes into it so it was a way for us to\nThose other devices that you've cooked up here I mean this is something you've got to check it out on Facebook right now\nSo there goes the motorized eighty eighty\nI brought a there's also a star wars a ship it's a first order transporter is what it's called a reason and brought this is because it looks like the first ship I was ever stationed on which was in LA Jay an amphibious aircraft carrier\nOr so that ship we could actually flood out the back would put about twenty feet of water into the back of the ship much land and crafts launched the Marines out much land a craft out of there\nAt the same time a landing helicopters on top and carriers the jets a takeoff vertically in Berkeley\nSo that's one of my favorite ones right there ... now how long did that take to make a this one came in on trade so came in already built how long would that date to me that would probably take me a few days and if I was doing it with my kids probably a few weeks\nWhich is good because that kind of you know that makes that process a little longer we could spend more time with your kids\nYes yep and that's one of the that's one of the beauty of it in the joys of it when I'm looking out over there see I brought in an eagle with the sailor flying on the eagle and I have Wolverine on there because I used to run off in the navy runoff coffee and stress so\n... it was my nickname and the navy was over in the ass and might have had a temper back in the day [laughter] but now it's round runoff happiness and lego enjoy so it's working out\nPretty well ... do you see what they brought for us but they made a ... for the four of us right here and we got the nine Seventy WFL a logo on it on Facebook Live here you've got Katie Jeff jak myself we're all here [laughter] and Katie's the one with the long hair\nA much better looking as a lego [laughter] that is what is it big thing over there\nAre so we have the dragon which isn't a jog goes really big right now so this is one of the one of the ...

at nine o'clock hurricane Michael has been upgraded this morning it's now a category ... storm with maximum sustained winds of one hundred miles per hour\nWaving your finger or waving the flag as the western world burns\n\nI Do not want to be part of the problem in America and I fail on that all the time we all do\n\nBut what counts he's the effort what counts is are you crying are you crying\nAnd are you better today than you were yesterday\nHave you found any answers or are you only shouting things down\nOr you just out in the street directing traffic\nYou feel it's your right well have you even look at what you're\nRights mean where do your rights even come from\nToday I saw I think progress write a whole article about how the constitution has failed that was the headline the constitution has failed and then it goes on to explain how it is really a slavery document\nAnd the three fifths in the constitution all lies all lies\nNow you can argue that or we can begin to teach our children you can argue that and you can throw it back in their face with some sort of ... your\nName calling of some sort [noise]\nHere's the question that we all have to answer is America a force for good or a force for bad\nThat requires real thought and discussion because it is neither in my opinion it is both it has been a force for bad and I warn you if we leave the bill of rights we will become\nThe darkest force ever on earth with our technology we will make the Nazis look like rookies make no mistake\nWe have been bad we have rounded up the Japanese we rounded up the Germans and the Italians we rounded up the blacks\nWe told people they couldn't vote including women\nBut we're also the people that freed the people we free the blacks and we fought for it we fought and died\n\nWe fought to free the Japanese\n\nWe've brought to free the Germans and all of Europe and the world we fought to free Russia from the tyranny of communism\n\nAnd we failed in the time of peace\n\nAre we good or are we bad is the declaration of independence still a viable mission statement because that's all that is\nThe declaration of independence is a mission statement period do we still hold these truths to be self evident forget about the past\nLet's talk about the future we have never ever reached the heights demanded by our mission statement\nBut have we gotten better is it still worth striving for\nWe hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that means we're born equal we all have an equal chance don't judge somebody by the color of their skin but by the content of their character who you have\nYou have everything the baby laying next to you has when you were born\nAs far as human rights and dignity\n\nDo you still believe that and I'm not talking about well or not the way I Am asking you as an aspirational mission statement that is the mission statement of our country\nDo you want to live in a country that's bribes and falls short but picks itself back up again\nDo you want to live in a country that says all men are created equal and they are endowed by their creator why would you have to throw God into it\nToo I don't care what you put there it just must be bigger than man the reason why the creator is important\nIs if you don't have something bigger than man then man we'll print\nAnd take away rights so if you want to see them please turn into these look great cause most whatever\n\nBut he didn't doubts each of us with certain on changeable rights and those rights are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness\nNow there's a lot more and that's where the bill of rights comes in do we still believe in this as an aspirational\nStatement we're only talking about the past\nWe're talking about the mistakes of the past\nYou cannot fix the mistakes of the past with out saying\nWhere we're going so where are we going to fall you want to terrorists down there now I read your website I read your mission statement I strongly disagree\nCapitalism is not the problem capitalism that is that has no moral sentiment is but you don't fix that by a state run economy\n\nBy co ops it's always fails now you and your allies in the press refused to point out that that is exactly what you're looking for it's a failed system\nThis one has been this one has failed us because it has been usurped the constitution no longer means anything the bill of rights no longer means anything why\nBecause it's not talk to anymore anybody who takes the oath of office in Washington Ninety percent of them are liars not even not even intentional liars\n\nThey don't know it they don't believe in it they will tell you they do as was\nTold to me by a very powerful individual once look land we all believe in the constitution but you know you gotta do what you gotta do no\nNo\nYou do not to do what you have to do that the ends justify the means we either believe in this or we do not and that is the question America do you believe\n\nNeutral half assed not sought out\nSitting on the sidelines all of those answers mean nothing in the end only those who know it who understand it who have done their homework who can intellectually defend it\n\nThose are the winter soldiers those will be the ones that restore freedom for all mankind\nEverything else is lip service a game and actually a tool in the hands of those

Glenn how are you good how are you\nDoing well so what can you you you mentioned earlier that are really the opposition to the people leading this leadership but the Democrat Party or or we'll have this right Nineteen eighty four was the inter Korean out a party and what I see happening with my friends on the on the left his they're our party members they\nWork every day and not involved in politics but they get sucked in on social media and being manipulated and it's a huge chunk of the American population being being a cold or the left\nAgree and I want to hear your thoughts on that uh I think you're absolutely right and it's why we have to be a difference and unusual and ... year people I'm On uh the Internet because if they see if all they see our people on the right punching back the people on the left\nAnd both sides suck while they're they're going to stick with what they know if they are seeing\nTheir side being unreasonable\nViolent if you see ... the way to answer ... is not with uh the militant people it will come out of the Nazis to come out and find them in the streets\nThat is the moment before we lose our humanity that is the moment that Martin Luther king walks through and chest\nIt's peaceful and gentle and you don't strike back it works at this point but at this point is going to slip away quickly as we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer a A R a Judeo Christian country\nWith those kinds of peaceful values you miss the moment and then it just becomes you know either communism socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group\nYou have to act while they're still is a Judeo Christian value and we're losing it quickly\nSo to get to the far left will never do that\nBut get to the people like you're talking about you have to develop ways to be peaceful and not part of that angry crowd it's what I've talked about for Twenty years there's going to come a point where everybody's going to be running in a certain direction and you're gonna have to have your credibility\nYour kindness you're gonna have to be able to stand up and say no wait don't don't go that way you're not going to stop the whole crowd\nBut you'll be able to stop enough thanks Anthony will send you a book or let me go to a Heather in Virginia hello Heather you're on the Glenn Beck program\nHi Glenn how are you I'm very good\n[noise] um I overall agree with every book I think it's awesome and I want to talk about kind of a minor point I guess okay you're you're um\nYou're talking about how am I going to come in and you know replace almost all the jobs and and I know you don't necessarily agree with every I bet you've said that we need at least how that conversation about ... because of it\nAnd I you know I think we need to be careful about even\nI'm considering the I I think that there really is fear over a I to try to come in and ... that's ... yeah I think that they want to push ups are socialism\nI think that a guy um well it will certainly changed everything obviously you know we've run into this in the past and all the other\nTechnical right I'm not ... ... where ... you know the ... they were afraid that technology what's going to come and direct place their ... their problem correct and so um I understand\nThat hey I is definitely coming and it's going to change things but it's not going to take over everything all the jobs you know in addition obviously to the people that want to create a\nMachine that they are running you know there are certain things I just can't like I'm being a fixing a leak in or climbing in her house probably not going to do that\nUm as far as service obviously I think McDonald's is a great example where am I yeah I don't think people are going to be upset if they go into McDonalds and not have to deal with anyone that chick fillet isn't known for their service and I ... that\nLet me ask you this let me ask you first of all just and I believe there's a don't mean any offense or anything I just want to know um how up to speed you are on this or ... or ... what books are you reading on AI ... or you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general if I could not than tape work unless I'm so I'm coming just for you know different perspectives are having done that research that I Know that you have sure on that but you know just my feeling like a\nA I was going to absolutely they all to diagnose cancer um quicker and more accurately than a doctor but are you going to want to sit in front of a robot and have the robot tell you that you have cancer and cleaner options\nCase so Heather are there is a very and I can't remember the name of it on the on this particular subject but I Will look for it uh there is a whole book based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in someone and being able to reflected in face the reason why\nI'm a ... that we don't connect with robots is because they cannot see our emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection\nUm it's going to take a while but it while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world ah and I think that's a long while I'm so there there are those are those the ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment that no one has to work\nThat everyone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made yes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that true a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to\nGo through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died\nThey'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message much better and much more personal than anyone else\nThe bigger problem is on a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about three four years ago [noise] the uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board\nAnd what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that has seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it's it's I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please\nSo you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen before\nAnd we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty and the world will not be like it is today you started your comment about the section of the book where I Know there's a chapter where I talk about ... universal basic income\nI Am against universal basic income I Do not think that that is the way we should go\nBut we as conservatives must be willing to listen to the debate and I'm not talking about the people who are socialist

our answer forward [noise]\nLet me start by telling you about the seven\nAm on the high school teacher a mother of three boys three one boy I Am a higher strength\nI was a police officer in Arlington policemen Virginia for thirty seven years\nI've wanted their politics to be very very different\nI Would be probably considered a constitutional conservative\nI find the older that I get the more

different\nThough yes Schott dynamic cloth and kids are not yet a shot down I'm I'm a retired navy combat pilots\nHave guns in our home they're locked out I've never seen them I don't want to see them ... started shooting I just say my dad and his redneck buddies out in the country [noise]\nLeast seven words thoughtful well informed good hearted people who all agreed to spend an entire evening talking to people they didn't even know why to come up with a list and I wanted to find a link and even if it was a very short one\nOf specific practical things that we could all agree upon to help combat this intangible threat to our kids that we all think of them from time to time\nAn intangible threat that Alicia\nOr teacher in the room explain from the perspective of being inside the schools each and every day\nI'm any time there is any sort of anything out of the norm at school and the kids get weird they get upset and he's just a feeling among the entire school\nThan something I'd finally wrong and I think it all over the country I think that you hear and noise in the hallway when you're ISIS quiet and everyone had turn [noise]\nWith that awareness we began talking the story of that conversation has two parts the content that dumped up with that and then the impact what happened because of what was said so content\nAs we searched for the list for almost four hours I'd like to share with you the three biggest impediments we came up against because in this new era of communicating and communication I think there was considering remember same children same goal\nImpediment number one opinions outnumber people I Do realize that in this age of unlimited access to opinion that although there were seven people physically sitting around me there were many more opinions and voices brought into our conversation\nListened to the following exchange between two mothers and I'm a progressive and\nMona a Christian conservative\nAnd see how many people's opinions and perspectives are brought into the ... other than their own\nFrom my side what I hear in [noise]\nOh you don't infringe on any of my right and I don't want any restrictions on myself and it's kind of and I'm not going to send my child but this is kind of a bank that's been in place\nLike come on there are reasonable idea if we can come up with that ... going to inconvenienced\nBy and you're right there are probably solutions there and you are reasonable but that the leaders of the movement or not reasonable that that fact why is that when there's a school shooting last shooting someplace the first things we hear\nWhen a gun control and they enter a is a bad\n[noise]\nSo many other opinions and voices most of them extreme jumped right into our conversation on mid thirty nine everything was

would like to think that you know when I see the ultra liberal you know screaming about all this stuff and calling people like me and gotten nuts and all that\nI Would like to think that that's not representative and yeah so how do we solve that problem with getting these people to stopping the ones that are out there trying to send a message because it's for me I think it's the wrong one and it's not productive\nI became aware very quickly that it's almost impossible to have a productive conversation with so many other voices reference to repeat it\nHow can I get each person just to speak
