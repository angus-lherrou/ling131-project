very clear crystal clear not our problem zero aid to Mexico\nWhen they go in that\nInstance the time you\nTo appreciate Donald Trump [noise] because Donald Trump will stand against this now let me ask you when's\nThe last time you saw Seventy five hundred people a mass with another flag to cross a border I Would\nSay it would probably have to be if you were in the military crossing into Iraq from Kuwait\nNow\nDo you remember the reason why we had to wait to go into a right you just don't land in go\nBecause you need to logistics\nAnd the logistics of moving a crowd that size is a nightmare otherwise it becomes a death march because people are going to get tired they're going to fall they're going to be dehydrated you don't stop at a seven eleven\nWith Seventy five hundred people to get some water\nWhere's just the water coming from where where is the emergency aid for those who are falling ill along the way ...\nWhere are they going to the bathroom have you ever gone to a McDonalds as you're traveling across the country and a tour bus has just pulled in and that has fifty people in and you're like oh jeeze\nYou ain't going to the bathroom there\nIf Seventy five hundred people rolling the town where all the bathrooms that they're using where are you stopping for food ...\nNobody's controlling logistics\nWow media this is truly spontaneous\nAnd on miracle I'm expecting God depart the borders for them because God surely must be involved to keep them alive for this exodus away from pharaoh\nOn believable\nWe welcome to the program Mr pat gray hello pat\nWow the hatred I just was a party to just was\nDeluged [laughter] as as I Know I Know I Know wow what does the president do I you know ... the only thing you can do is send the military where do you what do you suppose said eight to cut it all you have held on right now but if they ran out of here if they get here the military is the only solution you\nCan't let them in no way it's Seventy five hundred people look at they they try to handle it on the southern Mexico border yeah they ... they ... they just rushed into yeah\nSo if I could do my CNN impersonation briefly so what you're asking for them to just start shooting and killing all the people [laughter] that's what that's what\nThere is no riot riot police ah with tear gas and yes if you have to rubber bullets yes sometimes those hurt\nI Know they don't well the well the well and you know ... some people might die some people might die don't come over here yeah don't do it okay we have let's just say this we have Seventy five hundred people\nThat want to release people out of our prisons and\nSo they're just going to rush the gates Seventy five hundred people what do the officers do\nDo they try to fight them off does the does the criminal justice system sending more troops and tried to fight those people from storming the gates and opening up our prisons\nWell we wouldn't want that to I mean some people could get hurt\nWhat do you what are we talking about\nWell if they're Seventy five hundred people and they want to go into a small town and Rob every single restaurant\nTruck stop bank because they're Seventy five hundred of them\nAnd there's not enough police in these small towns\nWhere we just going to let them take all of the money or do we say no this is a mob this is a a group of Seventy five hundred people who are stating they are going to break the law and they've already done it\nAnd they're just crossing in an overwhelming\nWhat did we would never let anybody do that to any other thing why would we allow them into our country we wouldn't let them into our towns just to\nJust to take over our towns we would we would never allow this to happen can you imagine have you seen just the waste and the garbage left behind you know it's amazing they are just crashing everything along the way what\nAre we supposed to put up with that too you just come into our town and just crash it and then we have to clean up the mess after you\nAnd the question not being asked enough is why are there are so many young men not an older\nAge ... already four year old you know no no no no those are just women young women and children that are\n... forced to look like in like ... year old men yeah yeah who should be defending their own country yeah who should be making their neighborhoods better who should be fighting for their own country\nHave you noticed how have you noticed how the media is just calling these guys migrants\nYeah and knocked Marxist protestors because that's what this is this is a Marxist protest\nTheir their Marxist government which was in bed with the Castros in Cuba and manure oh in Venezuela they were ousted in a coup because they were destroying the country they were ousted\n... has done in Venezuela correct same thing\nSo they were ousted what happened they get pissed off\nThey start coordinating with the door Owen Castro and the ousted president they have been disrupting their own country now they want\nPublicity they want this to be a world stage and so they started coming up towards America They're not looking for a jobs they're not looking for a better life this started as three thousand people who wanted to make a Marxist\nPoint too embarrassed their own country because they got rid of a Marxist dictator\nWe're just going to we're fine with that we're just fight with these people coming in really what will they do if they did get jobs and decide to live here what kind of what kind of philosophies are they bringing with them\nAll the media doesn't care about any of that you know the Democrats don't care about any of that of course not hear about because they ... they just want them here as voters already they're sending out to all these registration forms in Texas the Democrats are in Texas set out but voter registration forms to illegals\nAll over the state inviting them they've already filled out the the uh citizenship box Bush get they check the S. and sent this out to non residents all over the uh all over the state\nThere's we had like governor is to increase their power base we have the governor of the state coming on and just a minute we have Greg Abbott's coming out in about ten minutes or we're going to talk a little bit about the uh the massive rally for Ted Cruz and Donald Trump ah yesterday in Houston it was\nUnbelievable and the massive turnout but this is in Harris County which is Houston Dallas County which is Dallas those are blue areas and in a massive turnout massive turnout or if the the red parts of the state don't actually turned out\nThis state could be in big trouble because it is a massive\nTurnout is there any thought a with a caravan of just learning from our friends to the south\nAnd what we do is we just let people come in and we just kinda guide them until they get all the way to Canada and they're walking north would they'd never that necessarily they're stopping here a candidate beautiful this kind of your time of year we didn't kind of it's kind of walk on the side of the streets and just kind of having them and we would\nThey're still counting at least seven thousand people from Central America are traveling through Mexico President Trump is calling the caravan and saw that in our country telling a rally in Houston last night\nAnd you have some very bad very bad [noise] and we can't let that happen to our country\nThe president has threatened to cut or reduce aid to central\n... he's also alerted the U.S military and border patrol ... to be about one thousand miles away from the

I I Want to talk to you about a couple of things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive turnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas uh ... what does this or what does this tell you and house that turn out the rally around the rest of the state\nWell this may be frustrating because the true answer is it's too early to tell right here's what we don't know and and that is is this safe ... running of what the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote or for your listeners what we're saying with regard to the turnout is a ... records are not just for mid term elections which is what the stairs or but in many of these locations are the first day of voting exceeds\nThe amount of those that took place in the presidential election on the very first day and so all we know is is is that is a massive number of people are turning out to vote will notice part but do mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan that's coming up here and we want to make sure we're supposed to be critical to do something to stop it\nUh but here's all I can tell your audience and that is if you care about the future of Texas it would be clear about the future of America or you could not sit on the sidelines this election we're because there are other people out there who are casting those who might be hostile to you and your values your values\nMust be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this me to make sure you go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo a governor and a lot of times people have said yeah that's the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I I always hated that praise\nBut in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say you know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing a ... a election is it not\nHe captured the U.S it was very correctly because it used to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats are either ran under do label or they would call themselves a conservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and then they were progressive\nAnd now they're openly or lifting themselves as\nSocialist and and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor in Florida a as an out and now that he says as a socialist and and the Bernie Sanders style of socialism is not even further to the lab at the same thing is happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas\nOr some people may not be calling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as the open quarter policies\nThat is so super as a with a look at the uh wealth distribution policy that is so she lives in the Hitler people don't realize and that is socialism is real out there that we see it in Venezuela where the reported inflation rate and Venezuela is over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nI don't I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue there's ... there's only a few counties that are really a a lynchpin here and ah the you know unbeknown to most people is Soros has dumped\nMillions of dollars into this state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing and so many of your listeners need to understand this letter to George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles are two years ago he gave a half a million dollars or directly to a candidate in Harris County down in Houston\nBut this year we paid a million dollars directly\nTo candidates in San Antonio on top of that ... has funded these ground game stick it out the vote and so he used quite a turn Texas a into California and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for candidates like that\nSo uh but let's go back to the first part of your questions and listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really\nBlew cities and blue counties you have\nA Dallas year after year that we have San Antonio you have often you have El Paso and so you have these massive\nRegions across the state of Texas that makes it so much harder for people who are

I think you should all these things you are innocent until proven yet at the same and charges against Cory Booker right one person making\nYou know and then there's people making these things about every ... every month which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man made an editor ... well we don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations correct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them right um so you know\nThat's the way I think you're supposed to head let's why innocent until proven guilty of thing\nAnd I think with not only a Cory Booker but also also Keith Ellison I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism by\nThe time these relationships break up and there's things that and who knows there's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing what would they were talking about with capital and everyone you know half the country\nYou believed Cavanaugh I should be you know I don't put in prison for what happened so what's interesting here is the Democratic party has completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to keep up with a they don't care about it he thousand can do it every once they've completely ignored these allegations\n... it was fascinating if the people of Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happen latest poll came out he now trails forty three to thirty six he's now down by seven points\nSoda wow\nThis is a powerful Democrat one of the top people from the DNC a very well known is on TV all the time\nAnd he's she's credible she's a Democrat she doesn't have an axe to grind Jimmy\nDated him for a very long time there's video there's witnesses there's Dr reports at the time uh and she again is a very reluctant witness who doesn't want to hurt the Democratic party she'd rather have Allison on another Democrat when she doesn't write your phone into it for I mean it's just crazy\nYeah it's an amazing wants to that one forty three thirty six is a surprise I mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they thought they had Alison running for that post they thought they had that wrapped up a instead is forty three thirty six so right now we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go ah there's a if you're looking at\nRight now a forty a four feet are that are\nSafe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have a few it's forty six excuse me forty ... if you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you can get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races that includes a Tennessee which is\nStill very close to poll came out yesterday that had the Democrat up by one point though the overall it looks like a Republican is still a head there are black burned and then in Texas so leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer then you get a few ... a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got to another six races that are toss ups that going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can go three of six they're going to be at fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they if they can pull off six of six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things passed a so\nYou know at that level of whether it's a him and they could lose it to they could easily still lose it it's possible\nBut that level of between fifty and fifty six is is kind of what we're talking about now and that you know that is a big difference uh so could be a major thing especially if you can hold on to the house which looks a little bit better than it did a couple of weeks ago but it's still on the unlikely side [noise]\nElection by numbers\nOn the program over twenty third there is that going back program\nAll right what I Would take a break and we'll tell you about our spots and come back and I'm going to tell you about\nI mean there's a real problem and you haven't even considered it to really know well you know that which is er out putting ...

with the Honduran flag in protest that their Marxist government was ousted in Honduras\nWhat what do you call them as they're marching towards our border\nThey chose to leave their country they're fine in their country they were trying to get a do a political stunt\nSo what what are these people where did they get the money\nWho's doing the supply chain how how do you even have the bathroom services all along the way\nWho's providing medical aid so it's not a death march you can't march twenty five hundred miles and expect everybody to be okay and in good health when they arrive\nThings happen\nWhat do who's providing medical aid who's providing the water who's providing the trucks that so far we haven't seen anywhere else we aired them yesterday on the news and why it matters in fact Sarah I don't know if we have this video\nBut if we could play this a video or if you have it the the video of a these migrants being loaded up into giant semi trucks they're being trucked from place to place from\nPhoto opportunity to photo opportunity you pointed this out there that I I didn't notice it initially but there's there's women walking with strollers\nAnd it's like well strollers not designed for a thousand mile walk down by like that's not how that happens in them or they're getting out there grouping up their racking for a couple of miles cameras get them then they get back in trucks and get an injury that Dr\nLook at the ... video getting role that video again please tell me how many women use spot climbing into the back of the semi truck\n[noise] just count them even just count them as of right now as to how the er well you know all of them counted right one all of them counted one ... one one and he said and by the way just to clarify you want you want me to individually point out the women that are women that are quite a big crowd but the women that you can see that the one there was an a on the um\n[noise] one Mm okay now so this isn't women and children who are these people are\nWe know that MS MS Thirteen now has embedded the people in to this group I mean now Seventy five hundred people\nAnd I want to play some audio uh this is ... let me see if I can get the right one ah\nYeah I think it's a I think it's CNN and Cuomo can you play this here on what the military is going to do\nWhat we look it's not about whether you're going to have the right to do it that's why I waved away the idea about domestic law enforcement Rick if you're put military down there we know what the God Forbid is in this situation and then how does it play\nHow was that good for anybody if cars you know you're not going to turn away thousands and thousands of people even if people start getting shot ... and what message does that send who wins and but I don't think they're going to wind up in the country a wreck and can I don't think that it has to happen that way but I'll tell you what if you have if you have a must happen\nWhat do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be here and you have to chase them around and process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who were coming in ... worse for America can\nYes ... you're you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in at entry points and it's a turn them away right there it's an invasion treated as an invasion turn way\nYou say there's an invading force these people they're not legally\n[noise] now the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is not an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor people away and I want you to listen\nWhat were you waiting for they put the cameras in and the people who work at simply say put them in their house and they said I feel uncomfortable because you never know if the cameras on or not most people say put a little alley the light on it\nThey didn't like that they decided they had to put a shutter on it and then they started looking for shutters that would make the right noises so when and when did you catch and closed you could hear it and then they had to find the right material that could do it you know five thousand times without any kind of wear and tear on it\nThat's the work that simply say puts into your system you own it and there is no contract for the

someone else a gang rapist without proof\nJust recently not a problem I thought that was okay now I thought that was fine and with him is Thirteen they are getting rapists we know they are\nCertainly some of them are for sure well I think that's part of any anger and some of them are rapists yeah I think that's part of the thing of getting in you have to you have to rape to to join the rape and kill\nA pass on this year's the subscription I I don't need the member sugar free though all you have to do ... you know thing no thank you kill is what are they going to go a different direction okay has MS twelve available you know no no they're driven out on [laughter] yeah yeah I mean that's the I mean\nYou know we've talked about this before I miss Thirteen the United states constantly is is this is just Donald Trump fever tree was nothing is not a big deal where they're killing people at four times the rate as of school shootings so if you think MS Thirteen isn't an issue you probably don't think school shootings or an issue\nWhich I tend to hear a lot of people on the left speak very loudly ... about school shootings when they go on and what exactly is that cause uh for them so I mean I like ... the real issue I mean and this goes to a deeper part of this which is\nYou it's not even if let's just say we thought they were all really good people we didn't know that there are any gang members in there that's to say that again come in that way you don't come in that way the that you have to have a process to be able to decide whether people should come into your country or not\nThat it's not are not hateful they've if you have a problem if you look at our if you look at you know a\nBlack Friday and say oh my gosh people are animals getting into a Wal Mart\n... that's what this is going to be Seventy five hundred people try and just to push through an opening those doors\nThat's all I Do and I lived as Black Friday Wal Mart says it going to be fascinating to watch because there was a good chance that you know as as Greg Abbott talked about that you know Mexico doesn't want to deal with the pressure from the United states and the shoes issue they're going to try to find a place to settle them within Mexico so it's a good outcome\nThat are not on our borders 'cause you know what that is that's the Palestinian\nPeople yeah but we don't we don't know I mean I think the point of doing that it's uh not anger us right so you would think that they would do it in a way to avoid that and ever and UN's going to be very helpful\nAgain I mean the governor tech I I Know I Know that so I Know I I Know the only reason to believe it's possible but let's see if it doesn't happen and they get here and try to over on the border\nThis thing is going to be a mess because you'll have the media making it look like our our border guard are are are National Guard of the worst people on earth and are not going to stand for it\nAnd I got a van for Seventy five

students with a hidden camera\nProsecutors say the forty nine year old Marc ... had hundreds of photos and videos of girls he videotaped when they tried on clothes for a fashion design class at Bloomingdales high school\nA minute aggregated into one place and really led to band together and so that when the blaze promotes opting Prager you and conservative review and Breitbart benefits and likewise when they share something you guys been offended um so it's really the app is I'm going to come out later this week on\nGoogle Play and the app store but it's the twenty first century version of Drudge Report it is for conservative video content um that's out there that's being pushed to the side and and hidden by these tech company\nWhat platform you're keeping it all on what do you what do you I mean you're going to Google Play I mean you're going going right into the hands of the beast or what are you doing to ensure that they they aren't um screwing with you and gathering information on on everybody else well what we were trying to\nDo is I've heard a lot of people on our side say we need a conservative Facebook or we need a conservative Twitter yeah so what we're trying to do is find a realistic work around to the algorithm problem that's going on with some conservative content so we said\nYou know we can find all these great conservative publishers and say hey here's what we wanted to do we can all benefit from this by sharing content into one place on the video side everyone can benefit\nUm so yeah we will be at the mercy of Google Play and the apple store but I think this is a sort of the first step to be able to counter\nThat suppression from YouTube and Facebook so who do you have on board so far so we have a conservative review we've talked to Breitbart we had a great meeting with Prager you last week they're on board obviously the blaze I Hope you guys come aboard as well\nAs the first time hearing of it but I Can't imagine we're not\nYeah so and what we're really doing is you know we're pulling the content from your Facebook page and from your YouTube so\nAh the blaze channel benefits because the view talents go back to you guys\nAnd the other thing that we wanted to do I'm In this where we're already starting to be introduced to other people so we have these great young conservative filmmakers who put out an amazing video content and no one sees it on YouTube or Facebook and so we said hey will be the platform for that you go out and produce it and then we'll work with our team at our network to make sure that\nUm you know half the country that wants to see this content can actually see your content\nSo what do you think because I've done a lot of thinking on this uh first of all congratulations thanks um uh it is um [noise]\nThis is something that I have wanted to do for about eight years and I think conservatives\nAre just now starting to say\nHey wait a minute what was that idea about coming together um because they're starting to see the writing on the wall or in many different directions or so congratulations on doing that I fully support anybody who is trying to bring everybody together and protecting voices [noise]\nWhat do you say I'm to the objection that I have in my mind when people say we need a conservative Facebook\nNo we don't because that just puts us in another bubble right you know what I mean we need to be a if if it's known as a conservative thing only conservatives are going to go there so how have you wrestled with that in your mind\nSo I think the first pick off for that was the Facebook documentary series that I did with a swamp so we had six members of the house Freedom Caucus and we followed them around the Capitol we talked about the big issues plaguing DC\nWe had a liberal and progressive groups sharing that Facebook series So Tim Canova who ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz this as a Bernie Sanders ...\nShared the swamp episodes and said I encourage all of my followers to see this um and we did it in a way where we didn't put you know Republican or conservative next to these guys name that was all about the contest\nAnd that's what a lot of these um younger conservative filmmakers are doing their libertarian leaning you know they're conservative leaning it's more about hey let's fix some of the big fundamental issues going on and then we can get into you know some of the more policy debates\nSo I think um that kind of content and then just presenting it in a really sweet mobile application makes it easier for people to interact with the ...\nHave you ah have you seen what's happening in Brazil with the with the young libertarians you know they they are looking at America going\nYou know you can't sell that we can tell the libertarians two ... two older than you know\nAll this freedom and talk that they're doing is not a not appealing to the the youth and they are making huge gains and headway because you know they're twenty somethings that have\nWho are are naturally attracted to freedom and said there's a better way to package this I think that's great and anything you're doing to encourage a you know twenty somethings to do that I think as time they take charge\nYeah I think so I think you know having the big conservative publishers on board um an does banding together you know with this program\nWe're going to find a lot of talented people out there who are you know frustrated who are amazing videographer isn't filmmakers who may go out there and shoot this content um and let them be the bridge to reach the next ah conservative or libertarian generation\nSo ear the update dot com or let me let me I'm a switch topics with you because you know you have consulted a with candidates et cetera et cetera but do you think is coming our way to places first blue wave red wave no way\nYou might as well flip a coin so I live I it's funny I live ah three blocks behind the capital in DC so I Am I describe myself as being a spy behind enemy lines because D.C is Ninety\nFour percent Democrat and so you know I talked to a lot of guys both sides of the aisle I'm In DC and you might as well flip a coin I mean there's Freedom Caucus guys who say\nRepublicans hold the house by but it's only by a couple of seats there's more people who have said all of it you know it's going to be Democrats by a few seats\nI really don't know I I think what they are doing with the election is the media is getting so excited looking at this big national view but when you break down these individual races they are going to be far more competitive than what the media saying\nIt's always about local that as\nA the Kavanaugh saying coupled with Cortez coming out and saying you know capitalism stock got to be around forever the Democratic socialist the surrounding people while they're eating and shouting them down\nThey have the ... do you think the Democrats different than the leftist do you think that Democrats are waking up to holy cow who's in our bad\nYeah I was telling somebody earlier this week the orange he just needs to put out a video of all the people clawing at the door the Supreme Court there is a big divide I think between like the old school you know Democrats all my parents' voted Democrat I can you continue to vote Democrats\nThan what's going on in D.C and people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker I mean these are radical left is when I was filming a with a swamp out in Iowa I was in ... district and these are we went to a machine shop\nAnd these are life long you know Democrats a lot of them switched over to vote for President Trump but I'm Talking to him and they go oh you know I still you know identify as a Democrat voter so I just rattle off a couple of issues and I'm like\nI had to break into your man you're you're you're no longer for in this Democratic Party right so yeah it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out two weeks away\nHow do how do you think the president and ah the Republicans should respond to this caravan coming up stop it\nI mean I think the president's made it clear where their country of laws or not and it it you know the the ruse that they're using that this is\nUh it's amazing how well the left uses terminology to try to convey people to their side\nBecause now they're asylum seekers you know their asylum seekers or asylum seekers you apply for asylum in the first country that you arrived to which would be Mexico so it's not about that it's about getting to the United states is about sending money back to their country uh I don't\nEven know if it's about that these guys are\nThese guys are Marxist or that are upset at the the the the politicians in Honduras that kicked their Marxist a guy out who had ties to Venezuela and to Castro in Cuba\nThey've been trying to do all kinds of standing in in Honduras\nThere 'cause they're carrying the Honduran flag that these guys are Marxist radicals at least the leadership is\nI I Would have to imagine that if I was in a their situation if I was legitimately or refugee and I got to Mexico and Mexico was willing to hear my case or process may\nI Would wait in line for as long as it took the helm ... you know myself or my family for them to just break down the barricades and and charge the police officers in Mexico and say guys that you can't stop us we're going all the way the United states and right you know singing Honduras national anthem\nYeah it's not this is about politics and who's funding them yeah it's a great issue but I'm\nThe president should stand strong and stop it if they make it that far [noise]\nAll right but the or the name of the athletes launching went this week yeah launching this week you can go to the update dot com or\nYou give his email address and we'll send you early access into this week when it hits both um the apple store and Google Play\nGreat thank you very much for coming by thinks All right it's a the

dollars coming and I know that sounds crazy because we we've been printing all these dollars where are all these dollars\nWell the problem is is the government keep spending more and more dollars and the government is looking for people to buy our treasuries which is a giant loan with US dollars\nAnd so the more we spend the more dollars the government is gobbling up also because all of the banks took out loans in US dollars I'm Sorry not the banks of the other countries the emerging countries\nSome are giving slightly lower expectations about the future you combine that with fears that
