S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and it was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs or around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people\nI'm going and without leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results that's not like a news story that just stays there for people to look at it generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know Wilson and Bernays or in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that this is the\nThis is the system that they would have dreamt of for propaganda\n[noise] [noise] oh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article\nA called a can of ways big tech can shift millions of votes in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA\nThat's just one of ten ways are that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment\nAh that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before uh\nAnd they they they're I mean some of these the effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd they're ... or ... years\nAnd there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\n[noise] well into thousands sixteen early two thousand sixteen or working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what\nPeople are seeing while they were using the Google\nBang and Yahoo search engines that was the election related votes as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system and so it was a first ever created and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton who am I favored by the way as you mention\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results\nNow that's that's pretty late and that's pretty extreme flowers these leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nA you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them and uh I don't think we should be surprised\nOr that we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually\nAble to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point\nUh you know I Wish we well I Wish we could be fully up and running and time for the midterms and uh at this point I Would say that's not going to happen but\nAmazing okay um ... let's go through some of the uh ... some of the uh affects that you are monitoring we have about about a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there was the last seven ten ten of these that your followers\nCan altogether okay out and all the other okay so let's take on one real quick\nBegin very good when ... go this is called the er the search suggestion effect and when you start to\nType a search term into the Google Search bar\nYou are being manipulated from the very first character that you type so if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon\nRight away they'll start slashing suggestion that you and Amazon it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you to turn a fifty fifty vote among\nA fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety ten split\nWill buy one having any idea that they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my gosh\nOkay we're gonna come back and uh and go through the others if we have time he'll talk about some of the other things Google is doing and what we're supposed to\nDo about it you need to know about it you can see it in the ... the line\nIt's a new

companies and stuff have biases and I think that there's some evidence that they do\nUm you know but I think a lot of people are motivated by politics when they ... like that and we've seen a lot of I think that's true in a lot of cases [noise] um you know the fact that Hillary Clinton supporter\nWould do a test of the two thousand sixteen election and find\nThe results that shocking is really a major thing this this is you know he went through an actual process here this is not just some guy it's not just some blogger who thinks\nThey bought and sold this is like a lot of it as a leader in in in psychology yeah there's I mean he was the head of Psychology Today these are the head of a couple of ah research centers it's Harvard I mean this guy is the real\nDeal with some real credibility I Can't come to terms that are on the left part of it because he comes out it kind of from the moderate to se discrepancy yeah Hillary voter right right\nUm but beyond that uh seems incredibly hopeless\nTo me to stop it I mean just you know because we talk about this all the time how do we move how do we how do we convince people how do we persuade people to look at the world and ex slightly different way or at least challenge their beliefs you know someone who might be a long term you know left wing voter why wouldn't they consider a conservative approach right\nAh and we talk about that stuff all the time\nBut I Know that I can easily supporter you know a candidate that I like right like I can vote my principles easily because I just do it right it but it's harder to make other people change with the Google thing I don't know even how in my life I Would be able to an might wind myself from Google I honestly have no idea how I Would do that\nAnd I'm In I'm not even use

time I mean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know in one of the reasons they do is it's the best what\nRight like this is a problem because the ... part of the reason why it's the best one is because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right\nUm you know or the search engine obviously we all know Google is is the best one chrome is the best browser\nIt is it's better than the other ones I've ever used as it's been a you know I'm ... I mean you know it's you get into deep stuff and you but I don't even know how just why myself from the basics there how it would even do it not to mention the stuff that you know what you talked about with um certain browsers or use other uh you know at all apple products right use Google\nFor the injured search and if you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah we talked about in a lot of every time we talk about this someone will will say hey what about duct duct go duck duck goes a a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principle\nUm and when it comes to the sort of stuff but I was like you know maybe I should start using that and I went to ... go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser crap what the hell is going to make the difference if I'm searching for all this stuff in duct duct go on chrome\nSo now I've got ... I gotta switch emails I gotta switch phones I gotta switch browsers I like my whole life is turned upside down and I can't I Can't come up with enough personal\nCost to what Google is doing right now to justify a life altering move like that what did he say\nThree hundred million word yet documentary a million ...\nMillion is like a ... of of\nData on you\nAnd that ... million pages pages of data and again like but I I don't know what is the personal cost to me in that data well there's several things\nThere are some things that could turn into I think there are several things that could turn into that are really negative for society he talked about how you could take a fifty fifty proposition\nAnd just by Google suggesting one way or the other can move people to Ninety ten Ninety percent go the way that Google wants them to go that's in that's incredible it's a great argument to have real principals right make sure you actually know what you're a ... or what your feelings are on an issue before\nYou are you are influenced like this because we can see how voters do that but I mean the other part of that too is you go to a place with no cookies and no none of these things tracking you will they don't know your preferences and they don't know the things that you like and there are negatives to that\nIt is a real struggle I don't even know how it would do it if I Want it to the problem is not today\nThis is not today it's just technology is now starting to a compound upon itself exponential growth in ways that we will not be able to understand I mean\nAs the book I write about this in addicted outrage and you know use you said when you read the uh chapters on a technology I remember you came in and ... okay well that's a little bleak oh yeah\nBut I mean it fail in their right right it's it's I mean if you just heard that from a guy who's been studying Google for ten years\nAnd he's a he's a Clinton supporter or is he saying anything less than I Am saying\nNo I mean I think if anything it back that up yeah and that's that's what's terrifying because we can all look at the potential future of some sort of series of events that could go negatively and you know you've talked about that you've talked we've discussed openly sometimes you think as a catastrophe pissed right like you think of the worst case scenarios\nBut these are measured results these aren't worst case scenarios the fact that the top ten Google or is a rare search results are returning things favorable to Hillary Clinton\nIs not some wild crazy theory it's something that already happened in his over where are they now what are they doing with this now and imagine if they get over more overt we talk about you know Trump pushes a lot of buttons of people\nYou saw how they acted with Kavanaugh\nRight you saw how the left really act ... acted crazily towards the Supreme Court justice when they feel so justified\nIn the way they act they get crazier and crazier and crazier and as this stuff escalates they're gonna feel justified to take more overt action and got only knows where that ends up I I I I ... I mean it could go in really bad directions [noise] this is um uh\nWe we are entering a ten year period now where our lives you really will not recognize your country the world or our lives by twenty thirty you just will not\nIf you when you see the rage on the faces of the leaders of of the left and the Democrats and they're saying we have to get more radical remember you're already talking about a group of people that believe the ends justify the means\nYou're already talking about a group of people and let's make sure we're not like this a group of people that believe they are right to the point that the others have to just be either re educated or eliminated\nLet me ask the Democrats ... you'll have fifty percent of the country that just does not honestly seen the world the way you see it\nWe are just as set against what you believe is right if you believe that socialism is the answer capitalism should be shut down and freedom of speech needs to be curtailed\nI Am against that\nOne hundred percent and I will not comply\nSo what are you going to do with me\nAre you going to silence me at what point do you feel that you have to kill me\nThis this isn't even that this is they know they know what their sorting people for now they know who they are blocking they know that those are people who are saying I I I Believe man should be free\nAnd I don't know I mean you can make the argument right if you're a a left wing or right and you're using search results to move the people in the right the correct direction to the left to be more accommodating to all these hated groups that you believe evil people dislike\nYou know you could at least the the pathway to thinking what you're doing is just right like in America you can with China I don't know how you see it I mean I you know I said to be able to to ... to that government doing what they're doing\nIs terrified and they certainly claim to not want to support it but I don't know I mean I don't know how you do it I understand the access to that that uh that market is enticing but I mean it it seems like what you're doing is putting real people in danger\nAh I Hope we're ...
