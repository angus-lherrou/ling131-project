Smith\nAnd council couldn't get it done and if you're not familiar with already Smith who's from Tampa a was born and reared in South Tampa\nA he's a guy who basically gave his life for his country I mean he gave it it wasn't taken away from him he went out knowing who was gonna die when he went out and jumped on top of the ACC and protected his fellow soldiers there by\nA they were about to be overrun at an airport it was during the Iraq War early days of the Iraq War and he got the medal of honor and a\nA bronze silver star and also\nPurple Heart but I mean when he went out and jumped on that truck he knew he was going to die but he grabbed a machine gun and killed a bunch of the enemy before they took him down and then that is heroism at its best that's when the guy says hey I'm going to die but I'm going to die for my country\nAnd we have not really honored him a\nCongressman just below ... got in a post office name for him up in holiday but they shut down the post office some time ago so he has nothing that there might be a school that's been named after him\nBut if anybody ought to have a street named after him it would be ... Smith Smith boulevard which isn't that bad a names pretty easy to handle but something should be done on behalf of him\nAs well like you said a true American Hero oh yeah yeah I mean this is one they do movies and things about\nI mean I'm ... Murphy the actor he was a he did similar things but he didn't get killed\nOne thing to think that if you were in that situation you would do that it's another thing to actually act on it and do it and lose your life for it yeah\nBecause as soon as you go out there you are saying well I'm going to get killed but I'm going to take a bunch of these bad guys with me and that's exactly what he did and we have failed to honor him to say the least we got let's see we've got a playoff game coming up\nWhat at one o'clock today is that the wild card they start today yeah wow I'm just ready for lightning opening day on Saturday I think it's the cubs and the brewers that are today razor out Mets are out on out so\nWell I'm I'm Still following the cubs here because it's it's our buddy in Tampa a guy who

you just took one more step\nAt turning the once great state of California into the formerly great city of Detroit\nAnd\n... and ...\nI got something last night have you seen the copy by the way hello soup have you seen the a copy of um of a\nRachel ... memo yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser ah Christine afford\nShe was the she was the woman that ah was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend\nShe well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years experience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by Barack Obama is head of homeland security\nAs the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year let me say that again\nThe woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was burnt rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nSo she's not democratic hack and also not a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true she goes in her expertise is on old crimes to be able to go in and say All right how did this happen NBA wrote\nQuote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event\nAnd those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them she then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court\nNot for profit institution but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and quote\nIt's pretty significant don't you think [laughter] again like she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this uh this poor woman because she was a girl you mean ... yeah Brock Obama's ah the homeland security prosecutor sex crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility ... with the left\nYes so she's saying that it's it's it won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee this explains in my opinion why\nIt was leaked in the final hour because every one who saw this knew exactly what it was now she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute\nIt may look like she's credible or but based on what she said not how she looked\nIf you're looking at what she said her story falls apart\nThe most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred and we're not talking about the difference of a few days according there's this this is from her memo\nAccording to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session list the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six\nBut then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein is office the date of attacked changed to the early\nEighties\nNow you might say what difference does it make well if you say you're in your late\nTeens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen\nYou're in high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years it\nGets better this is the again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report it gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with her lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote\nThe alleged tack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties but then something strange happens if you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the early\nNineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false\nAnd it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post Ford narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks\nEither on Sunday lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford said she has not heard from the FBI but the FBI did interview Deborah Ramirez another you college classmate who told the New Yorker that during a drunken dorm room party in the early eighties Kavanaugh thrust just peanuts in her face in cost her to touch it without her consent\nMajor Garrett at the White House meanwhile the Trump Administration is denying that it's restricting the scope of the FBI

J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he wasn't guilty\nBecause the LAPD is allegedly races\nRight so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago that the that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black man for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life\nAnd they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believed he was a was innocent more than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community and they all know that he killed the un Nicole\nThey all know it so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and and let me tell you I think uh [noise]\nDr Ford who testified she's a serious person cheated as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right\nBut when you actually start dissecting hurt or testimony ah I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws a just a it's a series of inconsistencies that would make it\nPhysically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right\nSo the fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications ah include all communication so I understand how talking points are circulated\nAnd how people get on T. V. shows\nUh the fact that everything has been mobilized or to support look the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucify someone with zero evidence and then what they're doing now is that you're moving the goalposts right I\nI saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about a well you know he must have drank when he was in\nIn college or whatever who cares but it's completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like pleading Adam hey Lawrence those goalpost seem kind of heavy let me know if you need help moving\n[laughter]\nSo Shankar what we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat or who has not lost his footing ah with with reason [noise] um so the address people\nAddress people who are let's say a twenty something female that says\nYou know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes then there's also a a a chance at USCB Cooper rather than be ... you have to go by the evidence and the case you have to evaluate a cases based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular\nSituation other people that are just as qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he is he's essentially being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um\nThe worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system short of murder so the question now is the economist is right and there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion\nIn fact all of the evidence that has been presented is exculpatory right the if the guy's calendar clears him right the testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also clear as him so you you have to\nCast that aside and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely find that's the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic where we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nThe way there's is into court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but the your your your your as the rights this would not need any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because what you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made\nWith zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back us up and then when you actually analyze the ... no evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim her testimony she contradicts herself\nIn ways that are significant she changed the timeline when this happens four times so I think\nPeople need to cash this aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell he is going to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is play guilty by association ride mark judge\nI I've never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of this country has never met this man right so we're just going off of here see right now and based off his own memoirs of somebody who was a very quotable person who had\nA serious drinking issues it's not Brett ... we're we're not nominating mark judge for the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with his judicial philosophy that's fine\nBut we we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family that's like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud right we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations just because we disagree with them\nPolitically or ideologically that state and that's what they do and and and banana republic that in third world countries that's not what we are in the United states of America\nJohn Carlos ... a Democrat when when we come back I I I Want to ask you if you don't mind holding on for a second generally do you have to I'm I

allow county has to be counties and regions Timmy regions and people to meet people and it's totally fine the issue becomes why do I want to enforce my will upon you I Want you to be as conservative or liberal as you want to be\nPeople tease me and say Larry you're from queens how do you know you know what's right for upstate\nI don't that's the point and guess what\nYou don't know what's right for me in Queens either were even how would you be you you let me me me and we can all be free to gather\nOne a ton of work did has words that's our original idea we just haven't done it in a long time so so Larry tell me your day one you're governor of New York where do you do\nThere are several things that have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so the vote 'cause it's a five way race in New York state and we are plurality state not a majority says we don't require fifty one percent there's a runoff go\nWhoever has the most that's how New York state works so I could actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing\nI'm going to happen in ... percent but it was time to vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be with you when this is the most important single election in the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more boring as a whole but as one single election\nIf I come in first it changes the entire nation overnight\nIt does not just a Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is is that the ... yeah this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nAbsolutely it is that important even coming in second would shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it wouldn't make better Democrats embed Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our potential Democrat they don't have to worry about small business they\nDon't have to about smaller government that will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant is just I'll protect you from the evil left and all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties is supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right but when there's a third party that were the libertarians can point the finger and say\nDemocrats what happened what happened to civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government\nNow they have a change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\n[laughter] man will be a massive a massive\nCulture shock within within the uh the state and within the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back I\nDon't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire for years as my assumption and I'm fine with that\nBut I have to focus on several things one a complete re board of education to a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay\nFor things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and Washington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government\nI next that the credit culture of transparency because the problem with the government is now is they're enforcing the kings well\nSo they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied and I don't want the state government to be I'm the king and I in force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nSounds like you've read the constitution\nOr what does that I don't know\nI Know I Know it's I'm not sure it's an old dusty are due to document\nTheir ego yes Neal anyway I think we sort of the way while ago but yes that's my point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families and met or individual\nBusinesses but individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs growth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value to each community we don't do that well in the upset at all we have things called regional economic economic development or corporations which Albany which is the capital and decides where the money is spent\nAnd openness eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county\nHow 'bout instead the county's can start to budget to zero so they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas of volunteerism how about the concept I'll give you to an interesting concept one instead of me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation end\nThrough lowering spending here's one idea that those both of those we have a bridge is right now in New York state\nOne of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial Britain named after our well family that's embarrassing how 'bout instead that Britain's named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights of the bridge we retain the asset I got an a business gotten that giving my ass at up\nI'm going to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime straight contractual that's all\nThese companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year on marketing they dropped twenty million dollars on a stadium name that she was on the weekends\nI got a bridge you can name and that bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times on every single day during rush hour and a sixteen person Mitt a sixteen million person metro area\nAnd hundreds of thousands of cars pass it every single day\nYou will easily dropped the million dollars and that if not more\nOn a law that taxes hang on just like a Texas New York ... Texas you should listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\nAbsolutely but he has the best part now we have them do maintenance\nAgain we own it so we still we still inspect it so damages though our responsibility their job is just to repair it right\nThey begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lower spending not just that contracts don't come
