bound lanes of my two Seventy five of the bridge being shut down the driver of the car that caused the crash\nI was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right out in that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what sign for you to walk to the United states\nAnd I want you to walk in that group of people and here's a guy and paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group with you and you get you across the border is that what you're doing or you just you're in trusting your children to who knows what and where is the personal responsibility of the parents here\nYeah I mean there's got to be something there is and I think their case would be or at least the case the left would make on their behalf wouldn't be or the you know things are so bad so\nBad in Honduras Guatemala I mean they can get a lot worse you can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you\nI mean there's so many things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's pretty much the opposite like\nThe same thing we talked about this yesterday I you know letting my kid walk who's seven ... the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI'm told the story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block ... there there there's a giant bond there in a green area is common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said hey that I'm just I'm going to walk down to the pond like\nAlone [laughter] without your brother [laughter] I Know [laughter]\nWhat do you stop and think about how you know\nPretty protective ... yeah exactly I\nI don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey\nWhy don't you walk to Honduras with a group of people that I don't know [laughter] and locked out look\nThere are situations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there's certain level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people in these situations are like this or is there probably are some\nBut it it's just ... you try to it's the same thing with the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of ... everyone is a four year old who came across the border and in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old that this is a different it's a different story\nOr and you just wonder first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about a hardening the borders\nThis is an easy way to get people together to do that mhm when people hear a story like that it it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa this ... you know because the word invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from people who\nOppose it or you know in a hawkish manner ... right and you know like four thousand people are not qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion\nRight it feels like waiting does they're just ... like the top of the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right let the overriding the security\nThere there you're coming in or the right way or the overriding security and you see that Mexico does not want to deal with this but they know that they're not the end they're not the end location\nSo they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course they're just keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this and yet or the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a fairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful\nA war on carrying were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy of\nCourse if somebody's snakes them from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they go and work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with them back then\nThey ... they send back them they then back to them if they do it without permissions they send back to them but we can't uh were expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to U.S Mexico has a pretty stiff immigration law they've got to streamline law\nThat insurers foreign visitors and immigrants\nAre in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves economically they're not destined to be burdens on society\nThey are of economic and social benefit to society weight you're you expect your immigrants to contribute\nTheir own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation or they make sure that they don't have any sort of a\nCriminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants protests have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they're demanding rights or that they think they have coming to them\nIn Mexico you can't even go can't interfere in their in internal politics plus if they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics may deport you I mean that's a [noise] a\nLately racist right I mean like that is not yes there's not an argument there we would never know I Can't do that you know you can't do that and know should you you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans and the ... percent we want to make sure we're still keep Seventy or eighty percent yeah I mean I think I Would you I wouldn't I Can't I Can't think\nOf one Trump supporter who would have a ... a supportive policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages of white people versus other races he ... he won or people who are productive who are here because they want to be here and be part of the society\nOr going to add something to our community instead of taking things from it\nI mean right now that's what you want the hypocrisy is mind by that really is incredible lying to buy it really is it ... ... security for me but not for me\nAnd that is not a a that is not a ... that's incredible I mean that's an incredible it is a line there that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and and it and it's politically wanting to look at the bottom line is we are we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten up\nThat is a completely lets a larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to a mid term election there's no like this is a complete gift to the Republicans to people who\nCare about the border yeah the people who have any uh did Donald Trump and the people he's supporting the gift\nIt is and and he's telling Republican that yeah saying hey use their use it in the ... election campaign start talking about immigration because I haven't heard any of them doing that are any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe somewhere someone somewhere is\nBut it doesn't seem to be a general theme for the party\nI did hear at all talking about it in the debate and I don't think I don't know that he mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security that mean there's a really close race in Arizona a race or where a ... has a I think a great chance of winning\nOr people to get because her opponent there is like if you took Michael Moore and put him in his brain into a female body of cost\nYou're referred to as best hope [laughter] I I Can't\nBe true American ... and\nAnd I don't think it is I\nI think it's not a common nickname in some communities it probably is but it wasn't his can\nBe is it not cultural appropriation did he not appropriate Hispanic culture is that not a problem\nIf that is a thing\nThis is an example of it yes\nI'm not going to sit here and tell you what the thing I think it's a ridiculous thing but I'm sure bets out what\nTell us it's

[laughter] Oh yes\nThat name for forty years and ah I don't like to be called Bertha which is that natural inclination from people\n... and I know that they'll personally oh you do I where\nI used to work for the NBA no Paso as the secretary to the director and assistant director when he first started as a came in Congress he's very adamant about helping veterans and we were overjoyed because we needed help getting the message out about the veterans mhm\n[noise] well\nIt let them know when I came on the a lot of my information because I knew what was going on and stuff is costing my desk and everything when I found out that a bad though was running for Senate I knew he had used the veterans\nAs a launching point ... they need to do with them under the bus wow what a\nTo get his name and don't forget his name nationally known by the way my call him personally myself I call him ... face [laughter]\nAttractive [laughter] calling dangling\nHe's got that [noise] um wait Adam's apple and it sticks out\nFor a long ...\nUm I don't want it seemed like an angry Hispanic female mhm I Am just an angry conservative and oh I forgot to tell you I had my best friend and she stayed in Albert she goes to them but he never aging live bring them in an age is\n... ... and it's like ... and thank you for the call it just seemed like that there is a a a\nThere is an effort made when you when you prioritize identity politics over everything else\nThese things are sensible right like it's sensible that Barry Obama was bronco bum or he is sensible in that world it sensible if you're a little bit more and to claim you have Native American heritage and\nIn in your school and and submit to a ... recipes the pouch out like that makes sense in that world because that's all you prioritize it's the only thing that matters\nRight if the only thing that matters is your identity as a victim\nThen classifying yourself or as associated with a victimized population of evil conservatives\nDoes a lot of good for you there's a real incentive and motivation to do it and we keep we seem to see it over and over and over again and you know look maybe he was called that it was a guy I don't know ah it's possible I haven't seen a ton of evidence that it's accurate north\nIt makes any sense but beyond that ... the idea that he has put on every single sign solely the four letters B. E. T. oh\nThis is not like that might be a nickname and it might be that it's okay to call him bad health but it does not he's not doing it because that the uh the case he's doing it because he's trying to fool a bunch of people especially back you know when he was trying to get to this level at this point\nI don't know I think everybody knows but it helped him climb to this level\nAnd it's it's the name that appears on the ballot too which is interesting very strange very strange ... a lot of times if it's a nickname\nThey're short approved it by going back try to ... generation try to prove it one one thousand twenty fourth yeah that's amazing a left hates it through like this is this is playing into the worst of our\nUh beliefs about the blood\nBeing the determining factor in these things and they they hate it they're they have destroyed or over the she handled it terribly I mean it's almost like one of those things I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out and doing this this is amazing\nAh but the identifying thing there's two parts of that like I said as a you know say that you know\nThe libertarian side of me right like I don't care what people say they are right like it made no difference to me if she says she's Native American or not I don't care\nBut beyond that there is an actual truth you know if it does all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean King wants to come out and say he's black when they're not black\nIt it does that matter to me I don't care what they're doing there I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason but that doesn't mean it affects me in any way however we have to be able to stand\nUp for the truth the truth is that Sean King is white but the truth is that Rachel does all is white and the truth is Beto O'Rourke as white as white\nAnd you know I that's okay [noise] you know people are supposed to be able to be you know we're not supposed to care so much about these identifying factors but we're in a world in which the left only embraces identity politics the tech world we need to cure it\n[noise] when you need to

you can follow his progress I I I Know there's a website I don't remember what the name of it is but if you kind of go out to search for\nA Glenn Beck climbing K. two it'll probably pop up\n... because I think they're doing this on the dark Web ... last time you do you have some really put stuff on the dark Web uh so I don't I don't know maybe you'll have to find that there\nAre but we're we're uh we're here talking about a Beto O'Rourke at Ted Cruz and the Texas Senate battle\nLot of people calling in and saying that they knew a lot of people who are white and not named Beto in the communities that he talked about on CNN last night and then there's ...\nIt says it could be a regional thing I Know there's a lot of differences between north and south I mean people look at you know figures like a Abraham Lincoln and better we leave and all these people who are uh you know from the\nDifferent cultures differently from where they are so I think that that's something that we can kind of look into as a possible cause for Beddoes a confusion here um\nThere are issues however when you try to appropriate culture or when you try to reach into some other uh cultural group and and and speak to them sometimes there are issues there was a case it is that the media is like ... is is like liking to highlight today\nA and it just it's a commercial run on behalf of congressmen in Arkansas a French Hill now he had nothing to do with us at all\nAlthough surely if you watch CNN Today he will be\nVoting for it ... it's a it's just some unrelated group running an ad in support of French ... which is part of our ridiculous campaign finance law situation\nUm where people when they want to donate more money than the the maximum which is completely unconstitutional to have in this country\nOr when people want to do that they give it to super PACs and they run ads on behalf of the candidate that has no control over those ads so this is a bad ... being run in Arkansas\nIt's up it's related to Brett Kavanaugh and it's being criticized I don't know if you can detect anything here pat I Would like to get your call and whether you can detect anything seems a little odd to here here's the ad from a the group supporting French all\nWhat do you think about what's happening in Washington Congress may French\nAnd the Republican no that is dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt especially for black me if the Democrats can do that to a white justice at the Supreme Court with no evidence no cooperation and witnesses including her best friend had been happy\nWhen white girl lives on them\nBehind him black folk and gold turnout always told myself don't mess around with that if you get caught she will crime rate\nI'm going to keep Congress let banks here and the Republican because\nHave to protect our men and boys we\nCan't afford to lead white Democrat cuts back to the bad old\nEighth grade verdict life had cause is Adam\n... what are white girls going through right paid for by black Americans for the president's out into not authorized by any candidate for candidates Khamenei first of all I Would normally watch a show with ... and you know I Do that [laughter] sounds fantastic and these are obviously ... they're making yeah right like the point of\nAnd this is a fascinating thing from the left who thinks that\nYou know we we one of the biggest reasons Beto is you know in the public eye in the in the United states and not just a Texas figure is because of this video he made about it's ... it's a great idea to Neal or for the national anthem\nAnd what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick stating that black people were being unfairly accused without evidence and being shot in the streets for no reason because ah for for crimes they didn't commit\nAt the same time we're supposed to get on board if you're on the left are supposed to get on board with\n... with the with a new standard in which any white woman can accuse the man of rape and we're just supposed to believer that is not going to work out well for African Americans or any ... any race of mail but this is the type of thing that makes no sense\nI mean there are real cases of this this isn't a fake thing go back to you know we talked about till town go back to Emmett Till\nI mean this goes back a long way where black people were accused of doing terrible things to white people when they didn't\n[noise]\n[noise] did you make no\nMatter what no matter how you train the\nTrain a business\nThat I mean the accident that almost an exact mission uh-huh he murdered somebody that we could we killed ... is your business though oh we don't follow your white men law now wait not murdering somebody\nIs white and I hope that I Know

deep [laughter] getting deep down here [laughter]\nBut I think it's important to point out this is Gary it is that is the mayor and the\nFact that he can get away with it with no repercussions still no I mean like yeah the yes if you ask the Democrat\nOr eating publicly will you distance yourself from this guy up most of them will say yes they will distance himself I have nothing to do with how\nThey will they will attempt that then you find pictures of them together right by like Morocco bombs out later ... but at least there at the point the only real repercussions this guy has as face for any\nOf this anti Semitism is you know basically that he occasionally get they public denial from a public source and remember he he was a he said that very early on with Obama\nSaying that he he said he would say this yeah he's got to distance himself from me but that's okay as long as he does the right thing\nRight you know I mean that's a it's it's a terrifying thing and the idea that I

this goes back to Nineteen Ninety eight here are are the percentages of democratic fundraising in Nineteen Ninety eight they had forty three percent of all fundraising okay uh in Nineteen Ninety eight in the house two thousand it was forty seven percent two thousand two forty seven percent two thousand four forty six percent\nYou've got to see a pattern and have their little bit and you know Republicans slightly out raising them they're kind of changes in two thousand six where it goes to fifty percent Democrat than fifty six percent Democrat and two thousand eight that's brought up on his first election\nUh it's been hanging around a fifty percent ever since two thousand ten was forty eight percent doesn't twelve forty four percent doesn't fourteen forty seven percent doesn't sixteen fifty percent so you get that there's a range there from about forty three to fifty six percent that is broken in fifty six was outlier most of the time is right between forty seven and fifty fifty one\nSo far in ... in two thousand Eighteen Democrats have raised sixty five percent of the money going to the house while again they've never been higher than fifty six sixty five percent a sixty five thirty five split against Republicans\nThey are out there was a congressman who came out the other day he raised eight hundred thousand dollars in his district thought he did a good job his opponent and outs two point six million shoes and this is like it's unheard of when it comes to money and the disparity going on now\nNow or ... that the Democrats are favored to take the house I don't know how much it has to do with money\nBut if they were to lose this race with these ah with this sort of a climate it would be not complete destruction\nOf any argument that money can buy elections I mean this is they're they're gonna complain I mean that was on stage complaining with Ted Cruz about money and how Ted Cruz is influenced by your heart rate made a hundred thousand dollar donation to him like I like this is a big a big deal in today's world\nUm but I mean he's he's raised this isn't even close Beto he's thirty eight million dollars more than any Senate candidate himself is in history yeah for a quarter or which is incredible you said it was it compares to ...\nRacing and what's your what he wants more in the in the uh if you compare quarter last quarter of the campaign in two thousand eight he raised more than ... Obama during his presidential\nCampaign that that's a presidential election emphasizing this is the Texas Senate ... Senate race where he barely have any chance to win uh-huh\nNow it's funny in the Senate race record he broke was the what was the ... record set by Rick lousy oh of course you remember senator lousy oh from New York running a children's Hillary he did not win that race was not a close race even though Rick lasagna wasn't a bad candidate was not a close race\nIt was Hillary right in New York [noise] expect her to win again ear to ear around fifty in almost every it's almost a fifty fifty split every year and this you're sixty five thirty five that's a big she is\nAnd the other thing uh it's kind of interesting on the in the bad side if you want to get scare mongering for awhile and why not cleanse out we haven't had enough scare mongering lately\nUm we haven't set it always ends with a bullet to the head all we all week on well now in the last two days and now we just you know we have a going back in history looking at two hundred and thirty eight seats with a democratic incumbent only eight percent of them are getting knocked off when you have a democratic incumbent running\nFor Republicans the ... the rate is twice as high sixteen percent now\nIs that a big difference I mean sixteen percent it's still not high but it does show that Republicans wind up losing these incumbency race is a little bit more often if you're worried about the Senate there's a little bit of there is a little bit of something there to be worried about I think they're going to win the Senate I think you're gonna see a fifty three or fifty four seat\nMajority I think they may pick up a couple of seats oh I'm I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Arizona I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Texas are those who were in question ... I I think Ted winds up winning by\nMaybe ten points or more I think it'll be a double digit I think that's a good chance of that um I wouldn't be surprised to see six to ten ... you know um I wouldn't be surprised\nI think it'll be much closer to barely comfortable yeah I think that's where he stands right now yeah Arizona is razor thin margin is right now but it's I think it's trending well for the Republican they're like Sally I think a ... you've got toss ups in states like Nevada\nAnd Missouri and Florida that in ... Montana seems to be leaning a little bit to the Democrat but I wouldn't even put that on the top I ended up on ... yeah well I saw it's close but I'm pretty much a toss up race but those other I mean Florida is a complete toss no reason for the Democrats to continually when in Montana I don't understand it\nI don't know how to do away for junior I mean I'm already been talking about West Virginia here\nI think Joe mentioned are probably sealed his reelection with his cabinet vote which was for Kavanaugh the only Democrat who did that that he has ... they're all bumped up up the system when I have to\nUm I don't believe it I mean you look at his voting record he's worse than every single Republican thing about this you complain about Mitch McConnell you complain about a Susan Collins you complain about a summer cold Lisa Murkowski\nJoe mansions voting record is much worse than all of them all of them yeah it's not even close I mean Mitch McConnell is like the biggest conservative\nOf all time I mean for a Democrat he's he's moderate he's the most moderate Democrat yeah but I mean that's not saying much because I'm a crafts are now communist again or social listening communist yeah\nI mean the most part you think about Jeff Flake here's a guy who's getting bludgeoned so so much by the White House and buy or the conservative media that he is resigning and not even trying to fight for head for that seat that the the ... running for\nA well he votes with the president more often than Joe Manchin it's not even close yeah\nYou know again ... West Virginia is a state it's probably the most pro Trump state in the union he won in West Virginia by almost thirty ... thirty I think yeah\nAnd you know this is like it was czar they would go for I mean I imagine it's got a big name in West Virginia again if you want to pick a Democrat in the Senate or ... you know you probably mentioned would be the guy you'd be most optimistic for he voted even more I mean high capital almost certainly is going to lose now in North Dakota\nBut I mean in in West Virginia it got mentioned he got his cabinet vote you have a couple of it but again this is a guy who voted for Obama carries he's uh he's he is a Democrat and this is not a\nHe's a moderate Democrat as compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez but is that what West Virginia actually once you wouldn't think so apparently cell though he seems to be leading in the polls is an interesting development there\nAre but I did a winnable she'll be winnable seat in this environment uh right now mentions leaving that won fairly comfortable but even without the mentioned seat you're you're at a I think you can get to fifty three fifty four\nWithout going crazy and I think you can get two fifty to fifty one it would be a real surprise if they lost the Senate at this point I mean I think there is a good you know eighty percent chance that they are I mean most models are showing about an eighty percent chance they hold it and I think that's I think that's safe assumption\nYeah interestingly I you know when you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota she's down by eight point seven now yeah the average is eight point seven point a to the Republican Kevin ... so yeah that is looking pretty good yeah my pursuit there I think honestly you had two\nDecided by the cabinet vote one was mansion ... high camp her vote against that sealed it I think I don't think she's ... I don't think she can win that race though\nI don't think she can win that race I think she's going to lose it I think she's going to lose a pretty big I would not be surprised as you said that double digits situation happens there yeah look again North Dakota as a conservative state ... are they are looking at high camp and I think a lot of people like to say well it's\nAt this one Democrat this is one we've got the one good Democrat I think people like to say that you know I think states in general like to say well we're not partisan we've got you know democratic governor we've got a democratic senator and there's something there's some level of pride there to say like we're not only voting one way when you vote against\nEverybody over everything however buried in the middle of the this is from the federal is ... ... buried in the middle\nOf the court's analysis was a shocking realization revelation Obama administration officials transported pregnant miners in federal custody to New Mexico to obtain abortions in order to circumvent ... parental consent laws and other states\nAnd email exchange between to health and Human Services employees in April twenty fourteen exposed this fact\nIn discussing Maria a pregnant minor held at a temporary shelter possibly in Texas or Florida\nThe workers noted that Maria state of she wanted an abortion and did not want her parents to know that she was pregnant at the time are we as parents who are the horror sponsors were located in Florida Maria was in custody of the federal office of refugee resettlement\nAfter learning Maria had requested it abortion according to government emails to field specialist looked into the abortion laws in both Texas and Florida and reported that the general rule in both states was that miners could not have abortions without parental consent with certain exceptions\nLike a waiver in dead they went the other way up to New Mexico were an abortion\n[noise] when you want me to know\nMy heart radios nine seven WFL a\nGood morning I'm Steve Hall our terms to read a lot of dirty fireworks at city hall is Tampa police jeep brand new gun gives counseling overview bike stopped in the city so far this year nearly twenty three hundred of those buy stuff for made with thirty three citations handed out most of the stops in twenty four decide cases\nInvolving black men in ...
