I was amazed me\nWhere you don't have to just go see it in comedy is very subjective so you could love someone it'd be like Glenn check this guy out and you could be like not for me yeah right yeah because comedy is very ...\nSubject you can't tell them if you can tell him it's not funny right what this guy's funny to me yeah so that's that's what I've what I've experienced so you are with you know\nSo uh you know one of the things that when I\nWhen I uh was I feel like does it tell you you look like somebody\nDoes it do you want to do they do know that you know how bad it is somewhere colonel Sanders just like I look like Glenn Beck I don't know [laughter]\nThat was going to go to a different direction I don't know if\nYou heard this before he looked like Dave Ramsey with hair [laughter]\nDavid actually really good looking man [laughter]\nAll right this is making me a little uncomfortable I have a new world set or the U.S [laughter] I was a ... and now this isn't helping because those three I'm going into their ... what I propose to my wife yeah she said no [laughter] and uh and what do you ...\n... what year was a citizen of IDs okay yeah okay [laughter] they're rational respond right\nThan I did All right yeah I'm just trying to get an error I'd run out of those so she said no and she said the reason why is because we don't have God in common and I said I'm you know I I Believe in God I'm On everything and she said you don't go to church and I said\nI see you every Sunday after church for and every time you come home talking about the people who were honking at each other and yelling yeah they're running the park oh why oh yeah yeah I Know it yeah it's crazy yeah it's crazy how people are in church and they're finding that but they're like they're looking\nAt their watch like on the news ... yeah yeah yeah they won out which of these ... these video mountain road rage and the church parking lot is like make all these ...\nI make two videos a week and some of them connect and some of them don't just probably like your content of your books yeah sometimes when people are like yes thank you we needed that sometimes you put your heart and

to\nYou've heard about that mhm from your why are they like yeah I Know how it goes and they're like yeah and it's just a what's funny is the juxtaposition of a ... you know God first serve others I mean\nHow do you how did you lose the twenty steps away the human\nSpirit wouldn't you say like if you like you see someone on TV and they're given a run down and you just go\nThat's not right it doesn't seem right that guy's lion mhm you just know because everyone is a human ... like you can spot in sincerity and why the everybody loves that is because everyone when people get mad at my jokes at the live show because you're going to come and the whole crew is going to come tonight\nSo to get to become an analyst yeah or bring up on ... ... people people are like stabbing each other we have a ticket to that's what I that's what our goal\nRight yeah I mean it's a good comedy show you won a few good yes at the ticket to people\nThe people are like ... whenever I tell a joke it's like a

on it would be real this guy like\nBecause that's how he generally said on the ground or they don't yeah ... that's on humans [noise]\nAnd I feel like I've connected with you 'cause you're like so so somebody's like talent somebody's like telling us the truth out here yeah you know what I'm saying and that's what people I think comedy is comedy hard in two thousand Eighteen I go\nI think it's way easier because you don't to to cross the line you know what to say anything\n[laughter] right mhm it used to be in the nineties you had to say that most profane mhm disgusting I never even I Can't believe this is coming out of someone's mouth but in two thousand anything we heard everything down we've seen everything ... so it's kind of coming back to like a Jimmy Fallon type\nI I I said years ago that I thought the only thing left shocking\nWas what up in individual actually felt\nYeah that's the only thing left shocking you know what you really are feeling and want to say but you don't as I I Can't\nBelieve you said that yeah but I live a joke in my act about uh like everyone like we're all good Christians in here we're driving down the road and seen that cyclists on the side of the

at the bottom of that you're a ... you want to be the person in church that and then the real human yeah is the guy and we all have a dark\nSide yeah ... is the guy now might be something might be better or worse than others some ... some might be against the law and some ... some might\nActually somewhere [laughter] you know the reason why\nThe the reason why the outrage and the culture and people were coming after cabin are because you were like\nIf if if we can notch him down\nI feel like that's why the tabloids exist that's why they outraged exist because you'd think these people are above\nView the people listening that are ... are like Glenn Beck is up here\nYou know the people listening now okay how are you [laughter] you know they they're like I'm Better than that [laughter] I
