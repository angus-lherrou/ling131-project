to the world created by the enlightenment of of science and reason them period the empirical evidence uh and and even I mean the ... when you hear people say mathematics is racist\nThis is because we're there trying to deconstruct anything that holds the modern world together is that correct\nYes that they they think that it has been constructed on family that a lot of voices has been left out and this relates somehow to a lot of knowledge is I I think they have a problem with\nThe idea that than irrational and I'm In ... um knowledge is is that the property of winning or ran\nAt the white people yeah that that is that is how it works\nOK I'm going to take you um before we move forward or I Want to take you back one more a step\nI'm a I'm going to take a break and then we come back I'm like you to help me on this because it's my understanding that uh they're done for coal ah came over\nTo the United states that this was really kind of shaped in frustration from the Nineteen sixty eight Paris a riots\nAnd in frustration that they're not going to be able to take this whole thing down unless they take it all down they got to take all the system's down they're not going to win through culture\nUm and and that it was that it was actually a much more strategic in its I'm planting a virus if you will and I'd love to hear your take on that if that's true or not when we come back we're with Helen Monroe [noise]\nAnd we also have to ask her about [noise]\nThe greatest ... ever uh they are into other scientists sweat\nAnd they spend a year just writing\nPeer reviewed the

things Ben from a polling we had over the last couple of days the polling since the cabinet thing has\nBeen really good for Republicans in the Senate\nOr it looked really positive we don't there hasn't been enough of it to necessarily know that the two two are tied but it does seem like\nI'm a real positive things have happened in ... red states where Republicans were a little bit on the ropes at one point um for example give you a Ted Cruz Ted Cruz going up against Robert Francis O'Rourke he's an Irishman\nYou may you know bad oh yeah oh yeah they go oh Ashville most Irish people are called better so you point that out but Robert Francis O'Rourke is running against Ted Cruz some of the polls there's one poll that had him tied at one point um ah ah several polls showed cruise only up by one or two\nNew York times doing something really really interesting in which\nYou know normally you kind of see the ... news no well I didn't say that uh they're doing something interesting in that like normally see polls and you see it like if you think of it as a as a sporting event like the ... a football game happened and then you wouldn't even go after winning right like you're not seeing the play by play the game with a poll you're only seeing the resulted in\nNew York times is trying something this cycle that's different which is there actually showing you as they make the calls\nWho's voting for who when you see the whole build slowly as you watch it it's addicting to watch uh and uh\nIt's kind of interesting because one of the things you'll notice is how many calls they have to make to get anybody to agree I at one point yesterday um the Texas Senate poll they had made Seventeen thousand seven hundred phone calls\nAnd had two hundred and eighty five people who like that's how hard it is very tend to get people on the phone anymore to take these polls which is a\nIs part of that and why it's hard to read you know 'cause I mean who's going to answer yeah who's going to do that but Cruz in that poll wound up up a nine points in that one and he seemed to be honest with our eyes are open up a lead there again and I'm not surprised by it either not a

saying to the drive from Panama City in Mexico beach with some of the worst damage they've ever seen and these are storm\nUh I like to buy these steps but um you know you look at the fundamentals of the U.S economy with the tax cuts the deregulation that high employment I I'm Still I'm Still really high on the U.S economy I'm Still lie on the stock market especially at these low low prices\nRight now so what happened yesterday what what what's the scoop did\nWell good question we're all scratching our heads wondering what it was I mean Donald Trump seems to think it was the fed and there's no question that the fed interest rate hike a and their announcement that they're going to continue to raise interest rates certainly move people out of stocks and bonds because when interest rates rise then\nBonds are more attractive relatively than stocks I'm usually those facts of of a\nBad changes are short term so\nI don't I don't think you're going to see a long term effect from that although I tend to\nAgree with Donald Trump that year we've got this blooming economy we don't see real science of inflation although energy prices are rising but you know other commodities are are pretty stable or or actually falling and price so I don't see a big inflation gain and ... I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth that says\nTo the fed and and a germ drawn Powell why are you taking a punch bowl away from this already just when it's getting boring and I tend to I tend to think\nThat he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but just because the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that that job is to squash shows a stock market rally and pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm an inflation watcher and uh in ... novel evolution watcher guy I was I\nWas really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and and the tax break and we haven't seen it\nWe show me the information I mean look I Would I ... I have to\nAdmit you know I I admit when I'm wrong I'm a I'm a conservative and that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but I did predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we have international trade we have um\nYou know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and trade and technology are two things that really keep prices down an affordable and so I ... my only point is I just think the fed\nActed preemptively prematurely and raising rates in in a in a way that wasn't that search I Am a little concerned by the way I go on about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like a quibbling a four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why has it gone up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nBe there soon sooner you there yeah maybe not near where you just I don't get why I'm a why did why is oil going up\nThat's a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the I'm In the middle east with respect Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off as a result I mean a big rise in the price because people are really concerned about the um\nYou know about the price of the global\nReduction in supply as a result\nOf our tax that back online\nBring Texans Becca bring Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think\nWell prices are going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it when you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick stick in the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next\nYear or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again so [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now is just fear you know this the stock market is driven by fear and greed [laughter] that's a truism for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and then by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred\nI said to my wife funny let's let's take some of these profits and and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me [noise] um let me ask you this I don't know if this is true or this is an old wives' tale but the last president that I heard really take on the fed [laughter]\nWas Ronald Reagan and we had Nineteen percent interest rates right certainly after that until you stop talking about the fed when her\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lotta people say it's it's it's a\nA you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week on why the president is the chief executive officer of the country right he's the one who was supposed to help manage our economy if he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't they speak out\nI'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fat correct but I I think there's a lot of one of the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years that these are not some kind of or uncles on high at the fed they act as if there was a temple with all of the knowledge and all of the intelligence but they've made so many mistakes over here and you mentioned\nI remember the seventies as you do when we had\nLiterally twenty percent mortgage interest rates that was all because the fed\nMistake and ah you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know what's the one that built up this bubble that led to the housing crisis in two thousand seven and they said we keep thinking these people are somehow like jobs like\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know let me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement\nOr and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with China\nI I fear that Donald Trump really likes the trade wars are and we're not that this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is you know great but do you think is it Stephen [noise] that's what he really fundamentally believes that ... are good\nHere's my view and I've talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at the rose garden ceremony last week when he announced the new trade agreement and he basically said look I Will um I Will I'm I Am using these tariffs as a\nTool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I never trade strategy but I gotta say so far you know the\nThe kind of a top elliptical view has not happened Trump is getting some good deals you got to deal with Mexico we play candidate like a federal here where he basically said you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on the night before the\nThe deal will have to be seal candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe and then that leads to Canada I mean to China and this is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with I don't know how you and I haven't talked about this one but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheating\nStealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an actual property they're building up their military they're like you know the old Soviet Union in terms of a lot of the tactics they're using that's all I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nAh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction or when it comes to China then I'll\nLet me challenge you on that whenever I uh you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way Trump looks at it and I think he's right about this\nIf we can't trade with China we'd sneak if they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia and I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't their ... their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets mean damn near everything you buy in Walmart yeah I was made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that courage and saying look\nYes [laughter] up both again but I just I I had hoped because I Want I Want a better world for my daughter you know a a\n... the great Jerome thank you for sharing that and thank you for um thanks for your honesty of emotion there um the the good thing
