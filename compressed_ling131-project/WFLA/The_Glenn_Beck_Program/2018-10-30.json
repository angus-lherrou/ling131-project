F. L. franchise and that began and then later on uh\nObviously you cover else got it but uh that was after that in fact it was a year later\nThat we had the contest to name the buccaneers and they were named the Tampa Bay buccaneers because of our contests I forget do you remember what they would have been if it wasn't the buccaneers oh we had a we let people submit ideas for\nNames and then we had a\nWe had a three judge panel to pick and it's a long story I Can't go into it now but it was\nThe only ones they agreed on was Tom McEwen is one of the judges and he had Tampa Bay buccaneers is first on his list but the two other guys had somebody else first except I'm David somebody worked with the Clearwater sauna forgotten his last name now\nHe was one of the judges and you don't remember the other names he had at the last you know let me think there was a guy from the evening independent in Clearwater son David so\nMuch right now I'm trying to think of what name they want it instead of the buccaneers\nWhile they hadn't made a decision on it yeah okay and they\nWe had all these list of names the mariners the mariners of spears longhorns I mean are all kinds of the latter we landed on buccaneers and we ended up with a list three\nDifferent lists of ten each that these guys and picked out and came out with the buccaneers because of a two votes\nAnd the buccaneers have a new

you went to the two Clearwater\nTwo thousand four thousand seven thousand strong marching to a border saying you're going to cross whether the country wants your not\nWhile caring another country's flag what what what do you call that\n[noise]\nYou know the reason why you have to stop this if it's coming\nThe reason why you have to stop it is because if you don't stop this one there will be an invasion because America can't control our own borders\nNearly eight thousand troops to match what four thousand strong caravan fourteen thousand if the second caravan linked up with the first swelling their numbers to seven thousand\nSo any media magician trying to spin what this caravan really is\nAnd I honestly don't know how you can describe a potential force of seven thousand people all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no but what does America say\nIs classic mail is ... military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country this has not happened before but I said I Want to be fair here unexpected in a regular tactics called ...\nEmergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing that men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\n\nI don't know what you can expect what should you do nothing\nNothing\nIf you had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house and they said we're going to go into your house whether you like it or not\nAnd we've got two thousand people here and you're not going to be able to stop us because what's in your house we want we're just going to live there now if you had a group of people that were marching\nSaying that coming to your house\nWould you want the police to do nothing what'd you think that would you be happy if the police all of a sudden just that you know what they're not common\nFor you know here they are they're on the road there on the road there they are there's the video there's the video them saying they're going to come into my house and live in my house oh please\nI don't know about you but the next time there was a campaign I sure be running for sheriff\n\nLocal law enforcement protect our streets the border patrol protects our borders\nThe new standard cannot be the military on our borders a hundred percent of the time emergency situations always give birth to\nEmergency changes which always turn into permanent changes the federal income tax the Patriot act two examples of many I don't like emergency measures\nThat's why we should have a border policy that allows immigrants to come in that are qualified\nCome in through the front door\nAnd stops all of the side windows and the back door entries\nThe country needs either serious\nPolicy on the border that will stop this or you need to build the damn wall because quite frankly the military on the border is not a good solution\nBut I'm Sorry CNN\nI don't know what you want to call it I mean after all you don't like to call you don't like to call and so far when they're throwing Molotov cocktails you don't even like to call them a mob\nGlenn Beck program direction by numbers\nLet's take a look at election by a numbers hello sue tell me what's happening so far well uh we're one week away and this is when we get all the with the chart a little bit because we have a had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of toss up category yep um because ... holdings been close and now we start to\nTry to move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away\nOr so here's what we have right now are down to only three tossup races\nOr we have moved uh Missouri\nAnd Indiana er into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident us Indiana\nThe polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican but the lives there was a Ted Cruz is still lean Republican state\nA ... and a a Mississippi and North Dakota is going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep thoroughly knows right now fifty one Republican senators say there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure toss up still and we couldn't really move them\nOr Arizona isn't there Nevada is in there and we moved Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points plays falling has a lot closer are really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the ... category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we've moved to Florida to a lean Democrat\nDate a again this is a tough race because you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen\nA movement towards towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one is a lean Democrat state um we moved from Minnesota as well from safe Democrat to leaning Democrat pulling their you know\nI still think that's going to the Democrats but at the polling is closer then I think most people expect there's two races in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we've moved to lean Democrat as well or was a tough race for most of the time it looks like tester has enough of a lead there to consider this one to be\nLeaning Democrat at this point er and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin and leaning Democrat as well so if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three\nForty five for the Democrats so I mean it's pretty it's\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate [noise]\nThat is the starting to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida that was discouraging I think for Republicans the past few days Montana's not turning around you know we see no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia\nAs well which was a big hope for a pick up again this was a state that voted for Trump by thirty points and Joe Manchin I think he you know\nI think he's solidified his seat there with his pro Kevin Olival yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota high camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's\nThat the majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri and Indiana are slightly nervous we're moving these days I Would normally keep those in the tops of category but for a week away and we got to pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now I mean people are voting all across the country right now or it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break then come back and give us some of those results on the house term\nElection by numbers\nOn the

can listen to and download at your leisure welcome to the program Patt big news of the day to you is\nI Would say the possibility of the president issuing an executive order ending birthright citizenship ... problem well problem it's an executive order I'd agree with them [laughter]\nSo you're all day with it and whatever [laughter] it was not the justification yeah that is the justification I think what would happen is it would be challenged parts and then it would go to the Supreme Court which finally\nOkay force the Supreme Court to rule on that the fourteenth amendment is not about is not about illegals coming you're dropping babies and having them be citizens out what it's about no\nThis was clearly again I said yesterday everything after the tenth amendment basically is a ...\nIt's just three it or not did you not get this yes blacks we mean black people to\nPay that right on the thirteenth amendment fourteenth amendment is oh Gees okay and then I'll stop it yeah here in the ... the ... literally Democrats knock it off ... yes their children are citizens to yeah that's what this was right this is not about coming over here and\nHaving a baby and then you know as sneaking in cross that having a baby and then being able to bring all your family here ludicrous that what that was\n... and so it's been an interpreter now all this time right but you can't you can't do it with an executive no but if he's doing it with an executive order so it's challenged and it goes right directly the Supreme Court I kind of okay with that yeah and that's I think that's what would happen to 'em because they will challenge it\nThey will challenge it and I want I I ... I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just because I constitutionally I think no the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution\nBut I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually means\nIt seems to be a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included and it will be entirely there is yeah I think it would be interesting to see how that shakes out because you know one of the things we've praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts so he needs of the judges he's put in\nWould now rule on this and with there being some level of debate even among original is whether this would be allowed or not it was going to be fascinating yeah and that it does happen imagine Chuck Schumer and uh\nAnd Nancy Pelosi riding up that brief as a friend of the court come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh we we really believe this that guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think oh\nReally I mean you can you come with a Pittsburgh shooter and we say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's got to be a part of it but just goes\nOh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership trying to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish president we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... you know what can we play we play just a couple of things [noise] listen listen to this this so far they have gone this how far they've got here's here's Joe Scarborough and what he had to say listen to this\nMake a um [noise]\nPeople get to make a decision is is the America they want to live in [noise] because right now the only constitutional check against this sort of a porn behavior I getting that guy really a guy who was sending a message\nBy time and time again tweeting about face forward talking about is bad hair day there that was done intentionally [laughter] than a message\nTo white nationalist\nDoesn't bug me that much\nBut I'm I'm going to launch a baseball game I'm going to tweet about baseball World Series\nNot that I'm I'm not going to let it occupy my day\nAmong men really random like yeah he's like okay maybe the timing maybe it's not Christmas but I'm telling you and he laid out all the reasons why it's about to take off yeah it doesn't it yeah right yeah not again it's just a matter of timing\nI'm All right so here's what I Want you to do I want you to take the smart crypto course because I think everybody should have at least a hundred dollars in in crypto currency it's just this game changing stuff\nAnd between a bitcoin crypto currency and block chain\nThat is the future and you need to understand it take this Glenn Beck exclusive course right now smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or coal eight seven seven P.

to take the audience through a bit what did you what did you learn from that because I think this is the same thing that's happening when we said Brock Obama is surrounded by socialist\nLook ... look at look at the cover of what was it a Newsweek Magazine said we're all socialist now and as soon as we said we're going for socialism or they immediately said were racist\nNow when you point out uh George Soros this week the media is trying to say anybody who disagrees with George Soros is an anti Semite that's kind of the same thing that you found in Hollywood with your case is about\nI did I did and they basically take an addition that anybody that is a Republican or conservative is racist is anti Semite is is a homo phobic and it's just their their way of kind of of the ring us I mean I'm an American of Mexican descent and so\nAt my wife is Mexican she was a first generation uh you know a ... a Mexican American ...\nIt's ... they use this identity politics to other us and then they completely ostracized and they just hack mode and it's something that it it it goes into understanding why Hollywood is so ubiquitous late last waning\nAnd you know you see why all these stories that come out of Hollywood that are so one sided only tell one side of the story\nSo you know that is when I saw this I said you know what we\nNeed to start telling our side of the story and we need to use storytelling as a as a way to do that\nSo that's what I ... it was it was astonishing kind of moment to to call out a man that is getting in bed with other people's kids and to actually have an entire community turn on it purely because we're conservatives it was an astonishing moment to go or\nWhat is it that they what is it that they have about conservatives more than pedophilia\n[noise] you know it I think it is a fear\nHollywood is such a small community and it's run by so few people and it was just such a fear for losing work and one way and it and on top of that it's like the game of Thrones where\nThey're it it's very competitive to ah to to get that work so the first the first way to take somebody out is the state of their conservative\nUm and and anybody that anybody that is even near that person that gets us think that among conservative that they're conservative they run from that person so there's a lot of it is the loudest voices basically first kind of ... you out like the invasion of the body Snatchers\nThat this guy is a conservative and then you have the the second tier which are just people that are fearful for their for getting work\nAnd those people run as well so it's just kind of this kind of a very unhealthy\nCommunity that get set up and then you know and then you start to see what happens to the Hollywood box office they start to you know slowly over the last Fifteen Years start to decline because they aren't making a content for the other half of the country\nSo um you know uh and I think that conservatives have really locked in on this and said you know what a ... of this we're not taking this any more you see the ratings start to go down but now it's our time and now there's this new friends here for conservatives where we need to start creating content for ourselves\nAnd we need to start entertaining ourselves because they're never going to do um and that's what we're trying to do with red old America that's on the heart radio a pod cast a shooting I heart radio I'm shooting I heart radio ...\nWe're talking to a Patrick grilled cheese and um let me ask you I'm Patrick I'm\nI have this theory about what happened with Megan Kelly that the that the business people looked at Megan Kelly inside rape get she's she's very credible she's great interview you know we\nHave our own kind of sixty minutes [noise] kind of person I'm very very smart yadda yadda yadda they hire her and that's when the social justice warriors all around them\nRemind her remind them she's a conservative she was or at least she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um and no you can't play nice and you have to destroy her\nAnd so they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized that the social justice warriors were against it\nThey did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy do you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do think that\nOr a ... going after the network for their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and in the entire me too movement at a big part of that that a lot of people aren't touching on um it it it basically she was you know print brave in doing that um I think you know from a career wise it might have been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet and here's a woman in the me too moment exposing the corporation for covering and they don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become just a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not um being used in the way that it was a God given birth to\nA man I think that that is is one of the main reasons why and it didn't help that she was a conservative and was easy to get rid of it because of that\nUm so yeah I think that's what happened and egg and\nPatrick ... we're we're talking to the host of red pills America you can hear it on the er I hurt radio out really good story teller I Know you're going to be taking on a few issues that I Want to come and go through\nA a couple of them um first of all the\nThe caravan that is that is coming up uh there's today they're they're the media and clothing ... Smith are saying there's nothing to worry about this isn't an invasion\nWhat what are your thoughts on the care of them [laughter]\nYou know I think that it is something that [noise] for whatever reason the last ten years the left is completely changed their tune on um in regards to our borders are open borders I I I feel like it is a we actually do an episode\nOf that is coming up that looks
