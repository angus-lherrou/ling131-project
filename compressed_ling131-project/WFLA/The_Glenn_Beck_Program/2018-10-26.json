historically a nightmare for the free press and you refuse to\nSay anything about it the crazy thing is today\nThing is is that the media gleefully gave Obama a pass even though he was weaponized\nIn the FBI and the de OJ against the press Donald Trump has gone so far as just calling them fake news and they got their feelings hurt\nForget about the oh I don't know threatening to throw us all in jail spread but it is calling us fake news\nYeah well he kind of has a point just if you even look at how President Obama treated the press compared\nTo you know President Obama was putting new people in jail\nHe was ... the government against you and you failed to stand up and say anything\nOh\nIs the media was gearing up for its outrage over being called fake\nThe New York times\nWas publishing an article on the very same day these pipe bomb packages were delivered now I Want you to remember this is what you know just just put this in your pipe and smoke it for a little\nBit there being called fake news they're being called liars they're saying\nNo no no no we're not we don't publish fake news we don't have anything against the president is not a vendetta and while\nThis is happening

single one that's going to come as a surprise they found five fiction writers are going to do it but every single one wrote a short story depicting a scenario where the president was found guilty every single one isn't that amazing they couldn't find one fiction writer to write something where Trump was not\nGuilty it's crazy\nOne story had Trump's signing the twenty Fifth Amendment or and another even had him uh being assassinated by a Russian agent with the help of Secret Service\nYeah\nWe can write about the president being assassinated were advocating violence\nKnow what ... what are you are you kidding me\nKnow that it was about the Russians that wasn't about a coup yes yes okay Secret Service was involved but that's not about a cool\nThis is the New York times\nYou know the ones who are leading the way saying oh my gosh the talk of violence is so horrible oh my gosh and we don't print fake news you're supposed to be investigators you're supposed to be neutral\nI thought that was the idea let's be neutral\nNow I understand that everybody has an opinion but five for writers and no one can come up with anything other than the guy is guilty and maybe he's going to be killed by the secret service\nThis is unbelievable how\nIs it the two hundred journalists can sign a letter claiming that everything is the president's fault when the flagship of the American media

are those are just people that feel passionately so I Know you love radicals\nBut here's a radical idea if you don't want to be called fake\nYou might want to just start with literally stopping publishing fiction\n[noise]\nFriday on ... desk and thicker and back program [noise] self awareness seems to be dead at this point\nIn the media in particular Glen or maybe this one what is the one

top story at ten o'clock clock police and the FBI investigating the discovery of an eleventh and twelfth suspicious package possibly containing explosive devices\nThe FBI confirmed the eleventh package was recovered in South Florida similar in appearance to the others and address to new New Jersey democratic senator Cory Booker\nSixty five and Britain sixty five percent of Democrats believed when George Bush was in office that he had something to do with nine eleven and that conspiracy was started by someone they claim is on the right and he is not\nA it was started by what's his fat face loud mouth guy what's his name is do no no no uh Alex Jones sixty five percent\n[noise] whatever it is a you know and I and I talked to Bush about this on TV and extensive\nLee and he basically said factor that's my strategy I'm not changing it okay so that's number one so Donald Trump could have done that easy but he chose the fight back trumped it\nAnd he said I'm not going to let these people marginalized me 'cause it'll never end\nAnd the American people uh see me as a fighter they see her son who strikes back one attack so while I'm going to do that so then you have to say okay well who started the fracas who started this and you can make a case that Trump's bombastic\nA tax on his rivals in the uh in the primary process um started it you can make a case for that how it\nHow he's in his room table names yeah he's a symptom the American people have never been this way we've never been this way no no no is it to them on your ... feeling beating and kit to death by being called racist and homophobia and everything else came\nLater when it when it was apparent that Trump was a player and could win\nSee what people don't understand is that in the beginning the press didn't think that Donald Trump could do anything you want to have a chance he was he was like entertainment All right let's bring out the dancing bear\nThat's how the press saw him but then when he started to win the whole strategy changed\nAnd I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does okay so then it was destroy him destroy ... that that would be orders that came down\nFrom the editors of the New York times not in those words but it was very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post CNN MSNBC\nElemental Facebook I mean they're on their ... their on video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered how does Trump\nCounter what does he do he doesn't have surrogates\nI mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it so he does it in a very blunt\nAnd sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what is his choice what if he doesn't do it\nThey are going to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah and the liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that but he has a growing I Believe growing number of people supporting him\nAnd the reason he has it is because it gives them no quarter yes he fights back\nBut now they're turning it around saying well your your fight back like Kavanaugh Kavanaugh fought back oh he's out of control oh that's not a if not fight back shows he doesn't have the temperament oh come on\nYou're you're being destroyed by these people you're not allowed to show emotion it's the same thing\nSo now with the bomb thing oh Trump did it where where CNN and we're not responsible for any of it all in all ... us\nNow I'm hoping that the vast majority of the American people understand what's happening I think they do because CNN's ratings are so terrible no matter what they do no matter how they ratcheted up\nStill very very few people watch that so I'm hoping they get it\nWell they're not going to um so so bill or\nHow much trouble or are they in I mean the New York times literally paragraph thirty five\nIn the New York times talks about how this doesn't look like these bombs were made by somebody who wanted to actually kill anybody this was just a statement of some sort of what happened that from the job of course they're cartoon bombs they are leaving it it\nDoesn't ... this is a the gang that couldn't shoot straight or gay or straight this is ... there was a\nPress we're going to do this to get it into the press because we know the media will go hysterical\nCorrect and it could be somebody who was on the right and didn't want to kill anybody but wanted to make a statement and they're crazy could be somebody on the left who wanted to do the same thing could be somebody who is just a really\nUnbelievably worst bomb maker known to man which I highly doubt\nIt could very well be somebody who thought you know what we're going to send the east of the press we're gonna send these all of the all of the enemies of the right or we'll obviously sway an election\nObviously crowd contrived to get media attention to influence them in terms I'm putting my money on putting\nA button [laughter]\nHow do you do and how does the uh media respond when it turns out that ah it's it's either a prank with no political motive or it was politically motivated or by the left\nWell that would be an amazing story when that was why I'm hoping the FBI can you know flushes out pretty quickly\n... how would the press handle what I think that they would um look you have to understand it every morning out of the ah Washington DC think tanks progressive think tanks they send stuff\nTo Anderson Cooper and and Rachel Maddow and these people they get stuff\nSo that they'll they'll sit down and go okay now how are we going to spin this uh may be the person sending it was insane or you know that kinda thing they'll never say\nWell
