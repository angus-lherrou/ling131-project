{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WFLA", "content": "A month\nAnd again the indication that we're getting close is when you start hearing about the interviews or their request for interviews for individuals at the highest level of the chain\nFor instance the stories that have come out that the the uh Mahler team is trying to work out the questions that the Trump will answer and of course that's the top you get an interview\nA President Trump last\n[noise] that that's going to be last in the chain because that's how they put their investigation together so the indication is that\nWe're getting close to the end and it could actually be by mid November So after the midterm elections things have been very quiet because as is typical of those type of event ego radio silence and that's what happens\nIf you have the the modern ... they've really been in radio silent mode since the end of August first of September and that's that sixty day window prior to an election in this case the midterms and they didn't want to interfere which I think is the right thing to do now\nOr the report from Bloomberg says the deputy attorney general and the guy in charge of the mother investigation Rod Rosenstein\nAnd new Trump best money or wants to get this thing done which makes perfect sense or after the midterms are the fate of a whole lot of folks including Rosenstein Jeff Sessions or could be ... by a threat I Would imagine sessions has gone after the midterms according to the Bloomberg report\n[noise] the Mahler reports will focus exclusively on his findings or\nLack there of concern in collusion and or obstruction now has been the case here\nAs long as it's been known for quite some time hundreds from both sides are Republican Democrat as well as most legal experts feel that obstruction poses a much greater threat to President Trump and the inner circle\nThan any collusion or conspiracy but all this remains to be seen on what actually and I would imagine we have no clue as to the depths I I'm sure there's a whole lot that's gone on that we just don't know about\nSo is there a light coming at the end of this tunnel it appears that way and obviously a massive question looms\nWill Bob Mueller\nInterviewed from either in person or in writing before it's all said and done\nWill it actually happened and again this story has been floating around that uh they were working on the the the smaller folks and the Trump legal team working on this specific legal questions that Trump would answer\nWhich I Would imagine would be in written form now you know Trump has recently said it would be a waste of time\nUh as far as I'm\nInterviewing him you know Trump's their waste of time because he maintains that he's done nothing wrong\nOr his attorneys are again still going back and forth and at least might be some written answers from Trump which is lawyers are really going to write and direct anyway uh so ahead of Mueller's report ahead of the mid terms\nGot a couple of key moments which you're around the corner he got Paul Manafort he's scheduled to be sentenced on the nineteenth or next week and I saw a story that is asking\nIs asking for his suits so we can pick a nice suit for sentencing when I I think that's fair\nOr maybe can wear the blue ostrich jacket or the the lizard tongue suit I don't know what you know get get one of the more exotic things nice photo up\nIt was an ad by by the way a way yeah and it's coming up on friday so uh it was exactly what a year ago the Papadopoulos that he pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about the timing and significance of his contacts with Russian operatives during the Trump campaign\nYou know we've had a whole series of guilty pleas of indictments Saudi ... stuff has happened but\nHas Trump been involved with ... plus it that's that's what we don't know\nI just don't think there was any collusion\nIf there's any thing are they going to be able to make any type of an obstruction case or is Don junior going to get hammered with anything\nNever was a ... and his drunk and ran to an Australian diplomat about getting dirt on Hillary Clinton they've got the whole damn Russia investigation started in the first place long before there were any Pfizer warrants to\nArgue about so again it appears we're getting close to Halloween things here there's always happens in violent township Ohio nine one one got a call there was a plane crash\nWas a Halloween the decoration suffered set up what looked like a realistic plane crash and it prompted calls the nine one one\nAnd eighty five year old retired from the Air National guard set up a fake plane crash along with his killers which spilling out of the cockpit [laughter] people thought it was real\nAs they called nine one one yeah 'cause planes typically witches and skeletons hanging out of the cockpit [noise] [laughter]\nUnbelievable oh\nCrazy a [noise] amazing\nOh the hulking thing we didn't get to the Stephen Hawking thing ... will probably pick this up tomorrow you want to talk about a can of worms yeah let's put this on tomorrow's a list Stephen Hawking his up ... latest book or after his death released he says is no\nThis is the shortage Glen ... program windy morning to nine ... nine Seventy WFL a\n\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management

L. S. it's getting to make people comment cry\nWell we're not talking about that right now we're talking about what's happening out in space it's not about ... can I go to mark and Colorado Hi Mark you're on ground zero\n... thanks for taking my call that a lot of sound bite kinda sounded to me like an old dial up modem modem trying to communicate\nWell it wasn't a dial up modem it was a it was the the sensors that are picking up where they say is a rattle under a under Antarctica and that's what they're picking up it's rattled but some are arguing that what it is the wind blowing across the snow or the ice and that's why we're getting that sound and others are saying it may be from something else completely because\nThey've been receiving these neutrinos signals and they didn't know what they are so something is active in an article something is active in space right now they're shutting down the telescopes and there and they they are they shut down YouTube for temporary period of time to get something they didn't want us to see went on in space last night was going on right now in space\nRight but uh but I've ... I don't think it was a mother or my or something else other than that and the train those are that's like a radio reporter sounds to me\nI was just bizarre I think it's bizarre that that that's the sound or that or they picked up on and and while they it's in the science journals still you know geoscience journal saying well this is what we think is some seismic waves were picking up on others are saying well this is this is sending is like you say this is like a repeat or\nSending something that ah most certainly uh is is bizarre especially in all the coincidental ... going on in the past three days\nBut I'd like to toss the single going into that coming out it's the same and the strengths Idaho\nAnybody anybody can take the said don't and they can speed it up or slow it down to see if there's anything inside the stigma because I used to have a guy who he would hear signals they'd say well let me speed it up and see what I get it needs to be that have all this like rpm and you'd get all these weird sounding side ban voices going on\nSo or the you know whatever that says it could be I get really even slowed down side band or a spent upside banned it could be a lot of things at the moment though they're saying this is what they're getting these are seismic waves or they could be the wind and they're not sure they're saying it could be under the cross or it could be something blowing over the crust to create this type of\nAh the sound uh it does sound very much like something out of preventing planet it sounds like somebody be from an old Nineteen fifty science fiction film\nAnd uh once again I played it and uh I get I'm getting worried that when I play that I got some jamming going on so I don't know if they're trying to block green from playing this I mean what's going on and kind of reluctant to play it again but maybe if I get enough demand I'll play it again so people can hear\nOh one quick question and a ... more about that she was sort of the\nSun the
