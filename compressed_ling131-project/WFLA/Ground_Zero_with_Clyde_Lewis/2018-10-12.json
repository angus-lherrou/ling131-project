you're constantly getting these hints\nAbout more civil war and license for violence and the motives of course getting what you want to promote it you know we want so many people to go out and vote but we don't want certain people to win and if they win will keep being on civil to one another if they if they lose maybe there'll be more violence\n\nAnd of course the media says about Trump when he said about the geo ... violence enjoys well that three expected you know he's a he's a fear mongering narcissistic blah blah blah blah blah blah you do that anyway but then Hillary Clinton says\nConsequences be damned we need to have incivility until we get we want to claim of civility could return when Democrats have power is this measure the ends justify the means\n\nMeanwhile she said this one we've had Republicans that are being shot stabbed ... be mailed a\nA rice in powder run out of restaurants sent death threats and yet she says we got to be an civil until we get what we want well who's giving the chilling responses right now\nSome guy I guess a bit of two hundred pound bombs but you want to detonate on election day one guy said he was going to do his motives were born in the news\nEric Holder's basically set up by the quote somewhere Eric Holder the streets we said we need to kick them talking about the Republicans we need to pick them when they're low\nThese are words of war\nAnd I know people don't want to you don't want to they want to admit to it but they are so what do we do well you've got to be fighting a civil war which many people were saying I'm doing why don't we take the task these people are making these statements including President Trump\n\nYou know we we stop blaming the Russians from middling now we're doing it wide open\n\nElections or or there's meddling going on the media is meddling Hillary Clinton is battling and now Donald Trump says well the that's meddling too\nThat's voter manipulation in my opinion is motor manipulation\nRegardless of what you think of your president regards what do you think of Hillary Clinton that his voter but if you only should\n\nSomeone who just sit down with them and say you know you just did what you said about your ... your manipulating the boat Hillary when you said that the Christian on the ... vote\nI'm sure they don't care\nI'm sure many of you don't care that I'm

would feel they thought he has a in the street\n[laughter] okay there's one thing you haven't touched on now [noise] I'm going to preface this by saying that\nRed as it stands nothing Hillary Clinton said actually suggested violence\nA really really ...\nThe opposite of civil is not violent it is rude now I Know that they're being very push ally and dangerously route but they are being rude nonetheless not violent not yet any faults does not have a party and he saw his last lot I don't think anybody realized that they don't have a party\nThey don't even have a left right there a black bloc okay that I didn't call to talk about any phone [noise] what has been done\nBy Hillary in the service of whoever's\nPutting up blocks and all the other thing is a lot more insidious than simply saying we cannot be violent anymore we have to be violent now that's not what she said [noise] remember that most you you prove this the other night when\nYou did your show that most Americans have no idea what the word civil war me [noise]\nIt\nDoes not mean a civil war no not necessary evil means no not necessarily not at all civil means state Sable civil means within the state or city or something else it it means [noise]\nEven within the state instead of with other states that is what civil war means\nAnd I think it was civility nothing however\nHillary said the exact opposite of go go up the pilots that the civil what she did no one is realizing is the use\nOf the worst civil suggesting exactly the opposite of what she is saying she's calling on all the people who don't understand what civil war means and using that word as a seat it's a dog whistle it's so subtle that you didn't pick up on it\nWow\nShe all she had he was dropped that word because it confuses too many people\nAnd that way she's not saying anything bad she's nine citing any violence she's just saying I'm don't be nice but she's using that word because we don't understand it and it has a lot of connotations that we don't even understand\nBut in that case then she's going to have a backfire on her when you agree\nWhat do you mean\nWell I mean if she was you know if it was a dog whistle and you've seen or how you know people have acted towards a conservatives you've seen you know like Ted Cruz being harassed I'm not at ... ... you know\nI'm I'm not sure she knows what she did I'm not sure she goes to cheat I think somebody encouraged her to say that\nWell but it's he's obviously got the New York post printing out newspapers said or the owners are going to just declared civil war\nThat's right that Hillary doesn't doesn't control the post no the post controls Hillary that media controls Hillary and media controls Trump because the media is controlled by those who wants to civil war and the media doesn't know it\n... doesn't know it to be still doesn't know it for the deeds they basically are you is usually the media to manipulate civil war and they're using both Trump and Hillary as pawns in in in the whole matrix definitely no yeah it's interesting\nYou know I hate the word paid to work state but yes what you're saying\nWell if you say is real I mean come on what you want to call it man I got on when you get what they what are your other term for you people may be a a dark said a ... billion or does really a darkness or I don't know what we want to call it the
