play earlier today as we were watching some of the news feeds I was doing some play by play of the rest is Capitol Hill police were a\nCoughing you know with those plastic handcuffs or some of the protestors inside the Senate office building protesting Kavanaugh and now we find out that Amy Schumer\nAmy Schumer has been arrested she was among the protestors so I'm looking at an image of Schumer lined up against the wall and apparently\nShe was among the anti Kavanaugh protesters who was arrested and also a last name Schumer Amy Schumer yes she is a cousin of the Senate minority leader and New York Senator Chuck Schumer\nAnd there are certainly people all over the world right now they would rather rules for other reasons you know it maybe it's just that I've been watching too much American horror story apocalypse but might get a God if you watch that\nThat's a lesson in in the fight between what is the dark powers and whether it powers out there in the midst of an apocalypse\nPredicted programming revolution of the methods\nThat would be increasing globally ... a globalization of political economic institutions it's becoming easier for a relatively small group\nTo deceive itself into quite staggering influential positions and one ... particular reveals alarmingly what another small group will do is driven by financial belief systems and a cult things and all the things in the shadows all the things that can reach out and grab you from the darkness\n\nAnd while there are many conspiracy writers and observers that tend to talk about the material world within the conspiracy history\n\nWe always seem to point to whomever we hate has control over the world the spiritual realm\nBut what is the thriving right now in the midst of globalization a lot of frightening and somewhat complex things that are difficult to understand even I sometimes have to go back and read and understand that's why I come in every day early\n\nAnd yeah you can go through all the bad guys the masons ... accusing them of controlling all of a spiritual realm of what appears to be this imperial called however it becomes more complicated\n\nWhen you deal with witchcraft or priest craft that takes place within the spiritual matrix of the elite\nAnd a lot of this I mean I'm sure many of you don't understand it and you know I understand a little of it\nBecause of what I've studied my my entire life what I Would I put into this program every night every major step in the development of the new world order from a simple ideology drew a worldwide super state can be traced back\nTo specific ideologies which uphold ruled by a chosen body of spiritual elite secret Brotherhood's from behind the scenes the Brotherhood whatever it may be or the sisterhood if you want to be equal\nAll plays a role in the hidden hand that guides us towards disorder you can also be seen as a manifestation of elusive theory and spirituality the professors to enlighten practitioners through mysticism and magic\n\nAnd I kind of alluded to it in the last hour I use the the word synergy\nThere was a guy by the name of a ... say knives\nAnd he\nHad an opposition to the rise of anarchy and the second half of the nineteenth century\nAnd to him the ideal state was a rigid social hierarchy topped by an elite that is pretty destined to rule absolutely at odds with what you've been emerging concepts of democracy and so he decided that the only way to win\nAnd to gain power which do you use the supernatural as a weapon\n\nAnd so he wanted\nTo transmit the secret synergy throughout the ages basically coming in coordination and cooperation with a divine rule meaning that some spiritual fathers do not exist on this planet and they must be conjured up contacted\n\nAnd one of the spiritual fathers or some of the spiritual bothers us that are key were of course the knights Templar and other groups that you don't actually spawned and and and new ideas and and\nMysterious mysterious subjects and hidden meanings and certain conjure rings and all these things\n\nAnd I said before that it seems to me that you know be beyond the deep state
