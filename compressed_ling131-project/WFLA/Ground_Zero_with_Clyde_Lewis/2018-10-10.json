Seventy ... LA that when you ... to clear water\nJust how we're hearing words and phrases to create a schism in the brain and how they're confused as to point to the point where we're where or frightening terrified civil war\nCivil war\nNo one wants to admit it but we are right now I Believe in a civil war\n\nAnd it's time to stop saying that it's not happening because it doesn't affect you directly it is happening the media is playing into it social media is playing into it and just because it hasn't been declared we can say that isn't happening here it is happening here\nThe civil war we are in now\nIs that two sides fighting against each other whether there are two sides but liberal and conservative that are fighting against one another\nAnd that is that that is the main fight\nBut what we're saying if somebody is asymmetrical we're seeing something that's\nA patchwork of affiliated in surgery or insurgency groups\nAnd we have counterparts engaging in fights in skirmishes along overlapping edges of other networks that are demanding your support and your attention occasional ... and then this leads to occasional high value terror attacks windows terror attacks happened there turned into political radicalization points about things like gun control\nThings like immigration\nAnd it's not just that that were radicalized that were radicalized with TV shows Roseanne next remark immediately we we turn into a political football they bring back Murphy Brown it's a political football\nCapra Nick kneeling a political football\n\nYou know we have a hurricane right now heading for the Gulf Coast Michael now only about loss of life it won't be about property damage will be about whether or not it's global warming this is another ... ready to rally the troops to political something radicalized people it's happening\nAnd you say well ... no one asked me to join the war no they're not going to ask you to join the war that are going to ask you to pick a side because the war itself composing\n\nAnd the thing is if I say one thing we so obviously he thinks like this will know if I say that they're going to see things like that no I Am not taking any side I Would say in general\n\nThis is what we're saying itself composing there's no official or to be called\n\nThe war is that all of us were angry about everything what radicalized about everything we have an opinion about everything that doesn't seem to be ... or or even a even\nHealed and the aftermath of course is when we identify the war you're not gonna identify during the war you're identified after the war and that's what historians do\n\nWhen you take a look at all of the things that we could say were little skirmishes ... and little ideological or fights we had Charlottesville Berkeley Las Vegas and what's going on here in my my city yeah it is just it's terrifying\nAll fronts aren't territory and we're not fighting for territory we're fighting for ideological or ideological superiority\n\nJust as the risk missing the signs of network violence thinking in terms of classic civil war can blind us\nTo the many actors working to disrupt the United states from within and beyond our borders we heard Carlos talking about the rough childhood the cirrhosis of the word world we got a benefactor's provocateurs all the guards plutocrats transnational credible criminal networks where you have\nA Islam we have a border skirmishes where you have MS Thirteen we are I mean we have everybody\nWants to come here and disrupt the system this is why are you know we always hear about Russia provoking anger this is why George Soros is always the guy that's being said well he's funding move on funding all these other groups\n\nNow if you can think of all these characteristics and you'd think about how we're all breaking down into like these tribal segments and now they're fragmenting everything you can see that this is what a modern civil war looks like\nMore sporadic and unexpected conflicts but with fewer deaths\nFactions products like mushrooms taking different forms but coordinated across invisible networks waves of information warfare\n\nOr seeing chaos that accelerated ... accelerated bizarre of violence in all kinds of I mean\nLook we have a healthy immune response obviously for the local and national authorities\nThe goal of the civil war is not deaths but the fragmentation of the republic the goal of the global system will America down to manageable collectors and this would easily heart and resolve I've been increasingly authoritarian world government and would provide more reason to implement smart city infrastructure in order to maintain full spectrum control\n\nWhen I said get ready for anything prepared for anything I wasn't getting when I was on Alex Jones I said prepare for a war footing I'm not kidding I don't know if it's brinkmanship with another country I don't know if it's saber rattling I Know

heartbroken over trying to do the right thing and she was met with violence by the officer\n\nYou know it wasn't I mean it was the hurt and it was the brewers it was all that but she felt like this is my community and it's falling apart that's the only thing that she could think about when she was raised in the northwest and she loves the Pacific northwest\nAnd this is something that she can't believe what's happening here\nAnd I thought it was just gonna get worse because virtually every major institution right now in this country is being radicalized you're being reshaped by the radicalization of our public lives and you can look at it the social media section you could look at it or you could look at it on on regular media\nI mean ever since the president was elected reporters on both sides of the political aisle for markets big and small have shown less restrained on social media when it comes to their personal political viewpoints\nAnd I said dirty war begins with a journalist school dirty war begins with the artists in the journal is dirty war begins with the bankers dirty war begins with all those people who are the movers and shakers people and

and it's not because we have a union and the confederacy we're several groups that are pissed off but want to be heard to want to be known and will do anything in their power to do it\n\nGo to Jack in California hijacker\nOn ground zero yeah so right now we're in an unconventional so or at least that you\nKnow it's not on the bench law it's a civil war this is how civil wars are fought in in modern times it's not about dying about fragmenting it's about I mean some people will die and some people have died because we've had these terrorist attacks we've had shootings where all these things going on and no one's going to call it it's a civil war I mean what what what I expected\nShow if you compare it to our first so\nOur civil war was the first civil war this is not unconventional what you
