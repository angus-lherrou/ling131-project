[laughter]\n[laughter] I'll Try hello [laughter]\nHi Sue how many generations of impersonation should I go through ... is three enough like oh you like them all on here's the deal sous favorites

comments at all though [noise] [noise] [noise] oh hello squirrel [noise] what were your thoughts about being removed from the flight [noise]\nI just think of a squirrel and in the Christmas Vacation that flies out of the tree and here's the deal and yeah we got some audio so this woman was taken off a flight beef for the plane took off earlier this week it was Tuesday because\nShe insisted that she had to fly with her most shuttles supports quarrel\nAccording to frontier airlines which is kinda funny 'cause frontier there the animal airline 'cause they have all the the different animals\nWith names on the tails of all of their airplanes [laughter] I Wonder if they have a a square they ought to put in the in the light of this story they ought to put the motion will support squirrel on the tail of one of the airplanes anyway\nThis the passing your brought the squirrels Osborne a Cleveland bound flight in Orlando, Florida\nAnd claimed that she must be allowed to fly because this is an emotional support animal and emotional support squirrels\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter]\nYeah I think those dolphins sound effects but it works it works as a ... a squirrel is well a frontier acknowledge that the un identified woman\nDidn't say in a reservation lady she intended to have an emotional support animal a company here on the trip but she didn't specify who is an emotional supports moral\nUh according to Cleveland's Fox eight rodents including squirrels folks squirrels those cute little squirrels you realize just rats with bushy tails write\nUs at ... at the squirrels they was daisy seriously a squirrel is a rat when a bushy tailed\nSo rodents including squirrels not allowed according to the airlines they told the woman the squirrels not permitted on board and asked her to leave but she reportedly refused to cooperate that's when the cops came on\nAnd I guess she was in a wheelchair as well so the cops made and when we get off the plane so they can deal with a woman once they ah once you is off the plane they abroad or the airports main terminal anyway here's an audio listen to this let me play some audio here of everyone cheering and applauding once they took her off [noise]\nSo there is there they're applauding all\nThe passengers they were taken off the flight [noise] for um for a little crazy this world\n[noise] hey baby wants to not [noise] you have some nuts [noise] how am I not stay the [noise] or they villages [noise] so\nKnew this world the woman takes off the flight and the passengers applauding [noise] uh emotional support squirrel sanity both have a great weekend we'll see you back here on Monday\nIs is slowly drifting away from us out of orbit the first man of course it's going to take us through the ... the apparel that to you know Neil Armstrong went through throw it in the middle of the problems we had with his wife his wife told me it would be saved in the kids were coming back\nOr either because they didn't think he'd be coming back from the moon is what I meant and so you know all about the reference to the Gemini program the Apollo program\nYou know or the deaths that happened before or the testing but see a lot of people you know point to that disaster Gus Grissom as the beginning of the conspiracy theory that we didn't go to the moon among Americans between Eighteen and twenty four years old twenty seven percent back in the Nineteen sixties\nExpressed doubts that NASA went to the moon over the years there have been many more people but also a stepped up and sit down and believing in the moon I don't believe that we went to the moon I Believe that a Hollywood has been telling us all this time that we have in the Stanley Kubrick directed the moon landings two thousand one a space odyssey\nTook time for their did the moon landing stuff\nAnd of course we were ... showed in Nineteen Seventy one diamonds Are Forever James Bond film is James Bond gets on a a a moon landing set\nNineteen Seventy eight Capricorn won a movie the talks about men faking or the Mars landing spot or two thousand and one of Fox special conspiracy theory did we landed on the moon basically saying stating a fact\nThat we never went to the moon then came by several film titled a funny thing happened on the way to the moon\nHe claimed he add footage of the astronaut speaking the famous for its shot and\nUh it's it's in his film if you want to look as funny thing happened on the way through and it shows the astronaut speaking the the the famous blue\nEarth shot so you know there are plenty of things that can cast doubt plenty of things are getting cast doubt on whether or not the moon landing happen in two thousand for\nPresident George W. Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon to Ryan program the ... the crew exploration vehicle\nBy two thousand eight you know we're supposed to be a working towards going to the moon getting there by twenty fourteen normally no later than twenty Fifteen didn't happen why because in two thousand nine actually when the two thousand nine round two thousand nine rock Obama pulled the plug\nBut uh it was because of a a a failed mission that we had to go to the moon where the LCROSS a rocket\nWill crater the ministry of there was water which didn't make any sense because we already had surveyor and landers and and orbiters the map the moon Clementine actually mapped the moon in Nineteen Ninety four and a comment I was able to deliver more than one point eight million digital images of the moon back to the ground\nAnd um\nThere was the in our our satellite they were ground tracking the stations or that they were they had to enter L A ground tracking satellite station was picking up on these images so everything is accessible to the general public via the Internet\nAnd one scientist reviewed the data from Clementine they already found the existence of ice within the moon's creator so why did they did as well\nYou know it was a failure nonetheless the LCROSS mission was a failure rock Obama pulled the funding from a vis a constellation Orion a project which kept us from going to the moon and a nine billion dollars is cut from the program and uh it slows down now here we are in twenty\nTeam we've been told that the moon is the goal again and what's really cool\nIs it today it was reported that Seventeen scientists often to report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national NASA mission the briefing was authored by National Academy of Sciences engineering and medicine it says ... instead of the briefing and says that ah\nThat's very important\nThat the new NASA missions include a studies at astrobiology\nStudies of how life originated on earth and how it might have evolved elsewhere in the universe and every phase of all NASA admissions destined for space from inception conceptualization they have to plan on trying to find a way to discover life in space\nAnd I think ... it's obvious the reason why they're saying is is because yes they have confidence that they found these techno signatures they found the grammatical waves are in fact Russian scientists to colliding starts thinking it was armada I played the tones of the stars coming out of the Senate south alarms all over the country so I won't be doing that again\nBut um\nAnd in fact this awful arms of shutdown radio station so if I had that Arabs because of that\nAh but in recent years we in the show has been discussing that\nThousands of exoplanets and biologists were actually uncovering new insights to the complexity diversity of life on earth and and also a means discoveries would bolster and move closer to\nThe chance that life could exist on other worlds and therefore all space X ray exploration missions now should incorporate technology to find traces of alien organisms\nSo you know with the number of exoplanets they've discovered with all the ideas about life on other planets scientists recommending that NASA accelerate the development of technologies\nTo detect the microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready instrument meaning there isn't anything ready now nothing they can fly out the space to take care of this problem nothing that can traveled to distill rose and measured the composition of its elements minerals organic matter that sort of thing\nSo the report suggests\nThat direct imaging systems to suppress star like should be used outside our solar system to improved detection a bio signatures from planet that might orbit those stars NASA also uh is being told that they can plan for more missions appear under the surface of exoplanets however\nThe efforts to locate extraterrestrials either in our solar system are light years away is going to cost a lot of money and you need do advanced technology to do it\nWell here's the deal NASA space launch system the S L F the new rocket they were putting together to go to the moon was supposed to be the design to go to the moon and then ... and then eventually go to Mars was a very powerful rocket\nApparently um it's running years behind a schedule is a lot of major cost overruns and it just got slammed by internal audit twelve point two billion dollars to develop this launch system\nA Wednesday the auditors came in public to report highlighting problems with the work of NASA and bowling and the report flags sixty four million dollars in extra fees they were given a NASA they slammed bowling for poor from a poor performance and question the long term sustainability of the super rocket program\n\nAnd the report even calls into question the sustainability of an entire project meaning that even with all the bright ideas and designs and the idea that we can go out and find aliens now this rocket won't even make it off the launch pad for years won't even make it to the moon\nSo this whole newly manned moon project they were supposed to have going on by twenty twenty ... may not happen and also I don't think space forces going to happen either I mean so you know once again we have this movie first man\nA big old infomercial for NASA and they can't even get a rocket off the ground sure we can sit up satellites probes robots but the man to the moon with a new rocket yeah we can't do that don't have any more I mean we're going to do it\nBut we were gonna do it in twenty Fifteen but Brock Obama made that go away and it was just and we're still supposed to send them out of the moon by twenty twenty and asks\nWe're going to the moon see that's the thing is I Want a guy I wanted to men on the moon before I die that's that's what I Want to see I don't think I'm going to see it and it sucks because\nI I thought I'd be go to the moon as you said earlier yeah it it was just\nKind of that kind of twisted me quite a bit\nYeah well it hurts me enough to have my doubts that's only going to say [noise] but they keep going thank you I mean if I found out tomorrow that we did go to the moon and they could prove to me beyond doubt I'd shut up about it but no there's no I haven't\nSeen anything yet that convinces be we went to the moon only\nTV [noise] and believe me they can do a lot of things with TV\nAnd a lot of things they did would be fooled people do a lot of things on a movie that do that is why first management petered my as they can make it and they can make it back then to\nTo release examined three thirty seven hundred that she
