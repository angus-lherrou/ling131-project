save them scoring chances this really fell in love for I said at the end\nUh shut off Broadway bath left and the Tampa Bay lightning this felt as much as any type of shut out of team shut out the way to defend it in front of him\nYou know there's no doubt but because it is a shutout he made some key said oh yeah you have to give the goalie the number one stock I've I've got ... number one star let me see that up for it in the reserves broad spectrum of illness I okay go ahead [laughter] yeah that's the last he has a number one because it is a shut out and you have to have some key big saves\nMy number two stars rhyming Donna I thought he saved three if not for\nWhat one of them at least probably would have been a goal I mean glorious scoring opportunities\nThat he took care of single handedly I thought he was standing the way he manages this game\nAnd on the third star I gotta go off to a ... off the book a little bit here the entire\n... cat lying ... cats line was really good and they did\nAs you prognosticators well do you and me though yeah I didn't know that they ended up being out there are a lot against the McKinnon line and they did a terrific job they chopped up to a game for them to their on them all the time they did everything that they had to and you know those guys are going to get some chances but I thought that line did a hell of a job\nIt really felt like a so we ... after the first period and he said you know we had a good start but we kind of stumbled in bumble our way through the first period from the start of the second period on maybe with the exception of a couple of minutes late in the second the lightning played almost textbook hockey\nAbsolutely absolutely well we remarked on the second period in particular\nThey manage the game perfectly in a really tough situation at altitude second period a long ways from your bench on the team that's full of horses and really wants to step on the gas and take it to you or they weren't able to do so because the lightning managed the ... got it out when they had to didn't mess around nothing had to be fancy and they were smart about that\nThat carried through to the third period certainly and I I have a lot of respect for how much energy they expanded\nReally being on the pocket hounding because you've got a one nothing game after a brilliant moved by stamp ghosts and ... to score the one goal of the game\nAnd then now you're protecting one goal lead walking that fine line between sitting back too much but not gambling too much offensively\nYou only get that right after the game when we can say yes they did it right right they won so many times you go well why did they take a chance there and then other times they'll say well why did they sit back so much they were doing so well up the ice you don't know until after they got it All right\nStarted the third period and we are waiting Ryan McDonnell will be joining us in a moment John Cooper just finished talking to the group the start of the third tier to third period shots were Thirteen six whitening but a lightning did a lot of that work of shot accumulation in the opening\nSeven to eight minutes of the third period and then that\nWas the ... power play goal but what did you like about how they started the third period that allowed them to get as much pressure on ... an shots on that because we are talking about earlier they were having trouble doing that even though they were tempting shot\nWell I think there was just a calm solid in this to to their entire game they you know all four lines were playing a lot that you know the pocket line which I gave it a third start to their technically the fourth line but they're getting out there in a regular rotation everybody feels important so everybody's executing the right way\nThey didn't have very many mistakes they didn't have very many ghastly turnovers in a fast game where there's so much pressure\nAnd you're gonna have some you'd just limit them as much as possible and then they get a big play from somebody who you know if they did turn it over and there were vulnerable for a you know a couple of seconds here or there\nThat's really what it takes the game is so fast\nAnd we point this certain turnovers at times and they go wow that's a bad turn over well it is but you know what\nOther people are responsible to cover up when there are turnovers some of them are almost unavoidable so those are the types of things when you executing the game like this winning a one nothing game like this can do more for you then winning six to two or six to five\nBecause everything's on the line the margin for error is so small and especially on a on the road when you played as hard as you have an escape and kept the top notch line down this one nothing went when goes a long way\nA little unusual to see a game not only the fact that it was one nothing but the way was played so tight in its checking to be played in October\nRespect I think you're right [laughter] yeah respect um you had to I mean they knew lightning new ... going to kill us I mean it came in with\nThirty four points twenty goals sixty percent of the avalanche goals scored by one line I mean ... what do you have to do you have to control them and that's what they did\nAll right Ryan McDevitt joined us downstairs rank congratulations so we were commenting that look a shutout is always the goal you as a big role in it and ... tonight but you got to defend it so well\nIn front of him particularly from the second period on how are you able to do that to to take away maybe some dangerous looks look dangerous but they didn't end up reaching you're goalie we wanted\nTo manage the really well and I'm now she got to be wherever that top lines on the ice allow them to play half day it's going to be a long night so it's a for the majority of that game especially second and third we did a good job managing the puck and\nLimiting are turnovers and then you don't five guys and that we did a good job closing out their time and space as the game went on and and be a little bit more aggressive there and and um help does not get caught up there too long [noise]\n\n\n\nRaces with guys like him is no fun is that\nNo I mean that's where it's art buddy you got to be so smart when they're on the ice and that even starts in the ozone I mean getting your shot through are putting the puck finding that\nThat line is so good at ah find an open space and taking advantage of opportunities and now she they create a lot on their own too so um you know is it the ... you know just one or two guys and it was all five guys on the ice or when they're out there and and certainly Vesey was there and we need them as well [noise]\nLike this against a team that's been hot on the road especially how much value do you see in the fact that I mean all four lines that the ... line I thought that a fabulous job and they were out there are a lot against MacGuineas line as well do what does that do for you guys in the middle of this road trip\nIn his ... coming off to kind of ... you know high scoring chance game and we had in Chicago you know to play against other high octane team and you know prove to ourselves that we keep the shots against down and we can win these taking when you know the office of opportunities aren't quite there as often as as we might like but uh [noise]\nYou know the bench was just incredible everybody was formed for each other you know we were tested a special teams again kind of like Joe is huge to get back on a you
