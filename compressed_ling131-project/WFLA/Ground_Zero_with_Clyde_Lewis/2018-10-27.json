some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada\nBought some rights from us the United states to sell their own version of the leader board and so they started making boards in Eighteen Ninety two and the rest is history and so a board such as Bob sports which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the ... makes it a prominent splash into\nThe market I mean everybody was buying them and using them at the heyday I mean this this has been a spiritual moving with going big time and\nI was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat boards and started doing different types of their own type a board and of course we ... a trademark passes the name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything\nA particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a suspect in serial killer or making aboard a basically feel that it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he would feel right about himself\nOr what have you are in his own special way\nI'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned earlier people do make their own and start customizing assign them\nUm but the degree of this type of story no I've never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case\nUm and it's I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted a legit or we don't know if he really was or not\nYeah we we don't know if you to be checked into somebody's mental institution\nRight in fact a you know that's that's the that's the thing is he avoided a any kind of prosecution because he checked in a mental institution I mean in in since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any ... any of this information to the authorities and if so did they take it seriously\n[noise] well it's just kind of awkward because I haven't really you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling on on on we just put the color\nA Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy used to work for ... which is an old TV show or on the which has only channel five or something right in the east\nAnd um she was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board and he worked on hated like um show he could like producing I think mhm current affairs and then he was the one who\nIntroduced it to the guys that make these um [noise] it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level\nLike the same image to same exact [noise] you know but then they took it and they just put on more quality thing with boxes and everything\nYou know in the background to run the background history\nYeah and they were told and everything you know and they put it down so they made it more like a sophisticated I guess\nBut I'm the same story and it's a very good I tell people you know\nNot to I I made them put on the heavy under Eighteen years old because this is real this is happening this really works\nAnd it's very scary and if if you have the wrong intentions and you know everybody would call go to the same place at the end but says some bad people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to some of them back\nTo shape it a shot a joke ...\nNo I'm a ... and I wanted to ask her and you know I have some idea of criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use a board in a long time let's be honest with you to board\nA gosh I Can't count back maybe I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they use it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated or lemonade peace that had a a a crystal glass so they use I mean you know boards can rudimentary like that'd be even\nWhen you see the TV show stranger things that you kind of a mix you board and Christmas tree lights so that her little boy you could go to the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know you you it doesn't ... we really do need boards do we care and I mean even the boards of bear or you can channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point and the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves support just becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard into being able to to access your own ability to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here when I started working the board was at my own\nSix cents ... he started developing really started really being fined tune\nAnd taking the Broadway I can still do this work and pay a lot of people use and the old days they used typewriters word processors now they use computer keyboards and they channel that way\nIt's what I find it to board with people it's the tactile experience and the movement movement itself that kind of opens up your receptor so you could start bringing in the information and so again I Want to be real clear the board there's no negative energy with any board that's why I have no problem\nHaving any board at my home cooking I got an ... even this board that I'm that great uncle made 'em for his purposes I have no problem with that because I Know nothing negative will happen unless I Want that to happen unless I Try to bring that to me or that's my desire or that's how
