what they are it's reversed causality or something else\nAnd the other night I was watching a movie called tomorrow in it was in my free movies band and I remember it being a good movie I wanted to see it again and what was interesting about it was it reminded me\nOf well\nA secret society in the film a fictional secret society called plus ultra\nAnd a lot of people who are involved with plus all trolleys visionaries Thomas Edison and H. G. wells and uh several other people Thomas Edison Mark Twain all having connections in fact they said that even this be was a member of this plus ultra group\nAnd I thought well that sounds really believable is plus ultra real\nWell yes and no okay cause I'm finding out that maybe it's not called plus ultra but it's something else even does be was a part of something called club thirty three that he created it was just a special club for some of the people he knew\nAnd some very special people and of course a lot of people believe that the club thirty three comes from the thirty three degrees and masonry because this was part of the Malay when he was a kid so plus ultra\nIs there any truth to the idea that maybe plus ultra may be some time travel group or some group it created a a breakaway civilization on some other plane a utopian plane well H. G. wells\nAre as you know there was a movie made about H. G. wells called time after time it was another fictional movie where wells goes into the future to find Jack the ripper and he does so by using his quote fabled time machine and the movie and it's kind of ... cryptic late says H. G. wells married Amy Catherine Robbins\nWho died in Nineteen twenty seven minutes as as a writer he anticipated socialism global war space travel\nAnd women's liberation he died in Nineteen forty six well wells also claimed that he was a Fabian socialist he was part of the open conspiracy to establish a future new\nWorld order out he knew that he wouldn't live to see the day that this new world order would happen but he knew that a new world order was in the works and he wrote a book in Nineteen forty called the new world order\nAnd the book addressed the ideal of a world without a war or a utopia that basically emanates from a global government there was a charisma medical leader that led them and the whole nine yards well prior to that book wells wrote the shape of things to come which is another book that was kind of eerily prophetic because he talked about a World War started in Nineteen forty\nOr the world will be brought into a new world order by criminal dictator who ... the war machine and so that actually approximate and what really happened in World War two\nWell then he wrote and several of his books that that there was a shadow government there was looming that this shadow government was there to create a new world order that would replace world religion and it would be an ugly thing and kind of like we've been joined Israeli said about the British Government and well well you know he was a visionary we notice\nAnd whether or not he was a time travel is anyone's guess I don't know if you ... ... but ... but he according to this movie was part of the plus ultra program now Nikola Tesla\nIs also one of the guys that was in this program this plus ultra program allegedly in the in the Disney movie and of course his inventions went beyond electricity in fact there were some people who believe that he created a time machine\nBut he was be I guess the American equivalent of H. G. wells at the time well by the time of his death he had patented about seven hundred things but after he died in Nineteen forty three all those possessions were seized by a government office called the government office of alien property\nBut about three weeks after they were seized all test those things in documents were given a thorough examination by group of FBI agents that included none other than John Gee Trump who was the uncle of Donald Trump\nOur president but what's interesting is that you know John gene Trump said that Nikola Tesla's papers were really amounted to nothing but a Trump went on to a actually create X ray machines tests all was working extra machines inside but he created them\nAnd of course Trump Donald Trump always says well I come from a long light of intellectuals and very a genius says like my uncle John J.
