who's been paying attention\nTo the goings on in the world it's increasingly obvious that\nWere already under a new world order and it's being brought to you by the global industrial deep state which is a powerful ... made up of international government agencies in corporations and I don't know how you defined I had to find out this worldwide fascism and it's something that uh I think we need to\nWe need to be aware of as a country together agreement the enemy is out there too and that we shouldn't be fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this order and wants to take over\nTo go to Jackie in California Hi Jack you're on ground zero\nQuite interesting story but I think it just didn't ring true to me about how do you feel name ...\nLike add ... ...\n... you know so you had the church came out ... showed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the team Elena\n[noise] well if they knew that these guys over there to put a hit on somebody why didn't they stop them so I think you have\nA the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen but what does it ring true to me is have you ever heard of a of any nation states sending Fifteen people to do it hit I mean if you're\nIf you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill him and the more people you have in the inner price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong so the stories from the beginning didn't ring true but Trump is a between a rock and a hard spot now\nBecause you're coming up on the mid term elections and they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you could see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly and the price of gasoline would skyrocket would have an immediate effect on the economy and it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy\nAnd the worst time for this to happen this right before\nThe elections so what's your indicators that something like this is a foot this hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was it like I said this is an example of worldwide be stay manipulation heat is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump is about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence\nWould this ... this happening and and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go by\n[noise] well\nIt's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy wish and we're looking at\nA another indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil is going to start going up I think to moral could be a very bad day in the stock market if if this thing somehow starts to escalate now\nHow how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when ...\nIs the Saudi citizens\nAnd he was actually in a Saudi embassy which makes him on Saudi territory we have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here in the United states is of no consequence the president United States has really no authority\nTo retaliate against Saudi Arabia but yeah I watch him get pressure to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to leak the story out that Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey and said that they know that he was taking in was killed and was dismembered and the flu is remains I Can't remember the ... too but uh the movement of the country\nClyde is the Turkish government had a video evidence of the team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it team\nProbably do the same reason you say that you would in a he was in Saudi Arabia territory they can get in there and embassy and do anything about it\nWell but but you're making the argument that that may be the CIA let this happen that\nThey argue with the CIA was a facility painting operation deeply an opportune argument that he said operatives lady I pay for facilitators to the murder of is a good show geek and of course Saudi Arabian\nOr a B C D operators were involved here as well now turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed too\nBut what I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple or our country even more can we give the Trump is pressure to do anything it's going to bring up gas prices and it's going to bring\nUp inflation and it's going to kill our economy\nAnd the worst thing that could happen to Trump is that the Democrats get control of Congress so you would want an incident is an incident like this to happen right before Christmas right before the elections what could make Trump look worse I Hope he doesn't fall for the bait and retaliate against Saudi Arabia\nThe thing I have a feeling do need to do that well I have a feeling though that's what they want I mean big the neo cons are still in control of a lot of things around Donald Trump okay you got ... and who certainly was a signatory on the project for the new American Century and if they moved him into another George W. Bush were screwed so he's old\nEnough to remember when Saudi Arabia pulled back their oil supply in the seventies\nAnd we had an immediate gasoline shortage there was long lines for gasoline yep and they went to the odd even license plates right so you can gas up one day if you play it was even in the next day if you play it was an even\nOn that I think they went by the last number of your plate so I mean number I was working in the motion picture business at the time and I'd have to have my\nWe had two cars so I'd have my wife gas up the car for me you know to get the car ready for the next day and then that day she gets up the other car and because the lions horrible I didn't have time to wait in line for gas but the price of gas skyrocketed\nAnd you can only imagine the leverage that Saudi Arabia is still has now if they pulled back or on their oil and they're saying if we're retaliated against by sanctions or any other means or that we're going to fall back on our oil and I think they use the figure that oil could go to two hundred dollars a barrel\nSo it'd be looking at ten dollars at the pump a gallon\nA easily my critic I don't know does does a Trump want to call their bluff\nNo idea that has been going through the bait and retaliate\nIt's all watch and wait now right and that's why I brought this up because I'm Glad somebody had asked me they said well why don't you talk about ... and I thought what am I talking about\nAnd then I realized oh I Know what to say that I looked over and I figured well gosh if they were all facilitating this this is one more way to destabilize the country namely United States of America stabilized this from the pomp stabilizes with inflation destabilize this\nWith an economy that's going to go by and then what will we have the will have to be put on a war footing by by Christmas Time\nRight and and remember the key thing is though if if this goes south quickly it could really affect the mid term elections and the Democrats if Trump looks bad the Democrats would easily get control of the house\nAnd so do you think this is a well once again in the deep state so what do you say the deep state intelligence ops wanting to make Trump look bad in making him by putting him in a position where you have to make the decision I think\nHe made a good point that they not only the Turkish government but the CIA is a facilitator because I've always maintained that there's elements inside a all of our main intelligence agencies including the CIA that hey Trump and they want to get rid of trumpet and it\nCosts like well it'd be allowing something like this\nTo happen it's creating the ... it's creating the atmosphere in the environment for a global is ... meeting that he does that work in America anymore the guy or something\nYou might have missed there there was last night and National Geographic special about the secret service\nAnd they talked about I'm a real story about an assassination attempt on President Trump while he was in a foreign country and kind of was behind it\nInteresting well we'll we'll see what happens but like I said right now this is certainly you know that's the whole purpose of the show tonight was discovering to show\nHow the deans said is worldwide thing about bad promote these states worldwide yeah BMI ... yang [noise] uh you know Christmas steal the British guy you have [noise] screw ball boys things to make about Russia look bad United States for bad with Russians during the Russian meddling terms and conditions now [noise] ah we we have ah people getting\nAnd ... being sent to them we have a God can you just go down the list of all these things that President Trump in a very very bad position [noise] even as much to see the competition exercise in Washington DC [noise] even\nThat's our next phase so I mean this could do it looked at it I think we have to look at turkey here born in the in the shaky footing or the wall is on with his\n... dropping like Iraq right and I hate to cut ties to the hardliners in Saudi Arabia yeah and and it's possible to this is a a a\nForm of a coup Jeff within Saudi Arabia to build interest served to serve to help a turkey get back in August ...\nWe'll see what happens you know we'll see what happens right now I I look though it doesn't look too good Peter thanks for your call ... ...

telling me that [noise] we're supposed to be independent now of oil we produce\nMore oil and Saudi Arabia well the question I had been is it worth that would that division why is gas so damn\nHigh right now I don't get it I mean we've we've seen it you know low before we've seen it in the you know down to you know to maybe even a two oh five to ... gallon\nBut now we're pushing four dollars a gallon and uh I I really think though that would have an effect probably not as much of effect is maybe you know ten dollars at the pump by me but I always get into this fear that some somebody will wake up to ten dollars a pop because it's something we've done or something is happening\nYeah I don't know the the just the world now anything is possible anything we speculate about the past is coming true it it's just weird how\nYou know and and it can you imagine how much division would happen if we found ourselves in a\nIn a in a moment of scarcity what am I talking about weeks to go with what the Henry Kissinger was talking about scarcity we must bore scarcity in order to demonstrate what it would mean to redistribute the wealth redistribute goods and services in\nAnd and make everything uh a happy global family feed\nThis is what they're pushing for an outside interest and outside interested is not American constitutional republic not democracy it's something else we want and they they they need to make their dance and trauma that he's traumatized enough to be ready\nBecause they're ... they're due date is twenty thirty that's where they would say due date is twenty thirty and then from there who knows but the the beginnings of what they want to establish\nAnd what they want to put forward a and that is a a conspiracy to destabilize the United\nStates of America to go to George in Kentucky I George or on ground zero\nHey I how about yourself a little bit I think you're right about each day but what about the situation with Trump we've never seen a president for that does rallies way Trump as to like public on both directions\nOr we have an eight ball Shirley how George George do these are like I say well I Know you need to acknowledge the fact that there are other presidents have had the ability to do with Trump does\nAnd what he's doing now if we destabilize the country when these elections come up and I don't think this election is going to be the major but I think the next one coming up is it ... all of a sudden will be stabilized with this deep state\nEvolved law this Trump is going to be able to put himself in a situation where he's going to say we're going to hold off on the elections and we'll just carrying the through until\nWe stabilize country\nWar so this is what they thought Obama was going to do this where they thought George Bush was going to do they didn't do it so you think the Trump would be stupid enough to suspend election so that I\nKnow it's not stupid if you think about it\nWell if he would lay that\nMost you got most of the American public\nI can hear Hitler Hitler Hitler I give you your Hitler chanted in the streets about happened\nYet but that's what we think about what the upper ... between the neo Nazis the class and everything that's going on I think about all the approach going on and what this is set up for an Emmy again if you look at it in a respect the\nLaw is not going on that it's not happening but then you go okay well that can't happen but it is happening look at all the diversity or I mean like that's happening with the Arab by a little up or you got all these", "show_name": "Ground Zero
