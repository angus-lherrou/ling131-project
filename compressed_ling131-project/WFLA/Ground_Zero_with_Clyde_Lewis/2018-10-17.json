guy and it's if intellectual honestly that's my position I didn't canvas and I I support his policies for the most part and I'll I'll spend plenty of air time talking about when he does phenomenal things\nBut I also talk about the things that are unacceptable and I think that that nails it but there he he's almost an exception the call we just have\nTheir uh even though he's a total Trump crane guy and he wants Trump to knock off some of the name calling there are a much higher percentage of individuals that would be full Trump supporters all on Trump Trump frame\nThat oh yeah man of horse face yeah that's the best estimate I I don't get it there is a a civility issue there is a decorum issue\nAnd I were going backwards in that department but that color the Trump supporter we just had he had a hundred percent right that is the correct answer\nYou might be opposed the Stormy Daniels might not be happy Trump won this federal round here one of the lawsuit being thrown out but its intellectual honesty to be able to state that now horse facing and calling them even though she's a porn star you know don't try to justify it\nWe only the president calling her horse face just say

why you would do that how about this guy Harvey answering or you know you know tell me about him ... or with a with the first drug czar in a column and drug czar but he went on his ... at marijuana we say back in the Nineteen thirties and Nike Ortiz remember do you ever get among the ...\nYeah I remember ...\n... a a Mexican immigrants who are coming to this country for a year to\nTake the lead us back in the Nineteen twenties actually turning twenty century stash civil war maybe\nAfter the stash ... more of a um a lot of Mexican started to come over here at the in the early part of the twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana ... identified with Mexican immigrants and this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and\nUh the government got his great idea to uh to uh\nTo prohibit marijuana along with alcohol and we really complain about marijuana 'cause nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made up they created in the campaign around reefer madness this idea that if you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's a funny movie now wasn't funny on covering for Madison talks about all of\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is ask cringe when they called the marijuana act act which I don't know if you heard of that a\nMarijuana tax that company put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana they put a tax on marijuana and they said didn't declare tried marijuana\nAnd taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... or ... with Nixon's war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana is legal and it's been illegal ever set but the fact of the matter is\nIs that people have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our draw our jail are ill with people who are they are simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing marijuana\nAnd like you said earlier we created at least a police state around are around people are just surround people who simply want to get high whether it's through\nA marijuana or secondary LAX or even with opiates why don't why don't we don't have a prohibition against alcohol what we know that marijuana clogged I'll tell you\nThis is the thing that uh you know and and for me I guess it sets be apart from a lot of a talk show hosts are mostly on conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where of course it's legal or both recreationally andme ... to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages or in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd uh when I did and it was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times and I never touched it again and it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I don't think it's good for my body to do this then I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer\nIt became a so difficult\nTo actually a deal with a lot it every day the the feeling of a a foggy had all this stuff felt bad and one of my friends came by and he says hey I Want to have you try something and I looked as though no no no I Can't do this\nAnd he says what's wrong he says I said I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not going to\nAnd he said no give it a try and he says he says and and and he was a guy that it would just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try cannabis and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and it was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know some idiot ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea\nAnd I I certainly changed my mind in one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about\nUm things like a cannabis that they ah let them use CBD Oil Somalian does it as an ointment on their joints and ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given it to end brownie form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a ... a a a a an ... an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that it has such a bad rap and drugs in this country as such a bad rap and see in other countries in Europe in England places\nAll over the world they they treat or this type of a crisis not with jail time and and punished but they they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest where they put them in the hospital and they have to be treated\nAnd and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean and a and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better or a far better thing for this country to look at people with this is not feeling morally but they actually people who are in need of help\nAnd they're in need of a ... there were needed medical care\nAnd I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we can develop facilities we developed cancer facilities were developed a facilities for specialized treatments and I think the facilities a specialized treatments on various drugs some of the more lethal ones like crack\nOr uh or or or even heroin addiction and other addictions you know everybody complains about you know the needles everywhere well if we were to find people put them in facilities and have him is not going as criminals and be trained to be put into the position of criminals\nThere actually put into hospitals where they were under a medical arrest that would be something I think would be an idea that we would need in this country to help ... rehab all the people that have gone through this because the problem is bad and you can agree with me I Know the doctors do not know how to actually\nYeah I like them because they came to me and offered me help and they helped me a lot and of course they're helping my wife polite to with her cancer surgeries and and giving her nutritional supplements would reduce the actual reduced or the the the tumor a swelling routed down actually\nTake you know that's what we're talking about earlier\nWe don't know that the anxiety and the uh the depression and the pain that people are starting from is not related to decisions and likewise we don't know\nThat the inflammatory diseases than immune disease and cancer and heart disease diabetes or what why not related to the traditional divisions like Berkeley we know that if you take magnesium out of the die you're gonna have blood sugar problems yeah are you going to argue that ... that's\nThe thing is you know if he were to go to tell us more about what needs to be put in the body say instead of having this gas I think a lot more people will be healthier we wouldn't have to worry about opiates or any other drugs where do you do the calls coming up Tripoli fix him at
