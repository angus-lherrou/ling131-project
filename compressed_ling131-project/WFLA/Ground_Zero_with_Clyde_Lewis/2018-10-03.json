a ... that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad to have a bat but uh I Would say that you know\nThey're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many people lost track of what happened was John relieving the Chandra Levy case would Gary Cohn did that is if they were able to look through the ... the nine eleven attacks\nRight okay well I got to put that on out there and I'll let you get to know that are good\nVery good point though very good comparison history you get your brownie points for being a story

Eighteen eleven you have this thing going on at two Eighteen as you said right\nWhich is an eleven eleven yeah and we just had a jogger who was murdered in DC not too long ago\nRyan Miller to what was discussed just recently by the previous caller right Kentucky yeah it does have an air quality to it in\n... you might want to get technical when was the ground broken for the Pentagon\nWhat I've what day was that September eleventh\nAll right yeah I Would say just one thing but I was calling up about the rice said and to to go on Ben and I forgot where the young man was from but when he was speculating on it being possibly from someone on the Republican or or Republicans\nSympathetic side because if you recall back in terms of predicting programming\nWhat happened to ... ruin Venezuela

behavior taking place upon the part of the United states where they're already threatening to\nStrike a Russian missile or install installation because of start treaty violations and they're moving a shift to the ass off to see a off of the Ukrainian coastline over there and they're Crimea right and so I mean there's a lot of powder keg occurring right now within the world\nRight and so there are a lot of distractions but the thing is is that how are these distractions affecting them both how are they affect you invest you know\nThe vote I Will tell you you don't have to I wouldn't even worry about it because I'm already screaming now the court has been de legitimize by Mitch McConnell's machinations and when something comes down to that is going to be a dramatic decision that will be the battle cry\nWill be confirmed yeah and when he finally does make a decision for something that will become a fifty fifty unpopularity then it will be pointed out that while you can politicize a court you can't make it political\nHow would you feel do if the FBI did not release the information about Kavanaugh and his activities when he was in high school\nOh I Would be I Would be ripping but I've also ripping based on the fact that there's this ... this a speculation on the part of Fox News that they're gonna already be finished by ...\nNot ... I'm Sorry to tell you it's not speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when I'm more fun to do that I heard it already from inside of that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressure them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just a ... a certain times in certain other things he could be guilty as hell and they wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but now Mitch McConnell has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nAs a matter they're getting what they are getting and the American people are going to a prize over it and that that's what I really don't\nCause you when you when you start playing with the very last\nWord because it's not right because that's the last word but it's ... it's the last it's ... it's the last word not because it's right but because it is the last word once you start making something from politicized the political that nobody's going to have faith and or in in the integrity of that institution anymore\nWell I think we've lost faith Eighteen years ago you didn't really I Do I did and I ... that's why I'm not political\nWell see that's why I don't understand your problem with people again being harassed you say by it I don't call that harassed and I think\nThat is around ... if I if I get on an escalator and a woman says to me oh you turn your back on women is I treat women I look back at it and say no I'm On an escalator I'm getting away from you jumping all over me and yelling at me for something I have no control over\nBut they wouldn't be doing it to you because you're not a person who takes on the position of publicity and demanding attention\nAt it and then even then I had\nThis agreement because I still consider it better than a presidential candidate who says to people beat the cream cheese out of somebody and I'll pay for\nYour legal you know one excuses Trump I don't excuse Trump from what he says in fact he causes own problems on his own but when you have people\nThat did basically ... things about you in public and yelling out all over the place I get very angry about in fact I get mad when people assume things about me to run through and the reason why don't they stand\nOn anything and you have and I mean\nI don't know what you don't have as a matter of ...
