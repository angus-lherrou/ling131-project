talk on cars have seen so I'm not singing the Beatles you were saying hey if I saying the\nBeatles I could just tell you all three or four listeners we've got to be gone and I can't afford to lose them right now rain but I Can't afford to lose them anyway welcome back to square talk on cars talking about how to fix your credit report mhm\nDo it yourself credit repair let's finish this up so I just said now that you've got your three reports and you know what's on there the next step is to lift the names handicap numbers of every bad item on your report even if it's valid and fruit\nAnd you're going to write a letter using these guidelines and this is very important um didn't give you some very specific words you're\nYou're going to stay in the ... river used your credit profile and you've found certain items that you believe that you believe to be an error and listen to all the bad items by name and account number and request that the credit bureau investigate the items\nAs they're highly injurious to you know those two words highly injurious those are really really really important words to using the letter\nSo you use those and what you're going to do now is you're going to listen to discrepancies and the personal information for so if there was a mistake and your address or your age or your place of employment 'cause all those things are part of your credit report\nThose are the things that you're going to list first the easy stuff so you're going to listen to discrepancies into personal information first and you're going to provide the correct information there then you're going to list the accounts that you feel have all this bad stuff on there\nAnd at the end of the letter you state that these items don't agree with your records and you wish to have them removed immediately if they're not substantiated it's like you say you're not saying here that they're not true like you said earlier on you believe that there are number\nAnd you want them removed immediately if they're not substantiated and also state and the letter that you want an updated copy of your credit report issued to you showing any changes made by law they have to provide that gee at that point [noise]\nAll right and now also if possible and this is why we're talking about this now you want to do it in the right season and this is the right season to do it mhm you're truly is to send you a letter because a lot of businesses\nGet very busy and they may not respond in a timely manner to the credit bureau during the busy holiday season and you know next month it starts you know we've got Halloween and been Thanksgiving and then the Christmas season and that's why we want to do that now\nThat when you send a letter you want to be sure to send it registered mail and you always want to register any mail you send to a credit bureau or creditor and keep a copy of your letter to both of them for your for your records and you want to send this letter to each one of the different credit ... credit bureaus\nAnd once the credit bureaus receive your request at that point believe it or not they're required by law to contact the creditor\nWho listed each contested item and they have to ask them for ... for proof that it's bad if the information isn't true the creditor obviously won't be able to substantiate it if there was a mistake there\nBut the real beauty of this whole thing\nIs that a lot of creditors may not bother to respond to the letter and that's what we're hoping for either they don't have the records handy or they're too busy or maybe the letter got lost and some pile on somebody's desk or maybe they just I don't know maybe they don't care\nWhatever the reasons\nBut they don't provide you the documentation if they don't provide documentation to the credit bureau within a reasonable amount of time and usually it's like thirty days like I said this is the beauty of it\nThe credit bureau at that point is required by law to remove the item from your report so even though it might be a legitimate item that you may have screwed up on or you just add some difficulty\nOnce the credit bureau requested from the creditors send them some proof and they don't respond credit bureau has to take that off your report mhm so once that happens\nAnd they send you you knew credit report if anything's changed and maybe some things you know maybe nothing has changed but you know don't get don't get upset because you've just because of the process really\nSo to remove any items that are still you know bugging your ... your next step the next step is you know what it is Randy ... rings and repeat rinsing repeat we're not talking about cleaning your beard\n[laughter] reports you [noise] can't believe I Can't believe you walked in here this morning with curlers and ... you know kind of keep up appearances [laughter] yeah that's an appearance okay but that's he's absolutely right except don't due to the rents apart because the paper doesn't get get through that\nWhat her very well you're going to you're going to repeat step one again\nYep you're going to do the same thing you're going to send another letter and others dispute letter\nStating that you still believe those items were never entered pleas investigate them again and this is why we wouldn't do that right now towards the end of October early November because like I say the big one is the Christmas holidays New Year's when everybody's head is some place else definitely", "show_name": "Rejuvenation", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day":
