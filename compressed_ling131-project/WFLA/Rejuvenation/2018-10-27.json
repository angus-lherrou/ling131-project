Ford's president of global operations said at an event on Monday starting the manufacturing of the new range or pick up he says now US Steel costs more than anywhere else in the world now\nUm he says that they're talking to the administration about the tariffs and he says they're going to tell them that they need to have competitive costs at our market in order to compete around the world\nAnd uh yeah according to him the benchmark price of American Made steel\nHas gone up twenty eight percent in twenty eight team as as terrorists got implemented on imports so they say that the levees helped push the price for about nine hundred and twenty dollars for a metric time earlier this year the highest in a decade\nAnd they say the U.S steel currently costs about a hundred and fifty dollars more per metric time than steel made in other countries\nSo it's interesting Ford's on this battle that they're speaking up and I I give them credit and they think they have the right to say to you know I always remind people that when the recession came\nBack into two thousand and eight\nYeah and well everything got bad not only the car business housing people lost their jobs banking eBay and it was just awful and when it came time to start pulling out of the recession General Motors\nChrysler they put they put their hand out\nThey took money from the federal government to bail 'em out for it they stood on their own they sold off things they sold off their interest to Mazda they sold off jaguar they sold off landrover but they went through it themselves and you know they pulled up the deal bootstraps and they got through it so\nThey're speaking up now and uh they're the only ones that I see doing it but hopefully they'll continue because like I say these things come in it's going to make the average car car built so you're in the United states somewhere neighbor about twenty five hundred to four thousand dollars more expensive\nCar imported from outside of the United states on
