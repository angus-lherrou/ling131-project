nine zero nine zero zero two two\nTwo big questions that Chris um how do I just want an income plan and this is when we get all the time can I retire today\nMany federal employees that we see come in because they want to retire but they don't know how how many Chris have we seen that we have to show them because we run a federal benefits analysis that you can get enough income today and actually make more if you retire that if you continue to where\nWe just showed a client this past week they came in and we should um hey you can retire and get Social Security turn your pension you'll have more income coming in then you would working and she sat back and said what did you say and I said it again I said just [laughter] you gonna get a pension you're gonna get Social Security you'll have more income coming in when you were tired than working\nAnd she sat back and she said I no one's ever said that to me\nAnd we showed her we show to the tax return shouldn't pay less in taxes are going to keep more of her money and she didn't believe it but then she saw it she said oh my God what am I working then that's what we're talking about can you argue in that situation if you are a federal employee scheduled time than eat with us because we can show your benefits\nVisit our website federal educators dot com if you're not a federal employee and you have\nWorked for a company for so many years let's help you understand your benefits your pension benefits\nCan you take a lump sum can you do in in service distribution with four one K. what are your options do you have to take the single payer option what can you do is there a survivor benefits these are things that we we we talk about we help you understand so you can have that a ha moment and say oh my gosh now I Know what I can do that's what we do here\nAnd I know what Christ said sounds overwhelming but it's not because another thing that we are talking about many many of you out there have for one case you may have a four one K. from a company you work for years ago\nIt was still sitting there you need to give us a call so we can get that four one K. roll it over to an IRA because remember it's your money and of course many times we see people with more than one or two or three and go oh yeah you know 'cause people are changing jobs right if you don't understand the distribution of um four one K. had it with\nOr how to roll it over give us a call eight one three nine zero nine zero zero two two it's so important to have you understand about what you have and then you're going to make the right\nDecision at least to a lake and then last week and she had too old for one case and one was uh twelve years ago and it was eight years ago\nAnd we asked him one simple question who's managing for one case\nAnd she said nobody and you know she she doesn't work there\nNo one's helping her and she had the same allocation twelve years ago and all that eight years come when she first started\nAnd look at the market's been up but what if the market went down she has a lot of exposure and that's that's what we're talking about here is is your money let's say it again has your money make sure you understand what your options are where's it currently doing what do you want it to do for you mean with the right advisory who's going to help you educate you and put together a plan\nAnd how many of you remember when there was a time when you could retire gracefully knowing the company that you worked for providing you and your family maybe you had a pension remember those days wow a pension you'll listen this is the thing that we talked about how many of you listening today have attention\nAnd ... actually know what a pension is but if you do not have a pension plan we can design a pension plan for you\nHow many do you remember those good old days because that's a guaranteed paycheck crush the pensions Social Security and think about that from it because that guaranteed paycheck in the form of attention so many people Chris is gone\nIt's not there so let me say that again that guaranteed paycheck in the form of the pension plan is gone\nAnd that's because you don't understand how to set up a pension plan like we do and help them\nBut there's good news what's the good news is the good news that you can create your own family pension where you have control where you get income and if you're living\nIn something happens to you and your spouse can get the income but you know even a better benefit is if you both passed away most pension plan Joe pension plan stop there I Would your own family pension plan it doesn't stop\nIt stays in the family and go see a cancer he grandkids there's enough there that it will last forever if you set up the right way that's why it's so important to get a complete plan you know it was so\nIt was so passionate about what we do why because people need to know what we do people need to know that there are other options out there I said just putting

yeah it's pretty uh pretty neat tool if its use right away and and uh you know what you're looking for so and I'll tell you it's amazing to me so many of the recreational\nGuys I think seemed to think that the commercial guys are separate from us\nBut really it's not the commercial guys and the recreational guys we're all we're all share the same fishery\nOr one part of the family right so you know I had a commercial guy this is a true story and it's the first time it's happened to me and it's not I have a couple of guys that I Know\nThat I get information from that are just friendly and I do the same thing I did see a bunch of Jackson I call them up and go [laughter] I don't know if you're on the water do but I Know that's what you're looking for and but I had a guy wave me down\nThat I did not know\nLike I was headed to a spot and I see him coming up thinking what's he doing these coming right out of me\nWaves me down and he is like I got my customers and the everything you know you look at the red fish goes to there's a whole school of 'em right over there I'm like\nReally he's like yeah dude I mean he goes there wasn't a whole lot of mode over there but uh I'm just tell you there's a giant school redfish right there and I was thinking\nThat's awesome bro bank is an odd yeah\nLike what can I Do to help you get my lunch or something I mean you just don't you know you're running that every now and you don't do that and it's not that I don't think there's a big there's some obviously in all situations there's some people the commercial guys it probably hate us Charlie cabins and some charter cabs of hate the commercial guys but for the most part\nI think everybody coexist and gets along just fine\nBut I was really cool that guy was like even told my people in the boat I'm like that's a good dude right there I mean I don't get that call every day you know hey we're all share the same fashion yeah yeah that's all our fish and it's all our\nIt's all our God given right to to that resource you know that's why I don't like when the knuckleheads on the other side the peta people try to get us Duke and fighting with one another they gave us how does it help anything that you know if the commercial guys\nAnd the recreational guys ... group together and work together as a group that makes our voice bigger much stronger yeah much stronger sure makes a whole lot more sense so\nYou know it's something that you know we need to think about is a group you know just like\nThey invite a lot of valuable information to yeah oh dude there's no doubt there's no doubt and there's\nAn endless and there's there's some really really bad commercial guys there is and there's some really really bad guides and there's some really really bad recreational anguish there's bad apples\nIn every baskets out and it's just how it is so you just you take the knuckleheads and throw him out of the pile and go with the good stuff and try to keep everything going in a positive direction you know especially in this time you know we've got to the election here coming up this is an important election\nWhere people really need to think use your head vote the right way you know don't sit in your little democratic corner your little Republican corner\nIf you love to fish and you love to be on the water here in Florida you better be voting for water that's it you
