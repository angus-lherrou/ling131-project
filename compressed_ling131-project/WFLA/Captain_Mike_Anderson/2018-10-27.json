I Wish they had pet insurance because I'd be the first one that offer but these are things that are unexpected you know and and repairs for your older home and we're going to get into that in a minute

want to make sure we're planning and that's where we're talking about critical things you need to consider before retirement\nAnd when you come to meet with us we talk about that unexpected road what's plan on making sure that you are protected by the client last week just passed away we met with the the the wife and the kids and they were able to tell them that everything is going to be okay\nFinancially they're going to have the income that they're going to have even more income coming in they don't have to worry about that because we put together the plan and that's what it's all about didn't have to go through probate the money's going to go to them and they were so grateful and they can\nThey can sit there and and and and go through the time of remorse but with their family instead of worrying about their financial\nSo one of the other things that you need to consider during retirement and for your time is debt\nYou should have two primary financial goals for retirement retire with enough money to meet your retirement dreams and retire without dead\nSadly you know many people out there choosing to ignore the second piece of advice and are retiring with a large amount of debt are you that's the big question and we're not just talking about um affordable mortgage payments or anything like that we're talking about a growing\nAmong new retirees is retiring with credit card\nAnd other consumer debt and that was a gentleman last week and he says his wife just spend spend spend and he's still mad at her and that's what he or she does she spends but this isn't so

with your spare cash and this is one of the most hotly debated topics in personal finance a and and it's very difficult because people think they have enough money they can just pay off the home and among homeowners age sixty to sixty nine\nForty one percent still had a mortgage in two thousand seven that was ten years ago\nHow many uh two thousand Eighteen to they have\nThis is a large number so you know seniors are strapped for cash\nThey might want to consider what they call a reverse mortgage I Know some you might cringe but somebody that have done a reverse mortgage it makes sense and it makes sense only Chris if if you sit down and do the numbers because don't just run and I'm going to do a reverse mortgage we've helped a lot of people do it right and that that leaves let some living

today and tomorrow as well looks like you know pretty much pretty solid Fifteen wins you're beaten us down a little bit I'm not real happy with the west when we had yesterday and the west when we have this morning as we got a little push of a a little snake little stinky red red tide waters showed up\nUh in interior Verde yesterday with some fish not doing well or some of the guys running for us uh at some bait issue so [noise] um I don't think it's real bad that we should put it's so frustrating 'cause Thursday\nI cut bait as the south here you know a couple of throws blacked out the well\nRan back to O'Neill's you know right to ... go back to O'Neill's sit for a minute pick up my customers are on all the way over to the south shore again back towards back through to Rudy back underneath the skyway\nRun over the south shore and I mean I was blacked out both my wells were choked full abate never lost his single bait everything was fine yesterday morning just guys went to south here called bait and just sitting outside of Maxwell park waiting to pick up\nWe're losing their bait and so it's so frustrating 'cause it just comes and goes and wasn't like we had a\nWe didn't have a west when on Thursday you know\nIt has to be close is just body yeah well the guys you know they should have the same problems there haven't they got cages offshore I heard that but but you know really if you run through a patch of that stuff you're not you're not on oxygen or something you're gonna you're done subject to lose your bait yeah you know says super frustrated aunt really depend on that's the problem\nYeah you know I've been I've been I've been meaning to get off shore to film some shows\nUm and really anticipating that as it cools down the bike it's good I'm hearing all this I showed up I rent a double here I'm Out of the south shore and uh I show up at the ... you know six thirty at night and here's you know really harm or and Glenn Taylor or\nIn with their people did they had more fish they said the ... was just ridiculous offshore I mean absolutely insane you know Columbia and snapper and group or they just rectum\nAnd uh so I Want to get out there you know to do some filming I mean it's a great time of year to do that things start to get move closer water temperature getting down but I'm so nervous about running out there without live bait I Know you can do it on you know frozen bait no problem but you know it's nice to get out there and\nGet some of that action going up top if you can with some libraries but the chances that you get all the way out there with your live bait alive is such a crap shoot that it's hard to do right now\nYou can't really depend on that yeah or yeah I mean it's just\nSuper frustrating so\nHurting that Kobe is gonna be thirty six inches to by the way it when you mentioned Kobe yeah it's my understanding is thirty six inches and when does that so I don't know when it starts but I Know that the feds battle that okay well I mean\nDon't [noise] you know I Know I I only catch a handful year I don't do a bunch of target Coby uh trips for me it's one of those have any metal what are you doing here yeah um\nI Know guys who do biggest ... the is it pretty much getting gas on the email me less everybody's carrying a huge ... without a doubt yeah so what you know it's just kind of weird do I I just\nI just think that that's one of those fish that should be like a discretionary side you're allowed to one deals so you're not a gaffe and fashions oh man he's only thirty five inches I you know I mean so that's a good point so I kind of where I'm standing will ... will be a\nTouch and go on the ... you know I hadn't thought of that and I do carry a really big net and if if I'm not sure that he's legal um and I think it was what\nThird so they went from thirty three to four two thirty six to ... you know I'm not sure what that effect but I Know it it passed that's a big three inches to I mean ... you know it's just hard to judge ...\nEspecially in the water and you know God Forbid you all by yourself and it's even harder than there yeah I have to\nUh all inclusive package fantastic place my wife's than there with me now three times in a [noise] I'm assuming she'll make this trip as well she hasn't confirmed that with me yet but uh I I Can't picture her letting me go to Costa Rica by myself

got great local taco stores here in the area and the reason that they make it is because the owners like Larry um are are are into the people that are into the community that they live and they want people to catch fish I mean that's the difference plus you know and they will I should do and you know how to do it you're pretty\nGood at that yeah yeah yeah pretty good at Larry Larry do know

on the beach and I said yeah it was good and everything else and he said some guy went up there to get a date and I couldn't get back in with debate debate all die before they got back in ...\nYeah I
