overloaded\nAnd I I basically explained to him what he could do and and some some questions so we can help so of course those are important things you know Medicare I'm a federal employees that we do and then you know a lot of things coming up now about ... and again we talked about it before about income planning how do we get more money\nHow do we preserve our money the Maggie plan which is a tax plan and insurance plan and income plan and investment plan if your advisors not talking about these issues\nWe just gave you a reason to give us a call eight one three non zero non zero zero two two we have offices in St Pete we have an office in palm harbor in an office and lose so look folks you can get to us anyway or wherever you live it's real simple\nUp to you pick up the phone and give us a call it's that simple\nAnd let's just talk about the importance of that or getting a second opinion first advisor can't give you a second opinion you know most time what we see is people come in they have these these these statements needs throwing her desk when it's three them and at five and I just have a whole pile\nAnd they just don't know what it does or when they were doing and what they're doing or what it what it is doing right now but\nWhen people need money they just kind of get the statement they say well this would draw the money from there\nBut what if they knew that they can take it from the ... tax free account as opposed to a taxable account would they would they want to know\nAnd most advisors don't tell them they just sell them something and as if a new show with the we put together a plan you know every account that you had has a specific purpose and designed for it so if you're looking for income will show you how to take the income from that bucket\nOr if you need more you know income or a for a large purchases if you want to go on a cruise or travel around the world whatever it is you can take it from another bucket but it's going to be in the most tax efficient way that's what we're talking about strategically putting together a plant and you don't have to have a lot of money to do this\nIt's just knowing what you want to accomplish either it's more income growth of leave a legacy or reduce your taxes what is it\nSo here's the other question if you have an advisor or you don't have an advisor then we can help you in any way in other words if you have an advisor and you're not sure what he's doing\nCome in and let's do a comparison for you will do a free comparison and and this is the best thing we've told many people that came in bringing your plan and will tell you if it's good or if it's bad now couple of things happen if it's good\nAs ... we're going to tell you it's good because that's the responsibility we have but for someone to tell you if it's bad or you need improvement and we get these strategies and concepts that are better you know it's going to make the final decision you not me not Chris you but here's the thing what what if you found something that was better than what you have\nMy question to all of you is when would you want to know so if we come up with a strategy concept it's better I mean we had people sit in front of a sudden I can tell you they go well what do we do now it's real simple let's get it done and they they agree to my right\nYeah and it's it's for their benefit this is your money your advisors not our money it's your money so when you come in and he was asked is a reason why\nYou know I Want to know why you're here because road to our office Chris yeah but you want to reduce your taxes let's show you how do you want to plan let's put one together at let's build your house because no one else has and that's the problem we say you know these things are not taught in in college and I taught in high school\nOr you know that that the parents are are working you know each every day they don't teach their kids some some parents and families do but most people\nDon't they don't know where to go they don't have a direction let me bring this up because you just sit in or if we had a client come in last week a real nice gentleman and\nWe asked him how he found us we ask everybody did your show a TV show radio show he said no he says I'm actually went on online Internet okay 'cause he found Maggie tax any he grew up with it but\nWhen he came in Chris ... showed us was what he was exposed to before where he was dealing with the guy in another state that sent him emails right right of what he proposed which we never do because you're not supposed to do that\nAnd he wanted to do business over the phone with him why would you do that why would you do that well\nThe guy wanted synthesize he wanted a some direction buddy sent them the applications decide to fill out Chris right right yeah that's the way you do this job for us\nWe want to get to know you know honestly and you become a client of ours we we're we're here to help these throughout the whole process and that's what our dedication is to do with a new Sherry believing that\nThey believe in um you know making sure that we help you and you know there's some advise that the other just sell they sell them more transactional you know we don't we don't do that what we want to do is they want to show you a plan design of plants do you understand that that's what they call it the ... plan for your time and the ... plain and simple it's a plan that you can understand\nTax planning income planning investment planning insurance planning legacy planning Social Security maximus Haitian planning Medicare planning\nSpeaking of which if you're worried about Social Security we we can do a free Social Security max them as they should report and Chris talk about how important that is what it does to the people when they see this\nYou know real quick running out of time here but we met with the client last week when Social Security ... report we show them a different strategy called they're restricted application strategy\nTo not just take the benefit for each each one of them they can take one or the benefit of the other spouse will benefit and they didn't understand how it works and we showed them and they were like oh my gosh no one ever showed me that they actually went down the Social Security themselves had tests afford that and they they didn't tell them about it so this is what\nWe can do for you it it's pretty simple just pick up the phone scheduled time from the ... with us let's get together have a conversation\nAnd let's go from there you know if there's a strategy we can help me with and let's do it if not the manual now eight one three nine zero nine zero zero to to visit our website Maggie tax dot com and don't forget Tamara tune into the nag attacks and
