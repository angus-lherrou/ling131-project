about didn't have to go through probate the money's going to go to them and they were so grateful and they can\nThey can sit there and and and and go through the time of remorse but with their family instead of worrying about their financial\nSo one of the other things that we need to consider during retirement and for your retirement is dead\nYou should have two primary financial goals for retirement retire with enough money to meet your retirement dreams and retire without debt sadly you know many people out there choosing to ignore the second piece of advice and are retiring with a large amount of debt are you\nThat's the big question well not just talking about um affordable mortgage payments or\nAnything like that we're talking about a growing tendency among new retirees is retiring with credit card\nAnd other consumer debt and that was a gentleman last week and he says his wife just spend spend spend and he's still mad at her and that's what he or she does she spends

gym with knowing where these goes traps are she can win some prizes and get them out of the dog in a way\nYes indeed I kept a but it's good to be back when you got a good to have you how you feel and body\nI Am the rent and remarkably well at yeah thank you ah yeah as some of the boat snow I had a hip replaced and I'm just really no one quite well so far I'm not I'm not allowed back in the boat yet\nAny awards that have been made and the years passed right all of that stuff has publicly available I mean you can go on grants dot Gov and see all of the different opportunities that are available you can search it by by federal agency they want you to\nLike a grand for like just being really the the guy from a good guy grant ears fifty bucks\nI don't know that might be out of there but I doubt it but I doubt it was late they even if they can get pretty they they take it pretty seriously in these agencies I mean they're doing I'm In a lot of cases there's good work being done it's just that the publicity of it never doing most people don't know it exists but\nI think that's interesting because to me you know obviously with all the turmoil in Washington craziness I mean do you Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump just ran for president right right you know right that world is ... ... yeah exactly Donald Duck and yeah\nIf I may be much commoner was to go to help us so [laughter] but I mean what I mean what\nDo you it's me to me to see that there's grant money available for positive things seemed like a lot of grant money gets wasted and we felt and push it in some weird direction young\nBut this to me seems like grant money that's well spent on her as to where especially all the problems rather red tide and yeah you know that's right you're able to focus on the shore anyway it's hard to do the fact that they were award a grant to ocean a three sixty more something like this to me makes a ton of sense\nYeah you know basically our our ... came from no was marine debris program poker which is one of the the offices inside Noah\nAnd ah they're tasked with the cleanup of watersheds all around the country but um and they offer a couple a couple of small opportunities for community based organizations like ocean eight three sixty is um to apply and be considered for a grant award\nUm we actually received about Ninety thousand dollars to do this project which is that a great hit you know to give her a good money\nUm and the the good news is that um it ... it was actually a requirement of of the a grant opportunity but we had to match the federal funding request we were going to ask for Ninety grand we had to be able to match it with another Ninety grand in community contributions\nEither through cash coming from community members participant organizations or through in kind services like donated services and things like that would match the money that we were asking for\nAnd so we managed to do that with sponsorships for the goes trap rodeo that series from marine tech marina construction company you're a roundhouse creative studio which just yesterday we were out shooting commercials for the for the event theories\nAnd we're also going to be shooting a ghost fishing and marine debris PS a video of it it's going to be shown around are trying to get it on the news and everything should um ACE High printing which is um I think it's pretty explanatory they're ... they printed all of our materials and banners and all that stuff\nOr west marine in St Pete is pitching in\nUh the level of angry stroke which is a new restaurant\nOver a year after that's my brother got rolling of sponsors were up against the bottom of the hour Hillsborough no nine zero but that was for six one they both tend to nine three five to
