here and now Florida governor Rick Scott is warning residents along the Florida Panhandle to hunker down as hurricane Michael is expected to make landfall as a category for storm in the coming hours\nNow the storm is here is not safe to travel across and handle if you are in a coastal area do not leave your house the time to evacuating coastal areas has come and gone\nJoining us now is meteorologist Jeff Hoffman with the Florida public radio emergency network Jeff where is hurricane Michael right now\nA Jeremy we're looking at the center of this storm in the middle of the pie is twenty seven miles from Kendall air force base\nUm it's about thirty two miles from Panama City but the I wall or the destructive and almost catastrophic wins are is only spending about eight miles offshore so we're looking at conditions incredibly deteriorating and the next hour or two right along the coast there from Mexico beach to Panama City in Florida's panhandle\nAnd when will it make landfall in the next hour or two\nProbably will be ... you know the it's all about the wall when that comes to shore is when the conditions get their worst and that's going to be in the next hour or two at the center it's probably going to make landfall between a two and four pm this afternoon probably very close to ten till Airforce base which is just to the southeast to Panama City\nWhat impacts are being felt so far\nWell I Want to give our listeners around the nations in perspective on this Windsor at a hundred and fifty miles per hour that's from the national Hurricane Center\nIt's per hour isn't the storm a that is not weakening and the next couple of hours um I Would say we're gonna see sustained winds is they're really good chance we're going to be sustained winds across a large area of the coastline\nOf one hundred twenty to one hundred and fifty miles per hour in that range\nAs going to cost structure failure across many structures is is that as we've been telling our our audiences from the NPR W. K. geez see station in Panama City that this is not just a move inside type of storm this is a move to your interior room find a mattress find a bike helmet protect your head\nUm if you're in a surge area and we know from the officials that many folks ignored the evacuation warnings there they need to also thinking about moving to the second level of your home but also still find a way to protect yourself\nUm because you have to take your preparations and the next few minutes to the extreme level in those areas and talking a um Gulf and bay counties and Franklin counties are there in the panhandle of Florida\nAre the FEMA administrator Brock Long said in a news conference today that not only Florida but also Georgia needs to be prepared to see the power out maybe for multiple weeks he said another unfortunate aspect about hurricane Michael is the rainfall that's going to be associated with the storm has it pushes through let's listen\nHopefully the forward speed of the storm or reduce the amount of rainfall that South Carolina North Carolina see but uh as you all know Florence passed through the Cape Fear River and other river basins have yet to receive a back to normal river levels and or any amount of rainfall a through south and North Carolina uh is is not welcomed\nSo Jeff uh obviously the people who need to be paying attention at this very minute or the people there along the Florida Panhandle but what about people who are in Georgia in the Carolinas what what what should they be thinking about\nFor here and now comes from the listeners of W. B. U. R. Boston and Geico celebrating over Seventy five years of providing auto insurance for drivers across America more information on auto insurance available at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine\nPoint in San Bernardino where we have the sheriff's office confirming that they've had an active shooter where they have at least twenty victims of the shooter in an area that that\nWas December second twenty Fifteen the terror attack would claim fourteen lives and injured twenty two including Julie pious who was shot twice after her co worker open fire during an office Christmas Party\nSix months later we met pious at our home where she showed us some of the momentum she received during her recovery including a star of hope from one of her nurses\n[noise] the the things that get into the nice people so he runs marathons Everytime events on he said to them for people's comes across [laughter] so [noise]\nThey congratulations employ idiot 'cause I got an award is a day for anyway [noise] and [noise] and God Bless keep renting\nWe've been following her recovery ever since pie as recently left San Bernardino for Flagstaff, Arizona to start over Julie pie as joins us to talk about it Julie it's great to talk to you again and why did you want to move to Flagstaff\nWell through the county I got a medical retirement my husband decided to retire and we just wanted a new start we needed a fresh a fresh start over ... ... because of what happened a couple of years ago yeah\nIt was just really tough being there I became separated from the county when I got my uh medical retirement\nSo I'm On my own with medical and doing things and we just decided we wanted that kind of a smaller town safer atmosphere and uh just quieter calmer life\nAnd what do you mean by your on your own with medical\nWell once I separated from the county and like I was required to resign um from my job\nBumped for all my medical care from here on\nWhile an ... how is that working out financially\n[noise] um well my husband has ... health insurance so for me personally it's it's okay for some of my co workers who have had to do the same thing um you know they're paying for their own health insurance on their own now and it's a it's tougher\nSince we talked last I've had\nI think five surgeries and seven hospitalizations with each hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to approve any kind of treatment\nAnd oftentimes they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the guy that takes the wind out of sales so I Would rather take care of my own rather than waiting for them to approve or denied treatment\nWe heard so many people and we have after every single tragedy like this politicians come out and say we're going to be with you all the victims will help you out do do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct our county was saying we were county family and that you know they'll take care of us were county family really what they want my my impression if they want to to sweep us away we were\n[noise] you know we were a stain on the county um even for the second anniversary they did nothing there was nothing they said there should be a moment of silence you know eleven o'clock or something but that's it there was no memorial there was no there was nothing\n[noise] now you have started taking classes in graphic design or you're fifty three right now yes and so I was doing a career change\n[noise] it's different it's something I really enjoy so we'll see how it goes\nA real real career change I met you might just enjoy this retirement and uh spending time with my family and walking my dog and exploring Flagstaff northern Arizona area how're you doing physically after all those surgeries\nI think I'm doing better now I'm and I'm having the opportunity to go bike riding now and do much more um activities\nMentally here it's much better because it's a whole new space it's a whole new start\nFrom our interview originally had interviewed a Gary ... who is a sergeant with the San Bernardino police\nAnd he got a hold of me and we've been doing law enforcement presentations with Gary throughout the United states and so that's actually been very healing to be able to talk and to talk to law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from the\nFrom the victims and survivors point of view and you met because of our story yes well he actually heard me on the on that um interview\nAnd reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nGroup and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned each of us\nHad such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also he was our our chief of our department and he gives his perspective from [noise]\nSort of has their own net chip as what they experienced and what was running through their mind and\nHow law enforcement really how they can improve their responses for the victims side I Know quite a few of my co workers all they solve with law enforcement they're boots and in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them\nAnd so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that that just the shoes someone sing issues alone would make people assumed they were bad\nI recently met a um teacher from Parkland high school in Florida who run into the building to help save people during the shooting at after I found that out about him\nI didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know Dru Joyce thank him do I say great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through one of those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured that they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice\nI think they expect to see someone ... much more crippled maybe even looking more emotionally crippled if that makes sense so typically they're more shocked that I went through that and I'm standing there looking kind of to normal to them\nIs it difficult for you to talk to them about what happened\nIt's not now I think a thanks to these presentations that I've done it's actually been really healthy to repeat the story and just said the story it's become um more maybe\nBeen very healing for me\nThere have been so many other shootings since we last spoke ... have your views changed at all on or have you developed any idea about what could be done to stop this from happening\nNow I I it's so frustrating to me and\nIt just always seems that at the ease of obtaining weapons here but especially the the weapons like the air fifteens and these weapons that are made to hunt human beings really that's what they're made for\nThey're not made for going in sport shooting or hunting you shouldn't made for hunting humans\nAnd it's frustrating to me that there are so readily available in this country because it seems that all the shootings these mass shootings have involved that type of weapon\nAnd do you think that anything will be done about that\nI don't think anything's going to be done anytime soon unfortunately now\nWhen we talk to you in twenty sixteen you showed us some of the things that people had given you to help you recover a star of hope at a medal given to you after the attack by one of your nurses [noise] do you still have those things\nYes and actually I'm Dexter the nurse I presented him with the star of hope\nFunding for here and now

Scott\nHey Jeremy and with me in the studio K PCC in Pasadena as Mary Plummer whose political correspondent\nFor Cape PCC Hi Mary ... so let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom a Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox Scott you just moderated there first and possibly only debate\nThis week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poorest state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle the vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget\nAnd here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people or I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento uh the interest groups that inhabit Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agree that California is getting to be an affordable for a lot of people ah Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls this Cox have a chance well it's tough\nThe math is tough for him the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party and California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate or decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent and the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just to ...\nGrass and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough place California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins a merry will be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm Governor Brown has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and new indicated he'd pick a similar approach especially on issues like immigration health care environmental issues I knew some support sanctuary cities for example he backs California becoming a zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are a couple of areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has and one of those areas is early childhood and during the recession state funding for programs like infant and toddler care and pre school was severely cut\nAnd those funds have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown use them as indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that if she reflected in TV ads that he's running as well\nWas as you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump to the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump's slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nSo I think the government's doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know they have property California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great properties of what is the taxes are way way out of whack\nPeople are starting to move pretty soon but if you don't have safety meeting if you don't have this kind of wall the drugs are pouring through in California that do it\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters are prepared to go to the polls next month well\nDonald Trump did and he's still way underwater or last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters so uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nUh their problem in these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he was not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates in persuading them to vote for for the Republican congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nAffordability homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in that congressional races and you know there are just issues of affordability that I think a lot of these new party preference voters\nAt which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nUh let's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat because in California the top two vote getters face each other in the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh\nHearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some that said this is a serious undertaking with serious allegations Scott ... ah maybe\n[laughter] certainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single\nFor the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media aren't paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nUh and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo uh and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether and a vet I'm not sure it's going to help Feinstein because those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist than her opponent\nOr so it's possible certainly a it's a it's not entirely clear how this cabinet things playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was re spending Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but you know I haven't seen Broadwell\nBut one thing that one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of the people on both sides of the aisle during those Kavanaugh hearings were pretty old she's eighty five years old\nHe's fifty one uh he's talked about that he's careful about it but he used to listen to him talking to us about the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to a to California to the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nYou know I think it is first time especially for younger voters here in California and daily and arguments are certainly resonates most with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know if we find a ... twenty sixteen\nBernie Sanders' presidential campaign had a very active group of supporters in California many of them are young people getting engaged in\nNot mentioned at the polling indicates you know strong favorability for Feinstein ... watching as the head she seems to have a pretty substantial question right now but we're still you know little little over a little less than a month away\nRight and Scott there's one thing we haven't talked about that has come up in our conversations here in Southern California which is that there is a measure on the ballot to repeal a gas tax that may actually play a role in getting people out to the polls well that's what Republicans\nWere hoping Jeremy they put prop six on the ballot in fact John Cox the Republican candidate for governor really funded that drive to collect the signatures put it on the ballot polling shows it's not as popular as you might expect a because you know everyone pays the gas tax if you drive\nA no one's particularly happy about having to pay it it's about uh twelve cents per gallon tax but it generates five billion dollars a year for transportation roads bridges highways and so the no on sex campaigns done I think a pretty good job of saying they're trying to take away money to keep our highways and our infrastructure in good shape\nFunding for here and now comes from network graders ... simulates software accelerating the pace of engineering and science you learn more and now we're done come\nFrom NPR and W. B. or Boston I'm Jeremy ... and I'm In a row down here in\nComing up hurricane Michael pound Florida's panhandle will have the latest\nAlso I'm In Southern California where a long time Republican Congressman Darrell I said is it running again we'll meet the Republican trying to replace him\nI'm running quite honestly than some of the function we have the you know all the resist in movies coming out of California really hurt us and the Democrats and\nPresident Trump's approval rating in our district is right around forty percent of people are ready for new leadership these stories will speak with a homeless family in California\nAnd the world famous hot air balloon fiesta is dazzling spectators in Albuquerque we'll speak with a hall of fame pilots and his daughter I mean you're in\nThe news is first\nWhy they're raised to five gee is a bad on a multi trillion dollar industry from American public media this as marketplace\nHe'd the number of devices that can be connected could spawn entirely new businesses that we haven't even thought of yet\nLast year chipmaker Qualcomm and tech research firm I H s technology put out a report that said five gee could enable twelve ... trillion dollars in economic output across the world like twenty thirty five not to mention some twenty two million jobs the report quite sincerely compared five ... to electricity\nNow compare that to forge e which just in the United states contributed about half a trillion dollars to the economy in twenty sixteen and even a with a bat potential is why there is a race to get to five gee first between companies and even countries\nScott tongue is a marketplace reporter and former China correspondent he said the U.S was a four gee winter and China doesn't want that to happen again\nThe companies the innovation that was built on this technology right\nWhether it is social networking or gaming or video a lot of those companies that built their products on top of this infrastructure where American companies so the U.S was kind of a hub\nFor this you know giant economic boost for the country\nAnd that is why so many countries I mean you have the European Union Japan South Korea all investing billions in this tens of billions and then of course there's China which has invested more than any of these competitors as far as the infrastructure so\nThe assumption is if you're first kind of build this ten lane superhighway in the sky that you know if you build it they are going to come right that these companies and these innovators are going to come to your country\nYeah what are people saying about the challenges of rolling out this infrastructure\nOne of the great big challenges that comes over and over with five gee is how expensive it is to build the network on one reason is because of the nature of the frequency where these signals are going to be transmitted is the cells are going\nAnd they don't have to be this big giant cell phone towers the nature of the technology is you know could be a small little pizza box sized thing on top of a light pole but all those have to be installed you have to negotiate with the city or the owner of a house to be able to put it there so one of the price tax at one of the consulting firm said was you know\nOn the order of three hundred billion dollars in the U.S to build this out\nSo what is the timeline for the rollout compared to some of those other places\n[noise] so the first five phones there's talk that they'll be coming out in the next year\nIn two or three years there's talk that some of the networks will be commercial ready to move into this Internet of things these machines that talked to one another will be on the market\nYou know what's a broader timeline well you know a lot of folks in the industry talk about a five year rollout and even more broadly that each of the past generations of wireless technology three G. for each of those generations has been about a decade so maybe that kind of order of magnitude\nGot hung up the marketplace reporter and our former China correspondent tomorrow and the show we'll talk about the tension between companies who wants to roll out five gee infrastructure and the cities who want some say in that process\nAnd all the way the market place\nThis is eight PM\nAnd this is your NPR station Ninety three WCBS and Idea Stream go along with us for part of your Wednesday afternoon it's five minutes past one o'clock I'm ... years with another look at traffic\nWe still that disabled vehicle on forty west bone after the transportation boulevard

[noise]\n\n\n\n\nFrom NPR and WB you are I'm Jeremy hops in I'm Peter O'Dowd to sit here and now and we are tracking hurricane Michael now a massive category for storm that will slam this afternoon into Florida's Gulf Coast\nMichael will be the strongest recorded storm ever to make landfall on the Florida Panhandle and in the historic town of saint marks the mandatory evacuation order is in effect but resident Bernard Sessions is staying\nWell when they said it was a category four I never been in war\nBut ah I don't ever allowed back hurts aren't coming straight as a category for and I said I Want to leave go ahead I'm going to say if you go now you're going to say I'm going to say\nAll right NPR's Greg Allen joins us now from Tallahassee Hi Greg Hi Peter and I know you're just back from St Mark's right there on the coast uh where we heard Bernard sessions what are conditions like that\nWell you know ... when we were there is a of a hour or two ago and it was already seeing flooding uh this is before the storm had had actually you know come close to shore ah was pushing water ahead of it you know nearly everyone had left town but uh as Bernard sessions said he was a there was this friend Katrina Hurley\nHe has a shop in a garage there at the marina he's not saying that\nHis shop in rain floods even in heavy rains ... expecting the worst but he's going to stick it out with his food supplies in his generator\nNow when you talk to him and other people in that area do you think do they get the sense really how intense this storm is going to be\n[noise] oh I think so I mean you know people make their own judgments about this about whether they're going to evacuate or not but I don't think too many people at this point can\nCan claim ignorance about what a category for storm means uh you know if you're not right at the coast that they were they really worry about here's a storm surge which has got to be nine to fourteen feet in some places and I think people who live close up to the shore\nThat that is going to be a concern are mostly gone you know I think you'd be rare person that was say in that situation\nI'm ... ... what's going to happen you're going to see this extensive flooding and coastal areas all along the panhandle\nI'm also you've got these high winds are concentrated around in her high wall that's going to be like almost like a tornado coming through about four or five mile square region so that's that's what people are worried about here if you're not in that manner I wall area you know on that one and there's no way to know unless\nIt comes to shore where you are so people that's where people are taking the risk if they stay in an area that has a mandatory evacuation you don't know where it's really going to come ashore and how strong the winds are going to be you know and and they're talking about tropical storm force winds a hundred and Seventy five miles from the center that will be a threat not just that area but for the solar we're we're likely see you know widespread power outage\nAnd I was just gonna ask you about that they're likely to be a lot of power outages have those started yet\nYes we're getting reports I think it's a ... up to thirty thousand state wide a lot of them are concentrated along the path panhandle coastal area where the storm is just preparing to come ashore you know it's just just miles offshore now in the area around Mexico beach up by Panama City Florida\nAnd so that's where the power outages are are clustered now but you know that they're going to grow as a as a storm moves inland and knocked down trees and power lines where we\nA kind of a surprising it's been raining pretty steadily we've had vans coming through all morning\nExact science is offering Colo

California really hurt us ah you know there's a tax reform bill where we weren't we we did well in the long run on the business community\nBut we we could have gotten a better deal had we had some people at the table I Do think fast or you know we have a lot of issues with regard to uh immigration that we need to get results\nAnd it couldn't be resolved if people were willing to work together and there's also the job creation that the opportunity in this district is amazing with the military contracting and the ... by on that\nThat is the engine of broke here uh biggest problem right now is to work for us we have three point five percent unemployment and we can't good qualified health and it's hard it's hard to get people to come to California because the high cost of living in taxation [noise] do you think that Daryl I so it was part of that dysfunction in Washington\nI'm Darryl than I have totally different approaches\nAlready party and that was the first Republican chair of the board and Fifteen Years which was unusual\nClosely aligned argue with President Trump because you do have is indoors [noise]\nWell there's a lot to live like on the ... and the economic front\nI like a lot on the economic front I'm not a\nFan of the approach\nHe's kinda got the good cop bad cop in reverse generally the elected person is a softer touch a but he's kind of frontal and I think it makes it a difficult to people understand\nI think in this district because we're not used to that kind of approach but I think the result she's gotten on the budgets a tax reform\nHas really help this district to help the states\nWhere do you disagree with Trump [noise]\nWell I would've liked to have seen a\nPolitical I kept seeing a little bit more a provision for California in our tax reform on the salt treatment but that really wasn't him that was the Congress\nI think that um [noise]\nI I think more in the mannerisms and also I'm I'm not for offshore drilling\nI think California has a beautiful coastline we don't want that to help here we have we have to do something about the health care health care right now in California is\nOkay but Medicaid funding that we've accepted a lot of is driving providers out in the market because it's a the state is holding back on the on the reimbursement rates very very difficult so some people are the AC a actually worked pretty well in California because we've got a huge population\nBut there and again we were seeing providers drop out\nOf the market so there's a lot of things to be worked on health care\nWhat about what we just saw with Brett Kavanaugh\nHow do you feel about how the Senate handled his confirmation\nI thought it was hard core politics I didn't like it should have all been vetted\nIt's created a lot of chaos and destruction one of the things that some voters know about you here in orange county and your husband was caught up in a pond [noise] what do you want people to know about that\nAnd and do you think that they should be judging you on that at all [noise] number one that's a lie there with no Ponzi schemes so I Want to set the record clear there were allegations in the litigation from two thousand nine that declared\nEverything it was simple it was never a criminal litigation that was the civil litigation where you can throw anything against the wall and tried to make a day and it went through a jury trial\nSo I really do believe that it's been misrepresented than politicians when they have no record to run on frequently like to dig up old old filing this was a huge litigation but I was cleared in two thousand Thirteen or do you think that that's hurting you know in this race\nOh well if you can't defend yourself it does but I got the ... actually you know are are asking about it now and I'm explaining it it's on my website I tell the story I tell what happened it was two thousand they anybody involved in real estate understands the problems in two thousand eight the bank folded\nA properties we're seeing it was it was miserable and Mr Leavenworth for country wide and he says there's an excuse for for closing on people but he was always a brand new brand new attorney and the group and and they get to a brand new guys these kinds of dirty job to do\nWhat do you think the biggest issue is for voters in his district which\nI think the dysfunction in DC [noise] you know the news is the thought of impeachment hearings and all of this chaos going on they don't if you don't want politics they want some results [noise]\nDiane Harkey Republican running for Congress here thank you so much thank you [noise]\n... opponent is the guy she was just talking about a lawyer and ...\n[noise] well ah for the last two decades I've been involved in a variety of political campaigns are never felt compelled to run a before myself\nA after having been very involved in twenty sixteen election or to help Secretary Clinton or in after seeing that result my wife and I both decided what good is our background or experience or education or relationships the values that we have the values that we want to share with our own children\nOr if we don't stand up and try to do something for our country right now\nHow much of an uphill climb as it for you as a Democrat running in orange county and part of San Diego county [noise]\nWell the good news is that in the primary on June fifth fifty one and a half percent of the vote went to the Democratic candidates so the momentum is on our side a President Trump's approval rating in our district is right around forty percent uh people are ready for new leadership do you want to see President Trump impeached\nI'm not running on an impeachment platform I Do want to get to the truth I Want to see justice and ultimately I Want to see a a a an investigation by Mr Mahler or that or is not politicized or what we have seen with Devin Nunes has as chair of the house intelligence committee is the withholding\nOf relevant testimony and information in you know the other side\nYou know they're they're making us to be out and be be some are angry mob or they're saying you know don't give matches due to an arsonist couldn't be further from the truth we care about our country we care about the rule of law there cannot be one set of rules for the president added states and one set of rules for everyone else that's not how\nOur founders or you know created this a democratic\nRepublic that we live in our constitution still matters\nYou bring up the line about the angry mob how much do you think that what just happened with Brett Kavanaugh has changed the dynamics of your race has it energized Republicans\nYou know yesterday day before we had an extraordinary number of volunteers more than we'd ever seen\nA and I don't know how much of that was related to a now justice cabinet or not but what I can tell you is that uh we're doing everything we can to take nothing for granted over the last month of this campaign we are going to just do an incredible amount of work and I won't predict anything other than that we will out work the other side\nWe asked your opponent Diane Harkey about ah something that's been dogging her campaign which is that her husband had to pay a penalty for being involved in a Ponzi scheme she said that's a lie what do you think\nUm I think the victims ah deserve to be heard and the facts are very simple\nAh her husband a endpoint center of financial was found by both the uh jury as well as a a judge in than an appellate court to be a Ponzi scheme to be financial fraud\nAnd dozens of seniors were defrauded out of millions and millions of dollars and her husband her ex husband or they have not paid a nearly enough to those victims\nShe also ah in her answer to our question about that tried to connect you to country wide I which was responsible for a lot of foreclosures I've seen that on your website you say I was just a junior lawyer working for bank of America which you own country wide and I'd have to to do with that\nNot at all she's tried to create false equivalence between uh you know the serious misconduct of her husband were talking about major financial fraud\nOr in my work I as an attorney I'm proud of my work as an attorney I've tried to do the right thing I've tried to stand up for people in the record is on my side in my case uh there was a very unscrupulous attorney a guy named Mitchel Roth\n\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

D. bridge dot org\nThis year and now a broadcasting from Southern California today as we continue our election road trip with less than a month to go before the midterms\nAsian Americans are the fastest growing ethnic group in this state they now make up more than fourteen percent of the population a slice of the pie that has tripled in size since Nineteen eighty and in orange county were there for congressional races that the cook Political Report labels competitive\nIt's about eight hundred thousand of right now we are over twenty percent of the county and third largest Asian American population in the nation\nMarion food executive director of the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander community alliance says the Asian Americans living here are people with roots in the Philippines China Korea Vietnam Japan and more that's been the case for decades the difference now is a greater number of those people were born in the United states\nI see it's probably about thirty to thirty five percent right now I'm Seventy percent of the community and foreign born ... cording to the sense that that you see more and more diversity here in orange county and you'll see more of a rising second generation\nThat's important because the politics of the generations can be completely different Alex Kim is principal in CEO of three kings public affairs he's Korean American and a registered Republican who worked as a political consultant for Democrat James Hall the former mayor of Los Angeles and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger the former governor of California\nThe first generation tends to vote Republican and my second generation friends are more on the Democratic side why is that maybe it's because of a little bit of rebellion\nA but at the same time it's similar to how Cuban Americans of Vietnamese\nFinancial distress the first generation tend to say why be both Republicans\nBecause they see the the corruption the government the distrust of government and why the second generation going more democratic I think because of the American values the\nA lot of this Korean Americans that grew up in ... uh tend to grow up in urban areas and I think that's part of the process or in urban areas than to focus more progressive thinking than more than a conservative suburban ideals\nKim says one of the first issues on the minds of Asian American voters is immigration he and others are concerned about President Trump's policies family separation and chain migration\nAnd the thought of eliminating about because a lot of my relatives\nCame here to chain migration so the question the workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from about chain migration system so\nIt seems like Korean Americans the first generation still are more majority loyal to Trump no matter what they believe they came here legally of a majority of them and they believe that what he's doing is fair for the country will definitely be the my friends I mean more democratic or\nLiberal Republicans are progressive Republicans I myself have have definitely some qualms about that key issue\nMany of the first generation Asian immigrants here are small business owners running nail salons dry cleaners restaurants Kim says the Koreans often use Korean community banks because back in the day it was difficult for them to get loans from American banks\nThen there are Vietnamese American business owners like tan and sunny new when we met them at a cafe sunny owns it an Orange County neighborhood called little Saigon sunny told us the politics here\nAre shifting [noise] definitely changing I I think you know you look at the generation one which is our parents um and then I mean we're\nBut we were raised\nIn America so we understand what it means to be an American but we also understand our parents where they came from so we can relate to both sides and because we can relate to both sides we can see the differences in a stark difference what do you mean by that [noise]\nI'm not just from a political standpoint but how we do business so speaking just for our business and how we do things our parents always said hey you know what they came from a a country where you can't really trust the government\nSo stay away from it so we came over here you see a lot of our visit family cash only pay you know what you you don't want to say what we have our own strategies that we don't want to share best practice because that becomes very competitive as well and that's why first generations they're known\n'em to be very fragmented right and um you don't want to collaborate but we grew up in America and you know I worked in corporate America and there's there's a lot of collaboration and that's how we actually through and\nYou know and being an American or you know and having include city I think that's one of the reasons why we have grown that because we do collaborate and we're showing\n'em are Christian parents said look we've worked closely with the city we're sharing best practices we actually sharing best practices that entrepreneur\nAnd they're getting better but because we're doing now we're able to work together and that's one of the big sort of different since from generation one generation to\nOutside the cafe in little Saigon our political science attached to a fence at a busy intersection nearly every candidate's name is Vietnamese the only Asian American running for Congress this year in orange county is fifty five year old young Kim a Korean American Republican who worked for the lawmaker she's trying to replace ed Royce\nWhen my family came to this country we can make on me and not because we wanted handout\nThat because we want the opportunity America provided to feed on our own\nYoung ... praised by the ... registered for her ...\nThere hasn't been a Korean American in Congress since Nineteen Ninety nine this year three are running in November says political consultant Alex can\nWe have young Kim of course local year with Pearl Kim and also I'm Andrew Kim and we're not related not related to that all you do Kim is a very popular name a Korean\nAmericans and a quarter of us are Korean Kim's including myself\nAlex Kim says some Asian American voters will support a candidate like them regardless of party even though he's a Republican he's working with a Korean American Democrat running for office in Georgia\nAs a Republican than helping a Democrat because it's more not just about parties about also this connection this this uh ethnic connection and having not a single Korean American including us right now I'd rather it doesn't matter if the Democrat Republican I Would like to see a Korean\nAmerican on there to reverse of meat up there\nWe heard something similar from Vietnamese American Tam knew when\nYou don't see myself especially as a business owner the community as a Vietnamese American first before\nBeing part of the party as a Republican or Democrat\nThat sentiment is very and food is in part a reaction to the way many Asian Americans have been treated in this country as outsiders she says they still face discrimination at the workplace in education and housing\nAsian American no matter how long they've been here they get the question of you know where you really from or where are you from I'm fourth generation my family's been here since Nineteen sixty one and I still get it or things like your English is so good and\nAnd you know where you really really from what languages you speak and I have to really explain only speak English or Spanish I'm and I'm you know my family's been here for so long that\nIt it's those types of questions we only get it and so it ...\nThe upcoming election I think it's really important to show as Asian Americans how crucial we are to civic engagement and how important it is for us to vote and have a voice but also how important it is to educate a the general public about the issues that we find are\nConcern or that we feel are important and so to really talk about our values\nAll of that is to say the politicians from both parties have a lot to gain\nFrom these Asian American communities in orange county or politicians paying attention to Asian American voters you think\nI think they have to and so I think those who haven't in the past are now and I think many of the ones who are more savvy or have known how important the Asian American vote is and how and why we\nWe tend to vote as a block and so I think they see the impact that can be made by really learning about the issues of concern\nNow in the news generally there have been a number of Asian countries that have been right at the center of what's going on you got the situation in North Korea you've got the trade war now with China how does that play\nI think people because of the other of their country of origin and seeing the issues that are affecting here are being discussed", "show_name": "Here and
