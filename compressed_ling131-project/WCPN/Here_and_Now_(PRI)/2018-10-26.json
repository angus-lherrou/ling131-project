I'm Peter O'Dowd is here and now one person has\nBeen arrested today in South Florida in connection with suspicious packages sent this week to prominent Democrats CNN and people critical of President Trump we will be watching as that story develops throughout the day\nThis morning to more packages were intercepted one addressed to New Jersey senator Cory Booker\nThe other to James Clapper the former director of national intelligence and it brings the number of potential mail bombs to twelve and now just eleven days from the mid term elections many Americans are talking about the need to lower the temperature in national politics\nJoining us now there's a minute come on to narrow NPR's lead politics editor hide him and go hey they're so obviously we're going to be keeping close track of this story and learning more about who the suspect is who has been arrested what we know for sure though is just how devices these crimes have become in American politics and I wonder if you can tell us why\nWell I you know I mean polarization has been at an all time high for quite some time uh you know you look back at a couple of different arrows and American history maybe the Nineteen sixties and the civil war I come a closest or worse than than today but there's not much in between\nUh and you know President Trump let's be Frank has been somebody who has created the sense that the press is the enemy of the people he continues to say fake news at his rallies and a point the finger at the pen that we're all kept in at the rallies\nA lovely people to chat with and talked to by the end in through the middle of as a crescendo of just anti a media stuff so that is what comes to be seen and President Trump has been somebody who's been a take no prisoners you know I'm kind of politician for anybody who disagrees with him\nBut Dominican president started this week by calling for unity and then he's come to this place of that you're describing now and I want to hear from a White House press secretary Sarah Sanders who was speaking on Thursday\nOr if the price of that I could not have been more presidential yesterday when he spoke directly to the American people\nCondemn this violence let's not get lost in who is responsible for this heinous act it is the person who made and sent the suspicious packages let's not forget that that is ultimately the person that is responsible and will be held responsible by this administration know clearly\nThe president thinks he's being unfairly linked to the person who did this but why hasn't he been able to stick to that message of unity that he started this with\nI mean it's pretty typical pattern of President Trump's I mean this is somebody who anytime he has criticized or becomes the sort of a focus of criticism\nThen he doubles down he trickles down he digs that uh you know that trench and is going to fight for every inch\nAnd you know to some respects but Sarah Sanders says is true or the people the person who committed this act um is going to be held responsible or its adjusts department that the president overseas and that person is largely responsible for what they did obviously\nAt the same time you can't ignore the climate that's been created in this country where people view each other in ways that are in human and that is that a recipe for disaster especially for people who

careers in the majors many of those kids leaving the country that since the most foreign born players to major league baseball the Dominican Republic baseball greats from one Marshalls to big Papi David Ortiz to Pedro Martinez\nTwenty years ago when Pedro Martinez was pitching for the red Sox he founded a charity to help young people in the Dominican Republic one of those it helped go to college in Boston was an athlete named Carol Lena\nEventually she met Martinez and they got married now ... runs the Pedro Martinez foundation the charity provides health care and nutrition for kids and the DR and it is building a charter school that'll teach young ballplayers job skills in case they never make it to the majors\nShe says only three percent of kids recruited by the majors ever play on a team and that's a blow on many fronts\nA lot of our baseball players a lot of young prospects do not finish high school and then when they're released from any team and they want to go back into life they don't know what to\nDo so they can be signed by a team I mean the lucky ones will be signed you're saying they never actually may make it to the team exactly and they're probably incredibly talented too\nOf course it happened to my brothers they were top prospects one was for the New York Mets and the other one for the Seattle Mariners\nAnd we should say you come from a baseball family either you're both your parents were players your mom and your dad and they started a little league and the ... that has gone on for thirty seven years now still operating correct okay so your brothers had high hopes\nYes they receive really good signing bonuses both of them did but they were among those Ninety seven percent that didn't make it one he was really prone to injuries and the other one he play in the majors but did not continue there was a cut and no other factors so\nTime to see them not being able to to find themselves in terms of life and okay so I was released and I'm I'm I'm twenty seven now I'm twenty six I'm not going to go sit\nIn a classroom with high school kids I'm I'm always exposed to this type of situations because of what my parents do and because of who ... and\nIt just became more clear to both of us that we needed to help players that have been released\nAnd they don't know how to go back to society to their lives\nWhat could you do for somebody who's older like that like the age of your brothers or are you just trying to do a stopgap measure by helping our young people who may hope to go on to major league baseball but probably don't have that much of a chance [noise] so what\nWe're developing as curriculum that would have them be calm technicians in any than it has to do with sports and the marketplace that means nutritionist professional trainers moustache therapist\nPositions that are related to the sports industry and they can go back and get a job either with another team an ... or maybe an amateur level but it's a way that they can go back into the sports world and make a living for them without being baseball\nPlayers but is it realistic given the amount of jobs that are on offer there that that would be the answer for for so many of the kids it could\nBe realistic and as American all thirty teams of M. O. B. have academies where they signed the players so there's a high demand all the time for work\nThe world series is going on right now and one would think for young people in the DR that there are so many sing that's going to be me one day [laughter] do you and Pedro\nSo but probably not so have a plan B\nWe do it in a way that it doesn't kill the dream\nBut grounds them what do you do when you say just exactly what you said that baseball is not everything\nThat there are other options in life but then they see Pedro yes but then they see Ninety seven percent of others that did not make it and it's becoming more of a cautious conversation topic in the Dominican Republic about the difficulty\nOf becoming a baseball player and how it's not only enough for you to have your raw talent\nThere's so many other factors that go beyond your control even the fact if you find a coach and triple layer java lay that doesn't like you if he doesn't like you he's not going to give you play time period\nYou started out wanting to be a sports broadcaster you married to a sports star you are now in charge of this foundation that is clearly changing lives in the Dominican Republic something I imagine you couldn't have anticipated for you\nMaybe you can synthesize the reward you get out of doing this [noise]\nSo I see it as a domino effect I was helped at some point my institution now I have a commitment to the kids and my country to do the same so I'm One but I represent five hundred kids or maybe a thousand or maybe two thousand\nAnd that other kid that I'm going to be helping or that two or three or four ... percent five hundred or one thousand or two thousand\nThat's what it means to me I can help and other ... I can help another page or they can become professionals either through sports or arts and they can eventually also do the same that we are joined\nThank you currently no Martinez thanks thank you Carol ... runs the Pedro Martinez foundation if you're looking for a good film to see this weekend and you want to try something completely\nOnce you leave your house\nIt's a black and white film made by the federal government in Nineteen fifty four the atomic age and the conscience Americans to keep a clean and tidy house because it will be better able to survive and atomic bomb\nThe film is just one of three hundred that the library of Congress's making available online that collection is called the national screening room and it includes digitized historical films commercials newsreels all sorts of moving images that cover more than a century of cinema dating back to Eighteen Ninety\nThe curator for this collection is Michael ... who leads the library is moving image section Hi Mike\nHi very nice to join you to tell us about that film a first a house in the middle [noise]\nThis one is particularly interesting because it's actually the second version of the film not a lot of people know that the sequel the first version of the film which was going to be on the screening room very soon our promises a pretty straightforward civil defense film\nWhich talks about the you know what would happen to a dwelling in a nuclear blast what could you do to help protect your house\nBut the second one the one that you're talking about is a lot more prescriptive and it argues with some fervor that your house in a better chance of surviving a nuclear Holocaust if he painted\nAnd the version of the film that we have on the screening room now sponsored by the national cleanup pain up fix up bureau which turns out to be of folks here a name for the national ... association yeah I don't know\nMaybe maybe there's a connection there some of the the really interesting ones as well or home movies the of Judy Garland taking lies I'm In LA to a birthday party um you have a garden party with Iran and George Gershwin and and ah who happens to be there as well but ah Fred Astaire and this is all candid\nThe and have come from newsreels\nAll Americans are equal in the United states coast guard and its training school to Battle Creek Michigan [noise]\nTraining and the coast guard isn't all the armed services begins with a manual on and so it is with these young men who some day but men are rescue boats and watch our shores for enemies spies to attempt secret landings on American soil\nTell us about a one of the newsreels especially intended for African American audiences in the U.S\n[noise] you know this is an all American news of his produced in Chicago and we have about thirty three issues are on the screening room and they all come from the world war two era uh and so it was the consequences are quite celebrate tore the African American contributions to the war effort\nI'm Mike what's your favorite of the entire collection\nThey're actually a couple of films made by a woman named Louis Vince sins and the first as a was shot on July Fourth Nineteen sixty eight at the reminder day picket in Philadelphia and prompt independence hall which was a gathering of gays and lesbians who were just seeking fundamentally quality\nAnd then two years later she makes a film of the Christopher Street liberation day parade in Nineteen Seventy that film was called gay and proud and it's also and the national screening room and of course what happened between those two events were the stonewall riots in June Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.
