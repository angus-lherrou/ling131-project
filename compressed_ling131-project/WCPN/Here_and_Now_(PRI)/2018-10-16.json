showed gee\nThere are reports that Saudi Arabia is getting ready to acknowledge that showed deep died during a botched interrogation at the Saturday consulate in Istanbul, Turkey for the latest let's bring in how he does she get MSNBC anchor an economics correspondent and co host of ... like hey Jeremy and what more do we know about this new Saturday explanation for what happened\nWell we we know it hasn't fully hasn't come out yet are there are a lot of reports that it's being crafted what's interesting about this is that it echoes something that a President Trump said yesterday morning after he'd spoken with king ... bought the father of Mohammed bin Salman his son effectively runs Saudi Arabia\nAnd the you know yesterday the president talked about a a broke group of people may be having a kill ...\nAh and then that's what the Saudis are floating at the issue here is that the Saudis are looking to accept responsibility in some fashion for this so that the story can move on at the moment they they're facing the threat of sanctioned and a lot of businesses that are very upset about this whole thing so they're trying to\nUh work their way out of it but no explanation officially and\nWhen you said the explanation was being crafted ... does that imply that my ...\nThere are so if one could be a fly on the wall one might assume that uh my palm pay was explained to the Saudis that this is a difficult position for the United states to be in because it is such a\nA supporter of Saudi Arabia and because of the global Magnitsky Act which a number of senators have triggered\nA that say that when the United states has dealings with a country that engages in human rights abuses the president has to take action within a hundred and twenty days so Mike Pompeo maybe spelling out the fact that the president may not be able to skirt the sort of Saudis need to do something\nSo that the next step can take place what\nHas all this done to the U.S relationship with both Saudi Arabia end with turkey where are the the alleged murder happened\nSo this is interesting because turkey and Saudi Arabia or not allies they are they they sort of compete for being the economic and power center of the Muslim world arguably Saudi Arabia has succeeded\nA because Saudi Arabia has such largest but Turkey's a more industrialized country it's more western facing it's a NATO member

two presidents Pete Souza joins us now to talk about a welcome back to hear now\nThanks for having me on Germany and when you left the White House or did you have any idea that you would become more part of the public conversation\nNot at all it's\nIt's just something that as the days and weeks and months went by and twenty Seventeen it became apparent that I had a voice where uh I and I needed to use it in a way just to demonstrate\nWhat is happening is not normal and I thought I was able to do that on Instagram using my photographs and commentary\nAnd how did it start\nIt started somewhat accidental I had seen a picture of the new Oval Office like on January twenty first there twenty second and it was ... you know golden ornate and I thought it looked like a Saudi palace more than\nThe oval office so I posted a picture of a President Obama with the the red curtains behind him and I are wrote a caption that just said something like kind of like the old curtains better [laughter]\nAnd I guess it was a double meaning in my mind but I didn't know how people would react whether they would get it and in that very first post\nSomeone or said that I was throwing shade on the new\nA new president you didn't even know what that tournament I didn't even know what that term men after you know I started oppose the war and then I heard that the term shade and yeah and and I and I figured I better look it up\nYou also posted when when President Trump made a lot of news talking about how his inauguration\nJanuary twenty first twenty Seventeen the biggest crowd in history was really on January twenty two thousand nine huge in all caps with a picture of the national mall with a lot of people\nI mean a kind of picture says it all\nRight right in that case maybe more than any other that that that the picture was what prove what was true yes I Do you get any negative feedback on your Instagram feed\nA a little bit very very few though I mean if you go through the commentary there's ... very rarely is there a negative feedback and and what's interesting to me is\nIf I'm if there is uh my uh it's kind of followers are have my back and they they end up coming back to the sea and they often point out to me\nUh people that that they feel or just bought maybe I don't know with a Russian bot but people trying to stir up trouble not really interested in ... just in saying what they want to say\nIn this book I you've got I'm often either Trump tweets alongside your Instagram post or a new story alongside your Instagram post is one\nI'm looking at right here a President Trump said on may six twenty Seventeen the reason I'm staying in Bedminster New Jersey a beautiful community is that staying in New York City is much more expensive and disruptive meetings exclamation point you wrote\nStuck in meetings at sunny lands in rancho mirage California twenty sixteen and it's a picture of President Obama golfing\nRight I mean let's just let's I well I don't understand why the the ... the United states can't be honest I mean just say you're staying in bed Bedminster because you want to play golf\n... and ... just lie about golf I mean it makes no sense to me so that was sort of just a you know somebody in cheek folk Polk\n[laughter] I after I corrected myself up sometimes when I when I come up with just the right picture in the right time and I guess you know a\nTrump is always saying you know it's a witch hunt and it's a witch hunt I don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points and all caps\nA in regards to the FBI and investigation um [laughter] and I and I found a a picture of a a a a young girl dressed as a which had a at a Halloween party\nAnd I just I think I wrote I'm a you know another kind of which I I have to admit that I correct myself up [laughter]\nThere's another one uh where you've got a picture of President Obama giving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that the more people that have been aggression and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history\nFox News ... every other networking you Instagram forty eight million people watched the twenty times said union address on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had to kind of look it up [laughter] uh and and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama as it was a two thousand ten state of the union was the largest and in history\nSeems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into a lot of high profile fights with world leaders and when that happens you show a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them\nA yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to [laughter] ... you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked that I correct myself up over was when he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong ... and ... and calling them\nAnd I posted a picture of President Obama with a gun right and I said there's only one\nRocket man [laughter] what does President Obama think of what you're doing\nUm you know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this in a coup boots with him or that he was going to have any input I just saw him a week or so ago and now the the book is actually printed\nUm I told them that I was doing this book and you just you know he he didn't say that much about it\n[laughter] or at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nOr no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to\nThe U.S ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post amongst around\nNo these are all a pictures that were previously made public offering the administration so they are considered public domain so anybody can use and there was another guy that has a\nHas a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine and but he's allowed to do that so\nSo what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama already or do you want to do something else [noise]\nNo I Want to do something else that's sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a search for what kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do new photography and I want to move away from 'em at least us politics for sure\nHow come [noise]\nI don't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with President Obama where I had a dynamic or a person to\nAccess and I think I Would just be frustrated I'm trying to photograph politics\nWhen I Know that I couldn't get that kind of access to someone else at least I don't think I could and and and I've never you know I I sort of ended up as a political photographer it was never something that I had aspired to do it just things just sort of happened\nUh because I took a right turn and instead of a left turn 'em and so I Want to sort of explore some other aspects of photography that I that I just don't get to do that much now\nTeaches at one more question for you um you know everybody now takes pictures with their phone\nYou can tell when you look at a Pete Souza photograph that it's really great photograph compared to what most of us are able to do although some people are great amateur photographers what is your one piece of advice that you give to people about how to take a better picture\nOh boy I'm\nOne piece of advice I can I give to yeah sure [laughter]\nUm you know for uh the the lighting lighting is so important to people forget about that so if you're going to do pictures when you're traveling around the country or the world usually they're already early morning or late in the day the last two hours of flight is the best time\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

F. eight degrees they have to show their work\nAnd they're always looking to sell their work and often when an artist is that new they're willing to part with their work at it tends to be affordable\nPeople may think that perhaps in that case they're picking up a piece that may as that artist grows into his or her career be worth a lot of money somewhere down the line is that a little bit of a fantasy or how real is that [laughter]\nIt's always a possibility but I wouldn't encourage people to use that as the sort of rationale for purchasing an artist work especially when you're focusing regionally you know my tendency would be to\nFind something that you really respond to personally or even on a visceral level something that you love and something that you can envision living with in your home\nAnd there are other places that you think are particularly good for sourcing art that is affordable\nWell there are many places in northeast Ohio I mean we're very fortunate to have a really thriving\nArt scene and so there are some places like Seventy eighth street studios which is a consolidated space where you can find a lot of galleries an artist studios they have open houses on a monthly basis so you can just very casually show up\nAnd not feel intimidated and wander in and out of the studios and the and the gallery spaces and find things that you love and there's a wide range of price points of the artwork that's available in at a place like that\nIn Akron you have some at art space which is a nonprofit community art center again artist studios exhibitions that display feature regional artist on a regular basis so there's a lot of opportunity to see to see artwork that can be affordable\nIs it realistic to think that going to places like a thrift store or\nNever know it's unlikely that you're going to go to a thrift store and find a a Leonardo da Vinci painting or something like that that you're going to turn around and sell it auction for millions of dollars but you may just find something that you really love and that that's a treasure\nAnd so what about art auctions or those just for people who are super wealthy or can you find something there that's not too expensive not at all uh auction houses are\nGreat a way to see a lot of artwork and to watch prices on to see how artwork cell and their ... in our region there ... there are a number of great auction houses that sell a lot of regional artwork from the early and mid twentieth century\nAnd the prices can be very very accessible and the way to participate is also you know can be suited to you what you're comfortable with so you can go and see the artwork in person which I always always encourage\nBut then you could bid on line and you don't even have to be present in the room for that sort of thing so I think auction houses are a great way to acquire artwork particularly when you focus on some of the regional auction houses\nYou mentioned bidding on line can you shop on line for art\nYou absolutely can shop on line for art work uh but I really encourage people to go and see art in person for one to know exactly what you're getting and also to know if it's something that makes you feel good that you would like to have that you like to live with\nDo you remember the first piece of art that you purchased [laughter]\nI Do and I was working at an art fair and it was the first time that I really felt like I had the ability to make an art purchase I I haven't been working in the art world for my entire adult life started out\nCould actually part with a hundred bucks to to buy an artwork and it was a very small painting but something that I still own and treasure and there have been artworks that I've purchased almost entirely a regionally\nIn northeast Ohio that represent to me as sort of moment in my life that I'm very glad that I I sort of\nMade the little splurge to to purchase and have a sort of part of my own personal history\nYeah certainly if you think about years down the line looking at a collection could tell a story of your own life\nAbsolutely and the places you've been absolutely yes now the Akron art museum has partnered with the Akron summit county library and you have an art lending program what kind of art is available to check out so to speak from the library for free yeah so\nThere's a wide variety of ah paintings prince photographs mixed media works fortunately it's all framed and protected so it's it would be it's it's easy to care for\nAnd install in your home and the artwork is by artists from all over but there's a large concentration of regional artists\nAnd one of the wonderful things about that is that if you're living with something if you borrowed something from the art a library program and you really love it\nOr we provide contact information for all of the artist so you could actually contact the artist and arrange to maybe by an artwork from them\nCould you buy it from the library if you if it's like oh I don't want to return\nThe [laughter] uh you cannot buy from the library program you have to send it back although you can have it for up to four weeks and then four weeks but then you can renew it\nSend it back and let someone else enjoy it but but you do have that connection with the artist\nHow does that work at the artwork something that you check out of the art museum or the library or boats\nSo it's actually the artwork was source by the museum but it's actually house at the library so you a check it out at the library with your library card just like you would a book\nOther tips advice that you would offer of that we haven't covered for people who want to get into collecting art\nI Would say don't ever be afraid to ask someone a question if you don't understand how something is made or you're curious about the price it's fine if you ask about a price and its its way out of your league and you walk away it's no big deal but she won't know until you ask\nAnd so I Would just encourage people to be curious and ask questions and talk to people\nI think that's the best way to kind of engage and and feel\nFunding for here and now comes

six months journalists around the world have been working to finish the investigations Daphne started\nThanks to the nonprofit forbidden stories which continues the work of murder journalists and last week five members of the European Parliament call to the European Commission\nTo back an investigation into glitches murder citing revelations from the forbidden stories work including that the Maltese governments sale of Maltese passports to wealthy Russians for one million euros\nWas enabling those Russians to enter European Union countries and carry out money laundering and other crimes Lauren ... is founder and executive director of forbidden stories\nLow rent a you and other reporters picked up quite a few of the threads that Daphne Koller ... was pulling on tell us more\nWhere we were thanks to the worker for forty five or photos for about six months we were able to reveal\nSome um information regarding the high level of corruption inside the motives I learned and we were reading some concern and Fox about some potential links between the economy minister and some of the people who have been arrested because they were triggering to build that were you to really\nCalls for definitely don't want to get it down today or she is she has been killed at least they're suspected of doing that and they were arrested\nAnd so during the investigation with the world cup that I'm collaborative team we were able to meet some people who told us that they have seen the economy minister with\nThose two ... before the murder\nAnd to the ... the ... project was not only about to identify you might be the key those but it's up to complete the stories of Daphne\n... very critical work because her stories was about sensitive issue like corruption organized crime so that's why we decided to complete the destiny of the name of that politic what's a definite project\nAgain you hear the Maltese governments she was doing an investigation into possible corruption having to do with matters of the economy and here you have\nYou found the economic minister connecting with some of the suspects in her death that's quite something look I I just want to back up and and talk about how this started because it's in a compelling story you worked in a news agency across the hall\nFrom the Charlie Hebdo office tell us tell us about your experience there\nWell hung investigative reporter for the past Twenty years and uh I used to travel a lot into 'em do some reporting in some countries where there was no freedom of press\nBut to another think convinced me personally a personal events in my in my life convinced me to talk for begins to reason this up and actually twenty Fifteen when two ... of our K dot in your man arrive\nIn the streets where the offices of the company where I was walking full worlds in Paris\nAnd they into the building and they killed ... newsroom were sharing the same flaw that were the right to the door right next to you\nAnd I ... into the newsroom and then I\nI was uh the first to discover my friends and colleagues have shut the door just dying or just already dead and we'd all best to help the people who were survivors and so\nIt was literally changed my life because this was happening in Paris this was not happening on a conflict zone was such an Iraq was in the middle of pirates was in my personal environment\nIt was a bold clicks I knew we were doing exactly the same work as me the same job there were ... or they were killed four stories they were able to publish and so\nIt was really traumatic experience I took a lot of time to recover of calls for that\nAnd trying to forget some very difficult futures but on that day had decided\nWhat I can do as a journalist to continue the work of murder the reporters to keep stories alive and usually when a journalist who's dying for wants to raise that probably means that the story's very resistant to the public opinion it's very important to continue to keep this there was a life\nAnd he said something so compelling there he usually when journalists gets killed there on to something and so for you it's about\nFiguring out what that was it as you say sending a message out to the murderers you can kill the messenger but you won't kill the message the story look at this has been going on for a while a when Arizona reporter John ... was killed in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd a new organization sprung up it was called the investigative reporters and editors and they set out to finish his New York but there have been over sixty journalists killed this year many of their debts connected to their work we also here in the United states in Annapolis a newspaper or was attacked in so many killed\nThreats were made against the Boston Globe by California man he threatened to kill\nYeah well um [noise] we are really facing\nA lot of threats not totally insults American not only in Mexico in Europe too in a in old continents and I think that the the only response which is very efficient it's a global an collaborative response collaboration brings protection if you are working to get the\nIf the Cuba will see that there was a group of journalists ready to complete investigation and to expose the crimes event that will probably think twice the next time they would think about killing one report or\nYou were talking about the origins project that's great and very inspiring project and I do think that we have to react this way\nWe have to send this pool full signal to the enemies of the press to kill the messenger you would never kill them is age because we are\nHere to make sure people to get access to these very important story so\nYes there was a lot of work we need some support there were a lot of children is to have been killed there are a lot of many forbidden stories behind that we need to publish\nIt's quite children to do that and a journalist who is dying is just it is not just a number we took ... important stories important information that some people want to to hide some people want to two segments\nWell and there are other groups had met I mentioned investigative reporters and editors there's also the group organized crime corruption reporting project that pursuit another investigation twenty Fifteen when a of an investigative journalist with locked up in either by John as there is a Brazilian nonprofit organization\nI think it's a ... a B. R. A. J. I they continue the work of another reporter so\nThis has been going on this as you say collaborative so that it's the investigative work is spread out among many reporters that brings us to the Saudi journalist\nIn Turkey have you been already eyeing his work\nWell of course I'm this is the kind of case that we we should be interested in what this tour we use he was ... he was walking on we need to to know mobile the Saudi regime and we need to to expose that so that so\nI Hope we get more information to build the disappearance of a of this um ... I Hope that we'd be able to get some information Saudi Arabia is very difficult country to rock and\nSo he was a kind of voice very rare very unique so we we we ... we need that kind of ... and so we need to to work to get those went to look at what kind of stories he was publishing those pastures\nAnd one last night I'm Wondering he said when you came upon your colleagues largely a cartoon is a satirical cartoonist from Charlie Hebdo who's been murdered or were dying you said that you you said you could not get those images out of your hand you have\nHas the work that you're doing now has that he's that at all\nThat's a very good question I'm I'm not doing that for being able to forget those kinds of different kinds of teachers um [noise] but uh it's really helpful because I think that I wanted to do some sink as a journalist and so by doing that\nI think I I can bring on the table the mice kills as investigative reporter to defend press freedom and I do think that ... can defend journalism and that's\nProbably the most efficient way to to make sure people get access to this information so yeah for me it's very important to continue the work and to convince all the partners to be on board on the on the new project I was talking", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "16"}
