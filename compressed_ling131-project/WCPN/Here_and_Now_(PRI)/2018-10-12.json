is terrific book why we sleep\nNot sleeping has been making me stupid or fatter unhappy airport sicker were set sex as well as more likely to get cancer Alzheimer's and die in a car crash\nAnd yet many of us just can't sleep even knowing that\nAnd students topped the list as homework sports clubs bravado many get just a few hours a night will now some schools are taking action Dr Charles ... is chief of the division of sleep and circadian disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston they have a sleep matters initiative\nHe also teaches asleep class at Harvard University and because of the success of that class Harvard now has a mandatory on line sleep class for incoming freshmen and it's going to be expanded to upper class and as well\n... is with us in the studio welcome thank you very much you were just telling us at Harvard was so pleased with what happened when the freshman students took this online course before coming in why would they pleased about what what happened that they want to know extend this online course to all the students\nWere they were pleased by first of all those spots more than Ninety percent of students took the corps students were actually lining up to fill out food questionnaire about their positive responses to the screen bitter collision program\nWell what are you fighting against I mean anyone who's been in school knows that there is almost a you know leave to the last minute part of this where kids are working overnight but we understand that in some schools now including Harvard some other groups study groups meet at ten or midnight\nOr one o'clock in the morning yeah a list of course was popular courses or computer science courts that have actually Hackett bombs were the students are scarce\nThirty in the morning to be lifting weights or just after five and then they may have another class that has a evening classes so the students are being pulled in many different directions many times problem sets are do let's say eight o'clock in the morning or nine o'clock in the morning and that just is a set up for the students staying up all\nThe extended to all young people because not everyone goes to college and not everyone is staying up late in high school because they're finishing their science project they have phones and they have their social media that's keeping kids out\nAbsolutely in fact just the light the predominant wavelength that is driving that light that we're seeing on the screen is in the blue part of the spectrum which tells the brain but it's daytime it's like the blue sky\nAnd that resets their circadian rhythms and and it makes it actually more difficult for us to fall asleep\nAnd it does so it kind of an insidious manner because the internal clock since the strongest strive for waking just before what would be dusk a so during evolution a we couldn't see during the night time\nAnd the brains send a powerful waking signal so we get our act together and being a safe place when it got dark and we couldn't see anything well that worked great at that time but now we have through artificial light exposure shifted our circadian rhythms by four or five times zones westward\nJust by the light that we got exposed to between dusk outside and when we decide to switch off so much\nWell this last week we talked about some of the health issues that arise does not sleeping enough re read Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep which is now in paperback we've seen the national geographic channel sleepless in America you're featured in there I mean not sleeping really can be fatal\nWell I mean you you talked about the motor vehicle crashes a nearly\nCar crash injuries and deaths well any Matthew walkers book\nYou know he he lists the problems that can be causing including the car crashes but he also does a\nFun thing where he does a fake ad for a new miracle drug that will make you live longer enhance your memory make you more attractive because it keeps you slim protects you from cancer dementia\nIn war itself cold and flu it lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke not to mention diabetes are you interested of course it's sleep absolutely get sleep keeps you then keep sleep keeps you\nDo as your appetite I mean if you're not getting enough sleep for example when you get the flu shot you only have half the antibody response if you're sleeping let's say less than five hours a night or you have a three hundred percent increased risk over five year period of Cal suffocation of the coronary arteries which leads to heart attacks and other adverse outcomes\nAnd lay down right now and just prepare for the grim reaper but how do you can say this to students and it's part of the culture to see who can stay up the latest\nPart of the programs are we caught sleep one on one very interactive program in which\nFor example there's a dorm room and the students can click on a coffee cup in the dorm room and find out that caffeine has a six to nine hour half life and many people are not aware of that then that they may take a cup of coffee after dinner and not realize the six hours later they still have half of that caffeine on board\nSo they get information I click on his sneakers and they find out that if they take up on sleep they can improve their reaction time if they're on a sports team the shorten the turn time and swimming they can get more\nAll free throws in one of the things that students don't realize is it is not just the amount of sleep that consistency in the timing of sleep so students have irregular schedules they don't do as well academically and one of the reasons we think that underlies that is if you have an ...\nThat those who have irregular schedules even if they got the same duration of sleep and inconsistent times they were shifted to California time even though they were studying here in Boston and that meant that if they have a eight or nine AM class that would be happening at five or six AM biological time on their internal clock so it's no wonder\nThat they don't do as well and those classes because when they take the test or when they're trying to pay attention it's the middle of the night\nWow so how do you change school life so that kids can sleep money maybe an obvious thing is not have a steady group but when am\nI right so when I have a teaching a freshman summer every year at the end of the term the Fifteen students in the seminar have to make it had like talk in which they make a case for what they think could improve sleep healthy for example\nThat there should be an eleven are in trouble one student argued between the end of the last scheduled activity\nSchool sanctioned activity on the first\nA schedule activity in the morning or another student or suggested that assignments be do ten o'clock in the evening rather than at nine o'clock in the morning\nSo looking you're working we're talking to you most specifically that students but you've got to sleep matters initiative from Brigham and Women's Hospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers\nFirefighters who took his probably twenty four percent less likely to report an injury you have as many disability days I mean you can trace how life is just better from injuries to work output because of sleep and we'll post some of the sit here now doubt or\nThe thing I was excited about that is that a lot of people have given up on firefighters and said well they work twenty four forty eight hour shift there's nothing you can do to help their sleep\nAnd we met at a simple program of sleep health education and wellness for the firefighters took about an hour canoe in detail so we did see a sleep disorders screening for example for ten minutes they fill out a few of them\nTurns out that one out of three men and one out of six women have sleep apnea and that means that even if they set aside the time for sleep is you can't breathe and sleep at the same time you're not going to get the rest of that you need and when we first came to present to them they made fun of the whole thing they brought pillows to the sessions are\nAre kidding everybody say oh I got to have my sleep session and so on but then when we started showing them the information we feel that this is a it's a right for people to have this information to understand\nThat untreated sleep apnea for example after Eighteen years only fifty eight percent of them are still alive as opposed to Ninety four percent of their without sleep apnea because it increases the risk of cardiovascular death by four hundred and twenty percent\nAnd we've had amazing feedback from people say oh my God this this change my whole life my depression was resolved I didn't stay on medications anymore my marriage I came back together it can really have a major impact\nAnd all we provide people as information and a screening\nBut what if you just you know you want to see more and you just put your head down you can't\nSort of for people with chronic insomnia let's say\nOne thing that they can do and and which is quite effective is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia they can be done on line one program is called sleepy oh another is called shut eye these are interactive programs again that help identify sleep Steelers and the environment that and that's part of our education program to

important for it to tell the story behind the story especially in this particular instance has\nThis story that I saw a tree tells it very often has\nEven if it is a narrative form it's the story behind the soy it's how that particular group of people feel about the situation that they're in a it's less plot driven as as having the plot affect the character and you think about it so\nYes I Believe that the\nMajor thing about poetry is the story behind the story and that's the kind of story that I'm always fascinated by them on a town\nIraq in northeast Ohio to receive a Cleveland arts prize your roots are deep your your father was a chemist is that what brought your family to Akron how did your family come to act\nYou know my family came to Akron in in that big wave of in the twenties Nineteen twenties when everyone coming up in off my father's family came from a of Rome, Georgia in that area when he was two years old my mother's family came up from Washington DC and\nThat's and uncles who landed in Cleveland because here where the jobs\nThe jobs and rubber factory in Akron the jobs in the steel mills here and in Chicago and\nIt was an opportunity I think for many black families to finally participate in the American dream and that's what brought them here how did it become a chemist too it's a big step wow yes I Know he was the only member of his family to go to um\nTo go on from higher you get higher education going to college or they were very poor and they are everyone saved up to\nDress him so he could go to school he was and he is very smart I mean he was the valedictorian of classical they didn't let him gives a speech but that's a whole nother thing\nAnd ah he loves the side since he was good in chemistry in fact he did his classmates and organic chemistry and then and then he didn't get the jobs that they got\nAnd wasn't elevator operator for several years\nAnd finally those classmates and his old professors at the University of Akron\nLeaned on the on good year and that in that way he became the first black a research chemist in the tire industry so that's how but he loves science\nWhen you were a loving on your birthday your father and your family when you were in Washington DC your father and under the great march on Washington which committed and Dr King's speech to talk to you at all about that [noise]\n[laughter] no [laughter] no you know it's interesting we all went down to Washington DC I had I still have relatives there and so we stayed with my other relatives it was my birthday I was a little bit miffed because it with most of those days I didn't quite understand what was going on I'm\nOnly eleven but I did you know and just and my father was somewhere in that television that I was trying to watch and I knew that it was important uh\nLet's talk about ... years later I asked my father why'd you know why did you not\nTell us about all the things that were going on with him because I was I was a baby but uh or toddler when he was an elevator operator and his response was with that he and my mother had decided that they want it to protect as long as long as they could\nSo that you don't grow

sciences as well um\nYou know I took all the advanced courses in science and the calculus and all that kind of stuff so I really have lived myself as a nurse but it doesn't matter\nI loved it what was really interesting about my time at booked on I think this has something to do is that not only mid western sensibility but the way in which um groups of people were in flux at that time\nWas that uh there was\nI Would say less racial discrimination or or segregation then I see even today you know in times my classmates and I kind of got along it when they were quite a mixed group of people we would make jokes about the fact that\nOur school colors are black and white said okay this is kinda cool [laughter] you know and and even now in in class reunions\nWe just have a ball we have a ball
