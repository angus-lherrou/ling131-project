hundred ...\nWith Alan Greenspan the man who led the Federal Reserve from Nineteen eighty seven to two thousand six he served through booms and recessions he's now Ninety two we asked him about the recent volatility in the stock market\nWell I think it's basically the combination of not what the fed is doing which remember the short term interest rates and it's what the market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note and say the thirty year treasury bond they've moved up significantly\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts had already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nThe impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with him about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America a history which he co authored with Adrian will drudge I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWho have more than two\nIt's more directly related\nTo a structure of the company for example the so called rust belt who's populated largely by industries which are very old Silicon Valley for example is a classic case of who've already knew\nThere of very different pockets of economic growth and various degrees of stagnation\nThrew out the country and it depends obviously whether your grocery and there was\n... was sort of being prices mean something or whether you're on the west coast to where the issue of high tech stock prices a little everyone talks about so the only thing about this country which is very diverse out of the ... where you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge\nFine rather than the dawn of the new era of tech driven growth why do you say that well when you look out into the future all we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity\nFlying uh well basically because fear you know when to deal with fear it is very difficult to classify\nBudget can you can look at the consequences of it and the consequence is basically a suppressed level of innovation and therefore of capital investment and uh just inclination to take risks\nIn the book and suddenly I might add discussing whether the lowest the long term outlook is all about\nUh we say that the issue the aging of the population and its consequences on entitlements and so having a significant negative deterioration over the long run the reason for that is what the data on a critically show is that\nIn title ... which are mandated by law\nA gradually and inexorably driving out gross domestic savings and the economy\nDollar for dollar and so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is our current account deficit and uh we're now built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners\nBut what this is causing this is largely the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging\nRight now the official actuaries of their Social Security system\nSay in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds and balance they'd have to cut\nFor civil rights act is going to happen\nI don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major problem out there\nSo long as you don't do it it could cause the debt overall total government that go over a rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation\nWhen you say inflation it it it's a big problem out there and we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nThat's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about for example interest rates ... century bc Greece when not terribly different from where they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise for no other reason that they're below the long term human nature to determine stability\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nReason we kept rates low as ... own employment rates so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace and the dot com boom was no moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move is that we didn't feel that the signals were there and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling oh well below the usual expectation of like four percent\nBut with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers\nPack on information\nSo if does low interest rates were not a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand\nI think that what we specifically learnt strangely for the first time in two thousand is there are two conditions as hard for a crisis\nOne is a toxic asset lives a\nSecured ties to mortgages\nBut the critical issue is how those mortgages financed and women have financed by leverage that that's the dangerous signal\nYou see anything like that right now no not in any area\nGeneral you know that that was a very extraordinary period in court narrowed it would've been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve the Brits down during the period of very low unemployment that was what the period was\nI was having a conversation with somebody in the banking industry recently who said that one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now\nI'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nA for jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that the people that want to hire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that that is going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically it's not lower productivity but it's an issue\nWhen you get the sort of tight labor market\nWage ... hours of necessity\nAnd it's the wage rate rises which affect the cost of production and hence induce corporation\nIt hasn't really big on that\nI Want to ask you about one more big thing that you talked about in your book or an as the issue of creative destruction um first of all explain what that means\nA creative destruction is the process by which people do two things they continuously invest but the investment is displacing older equipment but more importantly it engenders unemployment and uh\nIt's to process which unfortunately is a necessary condition for growth and standards of living\nYou have to let bad things happen in order for the overall picture to be better in the future\nWell because the very nature of progress economically as we point out in the book is the result of creative destruction\nWhich means essentially for example when uh\nThe uh open hearth ... been in the steel industry a whole slew of procedures within the steel industry so called best swimmer furnaces\nThey became obsolete and they were scraps but also workers associated with those particular furnaces so to speak they lose their jobs so that the labor force is

fifty for Bernice Simon was eighty four Sylvan Simon was eighty six Daniel Stein aged Seventy one Melvin wax\nEighty eight and ... younger was sixty nine they all spent time in the squirrel hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh which has been in the news because of this tragedy it's leafy streets and historic houses much of the population is Jewish\nBut it's also Mr Rogers actual neighborhood it's we're Fred Rogers lived when he was making a show a show we wish we had help us through a week like this\nWere British ... is executive director with the Fred Rogers center she's with us from ... Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers was born a he moved to scroll hill when he got married Roberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrel hill\nWell then this is really sad day in the neighborhood [laughter] um I Know that I'm afraid in July ... the community that diverse than the diversity in the community of squirrel hell\nAnd um he loves walking down the streets and I'm noticing the trees and then the various chemicals and synagogues and churches\nUm that all made him feel at home um that they grief that delicatessens and he often commented that he could get a sense Hebrew and it doesn't have the language is spoken and walk down the street that community\nHe actually learn ... pay get gas or do you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on scroll hill\nI'm ...\nYou know I think that it it was a fantasy neighbor click the neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another which certainly I think with reflected to him is through the ... community and probably all second electro community where I grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence\nOr we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination a that word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers I did and the puppet Daniel tiger I had this question for lady ...\nWhich is that the nation me [noise]\n\nHave you heard that word a lot today [noise]\nAnd I didn't know what it meant\nIt means\nSomebody getting killed in a sort of surprised way\nThat's what happened you know men killed that other men\nI Know and a lot of people are talking about it right now too many people are talking about a lot of people are\nSad scared about it you know [noise]\nI'd rather talk about it some other day and if you like [noise]\nSound a courtesy of the Fred Rogers company laid ... lady Evelyn goes on to change the subject to a picnic but Daniel tigers says he doesn't feel like a picnic a she says that's okay what do you think Fred Rogers talked kids about how to handle difficulty emotion\nIf the things that he taught us all lift that it's All right to have these feelings to feel sad and to feel angry and to be afraid and there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children the message was that\nA grown ups are there to listen and I think that the message to grown ups were\nIt's listening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it and helping them to learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area of what we saw where all the helpers the the emergency response team the police officers the firefighters the ambulances the doctors the nurses everyone\nUm have surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with so that they identify with\nThe helpers and not those who who uh cause destruction\nI've seen a line a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days look for the helpers yes\nAs part of that same special that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence which isn't\nI've been terribly concerned\nAbout the graphic display of violence\nWhich the media has been showing recently\nAnd I plead for your protection\nOf your young children\nChild to take\nWith out of me overwhelming what\nDo you think Fred Rogers will be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\nWell I I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of us to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but he also think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make good next attractive\nAnd I think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermines that message\nSo looking for the helpers helps the see the good that is still around us\nFred Rogers said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean this life and be hateful or we can spend that time creating a encouragement and spaces where children it and and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creative ways\nTo were British ... what do you think Fred Rogers new new Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend\nWell I think he would be horrified by what happened and and he would he would be concerned about the children she would be concerned that they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see these reactions in the adults\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn the feelings are normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express anger and find ways to express sadness\nI'm In ways that are not harmful to other people um and you know I think that the comforting its neighborhoods\nEveryone to live on this planet is a neighbor um and reach out and and to provide support to our neighbors to people of all backgrounds from all face symbolic rates said that we can live together on this earth and very productive place\nWhat's this been like for you living right they're outside of Pittsburgh\nYeah it's like to be very hard I've

G. of Ohio we've actually had him on the show before talking about you\nHim on some of those recipes are mighty good [laughter] anyway yeah Mike DeWine is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big guy ice cream social down in his home town and a lot of people now and you know from that but he's he's very folksy\nMike DeWine was a former U.S senator he's also served at the state level he was a with our governor\nOur former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties\nUm and served with him or so but he has been very staunch up against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed\nAgainst a a filed in a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea of having protection for um you know these pre existing conditions but he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed\n[noise] All right let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we are going to play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminals\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to let out for their first it's my turn ... or they get outraged by measuring the get out it's my turn of your ... okay here's Cordray getting a word and we are the\nWorst states in the nation the Trump Administration CDC report should we have the highest increase in ... last year and he stayed in the nation All right so\nWhat we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day\nWe're both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes and take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those\nAnd it would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say um you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but\nAh you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing the crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so\nThere is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people who have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for them\nIs that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or water people what's on their minds\nWell it seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even Mike DeWine would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it um Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and would they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you\nWell at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind that the most recent polling shows us that that it's you know very tight and uh we've got eight million voters of we do have in this election that can vote\nAnd um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there's a race here\nNow a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in\nOur could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal in Ohio\nAnd it is a big deal it's always a big deal\nThat Ohioans have approved at that ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to play out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have\nA a good good opportunity to get in there and help draw those lines and I have some effect on it\nThat's joined goes who covers politics at Ohio public radio talking about the governor's race in Ohio Joe thank you thank you representatives from the Indonesian airline lion hair have announced they'll meet with us plane manufacturer Boeing\nTo discuss what caused a seven thirty seven ... a plane to crash into the sea early Monday morning\nThe plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash joining us now is ed Kaplan from airline weekly Hi Seth\n... and we know the shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nA lot of it has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people\nAre saying that the plane was essentially Going Radical you doing things that we don't usually experience during flight my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like something more than that something perhaps to do with air speed indicators and a very early you have to emphasize that right now but\nKnow if that the played into this uh you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was\nCrash that some people might remember off the crush of the coast rather uh Brazil back in two thousand nine Air France flight for four seven yeah\nUh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things a mechanical issue some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but uh you know as much a cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes or which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly and the pilots\nUh you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so a very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened day before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening on on that it'll slated flight\nNow when you hear about a brand new airplane and this was a brand new airplane and flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brand new airplane sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they haven't tested it out enough and and there may have been a problem that didn't come up yet and here we are\nAs it's so new I ... and and yeah you know legitimate to say that on the other hand you know we've all flown on on brand new airplanes and in fact you know this this max eight is is the newest kind and there are already hundreds around the world\nOf flying you know for that matter airlines like American in southwest here in the U.S airlines like Air Canada and west jet just north of the border\nAnd and you know of course this is also very rare for something like that so sure at this point you can ... you could construct all kinds of ah you know ideas about why this could have happened\nUh but you know the newness of an airplane in and of itself shouldn't cause something any more than ... ... you know a very old airplane as long as it's maintained properly\nWe're not talking here nobody is talking about pilot error nobody is talking about whether anything like that they're they're looking investigators it appears or looking mostly just that\nThose pilots onboard again in all of this very preliminary but you know if all of that happened the day before well what happened after that a writer what was was the plane taken in for the kind of check that you would expect it to have been taken in for a ... after something like what those passengers scribes\n\nDirectly on glass a fracture is image and
