I Know the are the guys dealing with it would've been very excited because the whole point is they're going to get lots of ... and ... that's a very exciting thing because that gives us time to review the CCTV would never go look for certain people or if not with the audience fought people from the footage so would you use many different sects\nScary enough sleep because of a super recognizes were recognized that person that we got some memory and then if we see that person to get enough of it if it were stopped building the pitch and then we can start seeing is that the person can full\nNow London as you well know is one of the most surveilled cities in the world there is some estimates that there is something like a million CCTV cameras capturing hours and hours of footage every single day of the year how important is that trove of evidence for you as a detective in ... in that unit\nI think is absolutely brilliant it's estimated about one point five billion cameras now in London and I think is absolutely marvelous because\nBeing on that said ... which I was we used to get so much C.

I'm In ... when we took him back for fingerprinting it comes down to the same\nPeople probably shocked when you tell them how you found them\nWe did get quite often we even had one guy right from prison and I can't believe you me for that one sided I ah like did appreciate is a very unique skill\nWow Josh Davis let's bring you in again from the University of Greenwich what is the science say about how this works\nThe science says we think that she's sort of a night we think that super recognizes a less than one percent to population very very ...\nAnd I think that's the sort of direction that the research may be going and future [noise] is\nIt a matter of having a very very good memory or is it a completely different function of the brain altogether\nWe think is a different function is it's quite an interesting question that because\nPeople have done research on a world champion soup and memorize those who ... hundreds of ... something like this\nAnd when they tested that face recognition ability they found that they would not very good at all on the other hand super recognizes seemed to have average IQ they seem to be average at recognizing other types of objects recognizing so to streams of numbers in words and things like that\nSo it does seem as though it's a unique skill that these specific to faces\nWould there be an evolutionary reason why humans might develop a skill like this\nNot in fact almost the opposite because as you could imagine in sort of pre history people lived in very very small communities leading to know a large number of faces wouldn't being very necessary so so that sort of\nStrange situation as far as the sun is concerned it may be the what's happened is the policy of the brain associated with\nOther aspects of object recognition has somehow change slightly too in the super recognizes to become very very good at face recognition but that's a hypothesis less and that's not the sun's definitely well look\nComputers can be trained to recognize faces is well how how does the human brain compare to what artificial intelligence can do\nLike I say we're very very good high quality images computers are operating at about the same level as an average human being super recognizes a still better than the best\nA human beings still beat computers I think in the future ... what the situation is going to be it's the best algorithms working with the best humans to super recognizes to make the most accurate identity decisions\nWhat are the limitations that people like Kenny have\nA ... a human being leads to sleep unlike a few uh we get tied fatigue there isn't that must be a limit to how many images and how many people Kenny can say I'm big before before he does get fatigue so that's one limitation of humans\nWell is really I think in in press if about Kenny skill is he's ability to rule out\nThe huge number of faces the Hindus and they'll say ... to him because obviously when they're searching through CCTV footage for ... you know for a suspect Fritz ... most of the time they're actually looking at face these people then not interested in the ... super recognize that can do\nIs Josh I Know you've worked with Scotland Yard in the past uh we know they're recruiting people like Kenny from within the forced to be tested for this skill but what what about other places\nDo you see super recognizer is being used in this country and the FBI for example or are you noticing this getting some traction in smaller police departments around the world\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

to use the body's immune system to attack cancer\nAnderson Cancer center and joining us now is Dr Peter pitchers who is president of empty Anderson ... welcome and congrats to you and your colleagues on winning a Nobel Prize\nThis is fantastic news of course for Jim for empty arson but most importantly for cancer patients around the world\nWill tell us a little bit about James Allison's work in immunotherapy to attack cancer\nWell Dr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his uh research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works or in cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer and\nHis main insight was to understand how to block a protein on T cells that acts as a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand it 'cause that's you're still probably a doctor level [laughter] well\nIn our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells and those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or cause auto immune diseases\nAnd part of that break process also impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Alison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer\nAnd so what has that meant for cancer treatment and general well this is really\nUp an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call him you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery chemotherapy and radiation and creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments or sometimes\nTo treat cancer absolutely I I Do believe that this will lead to insights and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of treatment and allow us to reduce the side effects associate with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer what\nKind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular results including\nPatients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that gems team has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond\nThese are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nGenes Allison started his career at ... or send in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nA the Andy Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving a good results\nWell there's a mood shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals\nAccording to the world Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year how are you about the future of cancer treatment right now\nRight now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer\nSo as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the historical approaches of screening the environment for compounds that might have anti cancer a fact\nThis change in research strategy coupled with the types of innovations that are Harold in today's a Nobel Prize award really open up avenues that create great opportunities for cancer patients in the future\nIs Dr Peter ... the president of the University of Texas Andy Anderson Cancer Center thank you so much and again congratulations thank you so much well now to Spain and the city of punted ... population eighty thousand where you're more likely to hear chirping birds than hunting

wrote about this he joined us on Skype from Barcelona welcome\nHigh and did they ban cars entirely in ...\nThey they ban them from the initially from the historic part of the city the medieval city which is about three hundred thousand square majors and then they extend that to a slightly bigger\nOr area which is sort of the the Eighteenth nineteenth century part of the city so the city center is calm free and then it's it's ... it's ringing to buy a areas where you can drive and also where there are a lot of places to park and how's that working out\nUm it's worth you know very well let's say you know like most of these things there was a lot of resistance or people you know associate having caused what's their personal liberty um but I spoke to last for a while I was there and I couldn't find anyone who criticized the even though you know this is a POTUS fame where\nIt tends to rain quite a lot\nThat's on the Atlantic side of Spain\nAbout emergency vehicles police fire

bride and groom can come in a car but everyone else walks\nWhat about businesses or are they happy with this because you would think that many people would want to drive to get to a shop or a restaurant where they want to go\nWell that was you know that was a business where it was opposed to it exactly on that basis although it needs ... cities is very very difficult to park so the reality is in fact businesses survive better\nThan in some small towns\nOr were you know they still allow cause a pony because it's just simply nicer to walk around the other thing is that the the the city of ... combined the policy of banning cars were those also banning\nThe building of big shopping centers on the outskirts of town which tends to destroy small businesses within the town\nSo you spoke with the mayor of ... what did he say about why he wanted to do this\nWell you have you know he basically said that the old city was effectively a dumb said it was a that people didn't like going there that it was full of abandoned cars that were a lot of drugs and ... and within the first month of come into office basically they cleaned it up and buying cars\nWhich is you know clearly something you know he said they'd been you know he's been researching into those for\nSome time before he took office and I think partly because he did it swiftly was you know there was kind of a fait accompli\nWhat about C. O. two missions or what happened to pollution as a result of this\nPollution according to their statistics went down within the city center by about Seventy percent or accidents went down\nEither either people injured or killed so you know these are significant gains obviously you know it's also you know general gave for people's health and people walk or people cycle I'm you know this is what everyone is to some extent aiming for in cities\nNow punted they dress a small city many people probably haven't even heard of it but there is a larger city in Spain Madrid that's actually considering doing something similar what are they thinking about in Madrid um\nMany many cities and you're all about eighty thousand a hundred thousand lived on ... so you know what's been done there could easily be applied in the cities in the big city like a trip obviously\nIt's a different story I think you know what they're aiming for is to ... exclude traffic from the city center I'm part of part of what was being done it's also being done here in Barcelona it's simply make it less convenient to drive\nFunding for here and now comes from network greeters of Matt law that simulates software

than socialist government and the prime minister ... there is no chance of\nEver a referendum on independence it's against the constitution but they could have greater autonomy and last night I put that to the spokesperson for the ... separate discussion here and are joined by the PKK he said to me categorically no and they will continue he said working on accept disobedience\nI liked the illegal referendum if they don't get an independence choice and he said when and how he said not now I'm telling you will do something well\nYou know we should point out that their recent poll that say that people in the region are split on the issue so there are many people that you've been speaking to still want independence and there are those\nDo not um how how divided in\nWell I think that's a fascinating thing because it in the in the year since we had him really pivotal moment the polls haven't changed even divided fifty fifty and I think that's the the interesting thing when a loss of the analysts to look at the situation\nNailed it divided front Joe sense it could very easily spark off again on the street [noise] but to be received Kevin ... speaking with us from the streets of downtown force alone I got an thanks so much for your time to do for\nMm\n[noise] Mm [noise]\nWell now that we're into fall and the weather's a little cooler here in our resident Jeff Kathy guns does here to warm us up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy hey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that we love to eat but we don't always loved to make I Know and you know what I'm going to be really honest I spent a week after week in the studio telling you\nHow simple it is to make various foods and I'm not lying\nBut I Will tell you the truth that fried chicken it is involved deep frying at home is completely doable but it's involved well I Would be afraid I Would start a fire you start a fire but you want to hear my first step yeah\nI use a walk walk the ideal shape\nFor holding the oil knows flattering it's got the high side\nYou want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil and you want to keep a it's a mom and her because you want to constantly be monitoring the temperature of the oil you put that their own or in the hot oil right so I had my walk I also use a cast iron skillet okay I\nHad about an inch to two inches of I like to use a combination of an organic shortening some people use Chris go you can use safflower oil canola oil I like to do a mix\nAnd I bring it up to three twenty five\nAnd because my mom and her is right there I can constantly see why it's getting close to four hundred or oh no it's down to two hundred and I'm always adjusting to keep it around through twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to\nThis is my a nod to southern fried chicken American so I can listen to that crunch alright are good but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter]\nUm what I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into eight pieces and I'm marinated it overnight in really good buttermilk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and buttermilk tender I says chicken it at some of that acidic flavor but it also does tender eyes the chicken\nI take it out and then I dusted well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little specks you see I used to very course of course middle ground corn meal so it's got a great texture and then I fry it up and\nHere's another ... OK okay if you're frying whole chicken\nYou're going to do all the wings at first but then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the recipe says\nBecause each one of those cuts cooks for different amount of time\nAnd if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there you're not going over or under cook it now you've got a little bit of money here and some limits so close to you would yeah that and I like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the ... of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey\nAdds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken and you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken for ... oh yeah I'd like to write the hunting isn't the hunting has really brings out the sweet flavor that's there but it's subtle to kind of pulls it out\nThat's a really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left of oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answer the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end\nAnd was a little bit to brown but the idea behind having not greasy food is that you're monitoring\nHas got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this is my version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go ...\nAnd so I saw is ginger little ketchup sesame and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important this is double fried\nFood so you fry it you cool it down and they try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy knows that's just for Christmas that is yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispy this\nThen I made a sauce out of the marinate I simmered down again the chili paste the ginger and\nI spread that on the chicken and Dustin with sesame seeds and I don't know what do you think it's delicious and and by the way I sent well and and I remember we talked to David Chang the chef of ... about fried chicken he mentioned there's a lot of history involving fried chicken when it comes to African Americans\nI've also eaten at high schools in Atlanta which is where Martin Luther king used to go into his fried chicken\nBack in the day so there's a lot of history lots of history and David ... did a whole series for Netflix about right did a whole episode on fried chicken and what the big takeaway is that it's eaten all over the world but I did talk to\nMichael ... he he is the author of the cooking gene which won some James Beard awards he said fried chicken goes back deep into the middle ages in Africa during the slave trade it's emblematic of the afro krill innovation that gets co-opted time and time again\nAnd he goes on to talk about how it's southern and the soul identities come right out of this collision\nFunding for here and now\nProject from minor repairs to major remodeled homeowners can read reviews of local pros and book appointments online at home we'd visor dot com\nAnd college vine where consultants work with high school students to identify and itchy their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship awards more at college fine dot com\nWas this year and now in Washington state the number of school age children who are homeless is way up the Seattle Times recently found that in several rural and suburban areas the homeless student population had more than doubled between twenty twelve and twenty Seventeen\nAnd ... the number is up to thirty four percent in the past five years\nAcross the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening in a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming well it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for buffalo school district in ... county Washington and one of the district trying to figure all this out Carly welcome\nYeah thank you for having me\nThose numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing their peers county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students [noise] um this year we don't have the total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year do you have any idea why\n[noise] yeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand the layers of the onion that these families or\nWe had our economy boom we never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened um there's many different factors that are leaving these families just on the edge of becoming homeless and\nReally it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets\nNo you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country are you seeing a an issue where people are getting priced out of a of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community is what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or\nAs cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and like I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath\nAnd it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is it too\nFamilies that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them um it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go with out until we get them recognize\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee lest um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nYou noticed that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nYeah it's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter] because they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it\nI go out and my community and I do drive ... to go to the address that they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lot of times I\nJust go out to the house and cold and knock on the door they totally don't even expects me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to\nAsk them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment that they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers they're experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west and seen reports out of Idaho they've got the highest number of homeless students that they've seen in years um there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage, Alaska\nThis used in many places around the country do you think it's the same root cause\nA each one of these places or something different\nThere are different but I Would say it has to be directly correlated with um just housing prices going up and we haven't really seen any new shelters or funds being set aside for section eight housing to accommodate the massive boom in these homeless families\nIt's like we're not keeping up with the need so what kind of help or you ... [noise]\nWe um Bethel school district is not connected to a city titles so it's very difficult to have the resources and the funds that we need so we require solely on our own community to provide funding and donations\nI Believe a vessel we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have systems set up where we have a resource bus we drive we'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them closing that they need sometimes we've even ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program where we um send food packs home with every homeless students on friday so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday we have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here\nAnd it's wonderful and we're well supported but it's it's like a band aid to every crisis it's happening\nAnd it sounds like you're saying it's private citizens step in and it's not it's not going to do it\nIt's private citizens it's our team at Bethel it's our hard work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help\nThe big picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study that says kids who experienced homelessness in school or eighty seven percent\nYou see this every day in your job I mean how how does that look to you on the ground to see how these kids than struggle with through class work\n[noise] it's just heartbreaking to work with the families and work with the students\nOn their self worth and their self value and what they believe they're capable of doing is so low that it debilitate them from doing potentially well and what they potentially could be\nI'll just give you an example I had one young man I was working with and he had no self value could care less about doing his school and I had asked him I said what do you want to do what do you want to be when you grow up and he's like I don't know\nHis probably just end up like my parents and be on the streets and I'm like no you can be you can be something different I said what do you enjoy so after a couple meetings with them over the next week um I had discovered that he loved animals\nSo it was simple as hooking him up to a veterinarian it took took the young man under his wings and started showing the ... the ropes of\nWhat education you need to become a veterinarian doctor and here why don't you come after school and help on tearing clean the kennels for me and do this it gave that boy purpose to have a hope and a dream after high school and that's\nAll I can offer for these students is giving them the hope and the dream that they can be somebody after high school other than what they've experienced\nCurly ... a family resource coordinated with the ... school district in ... county Washington ah which has been dealing with a spike in a number of homeless kids are enrolled in their schools Carla thanks for the work that you do and thanks for being with us", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "01"}
