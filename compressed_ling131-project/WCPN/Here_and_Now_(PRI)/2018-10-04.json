thirty thousand dollars to her to stay quiet about it just a month before the election in twenty sixteen Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law by making that payment\nWill Stormy Daniels has a book out this week called full disclosure she joined me from Beverly Hills to talk about it it is a memoir about more than the night she says she slept with Trump\nEverybody wanted me to write a tell all and I was like I really don't want to do that because you know that doesn't define me of course everybody knows that you know about that at big you know Ninety seconds and ah back in two thousand six with Trump and I was like I just don't want to write a tell all because it would be a very very short book\nBut then you know I really didn't have an outlet to tell my side of the story obviously I went on sixty minutes and hope to do that or an interview was over three hours but once it was edited down it was only fourteen minutes and some of the really key things that I wanted to express you got cut out everybody knows what happened but nobody really knew how or why\nSo like you people haven't gotten the full picture of who you are\nCorrect and like I said how things transpired and why they happen the way they did in the way things unfold that so I just rushed the buck and it was it was just my way of putting having complete control um although you know I'm Still sure that people are just going to jump straight to chapter three and I've you\nKnow it might make a joke about that in the book but let's let's start with what you're talking about at the beginning you grew up in\nBaton Rouge Louisiana you describe a rough childhood your mother would leave you alone for days without food or you say you were repeatedly raped at the age of nine and you were called a liar when you tried to report that sexual abuse to a guidance counselor\nWhat are you were able to know about you and your life that you don't think that they do\nYou've named with someone that uh I met and just thought it was going to be a crazy night with a goofy TV star obviously I had no inclination as anyone else that he was going to be a politician you know I just started the book with the background because I kind of wanted everyone to get a\nA feeling for where I came from but I think that like the most important thing that I wanted to get across is that\nI was established and my industry as a writer and director and a feature dancer [noise] um I had this completely different life although in its own right very extraordinary and so I just wanted people to know that there's a lot more to me than just that night\n[noise] what made you decide to finally come out and say this is what happened\nI was fine when saying nothing at all if I wasn't I Would have never sign a nondisclosure I'm not stupid [noise] um and if I was going to do that I Would have asked for a lot more than a hundred and thirty thousand dollars once again I'm not stupid I just wanted it to go away I didn't want it to affect my family or my young child\nAnd I had a pretty successful career I'd moved behind the camera was starting to be really known and respected as a director I directed the mainstream things music videos lived in small town in Texas was very happy with you know I'm doing air quotes normal friends\nSo this was the last thing that I Want it to come out but then somehow it got leagues and Michael Cohen started running his mouth and then they wanted me to sign additional statements that were completely false\nI was fine with saying nothing but I didn't want to lie in the meantime the story was exploding everywhere and people were attacking the left and right and call me names and\nI just wanted to set the record straight and I just want it to be able to tell the my side of the stories of people to understand where I was coming from and at the same time all these other women were coming forward\nI just felt one day that it was the right thing to do so I did it\nWhat do you want to happen to Michael Cohen\nAnd the one who most importantly and if you read the book you'll understand what I'm saying he's the one that blew it\nYou know I was totally fine with saying nothing at all I was actually thrilled\nAnd then he's the one that's already happening he broke the nondisclosure way before I did and then when he realized he'd messed up he just continue to do so\nI think he's going to get what he deserves but on the other side of that I also am starting to have a little bit of admiration respect that he did finally come clean and I met the moment that I got the call I was actually overseas in Europe when I got the call that he admitted that\nI was telling the truth was a huge moment for me because I'm used to being called all kinds of named to have a pretty thick skin being in the adult entertainment business you know but being called a liar was was really hard because I knew I was telling the truth\nWhen you make clear in this book that you were worried for your safety all along still are\nRight that was my other reason for signing the nondisclosure which we all knew it was kind of a crappy deal I'm was because there would be a record and so I figure it's nothing really happened to me because there are people who knew about this nondisclosure now my fear lies mostly with just sort of\nCrazy fans not you know directly related to the government or anything like that\nBut you've got body guards now\nI Do I have to they're awesome [laughter]\nBut what does that what is that like I mean to to now be in a situation where you've got to have bodyguards all the time because of coming forward with your story\nIt was very overwhelming at first you know I was used to being able to travel alone I was used to be able to go to the bathroom alone [laughter] that's gone but over the last several months you know I have adapted it I've gotten used to it and we've become friends and it's just the way that it is [noise]\nYou describing this book when you first met President Trump in Lake Tahoe back in July of two thousand six and you say your first impression\nDidn't earn themselves they're harbored this inner self esteem problem that they try to mask by over compensating as you've been thinking back about that moment and as you've seen him as we all have over the last couple of years um as it shaped the way that you perceive to him at the beginning at all\nNo not not much ice does stand by that feeling you know ask anyone I'm not personally nominate checks but I have a lot of friends in the adult business that that's what they do or that's part of their job and they will tell you that their\nBiggest paying and most unusual clients are CEOs and presidents have companies and people at high power um\nAnd then the other thing about that is that people who grow up very privileged and spoiled for lack of a better word lack of social skills because no one's ever told them now\nAnd I think that was pretty obvious and still holds true today how would you describe it today\n[noise] I don't know I Would have to I mean I haven't talked to him and twelve years I think that he is a different person um at least the night I not with him he can make complete sentences\nOr there's a report on the wall Street Journal this week that alleges that Trump personally directed an effort earlier this year to stop you from publicly describing your alleged affair with him ... how do you respond to that\nI found out about that the same time you did I think it was yesterday just reading news on line it's the first time I've heard of that honestly and it doesn't it doesn't surprise me that it happened it just surprises me that I'm just not finding out about it\nThat actually brings me to another question which is how how much do you have to pay attention to the news now are you are you reading the news a lot more than you used to\nUh actually the exact opposite [laughter] ironically I she asked for like the first couple of months I was obsessed and was reading everything and I can't tell you the last time\nOh in politics closely\nThings yes but I'm not reading the news and the news stories and specially staying away from anything about me\nWhere you're coming out with this book just a month before the midterm elections do you want this to influence the way that people vote\nThat was not my intention at all that was literally how fast can get done how fast can get print that how fast can this happen it was not a strategy at least not on my part maybe the publishers smarter than I thought but I don't think so I don't think it was actually part of a master plan\nWhat do you what happened in the mid term elections or do you do have a view on that\nYou know I Do I think that it's going to be very interesting like I said I've watched everything turn I don't want to jinx anything so I'm just going to wait and say\nOkay I Want to ask you about one more thing or that's in the news right now which is the President Trump has been talking at these rallies about Brecht cabin on Christine Blasey Ford in her testimony and he just a at a campaign rally mocked Christian ...\nI don't want to [noise] right [noise]\nWell do you think it was it was what I'll do it how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where is the

they see on which is following me under the ocean I can tell us about this one [noise] you know this album ... by polo and pan it came out last year but then it got re released this year in the states with five additional tracks and that's when it sort of came on to my radar\nUm it's got a very tropical kind of\nFeel that route the album um and I know we're in the fall now but it's been a while since I spoke to you so just want to catch everybody our I'm classic ... this this is the sound of the summer I um it'll you still use it next summer too but when I'm screening albums to looking for stuff to play on my show if I can find [noise]\nTerrible album though has Seventeen tracks and I think I've played something like fourteen of them on my show already so basically like every uh every track on this album is great and that is like an unheard ratio for for my show to be\nInto that many of the songs but there's so many different looks I mean they have\nHave like some songs inspired by Brazilian some butter some daytime disco system club ready house cut some ambient songs that kind of run the whole gamut and what would you say is the John ... overall\nI Would say sort of like tropical electronic me and I would say you know they've definitely got an ear for a pop\n'em but it definitely is more electronic driven and or if I were to Johnny comparisons between other bands I Would say it's sort of like disclosure meet cool side\nOh I like that that is great we have poolside on the show actually they're great um\nYeah let's listen to the next when you brought up this is the Swedish group by agra boys on this is called sport [noise]\n\n\n\nTell us what's going on here\nYou know what I Am not completely clear on what's going on but I've seen a couple of different interpretations of this particular song and some people they're saying if the commentary on male hyper masculinity\nUm when I first heard it I just thought it was really goofy on track 'em and it's one of those songs like it it reminds me when I was little kid I wasn't allowed to watch Miami Vice before I went to sleep\nGood listen to do you like to listen to the song is an unbelievably fun lesson yet I mean like just after the after you get through the hook the first time you'll be you'll be chanting the hook on your own the second time it comes around and every other time\nAs the song moves on to become the the lead singer Sebastian Murphy becomes more and more on him um and sold it via basically just a bloody puddle [laughter]\nUm where people can people can\nGo on our website and listen to the entire thing it here now I Hope that I really hope they do okay or the next one is from Ireland uh this is maverick saber a who just released this new songs drifting here to listen to\nI like that why do you avoid [noise] absolutely I mean it's such an unorthodox delivery to and I think that's the first thing that really caught my attention with this song or the beat is really simple really funky but more than that it's just sort of the way he sounds on it was just kind of\nOther worldly who is maverick saber\nAn Irish R. and B. singer I'm I guess he's been releasing record since two thousand eleven I Know a lot of people had been fans with him for a while I just sort of caught on to him with Tucson drifting\nA but he's also on the label of Georgia Smith who was sort of a an up and coming R. and B. singer from the u._k. and he's appeared on one of George just miss a peas the project a Lebanese pie and I think that's where a lot\nA this is from Diana Gordon [noise]\n\n\n\n\nWhich we know about this one Diana Gordon just released her first ET as a solo artist but she's been around the music industry for a while and she's written for marriage Abe lives and she had three songs on beyond says lemonade album\nIncluding sorry daddy lessons and don't hurt yourself and she had a previous career as an ATM singer under the name winter Gordon but I feel like this is\nThis is Diana Gordon kind of doing her own thing\nSort of sort of a reinvention of Diana Gordon I guess but clearly multi talented person yeah I mean she she definitely knows how to write songs and and she can sing them too I mean sometimes when the singer things you can sort of feel their heart and soul and sweat have experience in their voice and to me this is one of those instances\nUm she's just sort of recalling her upbringing and sort of you know it's also very aspirational at the same time\nThe last one that you have brought us is albatross this is from Westerman\nRecords that the way they found some news [noise] but those are going to be\nJack\nDemands forthcoming ... pie\nAnd uh it is a solo artist named will Westerman a so he performs under his

efficient and kick start entire new industries\nSo the countries that invest in automation early and and the training that helps workers transition to new types of jobs could really jump ahead economically that's partly why automation is a huge part of the Chinese government's made in China twenty twenty five initiative\nThat's the country's plan to reduce its reliance on outside technology and create a tech economy that rivals the west\nAutomation is and especially big deal in China because there's so much manufacturing there it's sometimes referred to as the world's factory marketplace correspondent Jennifer pack has been giving us updates on China's a parallel tech economy from her post in Shanghai I asked her how big a deal that transition to automation might be for China\nThere are some estimates say that China's GDP will be boosted by twenty percent uh in twenty thirty of course that comes at a cost an estimated one fifth of change jobs in the manufacturing sector alone will be replaced by automation so that's nearly a hundred million workers who will have to switch jobs by twenty thirty\nWhat about retraining one of the things that we hear is that when there's displacement that there has to be re training for people who were displaced by automation is there a sense that companies or even the government is going to help with that\nHaven't heard of any comprehensive plan China's push has always been towards entrepreneurship at least in the private sector and they've been encouraging\nGood automation and artificial intelligence do for our society or it could release you of these mundane job so that you can go and innovate\nSo what solutions abroad is China's government have in terms of pushing automation forward\nWill China's government is not necessarily pushing for automation it is however a focus more on\nHigh tech manufacturing that's what they're pushing for under this plan called made in China twenty twenty five which is at the center of this trade dispute with the U.S so they are encouraging factories to use new technologies now of course the byproduct of that is automation\nBut remember this is coming at a time when China's workforce is aging rapidly and a lot of the manufacturers we've been speaking to when we try to\nAsk him about this a trade dispute with the U.S how worried they are the first thing they talk about is not about that\nThey're talking about how difficult it is defined as stable working force because a lot of the young people they don't want factory jobs they are asking for less overtime unlike the producers they want weekends off which is not\nA usual thing for a Chinese factories so a lot of these manufacturers are complaining that is very tough for them to find workers and so that's why when we speak to some of these factories they say automating is not so much about saving money it's a matter of survival\nJennifer ... marketplaces China correspondent based in Shanghai the automation

with with senator Collins saying calling the investigation thorough a Senator Flake saying it produced no new cooperating information as you said that's a sign that they essentially got what they needed to vote yes for this nomination it's it does FBI investigation\nHowever uh a brief and not conclusive as it probably was given how few ah how we've learned that not that many people were interviewed and the whole thing just took place over the course of a few days it was enough to get these undecided Republicans some cover and and and probably enabled them to vote yes\nWell and in fact Ford was not interviewed by the FBI for this year with Kavanaugh the Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley said showed no hint of misconduct by Kevin ... says the minority leader Chuck

moral instructions a soldier who misses the comforts of his wife\nAnd what happens when it gets there is he hears about wounds that might be teeming with maggots just horrifying in churning clumps they teens they stirred like embers these are life as well on every layer of clothing and every stitch and seem\nThey came out upon our combs grainy like wet meal just\nDisgusting because of these ... you know these moist dressings and amputations which he had no idea how to do and enter this nun who teaches him all of this where did you find her\nSo originally I had an imagine having the role that you eventually had in the story I had thought that measures would arrive at a hospital and of course there'd be some medical stuff then there'd be a nurse would provide a background role but much like Lew shares\nI found when I encountered her she ended up picking over the store and she has very forceful force in the book and I realized eventually but she was going to be the central figure in the book\nSo something from your imagination not from history and here's a scene where she first\nDealing with Lucia so again has arrived at this place he doesn't know what he's doing and she says wash your hands come with me now we operate we'll start with had moons and amputate the split this leg this elbow that for arm that I'm over there we can let the and this is soldier loose asks\nSmelling like that she says he'll be dead by morning\nDon't worry you didn't do it we keep them warm if he wakes up we tell him he's home because his father you call him son [noise]\nThis will creation actresses all over Hollywood should be jockeying to play her part in the inevitable movie adaptation were you thinking cinematic early because it is I felt as if I was seeing a film as well as reading a story\nI don't think I was thinking explicitly cinematic way I think that I'm very drawn to visual images at the time period offers up some extraordinary physical settings\nBecause this takes place on the Eastern Front it's different than the world war one that I ... in the trenches and muddy field so ... of Belgium this is different these are these large landscapes across which there's this encounter not only\nWith these modern military armies but also very traditional ones soldiers on horseback ... glances ... this is part of what drew me into the story of these very rich visual images from the time\nLoses in fact at one point is lost in the woods and then she's in the middle of a battle on the front it's kind of insane making did you see accounts like that\nA lot of the accounts that I read and I tell you many not most of the kinds of war accounts of battle\nAnd in that moment when Lucia stumble into this classic rushing classic advance and a group of Hungarian has ours he realizes that despite the fact that at that point he's been on the front for almost two years he hasn't really seen war itself and the rest of\nThe book really looks at this other aspect of war what's happening on the home front what's happening in the hospitals what's happening to people after the fighting is over\nWhat's happening to their mind as we know it was the beginning of people starting to understand that there was this psychiatric torment they called it nervous\nThe signal injuries of World War one is shell shock and yet at the time it was this great mystery to doctors men beginning to come down with wounds that couldn't be seen is that some new kind of\nVirus is is a reaction to this new kind of artillery and particularly potent explosive it's being used in the war that was an initial thought that there was something about\nThe high explosives that was used during the war is actually sending microscopic particles through the Gulf of the skin into the brain and causing an injury to the brain but efforts were made to understand what was causing this\nThis new disease and then most acutely how to cure\nAnd here's where we see Lucia is our doctor mature because he is viewing this as a problem to be solved Margaret denying is using this as a human being who is suffering\nIs this something because you said you relate to a lot to Lucia de does this something that transition you went through as a doctor\nIs I imagine it's a transition that many doctors go through and the when medical training begins most of us have very little experience of illness in my own medical training I found that the transition over from the pre clinical years into the thirty year when you begin to go into wards and meet people\nIs very disorienting one because for the first time you're encountering the disease that you've learned about in people who are suffering and they don't obey the same rules that you've learned about in the first two years it's much more complicated and beyond the impact of the disease on the Oregon\nThere's even more importantly the impact of the disease and the person and then beyond that and the impact of them on their family and those people who care for them and that increasing really\nUh we just want to touch on the some of the absurdist notions there was the daughter ring old professor in Vienna who steals an alleged murder made from a museum because he wants to x-ray it to see what it is enter a young scientist\nFemale scientist by the name of Marie Curie [laughter] who helps with that there was a staffer at the field hospital who was told he had manly hands\nAnd because he thinks they're special he doesn't want to wash them with just caustic soap so he gets dysentery and dies is replaced by another soldier with the same name and did it absurdity to war\nRight and probably to every conflict but particularly to this conflict ... bureaucracy was so expensive and so entrenched\nAnd so slow and reacting to her reality about on the ground but\nThe soldiers were in it would often come up against\nThese absurd situations which were horrifying often but at the same time could with the kind of gallows humor that that one and counter them on the front the approach in some ways for some some kind of humor\nWell there's also a with a doctor Zhivago for us and we are not going to give away your incredible ending\nKnock me over when I got to it but there's a moment where ... is chasing my Greta someone he thinks is Margaret through crowds he can't find her of course doctor Zhivago he chases\nA woman as well but again without giving away the ending or either the plot I don't want to spoil it for people but just talk about that sense that people could get separated in war and there's no social media and you may never see someone again\nFor here and now comes from the listeners of WB or Boston and your NPR station\nStaples with printers printer ink on toner cartridges for home in business and in store print

edition\nThis year and now retailers prepping for the holidays got some good news this week the national Retail Federation expects holiday spending to increase by around four to five percent because of destroying the economy but\nThere's a downside the low unemployment rate will make it very hard for stores to find seasonal workers ... senior innovation reporter at W. B. or he joins us now I ... I ... and tell us more about how much people are supposed to spend this year how much they're expected to spend this year and how that lines up with past year so\nThe projection is about seven hundred and twenty billion dollars in November and December and that excludes cars and gas and spending at restaurants are really just sort of those gifts around the holidays that would be about thirty billion dollars more than last year and just for perspective a spending usually does grow year over year but the\nAverage growth rate in recent years has been about three point nine percent so somewhere between four and five would be above average\nAnd how does that line up with the fact that we've talked about mall vacancies being at high levels about big department stores having problems like\nMacy's right so the trend is undeniable I'm In Cyber Monday last year was the biggest online shopping day in history and meanwhile the foot traffic in brick and mortar stores on Black Friday was down by two percent so I think the overall spending increased can help the retailers to do both and I think one really interesting experiment this year\nIs way fair the online furniture retail or they are experimenting with temporary\nBrick and mortar locations in those shopping malls but interestingly they will just be showrooms you can actually buy them there you see them in the physical space in that order online is it\nThe the ... model or where you can go and try things on but you have to actually go on line to buy it um what about this idea that it's hard for these places to attract seasonal workers\nQuite so we just saw a Amazon a couple of days that could increase its minimum pay the Fifteen dollars an hour and that increasing it looks like it will be the norm this holiday season\nHourly wage this holiday season is going to be Fifteen dollars and forty cents that's a big jump from an average of eleven and Seventy cents last year\nAnd the minimum wage just about seven dollars an hour or nationally what about the trade war and terrorists is that going to have an impact on how much we're spending on\nGifts could other Retail Federation says it's concerned about those tariffs has an estimated what the overall impact will be but of course we've been hearing for months from businesses saying that the ... of the tariffs are especially on Chinese imports could make their costs go up and therefore they would have to pass those along to consumers\nOne more thing account big economic news today and probably driving the markets lower today is that we found that the yield on ten year treasury notes US government bonds reached its highest level since ... eleven what's going on here\nRight so it was up to about three point two percent that's the highest since uh two thousand eleven as you said this is another sign of confidence in the U.S economy hard to know exactly what goes on and investors' minds but of course they're weighing the risks versus reward and the treasury notes considered a very\nSafe investment that's why the interest rate is typically lower than what you might be able to get in the riskier stock market but if that interest rate takes up a little bit maybe people don't want to take so much risk in the stock market\nAnd maybe mortgage rates and other things also start to pick up even more ... of WB or thank you so much like to be with
