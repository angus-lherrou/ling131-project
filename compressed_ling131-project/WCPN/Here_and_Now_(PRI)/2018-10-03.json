keep it confidential two senators or other centers like Bob Corker and John Cornyn want made public which their reasoning\nI spoke with both of them yesterday and part of what they said is that there

Davidson to make a documentary about his journey\nThis weekend the secretive Byron Price gets its premiere at the chagrin documentary film fest I spoke with Davidson and rent or about the making of the film so James how did you first discover the secret by Byron Price what was the attraction\nWell I remember being about eight years old and my mother lived in Bedford and I used to go to the library over in Bedford a weekly and I remember finding the book in the library this would have been back in Nineteen eighty six\nIn the book came out in eighty two and here's this book full of paintings and poems that lead you to a dozen keys that were buried across the United states and I remember thinking wow this is such a great idea because at the time ... was out and I really wanted to find some treasure with my friends\nBut then you know this is days before the Internet so there was no way for us to know how many of the treasures had already been found\nAnd so I just assume that you know they had already been claimed so I kind of forgot about it for a while and then working as a reporter at Cleveland's seen a one day open and the plain dealer and here is a story about two lawyers from New Jersey who dug up one and Byron prices keys\nIn the cultural gardens on the east side and then it said and ten more of them are still out there remaining to be found and then I got the fever again\nSo these two attorneys came here and they figured it out by looking at at the pictures what was the clue to gave it away for the picker treasure buried in Cleveland\nSo in the paintings there are always markers that lead you to the general\nThe tree and then turn the picture ups town in the negative space there is the outline of the terminal tower and somebody from Cleveland had seen that and then put that clue up in the Internet and these lawyers from New Jersey built off of that first clue and tracked down to the cultural gardens\nThere is an actual for the last box\nWas just the realization of a lifetime it's like one of the top moments in my life other than the birth of my children is like the ...\nOne of the things we see in the documentary the secretive Byron prices just how much interest in the secret there seems to be on line it seems like it's rejuvenated a puzzle or people like solve puzzles it also gives people a place to go in and congregate in talk about it\nYeah Byron Price was always way ahead of his time you know that was the thing about his life he had these grand ideas but it took everybody a while to catch up so this book really needed the Internet to really catch on\nAnd when the Internet came around and was invented that's when this book really took off\nBut by then those kids have been sitting in the ground for Twenty years so now it's much much harder to track them down\nDid you have any knowledge of the secret before you talked to ... and decided to actually produce this film I knew nothing of this book or a buyer and price but I did know James James introduced this\nFascinating idea based on this book and James ... around the same age and I think we both came of age as\nTeenagers watching movies like Indiana Jones and ... and stand by me these quest adventures that I think we were both attracted to and so when he told me about this book and the idea that we could actually get involved in a treasure hunt I jumped at the chance I have to\nDo this I tell you I could never come up with any of the ... I'm just like you I had a hard time figuring out which way to go to James and the other producer Charles Moore did a great job of narrowing down areas that certainly made sense when we discussed it once we got on the ground there was another story sometimes\nYeah we we're pretty sure we had figure it out the San Francisco clue and we convinced Tyler to come out with\nUs because we're like we've got this a hundred percent you're going to want to be there when we did this thing up so everybody went to San Francisco and we went to the place where we are sure that he was at where there's this little statue in the ground and I started digging and oh my God guy\nIt's it's it's the glue that's used to hold now in airport here full and no no don't\nLaugh now dominate guys you know I don't believe it\n\nTry to you actually appear in the documentary you seem to have a healthy dose of skepticism about something that is what is your intention to pull the curtain back and let people see that you weren't always convinced about\nWhat's going on yeah I thought that would be a fun part of the process to document not only from the perspective of the treasure hunt but also filmmaking and making this documentary and and the behind the scenes production discussions that took place\nAnd certainly how that translated to the hunt itself and it was great to be a part of it and I think maybe I represented the common man in some respects and the excitement and the disappointment that we documented on camera I think are quite palpable [laughter]\nWhere else did you go James besides San Francisco and in search of these keys to open the treasures\nOh man New Orleans we went to Roanoke Island New York city in New York was probably my favorite trip because we're able to get together with ...\nAround Battery Park or liberty island somewhere down the southern Manhattan is a key that's never been found in his daughters want to find it and it's really touching because Byron actually died in a tragic car accident Long Island in two thousand five\nSo it's very personal for them and uh it's a connection that they have with their father who's no longer around\nAnd sort of ironic because my dad talked about everything and yet the secret which makes me think that it was on purpose the secret was not something he'd Scott and now I'm the best of it obviously and finding\nThe uh it's very it's very seductive fight like I say why people are armchair treasure hunters right\nAnd also the fact that yeah the connection to my dad which is my thinking oh I Know him better so that somehow be able to read into the clues in a different way is another selling point for me\nHe seems to be such a beloved figure and you could see that coming out with the family but the thing that I found fascinating was you interviewed a wife and the film and the daughters when he said he kept a secret he didn't tell anybody anything\nNo he wouldn't even tell his wife where he went he met her in San Francisco when he buried the treasure out there and he shows up one day with a shovel and you know workers jacket on news like I'll be back in a couple of hours she was like where are you going he's like I don't ask I Can't tell you well\nFascinating [laughter] so you're pretty short films over the years taught her how does this compare with some of the other movies you've made\nThis was probably one of the most fun movies I've produced and I think a part of that was just that I was able to be involved in the treasure hunt and in the film itself not just behind the scenes but on the front lines with James and a couple of those cities\nAnd really had a blast with it and it's funny when you know James talks about speaking with the family of ...\nIn New York\nBill to discover and the same way that you discover in a treasure hunt really what the movie was about and the layers that became apparent in this ideal legacy and the relationship Byron had with his daughters and then I think James\nFound parallels and his relationship with his son which has touched on that really resonated with me and made the whole thing extra special\nCase people who know you're writing that you've written a lot about true crime here in northeast Ohio so this is obviously a very different kind of Huntington's compared to some of the other things you've done it was very touching this year than your children in the film to explain why you sort of gotten this direction you know first of all just like the true crime I mean it's still a search for an answer you know\nAnd it becomes an obsession for me\nAnd you know I also brought my son along with me as a way to kind of connect with him during the course of filming this documentary is when I discovered when we learn that he's on the spectrum\nAnd one of the ways in which we can connect are these you know little games and he really got into this idea that there was actual buried treasure out there so I've taken him up to Milwaukee just on a road trip\nFor here and now comes from that weren't greater the mat law that stimulates don't wear accelerating the pace of engineering and science you learn more and now we're not

that's that's the reference to Darwin in a test tube\nOr the laureates have used chemistry to accelerate the evolution of natural biological molecules that act as the critical machinery and the cells of living organisms\nAnd when we talk about Darwin I think most people know this term natural selection is that in play here\n[noise] well uh\nLive through the next generation continuing with that

or or other living so\nIt's a lot more complicated than just a simple Baker had um the real breakthroughs here to be able to fine tune that chemistry\nFor a desired outcome and ultimately to have that desire to outcome occur and the next generation as opposed to waiting for a slow evolutionary process as it is really what so spectacular here and\nNow we're reading that the research can be used to create things like more environmentally friendly chemicals also pharmaceuticals what are some of the real world applications all this\nWell to be able to use the um the molecular machinery within a sell to make chemical compounds are proteins that's what sells normally do anyway but to be able to ask that sell\nTo make a specific molecule is where the real creativity comes in so imagine being able to provide a set of instructions too simple cells\nSuddenly becomes a lot more interesting because we can do some very complex chemical reactions that do them in a very clean environment\nUntil really the the sky's the limit in terms of identifying molecular systems that we could imagine making in the chemistry environment like a beaker but doing it in these um these organisms that enable us to ah\nTake advantage of their natural process sees an example um all the natural process or created through um a an organism like like east helps our bread rise in the ... or ... generates um ethanol\nOr alcohol in the production of beer or wine okay let's talk about one of the winners Francis Arnold of Cal Tech here's a recording of her getting called late in the night by someone from the committee to tell her that she had one and she was remarkably calm\nYou're away from him so perhaps some projects protected from the immediate ... that's going to happen today\nWell I don't know I think it I Can't reach light show yeah it sounds like I said I Love or money [laughter]\nOr as a Francis Arnold is only the fifth woman to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry yesterday we reported on Donna strict Linda Canadian scientists only the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics for her work\nWhat does all of that mean for science and specifically for for you and chemistry\n[noise] willing I'll also point out that come from what I can tell this is the first time that women in physics and chemistry or recognized as laureates and the same year [noise] um and but you're absolutely right in the case of professor Arnold ... she's the fifth woman\nStart going way back to Marie Curie in Nineteen Lebanon and actually her daughter um several or two decades later so for us in the American Chemical Society where we're at the same for me personally were really advocating for\nBroadening the participation in the chemical science is specifically um for folks from all different backgrounds and and perspectives and frost recognizing the the fact that professor Arnold work has has risen to these levels is just it's just fantastic\n... is president of the American Chemical Society he's there at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas Oh thank you so much for talking with us\nThank you very much Peter and I'm a I Wish everyone a great day\n[noise]\nWell it's nice let's go to Colorado now for a story that many of us may have missed but not if you're in Durango that's because lego sculptures had been popping up around Durango for the past couple of years it's the work of sand bridge I'm the lego bomber from Colorado Public radio Stephanie will has this story [noise]\nThan Britain asked me to meet him outside a coffee shop Andrea's may not have them\nInto our newspaper had to he could identify me I have lights and I keep an eye out for an adult male and a sticky\nInstead and greeted by a blonde haired eleven year old he tells me he than the lego bomber and take me on a tour of quote his art for\nThis sand leads me to lego sculptures around the town many are surprisingly discreet you have to look up or down to see one posted outside businesses and\nWe put it up only a couple of days ago but\nOur tour and an old junior high school that's been converted into space for yoga and art classes there we find a bright green centipede like lego creature crawling up a wall I play along with sand but I finally called them out on his roots and remind him I've seen pictures of the actual than Britain\nWell they're taking photos of the older me\nThe older Sam who is was born in the sixties can meet the older than today probably\nCan you grow up right now okay [laughter]\nYounger sand disappears down stairwells an older San emerges from around the building or you know older than\n[laughter]\nHi nice to meet you [laughter]\nMy puppy it's\nHard to get that young [laughter]\nI I learned Britain's impersonator is ... and one of his assistants he has a posse of them but when Britain began legal bombing two years ago it was a solo endeavor\nI was just really frustrated one night on line in my bed and I'm I'm I'm not ordinarily are praying man but I Try to I gave it a try got nothing and I just felt really irritated and decided to go vandalized something\nHe happened to have hundreds of lego is lying around because he teaches lego robotics there his own business called alpine educational associates\nSo it just took all these legos and plastered on on on opposed to trying to offend somebody and what do you know it was wildly misinterpreted as art and the European but\nNow many of his young lego robotic students helped him construct ... around the city including places like a Starbucks side or the window at the drive through pharmacy out of ... this is Stephanie she's from all over the radio\nSystem she tells me that she loves having the Lakers culture there [noise]\n\nFor home advisor matching homeowners

and WB you are and the Boston Globe was last seen the new true crime podcast sponsored by Samuel Adams\nInvestigating the largest unsolved art heist in history listen on apple pie August\nIt's here and now\nIt was a part about the laughter that got me that's what my male friends said to me he said it was when Dr Christine Blasey Ford said in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault was the laughter for her to alleged attackers\nThey were having a good time she said at my expense my friend said when he heard that that was with through them that over half a century ago he was seven had gone to visit a cousin who moved to another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target\nWe're going to cash treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pinned him down he said just like glassy Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling\nBut then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left and my friends now well over sixty pretty strong he cried if that memory\nA lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lousy forward and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked forward they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying the national sexual assault hotline reported busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than ... ...\nHotline calls tripled and does yellow heads that clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all the the seas rape crisis centers she joined us from Chicago and welcome thank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nIt's been very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which is a nearly doubled from the weeks prior and five times as many calls as two weeks ago ... say on friday or calls were a little more than double from the weeks prior and we're continuing to see an increase call volume right what do people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that similar to Dr Ford they're experiencing a return it as a nation we had a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to Dr Ford's testimony we're hearing from male survivors that\nThe testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault um so the symptoms and stress reactions of the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody at a flash back you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that\nYeah absolutely so a flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if\nThey are right back in that moment to they they feel their heart pounding they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this sort of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nThe larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and nose\nAnd this friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now do this and you can't breathe lousy Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words this isn't about sex didn't do people do people when they come for help it when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about\nIn the ... the feeling of being choked of being of being and mobilized of being frozen\nAnd we know that when we experienced trauma our brain is going to react typically one of three ways we are going to fight we're going experience fried or we're going to fleet and Web lousy Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less intense feeling of fear and we're hearing about it as well from the survivors that we work with\nWe usually people have a flashback she's also explained us that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor replied and sing too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know as we talk to survivors about their trauma narrative\nThey are able to define a frequently what the worst part of that experience was and so it might be the worst part related to the disclosure it might be the worst part related to their response of the alleged offender\nBut we know that survivors have the capacity because of all the way that trauma is stored in the brain to literally re presents themselves and re experience that trauma in an incredibly intense way\nSome of us thought that she actually sounded Fifteen times and and\nTo a what that was exactly like for harmful yes yes yeah\nLook the majority leader of the New Jersey state house an eighty year old the Retta Weinberg\nAfter watching the hearings revealed that she'd been grouped in forcibly kissed by man when she was Thirteen Shireen Ghorbani Utah congressional candidate went public with her sexual attack when she was eight years old\nBette Davis President Reagan's daughter a revealed that she'd been raped by music executive Chris Wallace of Fox News anchor went on the air to talk about how his two daughters confronted him to tell him that there were things happening in their high school that he didn't know ...\nYou know it was happening to his daughters maybe not the full attacks that we've been hearing about but something very troubling to him so this has started this national conversation\nBut on the other hand Brett Kavanaugh as strongly denying that this happened Christine Blasey Ford is not believe a lot of people including it seems President Trump who initially said he found a credible but last night as you well know in a in a rally mocked her lips was new then\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get hurt on remember where is the place I don't remember how many years you don't want I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nWas I don't know why\n[noise]\nEmpathy all over again from the Chicago rape crisis centers\nWhat happens when you have this huge national dialogue and people are feeling safe to come out and tell their stories and then suddenly there is a pivot now we're hearing the president and his son say it's a dangerous time for men who are being falsely accused\nWe're hearing from callers that they're feeling just man but there will never be enough details to convince some people that a crime was committed they're feeling invalidated by the national conversation\nThis fact about traumatic stress reactions the way the brain and the body processes trauma is being used against survivors to invalidate their experience\nBecause of Dr Ford said and as so many others have said anybody who's had a traumatic experience of any kind of knows you're taken out of yourself you do forget some of the details I mean that's not uncommon\nCorrect and that's the way that the brain and body works to protect survivors and it's a part of trauma and so to expect a survivor to recall the exact details of a sexual assault whatever that assault was five days ago five weeks five months five years for Fifteen Years\nReally lives the incredible complexity of the way that the brain operates and and honestly contributes to victim blaming and myth making around sexual assault and sexual violence\nAnd we should say that Christine Blasey Ford did describe some of the things the president said that she didn't but\nAt any rate uh others have said it's like trying to describe a nightmare so we await the FBI's investigation and the Senate decision tomorrow what do you what do you bracing for\nWe're bracing for increase calls a tour hotline we're bracing for increased requests for counseling we're bracing for our current clients experiencing triggers and I\nThink survivor is find themselves you know in this incredibly powerful moment caught between pressure to come forward and a feeling that their experience will be invalidated I think this is an incredibly critical moment for our country for our government for survivors of sexual violence across the country\nTemperature below she hits the clinical program at the why do you see a metropolitan Chicago they run the hotlines and all three rape crisis in his air and thank you so much thank you and of course he knows that people have been falsely accused of sexual assault no doubt but there is a huge number of people who have been assaulted", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "03"}
