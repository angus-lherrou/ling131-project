an acronym for secured transparent auditor bowl and reliable so we're starting to what we said what\nDo the expensive so we we wanted it to be an open source system we wanted it to be very easy for voters to use so it had to be something that they could take the paper out of the machine and look at and examine themselves\nThat system would let both voters and election officials verify that votes were cast correctly after some heavy lifting on and designed to before I went looking for someone to build her dream voting machine and there were no takers\nLast year she went back to the voting machine vendors to see if they could meet just two of her requirements\nOne of them is we must have a paper trail that actually work and we noticed tend the capability to use that paper trail we have

Graham she was evicted from a low income housing project in Panama City because of the storm damage let's listen\n[noise] [laughter] [laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter]\nSo you multiply her I'm sure by many and she has been approved for FEMA rental assistance we forget about I mean she was in low income housing but there are all these renters who don't have any recourse she got to see mode rental assistance and his waiting on a check\n'em but but then what I mean where she's supposed to she can find housing but where she's supposed to find housing\nRight that's that's the difficult thing is that there aren't a lot of places available right now for housing and FEMA\nHas made some hotels available on their their vouchers or that you can use to stay these hotels but many of them are outside of the hardest hit areas that people have to have transportation to get there really there's about twenty that are accepting vouchers\nAnd did you say you know trailers are on the way people think about those FEMA trailers\nBut there seems to be a you know some slow down in the process they say they need to work with local governments they can't just come in there and say here\nWe come we're putting these trailers here the local governments need to ask for it and of course those local governments are are still putting themselves back together and so I think that's why we're seeing sort of this slow response there also shelter is of course yeah well\nIt will ah and by the way we see FEMA people all over the place in their boots teachers they're working very hard you spoke with Michelle chestnut though she was staying in a shelter in a local high school and just want to listen to how\nWe say we were in charge and maybe it was just like all the windows busted out and buy all the trees come down and landed right beside the church though yeah [noise] um I have an aunt who houses destroys a brother in law does houses destroyed you know a lot of wealth rooms\nWell so first of all clarify for us because driving around this is driven home or in the panhandle people might be picture\nMore rural people a lot more low income people and so these these are even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are\nHomes that have been handed down for generations and so since they have no mortgage and they really don't have room in their budget for insurance they don't have that insurance which will make this recovery even more difficult they don't have that way to to begin rebuilding their homes\nWill and rebuilding was what because with so many things down a incomes have been cut another big challenge is joblessness that's looming 'em and you heard from Nikki Gilmore or Walmart manager in Mariana who said people showing up for work even though they have really trying circumstances let's hear\nThe word ... son coming here called ... ... we got here they don't have anything\nAnd so I've got like ... the law does allow but after two days is here with our through smiling and Grayson just described ... just right he has a job that he can regardless and water so to see that\nThere's more calls when he says we got air he means is he conditioning air conditioned right how are people getting by they have no income I think that it's\nTough I'm hearing from people who who are very concerned about it Gilmore had opened his door and it wasn't open to the public but he would allow in his employees to come in and just help with the cleanup process so that they could get a paycheck many of these people are living paycheck to paycheck\nThere is some unemployment like specifically storm related unemployment assistance available through the state but again that's difficult for a fisherman who maybe don't have a good way of tracking what their income has been and so they don't have a good way of applying for that assistance\nYeah well running water mostly back and some places it's not drinkable communications as we have discovered are still pretty spotty um it's just really ...

Cleveland back in the Nineteen thirties idea streams de Vinci Burnett spoke with ... about the book\nWhy did you decide to tell the story as a graphic novel\nIn a way of what it was a no rain I feel like it's a lot of great literature around that is non fiction but not everybody would pick up the fight for the page non fiction book on this topic if you're not like a hardcore fan I feel like\nThis is that the more acceptable sorry and with the the especially out that the U.S I mean the book has been published and if you have a country so far mostly in Europe but it's coming to Brazil ended up the mountain and their audience fill that familiar with the story and I think people who are not\nLike heart but Superman fence would never pick up at five in the pitch non fiction book but that might be interested in that because of the story that it it's a thing even if you're not just to buy your oath at the wonderful medium to tell it and it allows also of course to pay a whole montage who's a dollar a graphic novel itself\nGrowing so much which is a whole much to the character he invented for Bob Kane betrayal of the ... is a joke or things like that you can only doing a graphic novel\nAnd tell us more about Thomas campy your partner in crime here\nSo he was someone who had no knowledge of fry it to this so I pitched the idea of the book to my agent and he actually met Thomas in China at that time some as was living in China and teach ... and ... read my script left it and I saw his\nPortfolio online and I really thought that was the perfect fit for it\nHe's moved to Australia where he's currently living so lots of in a way a lot of challenges working for all the time zones and we did like a month later ... friends and so on but it really worked up nicely because I really wanted to have like ... like traditional Americana you know Edward hub for images and\nIt really works I feel like it has like a certain ... feeling the graphic novel and his illustrations really are I mean every page is like I'm off the ... wonderful book full of wonderful images\nWere you started out you frame the story by taking people by surprise by having him sleeping in a park bench yeah\nThis was one story that was recalled by Jerry Robbins ... the first Batman illustrator at a conference of cartoon is when they were just trying to force DC Comics to reinstate the credits and when I first read about this story just stuck in my head so I really knew that this is such a\nLow point that I wanted to start with it because it really sets the stage and then you know we see how slowly supplementing created his own family background but we know that something bad is going to happen but it really built up to it but yeah it was such a scene when I first read about it that I Know I wanted to start with it\nWhere there are other mysteries you were trying to solve is you dug into this history of Siegel and Shuster\nAnd there were a few things that uh\nIs open also all the pop culture influences that's created Superman I really wanted to I didn't want to take\nPosition and what was you know definitely um influencing them but I I we list a lot of the it like a movie like metropolis or ... for\nUm radio programs about Tarzan and so on so we show all the pop culture that's what's surrounding them and I think what's but it's so fascinating is that they really created something new out of all the existing culture that's what's really they're also time so\nI think we saw a lot I mean what what really fascinated me was also at the grassroots support I mean\nFrom the pen for us the large corporations basically to cave in and that gives them the credit and pension I mean not that great tension about you know that they basically were afraid of bad publicity and it was not the legal the court stepped aside it but it really depends which\nIn a way it's also like a nice Endings That you see that ah you know grassroots support can lead to change\nSo you're going through all this research you're going to the correspondence correspondence was over what period of time so it's\nIt's it's mostly the sixties I Would say like I Can't remember offhand but I Would say it's about sixty five Seventy one or something so and it's a lot of legal documents a lot of letters\nBegging people to borrow him money yeah I mean that's a lot of frustration he recalls the case a few times and he writes about like the CEO of fiction medical bills things like that that you get a sense of of the way he talked to the very few argued heads off him thoughts it's it's a very\nI mean he's very apologetic uh all the time for his situation which you know makes it even double sad because you know he was pushed into this poverty uh\nSo yeah so it was like really like very heartbreaking to read I didn't expect that it would have\nClear to me as a kid growing up um is that really Superman wasn't blueprints for superheroes I mean you know I liked opera is more because there were more complex 'em and Superman book oh you know he was an fail a ball he\nYou know you must have super mindset once researching it I didn't realize\nThat Superman what the blueprint for everything he was the first debate you wrote an everybody want to drive the next Superman and this really you know in a way it's an origin story really go to the origin of the whole industry I mean Superman\nCreated the genre Superman credit the whole industry that were you know ... to ... we're not big business and that became it's thanks the Superman so that's what really fascinated me because it is in a way an origin story and\nLexus also the contracts that single insurance assigned as original sin because yeah there were\nNo I mean the people say that single issue that we're not used at this time the rights away but the truth is there ... there was no precedent I mean nobody expected that comic books would make so much money is so in a way that they have signs of rights away but nobody expected success of Superman\nWhat what do you think Joe ... legacy is in the world of comics sent and then I guess in in our in our culture in world culture\nI mean he created the look of modern superhero I mean yes superheroes are you know that\nSome say American Gods or something but he credit the look I mean he took what you had like a you know ... strong man or the case I mean everything that you know you fight and the superhero the way you would\nYou know if you get to draw superhero it will be more or less a copy of Superman they will he would have a K people that\nYou know it cost him he probably would have to shield on his chest he created\nAn iconic look that's you know it's\nBasically the image off a superhero and yeah\nArtists working on superheroes is working in the tradition of truth or\nIs there anything else you want to say about this adventure you've been on and telling this guy's story\nWell I mean I think that it's important to acknowledge that there were a lot of research is working on this and I just want to make clear that um it it's a new way we tell the story and hopefully people find it very entertaining way but also\nI Want to really acknowledge that there's so many people who read storage and a thanks to whose words I you know we could create what we created and um I think yeah we're very proud with the outcome and we play with a lot of\nUm other stories I mean one example actually maybe point out is a that was the interpretation that you know Superman bullet proof that had to do with the fact that\nI'm Jerry Siegel five I was murdered in a robbery and it turns out actually marked how the noble man what's the one who found the corona reports that he wasn't ... murder but he had a heart attack um so which of course what destroy a lot of theories somebody research has had\nSo we play with things like that you so you see a robbery but you don't see him getting shot so you know that the father dies and um things like this\nThat's why I think like everybody who picks up the books that police also read the notes at the end because you can get actually so much more out of it and yeah I Hope people really left the book um\nIt really was you know it's a labor of love I mean it took us over five years to finish it um and um we hope you know that people appreciate the work and also we'll think more about the creators of not just about the creation", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "25"}
