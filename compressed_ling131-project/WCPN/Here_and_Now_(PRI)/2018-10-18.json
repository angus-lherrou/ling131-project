which is somewhat unusual for inland hurricanes but this is becoming the norm although a lot of places and people realized that they stole it does affect people that deep inland\nAnd when you've got stole all of this magnitude movie as fast as it did held together a lot better yeah and that's why we got such an impact\nWell and the impact included you do I understand your home was hit\nYes it was it was a heavily damaged and pretty much it it it is destroyed the structure stood the house basically over pressurized and blue part I'm aloof often we're hoping to get some some adjusted today\nYou know well I'm Sorry to hear about that but we know you're you're in good company they're just give us ...\nThe damage is it just off the scales that in buildings down almost every tree has been affected snapped off halfway up and it it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that have used to live here and come back so they don't even recognize a town\nWell the county appraiser

pictures that you sent\nA sense that we all we had a\nCrew go out and take a look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures that they were able to look at were severely damaged four hundred plush are completely destroy so you're looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nOr with Gulf Power spokesperson said this isn't to restore that had it's a rebuild the entire electrical grid and we understand is a patchwork of city and a cooperative utilities\nAnd then after big storms in two thousand five and six utilities were told to do more to be turning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for these storms do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do\nI can tell you on a critically but they do an unbelievably awesome and difficult job and they have had very aggressive programs to bring back those trees to upgrade the grid\nAnd I see people putting power lines underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you\nHave done absolutely awesome job upgrading thing\nWhat are some of the issues because I I think we heard in one report that the rising is out\nDoes run the twin towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood is just that was so much debris do they could not get back to ensure the propane types refill for the generator so the generators stopped so they were not transmitting\nLook you've got the personal here but also the professional what do you think should happen a measure to improve communications among the utility companies and another to fund a study on storm response failed in the state legislature twenty Seventeen do you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level\nOf emergency convening on what to do going forward\nWe're looking at an infrastructure this country that is fifty some of it's a hundred years

that that something is happening because of climate change\nI I don't know if it is so much climate change as it is is just a natural process that occurs over the\nYears you don't think this is I mean you're looking at an hour inland from the coast ... a town wiped out and you know every scientist worth their mental saying that uh this is a direct result of warming waters\nAnd and I'm I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me at my level it's not a question of climate change is a question of changing the climate of people getting ready for these things and I could always guarantee you this will change the climate of my community elite attitude of those in this area\nWell uh Rodney and ... and they're in Jackson County in Mariana Florida we wish you the

on Jew or and chew 'em there is a red and you and then there's also a bright green one which is kind of an egg shape\nThey tend to be soft juicy they're great Rob but they hold up to poaching and baking as well and you're going to find as I describe these that\nIt's an incredibly versatile fruit most of all of them can be cooked as well as eaten raw and they are some what if not completely interchangeable how dark brown ones that seem to have a tougher skin\nOkay so that's called an Asian pair and I caught one up for you right there they are very crunchy very tart\nSweet also these are best eaten raw Timmy and Asian pair tastes like a pair and meeting with a water chestnut and it's got that wonderful crunch and a little bit of juicy nests and\nWonderful and salads wonderful graded

my naked as you call them pairs into the syrup and I let them cook for about twenty five to thirty minutes and what happens is the pair releases its juice into the syrup\nAnd the pair than cooks in this week delicious ginger syrup\nIt can be made well ahead of time it keeps in the syrup you can do that for breakfast you could eat that as part of a salad\nBut you certainly could serve that for dessert you don't need whipped cream it's healthy it's light and I think it's so refreshing line right now but the other thing about Paris is that they swing both ways they're savory\nAnd they're also clearly sweet so I made a savory salad that's a little bit different than a normal\nPear salad I took 'em in this case I Believe I use a Bartlett pair might peel debt I put a tiny bit of olive oil salt and pepper on it and I roasted it and little wedges and then I have fresh spinach and fall greens\nAnd I put my roasted pear around it then I took some French bread or baguette toasted in thin

L. in Urbana, Illinois Dick welcome back\nJeremy it's great to be back thank you and you wanted us to start with the menu at from the string quintet in e major this is played by the Smithsonian Chamber Players [noise]\nTune that this was actually made famous by the Nineteen fifty five movie the lady killers about a group of these that rent an apartment from a widow in London and they say they're a string quartet that just want to use the room to practice or this is a song that they play I've heard this and a lot of movies since then tell us about it\nIf anybody has ever said they haven't heard anything of Luigi ... having the day for his peace and in our time it became famous in the Nineteen fifties in that film but I understand that in the late Nineteen century\n... they were arrangements that were made this piece went viral in its time you could say there were range means for\nA Mandel Lynn's for piano for saxophone for ... choir with Latin text added so this piece has been popular will before Nineteen fifty five and the fun thing about the lady killers and the use in the film\nThis is a word that's written for a string quartet to violins viola\nShallow was an additional cello\nNo there is a joke about the film it's either an error in the film or it's an additional joking that these crooks pose as a string quintet with an additional viola and not with a cello somebody should have been on to this guys are walking around without a second child has\nYou know the other film that it's in one of my favorites is ... day off this is what they play when they go into the fancy restaurant in Chicago and try to get in that whether or not supposed to be but it's it's been in a lot or I Want to listen to actually to\nAnother version of the same piece this is the saint Paul chamber orchestra with Bobby McFerrin conducting and on ...\nMm Mm [noise]\n\nYou know when I said Bobby McFerrin on fell 'cause I was waiting to find out what that meant exactly but there you have it he's not singing necessarily but he is a humming along to the to the tin\nBobby McFerrin as being Bobby ... and I think it's a fascinating arrangement of it for our time if you like this piece you should know that Luigi ... wrote over a hundred string Quinn tests this is one simple minuet from one quintet so there's a lot more there to explore\nHe was writing these for the younger brother of the Spanish king dome release and a while he was doing it he was writing string quartets for royalty and playing the additional cello himself so he was doing this so that he could play along with them and then he would also right\nString queen tests for depression king who was a cellist so he had a lot of opportunities to write to string queen tests and string quartets in addition to other cheaper music\nWhat do we know about what influenced book or any who influenced him\nWhile he was a cellist early on he learned the cello he also learn singing his father was a double bass player he and his father were playing in orchestras and he realized city couldn't\nMake a living just by being a cello virtuoso they had to compose music so he began to compose music\nAnd he ends up getting very wealthy patrons who demand a certain kind of music and that seemed to influence his writing chamber music rather than say ... at the time\nWell let's get to another ... and this is the cello\nAnd actually by Jean Louis ...\nWhat you're going to ... or something you have to admire this it's ... on a plane and then they can sure does there's a lot of virtue washed up writing as well and I think those two things\nSort of defined book greedy in many ways he was a virtuoso and wrote parts for a child listed his country or does\nAnd he's also known for having been gifted in writing melodies we kind of wonder if he if he would've ever written more than a couple of operas that he wrote late in his life whether he would have been a great opera composer but here we get both sides of them in in the ...\nOkay now to one of his symphonies this is the symphony number three G. major played by the London Mozart players [noise]\n\nSo one of the things that I hear there is that this was obviously recorded in a big hall which I loved that you can tell that by listening there but what do you hear that tells you something is a book or in a piece\nYou can hear again this gift for ... and he's writing this in a symphony heightened who's writing symphony is at the time it's been suggested that book arena was sued detail oriented that maybe he didn't have\nAn ear for the architecture of a full symphony or if it's funny there's a contemporary book greedy violinist composer ... ... and his famous wind\nThat if the almighty wish to speak through music it would be that of heightened if the almighty wish to listen to music it will be data ... and ... had that gift for melody and had the gift for the detail and you can hear that just in this a portion of the symphony number three by brokering\nWhy do you think then that he is not as well known as Mozart Beethoven Chopin Tchaikovsky and others\nIt could be that most of his music his chamber music\nAnd I would say that the appeal of chamber music is not as great as say the appeal\nFor orchestral music and that's not that he didn't write orchestral music and I think it's becoming a little bit better known but I think compared to those other composers ah there isn't as much of it and I think that's one of the reasons why it's not as popular in our time\nVictor ... who is host of classic mornings and W.
