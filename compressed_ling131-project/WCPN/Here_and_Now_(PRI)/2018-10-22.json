B. U. R. I'm Peter O'Dowd I'm Jeremy hops in each year and now it is Fifteen days before the midterm elections both parties are holding their final pitch to voters\nFor the president that means raising alarm over a so called caravan of migrants headed to the southern us border he blamed Democrats on Twitter today for quote not giving giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nToday Trump heads to Houston to stump for his former political nemesis Senator Ted Cruz\nAnd joining us for the latest as NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson Highmark Hi Jeremy so concerning these migrants first of all who are fleeing violence in their home countries in Central America the president has said that they're criminals this is not the first time migrants have tried to come to the U. S. seeking asylum but it is happening right before the midterms one of the political implications\nOf the political implications are pretty big because this is the president's go to issue and he has really grasped onto the caravan he's even said that the caravan and Kavanaugh will be the two most important things about the midterms\nHe's not only said without evidence that they are criminals he's even said that there are terrorists or he's repeated some of the a commentary on Fox News that they are members of ISIS or al ... somehow\nIn the group of people who are traveling to the border by the way they are about last time I checked there about three thousand miles from the U.S border but he's been saying that Democrats are funding them so this is an issue that he thinks\nEnergize his base it's what he started out when he came down the golden escalator\nArmy and the strength of the economy right now here he is a President Trump speaking to reporters outside air force one on Saturday\n[noise] we'll look it up again a very major tax cuts for middle income people [noise] and if we do that it will be some time just prior I Would say to them [laughter]\nHave major tax guys we're going to be putting in [noise] and are studying very deeply right now around the block a major tax cuts for middle income people\nNow ... Congress has not even in session a right now and November is coming right up ... what do you make of this\nHe's just making it up as he goes along there are no plans to put their congressman session as you said they can't vote on this but he said it's going to be major it's gonna be for middle income people why because the tax cuts that they already passed or not popular Republican stopped they'd ride these the tax cut bill to victory in November\nBut people don't buy it broke RMC polling Republican Party polling has shown that people think the tax cut when mostly to the rich but this is\nWhat President Trump does you know he used to call this truthful hyperbole and some of his books\nYou know he's talked about liberals rioting for sanctuary cities he even talked about how the arms deal to Saudi Arabia he started out saying it would produce forty thousand jobs in America now he says it will produce a million jobs he said Democrats want to give luxury cars to illegal immigrants I mean he's just improvising\nOkay the Democrats do not have a President Trump right now they don't have one leader at the moment but there are a lot of candidates that are running around the country I Want

reaction including from first lady Michelle Obama who had this to say the following month\nLike millions of people across the globe my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping of more than two hundred Nigerian girls from their schools dormitory\nIn the middle of the night\nBut then what happened to those girls some managed to escape right away Twenty one were released in October twenty sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released their stories told the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram\nIt airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha how tired and he said the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram and living in a compound apart from their families and their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't\nIt yeah it was a part of the condition of the access we hosted the kid the access with the government's consent it was the only way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the details about what had happened to the\nGym three is that they held by Boko Haram why am partly a I mean they you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we the girls were released in may we started filming with them and not government safe house in early July\nSo it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks so it was quite rules they um with still processing what had happened\nIs what had happened that we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to but he couldn't be any time we were alone with the girls the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly so it's twofold I think the government will say I wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see that kills time in captivity because they were held a three is the full ... down and they were releasing\nWell what do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like\nWell they they um they was free to speak to his they did give his diaries discreetly it and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't goods that they were forced to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they called us and the full Boko Haram treatment ... ah and in the film what we do is the uh the girls that the book goes who have taken was actually just the tip of the iceberg there were thousands of girls in Nigeria have taken by by her around\nWho are free to speak and they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through them testimony we get a sense of what happened to the to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid ah with\nSomebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a lot of the goals that we interviewed her knowledge and the sound is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry\nNot taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the Gulf felt like they you know we're rights\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it's say she as she says I was two months pregnant or when I ran away and when we first met had like she\nShe did tell us I don't love\nMy baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well er and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have ... have been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay ... has been kidnapped and children but also older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fights\nAnd then when the military engage with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill and arrest or people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching\nHow terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kidnapped but they're just flooded their towns out of fear of book around they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah is functioning I think all the focus has been on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria is just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns and these they call them id Pete\nCould not then the and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even those places like my degree which is kind of a one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous producer safety by numbers on that whether the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you want to live that's why you have to them\nAnd their their outcomes but then a lot of the uh uh loves internally displaced people end up living within the community save\nDespite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped vocal her um but they both have been incredibly welcoming to the number of displaced people who have come to made it very\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they try to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory isn't a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize control the Nigerian military and\nTheir constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night that happened to be the end of Ramadan\nThat was sick suicide attacks in one night and you just never know\nWho to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stopped them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into bits of the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line ... ... you just don't know why this is coming from and where and when I said there's a lot of mistrust [noise]\nWhat about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and try to have a hopeful future\nI ... I think [noise] I'm not less employees because everything has changed my life now and I think in the nation I mean ... [noise]\n[noise]\nDo you see a bright future for some of these girls yes I think uh\nSo that your book girls who are are in a un American universities I dropped the American University in Nigeria which is why oldest but girls who were released a negotiated full and ah the escaped goes who on the nights that to\nThe kid knocking happens so tuned in Seventy six were kidnapped\nFifty seven of them during the long journey on the back of trucks to somebody's very kind of jumped off the back\nAnd half of those have gone straight to this uh University in yoga\nAnd that's where they've been the last three years and they feel positive about life and so the two book goes who have only just started they've done it yet this university I have um we keep in contact with them and they say that while their education is coming on\nAnd I think they realize what a privilege education is so ... ...\nFunding\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

afterward the only way they fought for skin they listen to ... take on French I'm with a five minute we can't we can't say whether you live for this Monday edition sponsored by Google makes all ...\nHere and now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what's going on with the ranking behind us\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that\nAudiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots and they're also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new show\nOn it let's take this first change Fox is calling it the Ninety nine second sixty second breast started be nine sixty second breaks jazz pods jackpots what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which means ... traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually eighty second you're does have got a promo when there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nAnd also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new concept is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block a brand new content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and uh and other Mars candy ... brands\nAnd and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content it's okay\nJust talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSort of financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in volume to advertisers like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain nuts\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much I get so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile\nRide sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThey're also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam date is founder and CEO of the company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSam your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost turned fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car overpopulation by using the cars we already own source that are buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nWhat's your goal I mean do you hope that someday their will\nPersonal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority in that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about the specifics how get around works are right now it's available and what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYeah so you don't arrive you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like to rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you'd pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nA lock the doors and try and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to attack us led to a Porsche people share all sorts of ...\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's ... a which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\n[noise] no we think this is a mass of opportunity this disrupting a trillion dollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access to more of this market gross for all players\n... some of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um costs automotive recently did a survey that said that those companies sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent\nWhat what do you think about that I mean are people really that eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nI don't know the methodology on the talk study um I I certainly know what we've seen in it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen so you know I think\nMoving away from ownership but they can't rely purely an ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of solutions to the marketplace\nSo you believe people really do want to live without a car\nI think if you offered them mobility at an equivalent level as you get today from ownership that's absolutely true you know\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for the money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partner with some some great companies like Toyota ... continue investing those partnerships and expanding our roster partners\nWell speaking of super and Toyota I mean these are companies also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and it's something that we've since day one than sort of very aware of in fact it was a ton of his cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if\nYour car could drive itself would you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and this maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those cars to be used by more people different use cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opens a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace get around or kicking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road I told them to see a goals are here and they're here to stay\nAnd then it would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in a world where for fifty years out in the town of media sort of a mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where\nYou know the cars you know today is different the foreign factors of those cars have changed and you know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be operating in around cities and outside of city in suburban areas\nUm and you know those cards might be self driving but they're fundamentally not you know self cleaning or self maintaining until there's a lot of infrastructure in sort of network function is required to sort of operate those vehicles and that's very close to even what we do today right we help owners\nShare cars efficiently in urban centers across the United states and we work with partners you know who helped service those cars or keep them on line and and continue to operate a\nNetwork and so we see the opportunity there's something that's pretty large\nSam's aid founder and CEO of get around a company that calls itself a community marketplace for sharing underutilized personal vehicle Sam thanks very much at

he is an elite by um you know some recent public polls but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWell and you can has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with eminent as Syria's on Fox News earlier this month\nWe've been over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting with the jerseys of every location in our state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nDespite all of that uh there have been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally nationally he's getting some support\nThe Democrats largely are standing with him um uh you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was however admonished by the Senate for ethics violations so when ... says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to\nAnd what about Bob he's he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAnd at the end of the day is a question about\nWho's judgment you want sitting in the Senate fighting\nBob you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not ties with three times for drugs that those cancer patients politically need\nNow he has blamed insurance companies for some of the cost of the drugs that his former company makes he's called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at ... as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\n[noise] well it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug revel in that they've doubled it in less than a decade you would say that many patients a vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nInsurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up cell gene has also you know uh settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that weren't approved by the FDA\nBut you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied\nRepublican conventions so you know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's a he's a first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump factor compared with ... ethics issues\nYeah you would think a Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about um it keeps coming up in my conversations with people\nBut so do Menendez has ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know ... tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and they're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nIt's been a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election\n[noise] yeah um you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey's pretty pretty reliably democratic and that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years\nNew Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that\nHowever these races do happen um you know New Jersey often does elect a Republican and and and ... them for a long time Republican Congressman Frank little beyond those retiring this year after decades in Congress so\nIt does happen but it's surprising this race it's surprising how close it is because of ... support and the party\nAnd just his popularity and previously\nThat is Joe Hernandez of WHYY talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you you got it\nWell known now that our next story might not be appropriate for all listeners it's estimated that hundreds of thousands of boxes of rape evidence or sitting on shelves at police agencies across the country are waiting DNA testing DNA evidence can help identify sex offenders by matching their DNA with the federal database\nSome state legislatures are trying to reduce the backlog including Washington state but as Anna ... why\nTroll the state's police agency estimates there are between eight thousand and ten thousand rape kits that haven't been tested\nEvery one of those represents a survivor whose\nVoice wasn't her who didn't have justice and also potentially very dangerous offender still on the streets\nThat state representative Tina or wall a few years ago she sponsored a bill that passed the legislature it required that every kid be tested they didn't solve the problem now there's a bottleneck at the state crime lab\nRecently in Seattle and the city of Tom water two cases emerged of men who continued raping women as their DNA sat in the testing cue\nThat's increased the urgency to fix this problem we're looking at how other labs like in Ohio had been able to process them more quickly this year Ohio was able to nearly eliminate its backlog around fourteen thousand rape kit [noise]\nThe crime lab in rural central Ohio the rooms are set up like well equipped high school chemistry labs along narrow corner doors so this again this is the biology lab during the laboratory supervisor Christian flavor stands in front of the rooms glass window on the other side a scientist is testing a rape kit you can see the\nWhite box that's close to the window so with the paper bags rape kits are smaller than a shoe box they're filled with materials and Q tip like swabs of body fluids collected by a nurse after rape\nThat this lab robots help test those samples for DNA these are our robots have names like a vi Ninety seven hundred and key can the robots do three times the work of one scientist their key to the labs efficiency\nSo is another word you might be unfamiliar with ties and sleeper explains that they basically did a hack us on using a Japanese productivity\nWas to examine each step to make it more efficient sleeper says it worked\nIt used to be that it could take a scientist a day an entire day to work a rape kit um and now it can take an hour two hours for them to open it do minimal screening take their notes and cut the samples into tubes and then move it along to the next up\nThe Ohio labs were essential and providing evidence for many sexual assault cases testing the kids helped uncover three hundred a serial rapists and solve over one thousand crimes including the case of lives Garcia\nGarcia was raped at home in Cleveland in two thousand and four\nI was looking in the mirror I was like oh I did a really good job with my here this morning then I noticed that the door was opening so that's when I turned my attention to the door\nA stranger in a ski mask walked in choked her and raped her\nOver a decade later that man is now in prison for life without parole DNA testing helped link came to the rights of Twenty one women Garcia says getting justice helped her move forward\nThose kids sitting on shelves do nothing for us for us women in the process of our healing we have to know whether the assailant has caught we have to get our chance in court to face some\nRape kits in Ohio are tested and out the door in less than a month but in Washington state it can take around a year and a half to test one rape kit gene Johnston is a crime lab manager with the Washington state patrol she says the labs are in a tough spot\nThere's just an increase in the demand for service so it's it's hard to keep pace with that\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed\nAnd that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity when what really shapes and a lot of times is the time that\nSocial media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decided that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\nWell there is certainly awareness or that a lot of times they're spending too much time on their phones they will in their own words often describe themselves as addicted\nBut Ninety five percent of teens um had a smartphone now and it it is become it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to your friends text instantly to want to be the first to post a like a ... and so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but generations ear I Jim is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history\nAnd that's reflected in these big um service that I work with where they're asked about um their experiences with um people from different backgrounds so say high school students of course because the high schools they go to a more diverse much more likely to um have friends of other races and ethnicities too you know hang out with people from different backgrounds\nThat's definitely more common among ige and then it was just say ten years ago with the millennials\nWe mentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy has shaped this generation\nWell\nThat's hard to tell from the the data that we have because um you know foreign policy arguably it's changed the most in the last few years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\nTrue um but because there's not a draft for that\nThen they have to the millennials for example [noise]\nYeah they they do have to market to this generation differently because there's this such that big a generational shift I think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as\nI Jen is really interested in safety is not something you usually associate with teens and young adults but in their conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors\nYou're very interested in physical safety and what they call emotional safety and I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on\nAnd um I think is well that there's a lot more awareness around stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing as another theme um with this group\nSo we're just a a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections do you think that many of these potential voters will actually vote Generation Z people\n[noise] I Wish I could say yes I'm\nBud statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government in voting are not encouraging\nSo in these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to say they're interested in government or social issues or politics Dan teams were say Twenty years ago what do you think so um well I mean because there's so many other things to do\nThere's always the possibility of a you know something new to see on I'm On social media or a new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix and you know I think some ... some of the interviews that I did a lot of teens\nYou know say well you know we have all these other things to do while we pay attention to the news I only do that if I have to do that for a class was very common response that I heard\n... interesting I mean I've had some many conversation\nPhones their mobile devices the Internet in general um but they're also often really smart I I'm quite impressed sometimes when I speak with them\nOh absolutely they're definitely smart I mean they've they've had access to all of this information and um they're they're quick thinkers on there's actually data showing that IQ has has gone up over the generations so I think yeah smarts is is definitely not the issue\nSo obviously a generation Z is going to have to deal with some of these problems on their own as they get older and and and even right now what can those of us in the other generations due to to assist in any way with some of the problems of this generation\n[noise] well I think we do need to be aware on just how severe um the mental health crisis is right now among teens and young adults so there's a little awareness around that but not half as much as the as there should be that we're seeing unprecedented levels of depression\nAnd self harm a among teens and young adults now and we need to have more resources and more awareness of that causes behind that and then more funding and awareness for treatment\nIs Jean ... who is professor of psychology at
