seeing\nIt's extremely dark here but there are a few street lamps on most of the houses appear to be deserted\nVery few lights are on um gas stations are indeed open there are lines but earlier\nThat kind of harried jammed crush that's just not there I also saw earth movers for the first time at the Roma yawn a shopping mall you remember that was this huge shopping mall that was destroyed in the disaster but I have to say Rob and there is no mass government mobilization\nOne week later that is absent this is a do it yourself affair of full of good Samaritans\nYeah and and in the areas that have been devastated I mean the pictures just ... you know we almost get numb to these pictures of toppled homes and buckle roads and smashed cars in body bags um but you know what how do you take that and\nYou know you take it in with personal stories of people\nYou take it in with the man who sits and described to you and he's had with a far off looking as I\nUm this complete conflict that he has inside his his self that he ... that that he survived but at what cost he kept saying things like it you you may think we were selfish when we just ran\nUm because their loved ones were left behind in in in his case he left a father behind he said he was he was praying in his house he said we had seconds to to get out um and\nIt's you know in some ways it's it's so serendipitous in miraculous that people survive these these sorts of events because this this uh sue nominee is coming at them like a locomotive and it's just building steam and it's building height and so I think it's a the personal stories um\nOf of people who whose lives are completely shattered you know there are a thousands tens of thousands of people whose livelihood has been destroyed the economics of the city robbing are simply not an up and going concern right now and the vice president said it's going to take two years for that to happen\nI think by the look of it it will take much longer\nBut you know this question but what does it look like there are you you you would be\nForgiven if you drove through and thought or some areas the Joe Joe through some areas and said well there are there what could possibly have gone wrong here and other areas that are completely\nOn on recognizable\nFor example a church moved an entire over and over a mile it was moved by the churning earth below it in one area I'm ...\nA vast expanse set on swamp land it must be said\nWas part of this churning of the earth someone called that said the ground was like a blender the earthquake was like a blender just\nGobbling up houses and its weight they don't know how many people are are are are lying beneath that that mountain mountain of mud is what I saw and so that\nWill take a long time to to on earth and they don't have the equipment here to do it yet and that is part of the mystery of this place I mean it's really not knowing how many people\nWe know a French rescuers were very frustrated they thought that with their equipment they heard signs of life under a four star hotel the collapse now they're\nGovernment response so yeah long term recovery but what about you know tomorrow to people have food do they have water\nThey don't have food they don't have water there are scrounging for it and they're begging borrowing it\nOn there are people coming in from the outside driving for hours

Julie thank you so much\nThank you Robin well the United states is not the only country dealing with political polarization Sunday's election in Brazil is expected to be the country's most polarized vote in decades\nThere's widespread distrust among the electric because a record number of lawmakers have been caught up in a massive corruption scandal polls show that's driving voters too far left and far right candidate joining us now from Rio de Janeiro is Tim Franks of the BBC Tim\nOr what's at stake in this election in Brazil\nFor other people do say that democracy is at stake and the reason they will say that particularly opponents of the man who is leading the presidential campaign including the opinion polls they said because he ... he's All right\nThe Democratic norms a painting Brazil's and this is just says he is remember from when there was a middle tree dictatorship here so will vote democracy is vibrancy in this country\nThat people don't take it for granted equally supporters of Mr both and already said that they are the ones who are going to rescue Brazil's from the clutches\nOf the people who have been responsible for a surge in crime a surge in corruption and the worst recession that the country has ever experience so they say that you know Brazil is on the multiple threats\nIf the less catchy and hence Europe's the rights to about ... but also the language people use about what is at stake in this election could not be more fruits\nAnd we should also remember that two of the last few presidents out one of them is in jail right now the other was forced out of office\nAnd that is ... under depends a lot of the opposition to the main challenger civics fall right presidential candidate because the work is policy the P. T. to give it it's a\nPortuguese accident they would impact two thousand and two ... two thousand and sixteen\nAnd I only watch\nThe largest corruption scandal that Brazil is ever seen and and in fact his mash much of Latin America at two groups\nAnd Lula presidents of messier Lula da Silva who was a two term president of Brazil or the ... she had been hyping feels him as a candidate in this election but he was sentenced to twelve years in jail for corruption at either tia and so they put up to this other man for them to a dodgy who come patch\nThe second to the opinion polls at the moment but he's funny difficult to punch through against the the brush populism of ...\nOr people excited about this election or some people not even going to bother to vote because of all this\nOther thing is either to be honest I think people are only tens of hooks about this election and I think a lot of people are feeling [noise]\n... ... ... she is a state so having the rise of the choices facing them but they really have to choose it's apathy\nIsn't isn't an option and I think one of the key things that you have to remember here is that\nAlthough an awful lot of people do feel there's ... is\n... racist homophobic a man who in the past two to warmly about dictatorship or even about those who tortured and killed for the state's loss of people\nFeel very strongly that the workers policy has headaches shops in Brazil and on their watch corruption crime and recession has been the result so even though there will be plenty of people who feel that Mr personality doesn't speak for

the Labor Department which also reported today that us employers added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs last month\nMichael Reagan and senior editor at Bloomberg News he joins us now Mike Hi Germany will start with the number of jobs added a hundred and thirty four thousand that was actually below expectations but continues a long long long streak of job growth tell us more about what we learned in the report today well right as you\nMentioned it was below estimates are the economists in ah the Bloomberg survey had forecast about a hundred and eighty five thousand jobs so yeah this is about fifty thousand below that but it's a very tough month\nTo get right because of Hurricane Florence um ... you know a lot of companies\nThat might have been planning to hire would postpone it and a lot of companies were just you know more or less laying people off temporarily because of the weather so they're actually about three hundred thousand people are away from work to do the bad weather\nSo it's you know most economists are kind of looking past that disappointment in the number of jobs added due to the weather [noise] um and it just assuming that the same trends we've seen of of pretty healthy job growth a is still intact\nAnd what about that unemployment rate the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nAbsolutely and uh you know a Larry Kudlow today saying he he wouldn't be surprised to see it go even further\nSince two thousand and ten a the the nation is out of jobs every single month Ninety six months straight um and it just does not show any signs of slowing down at the moment\nWhen we were just talking this week about the fact that companies are having a hard time finding seasonal workers for the holidays because the unemployment rate is so low people are able to get\nJobs I this is totally anecdotal but I was at a coffee shop this morning huge line not nearly enough people are are ... are we at the point now where the issue is that companies just can't find enough people that want the jobs\nI you know to to give you an addict out of my own I just noticed that a lot of my friends nannies are are quitting\nBecause the employment prospects for them or are good so what does it all sort of\nAdds up to this notion that the employment market is very strong now uh it's still not doing what a lot of people were afraid it would do is which is overheat the economy and cause wages to accelerate aggressively um that's not quite the case yet\nUm but it's it by all accounts of very very strong job market\nWhat did we learn today about wages\nSo they continued to increase the year every year a gain in average hourly hourly earnings was about two point eight percent I'm so nice gain but again not so strong that it makes you worry about in overheating of the economy that would start to\nA turn things the other way cause corporate profit margins to to shrink and that sort of thing it's still ... steady as she goes uh considering the trends we saw a first for many years now uh back back through the uh beginning of the recovery from the recession\nWas going to be interesting to see how the Federal Reserve takes this news and we're already up to a to into court two to two and a quarter percent interest rate on the federal funds rate will see Mike we're going to Bloomberg News thank you\nGerman temp is touting\nTo Wade into one of the most hotly contested congressional races in the country for an open seat in Minnesota's first\nThere's supposed to be Democrats thing\nI don't I don't think\nVery surprised\nThat the whole thing that surprises at the Republican\nJim how you doing wins he's facing the Democrat Dan ... both are vying to fill a seat left open by democratic representative Tim Walz who's running for governor\nSo that district is where we turn to this week's district profile cats and Richard is senior reporter for Minnesota Public radio she joined us from Rochester and cats are in uh Minnesota went for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen\nBut the first district went for President Trump's so tell us more about the district itself well it's kind of a funny district if you look\nAt it in the long picture um it's been traditionally conservative and Republican it's very rural so there's a lot of you know smaller agricultural communities and the district outside of Rochester in Maine Kato which are sort of the city hopes\nThat being said during the Obama administration Tim Walz won his reelection pretty handily up until twenty six team when he was almost defeated by Republican Jim Hackett orange and of course the district went handily for president Donald Trump at the time\nRight well so let's take a look at the two candidates the Democrat and the and worked in the Obama administration he's an Iraq War vet a member of the Democratic farmer labor party which is aligned the Democrats and industries an ad he built himself as an independent voice\nIn the army you can put any differences aside and come together accomplishing a great thing and that's exactly what the Congress today\nI'm not taking over ... ... ... nothing leader corporation\nCats are Mitch or tell us more about seeing [noise] well I think the first\nDidn't Minnesota since he was a teenager actually and his opponents are frequently point that out so he's moved back to the districts are run\n'em I think what you're hearing there is his willingness to work across the aisle which is really important in this district which you know and the best case for Democrats as a moderate district and you know so you hear him running a pretty moderate campaign and it's really an echo two of the types of campaigns that Tim Walz around here\n... the Republican Jim had the door and his reason add he talks about growing up on a farm in Minnesota doing a lot of reading which of course he brings to his thoughts on Washington\nWashington ... government are so certain rather than a truck pulled from the\nCar with the health and rip out the regulations for Obamacare ...\nCatherine we hear him aligning themselves with President Trump what's the thought on that\nWell he's done aligning himself with trumps views before Trump was really even on the scene remember he's run for three times for the seat so he has been running on a very similar platform for far longer than ... has been you know campaigning\nUm and I think that plays well with certain aspects of the district and ... it's playing very well this time because of the fact that the district favor Donald Trump in the last election\nI think that things to know about ... joined that are interesting or that his dad actually held the seat and so he moved to Washington DC when he was a teenager\nAnd lived there for a long time and actually worked there for a long time so just like his opponent Dan fee and he has lived outside of the district for quite awhile worked in various administrations worked on Capitol Hill and has more recently come back to the districts to run again these last three times\nSo those are the two candidates cats around they ask you about another thing the president said last night that jumped out he really distance for Minnesota senator ... Franken four in the president's ah words kind of quitting after Frank and was accused of inappropriate\nOf politics would the president seemed to be saying he was kind of a a coward for that\nYeah it was it was an interesting point that he made and I'm Still sort of sorting through what he was getting out because on one hand he said you know Franken was kind of a wet rag he he took responsibility for what he was doing and he left office of course under great pressure from his own party let's not forget that\nAnd this has been set against the backdrop of what's happening in Washington did today which is this you know big discussion about whether judge Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court and whether I'm he is taking responsibility for his actions\nBut of course keep in mind that when Frank and laughed we you know the governor here appointed a Democrat to take his place who's now running for reelection and it's effectively opened up a potential seat for Republicans so on one hand he's criticizing it seemed Franken for leaving so quickly but on the other hand it's presented in opportunity for his heart most fascinating\nBut how is the whole cabinet debate impacting if it is this race or is it just falling along party lines\n[noise] you know I think generally it's falling along party lines when I spoke to people who are waiting to get into the rally yesterday this is something I asked them about all of them said you know we want him to talk about judge Kavanaugh we support judge Kavanaugh\nBut it was sort of weird was that people said you know we believe that something bad happens to you Dr Christine Blasey Ford so many years ago we just don't think it was him because he doesn't seem like the type of person who would do that uh they called it a witch hunt they said that you know that she knew she may be missed remembering", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "05"}
