to scan the political rise in in the next few minutes but we're going to start the checking on the race for governor in the state of Alaska it was a three way race until October nineteenth just weeks before election day Governor Bill Walker and independent said this at the Alaska federation of NATO\nThat give today I after spending like campaign [noise]\nFor the re election as governor\nAnd the time remaining become clear we cannot win a three way race\nWill walk them through his support behind the Democratic candidate former U.S Senator Mark Begich who was trailing in the polls behind the Republican\nFormer state senator mark done lady and now that race has tightened political rights that Republicans insurance chance to pick up a governorship on Tuesday has suddenly turned into the weirdest least predictable campaign in the country and to catch him in as a state government and politics reporter at Katy oh and Alaska Public media\nHi Andrew Hi Robyn so if you're going to have a weird race let it be the weirdest and this sounds like it and just take us back a second because the sitting Governor Bill Walker is running mate who was his ...\nOver in inappropriate comment to an unnamed woman did that for anything to do with why I'm Governor Walker's stepped down or was it simply because as he said he felt he couldn't win and if the if the way race and he wanted to throw his support behind the Democrat\nHe really stopped because of the My Lai issue both he and baggage all along have one in one or the other they both of one of the other to drop out um they're pretty similar on the issues there are some differences on social issues but walkers really downplayed social issues as governor and has really focused on\nEconomic and non social issues so in practical terms there wasn't a lot of difference between the two of them and they were pretty evenly splitting the non Republican vote\nYeah but then when mullah made that comment it seemed to be um the time to make an exit look or just after Walker left the race in Alaska survey research full had done levy the Republican up only four points than higher so uh talk about how this race has changed\n[noise] yeah so a challenge for baggage is Walker's name is still on the ballot even though he suspended his campaign it happened after the withdrawal deadline and there isn't a lot of precedence for having an incumbent governor name on the ballot\nAnd then not campaigning so as you could imagine if you get five percent if he gets ten percent that's largely going to be votes coming out of\nBaggage is likely voters an enemy get the votes just because people either aren't informed about the latest news or they really like Walker and they don't like the other two names on the ballot\nYeah well so that they again that's what makes this so weird is that they could still could look really good in the polls but ah we'll have to wait till we get out the other side of November six to see what people actually did\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

issues into one yes or no question Danny Rivera of W ELL RN explains\nIf you live in Florida on election day you'll get the option to ban offshore drilling and also been vaping in the workplace\nOr you can vote to change the state college system and also give more deaths benefits to the families of first responders and members of the military these two items on the November ballot or the product of the Florida Constitution revision commission\nAnd the voter has to make a terrible choice\nEllen freedom was on the rivers and commission Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight\nDo I vote for the thing I don't like in order to get the thing I Do like and that's just not fair and not acceptable\nI think that what the constitution and vision commission did is it packed things that they thought would be popular along with things that they really wanted but so I wouldn't be popular\nThat's held Broward County is top administrator Bertha Henry sees it to particularly on a question that would do three things at once mandate a State Department of veteran affairs mandate estate anti terrorism office and something Henry is not happy with force every county to have five elected government officials including sheriff in supervisor of elections\nThe amendment that's on the agenda it's sandwiched in between motherhood and apple pie\nThe commission has been putting seemingly unrelated questions together on the ballot since it was first formed or Nineteen Seventy eight but the way freedom and some legal experts at this time is different Twenty years ago the decision about who would be on the commission came from a mix of Democrats and Republicans that men in almost even split between the two parties says Ellen Frieden\nAnything that got passed through that constitution revision commission had\nIsn't level but this year every appointment was made by Republicans are Republican appointed officials and that can make things look political even if they're not\n... as was on this year's commission on a committee that helped write the language voters will see she says politics were not at play just plain logic\nSo when we first started meeting we all came to the table with ideas of how things might be grouped and everything really had in a somewhat of an access or natural connection\nGame is offers the example of amendment nine which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work\nBut if you look at it from a let's make our environment more friendly and and and protect our state and protect our citizens\nI think that you can kind of see why they would have fit together I Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group beams and my voting record would speak to that but for the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that it just it made sense\n... says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission want it to stop voter fatigue\nJust make the shorter an easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the floor of the constitution the title and the summary of the amendment needs to be clearly understood by voters Timothy McClintock is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat it needs to clearly state chief purpose it needs to be comprehensible and so the more you unfold some different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled amendment was not clear enough for voters there was about charter schools and it didn't use the phrase charter schools so that was removed from the ballot three other amendments were in jeopardy of being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would stick\nBut the legal filing that was used to make that argument was the improper vehicle Justice Party and they had to where it's where people looking at these questions on the ballot voters be where for here and now I'm Danny Rivera in Miami whether you're a voter\nIn Florida or another state you may also have ballot measures to weigh in on on election day this year there are a hundred and fifty five statewide ballot measures in thirty seven states sixty four of them are citizen led initiatives\nThere an example of direct democracy letting voters rather than legislatures decide policies and laws joining us now is Josh all tick who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PDF Josh welcome\nYeah it's good to be here thank you and how does the number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other\nYears overall the total number if they would measure is has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgence specifically in citizen initiated measures measures they get on the ballot through a signature petition signed by registered voters\nAnd in those citizen initiated ballot measures if they get past do they become law or is it something that just gets referred to the legislature to make a decision about\nThose have gone to the ballot for final approval from the voters on there a couple of exceptions for example in Nevada there was a measure that has to get approved again and twenty twenty if it passes and twenty Eighteen um but these measures are going to the voters and voters have the last say on them\nSo what kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with elections and voting\nYeah that's one of the the biggest trends are seeing in twenty Eighteen or things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting marijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years has been a trend and it's sort of continuing this year\nI other election policies related measures things like voting requirements\nDifficult is it to get some of these initiatives onto the ballot\nThe process varies by state the number of senators required as usually based on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number varies from a little over Thirteen thousand a small state like North Dakota to over half a million in California this year\nThe costs on average was a million dollars a little over a million dollars and twenty Eighteen for these initiatives\nAnd so does that mean that it is mostly big organizations who get behind these things and get them on the ballot or it could have just be Jane Q voter\nThere are a few sort of really true grassroots volunteer efforts but for the most part if these things are crossing over a million dollars either have to have a rich individual and industry or a special group but a national interest group that's behind you to provide the funding to get these on about\nI can imagine that in some cases state legislators would be happy that something is put to the voters so they don't have to make the call themselves and in other cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands\nYet in general implicit in the initiative process as a conflict between citizens or are registered voters and the legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as\nA sort of a method of last resort if they're not getting what they want done in the legislature and they see an opportunity that voters might approve a policy that the legislature has either not acted on or has opposed um but there's always some exceptions that prove that rule and there are cases where\nPolitically connected people go to the initiative process and that could be for for a variety of reasons but for the most part the citizen initiative process of used when the policies are being approved and the legislature\nNow sometimes the voters decide on something and then the state uh either dragged its feet or decide that doesn't want to go through with it or in Maine last year sixty percent of voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid\nOver it or how often does that kind of thing happen as you see the initiative process habits resurgent so as you see more initiative you see the number of instances where that conflict I was talking about implicit boils to the surface\nThe response to twenty six the initiatives was\nIn many cases to either repeal or I'm changing the initiatives if possible in some states allow that some don't\nOr to pass restrictions on the process and then the sort of a third response we've seen is an effort to compromise and twenty eight team with an issue proponents instead of\nLetting it go to the ballot and letting it be the sort of hard battle trying to find some sort of deal they can make where an issue opponents withdraw and the policies still gets at least some sort of advancement if it's not the full effort that they should probably want it what\nIs the thought about how useful a ballot questions are\nDirect democracy is is really important in the u._s. um every state but Delaware it's a forty nine states require voters to ratify constitutional amendments\nSo even if the legislature puts it on the ballot the voters still have to vote on it the question really comes down to and the argument is about citizen initiated measures where you know an industry or a corporation or an out of state interest or grassroots volunteer efforts can put a measure on the ballot by collecting a certain number of signatures\nOnly twenty six states have any process that's similar to that\nOne of the most common argument in opposition to this year is out of state interests

national security editor Phil Ewing joins us now feel this is weird though what do we know so far about this story\nIt's a very weird story it if it's a hoax that appears to be a hoax within a hoax so

false charges against Muller and what may be the cases that woman actually\nDoes not exist and that those false charges were in fact false charges about false charges what isn't clear is whether this was intended to embarrass the special counsel's office or just to embarrass the journalists who had been sent this email as they try to investigative report\nOn it or is it possible that these living 'cause I Want to be clear this woman was trying to alert um did that neither was to that she was trying to alert Miller's office that someone was trying to take him down\nWe're not aware of any contact but between the women involved here in a special counsel's office that it's all been done through journalist intermediaries and they've reached out to the special counsel's office to ask about this and when it became aware of those uh outreach attempts then that's what it refers to the FBI and\nWell there are two conservative media personalities capable and jak Berkman who I said to be linked to the story to tell us more about that\nThat's right wall is the young man who writes for the website gateway pundit\nBerkman has a show on Newsmax TV which is owned by President Trump's friends supporter Chris Ruddy and what they've said is the special counsel investigation is itself a hoax that it's illegal and that it's unfounded\nAnd they want to expose what they call the crimes or the finality involving the special counsel's office and mullet himself and that is the background for these accusations or a legit accusations this week in votes\nOn gateway pundit yesterday Tuesday in the form of a so called intelligent ... intelligence report that was linked to a so called a intelligence agency which in its way was kind of a parody of the Steele dossier a which by the way is partly unverified ah because no one knows which things in it a true in which things are not\nAnd it became clear to people looking at this on line that this alleged intelligence agency was made up of a series of suspicious linked in pages and the profile pictures of the people who had those pages where people like actors or models not real human beings\nOkay well now my head is officially exploded and we have about less than a minute left so our ... is the speculation that these conservative personalities might have been behind paying these women to say something about ... I mean what what what is the possibility here\nThere may never have been any women at all and those are payments are those accusations were themselves just a trap\nTo try to get reporters to talk about them or none of that is clear however we do know the special counsel's office has has asked the FBI to get to the bottom of this and if it doesn't there are criminal charges or there is some kind of report from the FBI we may learn what the real story was that was taking place\n... in other words if somebody was masking masquerading as a woman saying that there was sexual misconduct allegations about mother and she was with the money and exact and someone had made that up\nThey would be in trouble NPR national security editor Phil Ewing in Washington we will follow this thank you thank you\nWell know email earlier this month a federal judge in California block the Trump administration's plans to end the temporary protected status TPS for immigrants from Sudan El Salvador Haiti in Nicaragua\nThat ruling men that an estimated three hundred thousand immigrants didn't have to have an immediate threat of deportation but many of them had lived there are already turned upside down during the ... plus months when they believe they have\nThe war torn country but she left for other reasons of fears of her personal safety and until a few weeks ago was prepared to lose her temporary protected status on November second which had been the deadline\nShe joined us in the studio welcome thank you for having me and how long have you lived in the U.

yesterday at this point and I admit that I'm wrong about nine later on anyway so the answer is not changing it would ruin the say it would ruin it to make it more accurate yep\nWell now those emails have been turned into the Broadway play lifespan of a fact with powerhouse actors body kind of al as writer John D'Agata Harry Potter I mean Daniel Radcliffe as fact checker Jim single and cherry Jones as an editor referee the to\nThe seven years of fact finding has been condensed into twenty four hours in which the three are trapped in an apartment like caged cougars\nBattling sometimes physically over the meaning of fact as a deadline looms which side will win will editor cherry Jones publish it you know find out [noise]\n\nWe met up backstage was all three before recent matinee\nAs veterans of the stage can you feel what we felt in the audience last night people on the edge of their seat it's like I I don't want to try to outdo the critics here with describing this but I came up with a pistol Larry ... yeah thank you it feels like we're at almost a fight or a or a debate\nYeah I mean first of all I have to have I just have to take him on me I'm just really acknowledge the I just was referred to as a veteran actor in the company they do for the first time ...\nAnd yeah I mean I I've never done a play before the housing argument at the center of it to feel that going backwards and forwards every night is really special unlike some nights\nI'll feel the audience finding me particularly irritating it is a moment and some of gyms ... like make the audience go oh this guy's being ridiculous but actually like the ... in in in my head they all know ridiculous to told I find like as far as you up to go okay I have to I have to try and win this even more\nDo you feel that because there was a guy behind me last night I don't know if you guys could hear that he kept going yeah we did\nBe the biggest events of the characters on stages lives in a sense and I think it works best when the three of us are fighting for it with all our lives\nThe cherry explain your character because the character isn't in the book but there is an editor\nWell it's funny because Jim single engine to God who we've been seeing a lot of 'cause they've come to the show many times in fact last night when I said the first line of the play is Okay Jim single I heard people actually left\nAnd it was when I left the theater last night Jim single was standing there with thirty literally thirty of his relatives\nWho've flown in from all over the country and and I when I opened the books at which they kind of gave us for opening night Jim's comment was man we could use to use\nYour character as this sort of what the soul of the argument\nI don't know if it's a ... she's the soul of the argument but she's the one who has to make the decision and she's so desperately wants to publish it because she really thinks it will help at this moment in time\nBut at the same time she is a journalist and Dana damn it every night is I come down to the moment is to play were decision has to be made\nYou and your character have not made up their mind\nUntil the moment I reach for the phone wow it's who convinces me I'm going to soften you if you publish Eleanor every night now the ... that's going to be called a ... D briefing\nBringing money [laughter] or physical wrote in my book thanks for having John's back\nOh I can talk about that when your character John to God I was saying things like yeah there are thirty one strip clubs that thirty four is a better number so I like that number my head was exploding you can't do that it's bad for all journalism whether it's an essay or news\nFor me to the nursery out a piece of writing in the newspaper\nWritten and that's it you know what would you say about the Greek histories what would you say about in cold blood\nI Would say Daniel you're smiling Daniels character gym would say if it's thirty one strip clubs you can't make it thirty for it because you like the way that number's sounds you've obviously to say you can't just not a bad guy we're in real life cycle\nThat guy anyway he's just he's a writer in order to\nSave your life he he has said that the real writer has said oh my God I'm like the devil spawn does some\nPeople just destroyed them then they continue to do so um I don't think it's fair joined does it work for the Washington Post he was not writing articles for writing articles ...\nNew York times he's ... he's a looming eating the lives of people who normally would never be written about that follows it a long line of tradition why all of a sudden because we're in such a controversial time we're going to just say all these artists you can't do that anymore\nBut that brings us to present day and you're all aware that there's a moment in the play where bother your character John ... has a line and most of the lines of straight out of the real life interactions\nAnd there's a whole world effects to choose from the wrong stocks getting the way of the story\nAnd you attach a says the wrong size what does that mean exactly\nWhat you got to be aware that we have a presidential health person Kellyanne Conway who spoke of alternative facts are not ...\nIt's interesting because there is a beautiful speech about the importance of facts and democracy and\nIt frequently gets applause the argument is basically that if you were reading something or watching something and you find even one thing to be untrue and at the whole thing can for the policy you and your trust in your relationship without saying\nYou know there's one point in the play where it would debating about the length of time this person fell for it and that's one of those moments of the audience is kind of going oh come on clearly you are going to follow this you know the difference of math as you go to Jim\nWants to publish this essay he is convinced that by making it through a you will also make it more beautiful inherently\nYeah but it is irritating certain play Jim singles\nWhy is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case about picking your battles he becomes more and more entrenched as the argument between him and joined gets more intense you'd\nDo both become the divided United States in a way and you know over this issue of facts and cherry again there you are in the middle talked about the physicality on the stage I mean there's there's heat up there\nThere is and in fact I left a little more heat happening last night I was slow on an entrance is\nAt a strangling each yes I was really no winning that's like [laughter] I saw the U.S strongly dinner\nYeah it does go to those extremes because these two men care so much and it is in that sense where we are as a nation right now of of what facts mean to I hate to say the either side and I just can't believe we're talking about our country that way but\nThen you you actually got a taste of that she went to the New Yorker and you were in fact checker for a day barely hands shaking on your red and when you made a call you had to call the restaurant tour after someone wrote a review so you had to check the description of the food and\nAs I was doing I was like well I guess every ingredient mentioned as a fact so I'm just going to have to also came about every single ingredient as mentioned it and I only missed one they were ready to higher among the ... with us very gone yeah just the fact you miss [noise]\nRemember now and it was that S. on restaurant Oh yes yes I didn't underlying restaurants which I should have because I should've checked if it was in fact plural anyhow top two previous restaurants or one previous restaurant\nI have to ask you all are actors you've all been written about do you come away from this play feeling better about the press more fight\nListen see with your eyes as much as you possibly can and these days and then check and fact check\nShannon posters Smith printing posters on wrinkle resistant fold double fabric that transports flat for conference presentations poster Smith provides a service to research communities worldwide learn more posters Smith dot com\nAnd NPR and MORNING EDITION on this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis this year and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures I ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven\nOut of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that they are an itemized because one state the brass guy does not have the house and Senate they only have one a chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why are Republicans so dominant at the state level\nWill will with the straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they've earned candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms um and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd an four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both the legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\n[noise] will they run on issues like\nWas around abortion rights and things like that I'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on implementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on taxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and a and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education\nPublic safety health care at a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level and so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw the maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans in edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct and in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of a group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines and in most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape in the states is that they had\nA very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten which meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that\nAnd um and so they drew lines that were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade but yes the the twenty twenty cents is right around the corner and this is kind of the first election to tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eighth of the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nAll right Jeremy that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled in less than a week from now\nWe are governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday and you know that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policy making in the next legislative sessions in two thousand and Twenty one but I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impact throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what are things looking like this year or what are the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of these state houses\n... from the very beginning we knew that this would be that a democratic opportunity year they would have the wind up their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans\nOn for a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of all legislative seats and as you pointed out um almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country so they're sort of in a tough position where they're basically playing defense around the country\nAnd there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics as you'll find anywhere which is\nIt since Nineteen hundred so going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party in the White House loses seats in state legislatures in twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats in legislatures as well as in the U.S house\nAnd it looks like that's where it's going to head this time the Democrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years um they have raised a tremendous amount of money unprecedented amount of money that they're putting into\nLegislative campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting hard for the uh the majorities that they have in ... and states and legislatures but um but it's really the the Democrats who you know sort of have the momentum\nWhen we've been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised although maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote for either a Democrat or\nThis end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or if they're a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know widely broadcast the TV ads and some of these legislative races\nBut you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year and despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and\nAnd a criminal justice crime and punishment on health care on immigration on the environment I'm very few people know who their state legislature who are is and and who those candidates are in fact it's less than Fifteen Percent so it's ... it's it's you know probably not much better for the U.S house\nUm so you know we would encourage people these races are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do\nAnd um and then to your point it then it does sort of turned into something of a referendum on the parties\nAnd one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\nSo give us an example of a state house race or that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake\nWell there there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear just a ... a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota\nAnd Colorado in Minnesota there's one special elections and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican um there's a race for governor so that that's also on the ... so um [noise]\nYou know this one race which has had seen close to a million dollars in campaigning it's a heavily Republican district but if it goes one way or the other you know that party will control how much do the ...\nWhat this person to when we want that person to win\nMore than ever so particularly on the Democratic side the Democrats learned from getting show lack in two thousand ten and by the way that was Brock Obama's where we got shellacking down ballot in these legislative races and of course they paid the price because of the redistricting advantage Republicans had\nSo in this cycle predict on the Democratic side and they have really ramped up their fundraising and their distribution and the sophistication of how they spend that money how they do\nUm you know sort of a voter registration projects um get out the vote projects the proverbial ground game but also big time outside TV buys um you know things you would see in congressional races you now see\nFairly commonly in pivotal state legislative races and that is being supported heavily by national party operations and so it's not just the Democrats they've just increased fairly substantially from where they were just a few years ago they are now paying a lot more attention\nTo the state races but both parties are going all in on these races\nYou said President Obama said ... I remember President George W. Bush called the law says that he faced a thumping I think maybe it's now or something that the president has to do is come up with a word or for that first midterm election if it doesn't go out for their part yeah [laughter]\nYeah that's a great that's a great point that you know if the Republicans I'm really take it on the channel and it turns into a a really bad night or a large a democratic night um then yeah they'll have to get creative get the word Smith is a generating\nThe dismal words that are whose analogous with Simon Cho lacking [noise] Tim storey director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures thank you so much [noise] oh my pleasure thank you for having me on [noise] I'm doubting the word will be trumping", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "31"}
