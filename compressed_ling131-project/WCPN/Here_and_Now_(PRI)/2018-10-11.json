again I'm Jeremy hops and it's here and now the devastation left by what was hurricane Michael he's becoming more clear today the storm has killed at least two people\nA man and Florida and an eleven year old girl in Georgia and for some the danger is not over here's FEMA administrator block Brock Long\nRight now the focus is truly on life safety uh and making sure that uh we're helping people who may be trapped and are pushing through and doing damage assessments to make sure that we fully understand where we need to coordinate our response efforts\nJoining us now is Jeff Hoffman chief meteorologist with the Florida public radio emergency network Jeff whereas Michael today\nAre Jeremy Michael's moving into the uh North Carolina region it has quickly moved to South Carolina this morning and over the next few hours from the heaviest rain from this will be near the Raleigh Durham area Fayetteville Greenville North Carolina the center that storm passing near Charlotte still a tropical storm and likely will stay officially a tropical storm all the way to the coast there at the mid Atlantic states\nWith wins in the forty to fifty miles per hour range and some heavy rain\nWell and as Michael passes over the Carolinas this is the area that was already hit by Hurricane Florence what are the concerns there\nThe heaviest rain from this thankfully is a a little more located further inland into the mid state of upstate region still very heavy rain flash flooding concern big time in the hill country but it is moving quickly us so Jeremy that it's going to mitigate the flood risk they're still going to be some runoff rivers that were of course are at their craft stuff\nQuickly and what about further up in the northeast\nWell we have to watch out for tornadoes as a tornado watch in effect for eastern portions of North Carolina southeastern portions of Virginia 'til nine o'clock tonight I Believe\nAnd that risk will continue up into uh uh the Delmarva area this will become a nor'easter so there's going to be some coastal impact in New England or the center of this do should stay just offshore but I certainly of this will be a far reaching storm all the way up into the coastal regions of New York in Massachusetts and up in the main even\nA Michael at its strongest point was a category for hurricane with a hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds very close to a category five this is the same a wind speed that we saw with Hurricane Maria when it hit Puerto Rico one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the U.S mainland how did that happen\nVery warm water on the Gulf of Mexico very light winds aloft a this has been a season where conditions in the central Atlantic have not been particularly favorable for tropical development but it's just a goes to show it doesn't really matter where a storm forms as long as the conditions near an over it at the time\nOr can allow it to develop a it will develop very quickly um and yeah it is the intensity and the pressure was lower than Andrew when it came ashore um and it's one of these circumstances Jeremy that it was still kind of been a strengthening phase ended approach land\nAnd we've had several hurricanes in the last decade that have weekend as they approached land a just a reminder that that can happen but the other the opposite can happen as well they can be strengthening as they approach and that's what that's what Michael did\nHow well they didn't hold up in terms of the forecast of of where it hit and the impact that it had\nJust like Florence the track forecast from the hurricane center was really spot on here and that is that's also a reminder that the track forecast have improved remarkably over the decades but the intensity forecast are still very challenging the science is still lagging behind a bit\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

Edgar says the sanctuary state law goes too far\nWhen you look at this it's really the difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal\nFrom our perspective we wanted to go and take an option to say hey look we have the right to do this and that's when the ACLU came in and said we don't think you do have the right so now we have an outside group that's actually going and challenging us on that issue\nHow do you respond to some of the opponents of this who say that by not having a sanctuary city or a sanctuary state policy that immigrants are going to be less likely to work with law enforcement on major crimes reporting things et cetera because they're afraid of deportation\nYou know what I I don't see it that way I think that um if you talk to people within a especially around a list I Want me to stay in the north Orange County area you'll see a lot of the immigration population that may\nBy the sanctuary laws what happens is these people that are bad actors that are illegal that get put in jail and then are not released back to the federal government come back into their communities and continue to terrorize their community and so from their perspective they're very thankful I think a lot of this this is the politics and the soundbites versus the reality of what's going on on the ground\nEdgar met with President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and Xena phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think this has anything to do with racism um I probably the best example and the real life example I gave us my wife is from Iran\nShe came when the shah was overthrown she's a Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years and wait and turned to get into the United states that so you know that is\nThe way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I'm actually I'm with my wife is an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or racist\nMore than a dozen cities in California has sided with last Alameda in defined the state law marches Ito is assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or a chest I\nHe said the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking\nFeel that this has become a political issue and it really should be it should be a nonpartisan issue and so public safety issue it just ... is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nThan if they took a minute to actually learn what we did I think they would be we're we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of a lot of these immigrants that come across illegally\nAnd so the ones that help the immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them or we're talking about criminal organizations that are doing those\nDetails says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country is broken immigration system but other cities in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from Los Alamos and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a sanctuary city long before the state passed its sanctuary law\nDivvied Bennett ... is a city councilman there\nWe believe in the dignity of all people the city of Santana has about eighty percent\nLatino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in another country so\nAre the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary city insurers that we send a message to all of our residents that they're going to be treated respectfully a with dignity\nAnd at the stadiums here to serve them well we we spoke earlier with the city manager from last dollar meet us who said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that is not about racism why um why I'm doing this [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't hold back my uh laughter there if if it is a\nFrankly a pretty shallow a response there was no need for the city of selling me to to take the position that they did other than to send a political message they're wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California's is not\nA welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that we've come far beyond that I Would hope and we believe in the dignity of every person who answers our city and that's what it means to be a century\nIs a liar and has no idea uh about the laws and and the law of the land he oftentimes talks about a violent criminals and\nI Do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable the city's than than I Believe that any violent criminal should be ... held accountable they should be arrested they should serve their time\nHowever if you were only\nCrime quote unquote is leaving your country out of desperation looking to be able to uh survive being able to provide for your family that's not something that I see that uh the city should be looking to arrest somebody for\nSo what do people in law enforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Valentino\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is a slap certainly will we do here that's not what my mandate is tomorrow officers um we responded ... responded criminal behaviors irrespective of your status\nSo when representatives from ice state makes their job more difficult what do you say to them so federal authorities\nUm are you know they they have the mandate to um to enforce federal law uh we do not and so a dislike lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide services to the folks live here um they have their mandate to enforce federal law in there and and they do that so\nUm the other pieces it has to do with community trust and I know there's\nThere's a large part of the dialogue there on what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to call for help if they're not calling the police who are they common right so um the ideas um to reinforce the messages\nThe chief of police in Santa Ana this is Don Barnes the under sheriff of Orange County\nWe were in one of the largest jail systems in the nation and we've always had a relationship with ice prior to this regardless what administration Bush Obama and now Trump\nWhen there's somebody in our custody roughly just about temp less than ten percent of our inmates in our custody for local crimes not for ice issues or here undocumented of that ten percent ice only really wants about one percent of those individuals those are the ones that place at the Tehran\nSo it isn't everybody in our custody as just a small population of inmates ice has said they want that we can no longer communicate if we can communicate we release them back in the community\nSo you'd think S. B. fifty four is making this community less safe\nI Know it is making the community last day first up a lot of the individuals who we do who are arrested or being returned to the communities in which they originally preyed upon so we know that to happen we know of as of since January first we've had seven hundred and Seventy two through September this year\nIndividuals criminals in our care who ice had place to detain are on that we could not return to eyes they released back to the community one hundred and forty of those I've already been re arrested for new crimes for for attempted murder\nUm several for assault with a deadly weapon one for child molestation one for spouse or rape numerous other crimes that are occurring that one hundred and forty and those are only the ones that we know about because a return to our jail\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

come\nAnd be able to talk to everybody and meet new people all the time\nAnd you know I have a customers that I met when they were first coming at the age of twenty I still see him to this day is is stopped on let's see bombed on what's going on you know ... there's a whole history of different people that I've known for thirty forty years actually\nShows the flats goes through changes and it's and it becomes less industrial becomes more of a place for people to go drinking the bar turns into patching the flats what led to that was it because there was a just a changing clientele in the changing nature of the flats\nKnow or if you ever see that a Mickey Rooney movies or Judy Garland now let's start as Charlotte's our best show or something like that you know sure okay well\n... got a couple of young men broken neck adorable\nPlayers a campfire and they had no place to practice show they said that you know after work at ... you know one clothes are all us who was going to be down and listen to you guys playing and no no no it was going to be practical for an hour and then new mobile about our business and all that\nWell as it turned out even the workers in the area where there was no live music at that time that there was something different you know young guys playing\nA song that day and wrote themselves and all that showed that turned out the customers were then started joining in and read them and everybody likes to have on my ...\nAnd be able to you know you give their ideas out there and show they sided like I said just practicing here and there are a couple of times a week well then they found a drummer\nSo all the drama and came down to join them or we had a full band and the drama happening to work out a recording studio and story asked he says you ever

started jerks they buy accidents\nThis amazing ... show people I mean you notice that people were willing to stay later and they came to hang out uh did you think wow I'm On to something good here\nNo I don't believe even the name catching on flat strictly by accident were just long overdue the time most called and launch named after my mother\nAnd within usually seeing that somehow zero really didn't work so we're just throwing named around and we came up with passing away I suspect that the last maybe you know a year two years at the most well ... years later and that's how we would never do\nYou think there was a particular heyday was a punk here the best time to be it\nA lot I really young banker you talk about a garage ran those are the kinds we had ... the punk rockers you know of and taken off yet it was mostly in garages are applying Joe and they would come down to play and then of course the parents and grandparents or come to watch them\nWho had never seen but they were doing I mean they're paying for the um [noise] blessings but not knowing what kind of\nMusic that plane [laughter] so so much fun to watch the kid just sit and start playing and kind of money at their front of the bars are behind your grandparents and parents and when they start that punk rock stuff prior to poke on each other grant prior to ... it was this kind of knew a\nCouple of for the father

enjoy the\nTo hedge against us over the years what made you decide now's the time to sell pack\nAnd well being that no I haven't been sick for one thing and there's nobody to take over so much ado drama when somebody is interested in and carrying on or that that's my hope anyway you never know\nSo so yeah I Do hope someone buys it continues on was presenting music in the kind of thing that you build them right in\nFact when they're on the original stuff because we never did any cover band or anything because it was all original mostly local read a course out of town bands to reserve

five gee has become shockingly politicized you've seen it argued as a national security issue because if the United states doesn't deploy five gee fast enough than China will and that will put China

a reporter who's been covering homelessness for K. PCC here in Pasadena Hi Joe Hi Tammy and when you listen to Michael and Elizabeth uh you hear people who are educated you can't\nSay it it's so important to get people how quickly you know I'm demand talked about sort of thinking in to that hopelessness and when people go on how it's for a long time that just gets worse and worse than a lot of the things that people complain\nAbout street homelessness you know the associate things like alcoholism that comes from the trauma of being on the streets for a long time how bad is the problem in California right now\nLet me give you an example I you know up until a few months ago there were about two hundred people sleeping in tents in a plaza\nRight next to the main courthouse in orange county and next to city hall in Santa Ana so you know people saw this every day when they walked past it I Can't ... has since been clear that you'd be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn't encounter people pretty much on a daily basis leading in parks are asking for money on sidewalks and is it getting worse and if so why\nThe single biggest reason is or the lack of housing I mean first of all yes it's getting worse\nOr the lack of housing in Southern California and especially the lack of affordable housing you know a lot of people haven't yet recovered from the recession even though that was awhile ago now but rents have risen sharply and you know people more people keep moving into the area and there's just not enough housing for everyone let alone does who salaries can't keep up with those market rate rent\nAnd and the second factor is that local governments haven't gotten really serious about addressing homelessness until pretty recently\nA there is historically been a lot of pushback against shelters and housing for homeless people and that continues today\nAnd there's a lawsuit in orange county uh currently before a federal judge in California tell us briefly about that\nIn this case came about when Orange County officials talk to clear out a very large homeless encampment I'm up to possibly Fifteen hundred people that had been growing for many years along a flood control channel kind of right smack in the middle of the county\nAnd advocates sued based on a federal legal precedent which says law enforcement can't take it people for sleeping outside in public places if there is no realistic alternative for them\nPeople and then from their work to get them into shelter and more permanent housing we don't actually know how successful those efforts worry because they haven't really kept track but the case really forced the county and cities in orange county to get serious about opening more sheltered there are several new ones expected to come and lined by the end of the year and and the judge is watching closely\nOfferings considered starts at four o'clock this afternoon\nFrom your NPR station from college fine where consulting to work with high school students to identify and achieve their

to flip some house seats that they'll need to take control of Congress in orange county alone there are four house races ranked as competitive by the cook Political Report\nAll of them are currently held by Republicans in this traditionally conservative county but President Trump's approval rating is low here creating an opening for Democrats\nIn the thirty ninth district ed Royce is retiring after twenty five years in office the Republican running to replace him his young Kim one of his staffers\nAnd what ended that shapes throughout the entire thirty nine congressional that day at a congressional staff that that the community I Know that these are the people that I'm running to represent that this personal to me\nThe thirty ninth district is two thirds non white Kim would be the first Korean American woman ever elected to Congress but Democrats Gil Cisneros a Latino and first time political candidate who bankrolled his campaign with lottery winnings hopes to turn the district blue she\nWants to protect I Want to protect the border that's one of the reasons I sort of the military was defending our nation although we don't need to do that by building a thirty billion dollar wall is probably going to end up one has done costing fifty billion dollars\nA prominent Republican is also leaving an open seat in California's forty ninth district which includes parts of southern Orange County in northern San Diego county after narrowly winning his last re election Darryl eyesight is leaving\nReplace him well I'm running for Congress ... replacement that function and Washington DC I've worked in the legislature I've also worked on the board of equalization in very very minority position because I'm a Republican and very very democratic state\nHer opponent is Democrat and first time candidate Mike LeBron\nWhat's happening with the Republican Party in what Trump is that consistent undermining of the Affordable CARE Act and I see it all of you know my travels throughout this district I speak with so many people who are one medical emergency away for not being able to pay the rent\nIn the other two races incumbent Republicans are facing tough re elections in California's forty eighth district Dana Rohrabacher is fighting off Democrats were labeled him ... favorite congressman or a buck or has advocated stronger ties with Moscow and wants to put his muscles were just unbelievable\nYeah my constituents want us to work with Russia where a week job and the American people want us to work where we can rather than this unrelenting hostility and push towards you portray Russia and the United states in conflict\nHardly router hopes to become the first Democrat ever to win the forty eight [noise] and you know what\nAre going to not flip the forty district but we are going to wash across this country for all of America [noise]\nAnd in the forty fifth district Republican Mimi Walters is seeking her third term\nI think that the American public has seen what Congress has accomplished look at more people today has a money and more money in their pocket um jobs are being created a we have higher wages\nWalters opponent Democrat Katie Porter couch endorsements from progressive senators ... Harris and Elizabeth Warren her former professor we're\nCorporations in this country that before this tax bill we're paying zero and my ...\nCounty Orange County went for Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen the first time that a Democrat won the county since FDR but that doesn't mean it's turning blue for good Jody ... is a political science professor at fortune college in orange county\nSo she thinks first of all we're still a Republican county\nAh we're becoming last Republican as old white guys die and as the young people are much more diverse um Eighteen year olds in orange county or fifty percent Latino so um those demographics are shifting\nBut we went for a Clinton because people didn't like Trump not because Republicans in orange county suddenly found love for Hillary Clinton and what do they think about Trump now [noise]\nSo a number of people who didn't like him have come around partially because they didn't have another choice I think one of the reasons that I'm Republicans in orange county didn't like Trump was because they didn't like Schwarzenegger or\nAnd they had that experience and an outsider who said that he could clean up the capital and didn't understand the government and failed pretty spectacularly in getting what Republicans wanted so I think it was just that they had experienced that a lot of Republicans across the country hadn't ...\nOrange County think of President Obama\nCertainly the Republicans didn't like him and spent eight years hating him pretty uh vehemently ah but um [noise] you know it it wasn't because they loved Hillary\nSo what are Republicans hoping to do in the upcoming election\nSo Republicans are hoping to hold on\nYou know it's going to come down to three things it's a Trump\nIt's turnout and its taxes are there are a lot of people who are supportive of Trump and and now I guess I've got to add the Kavanaugh factor of driving people to the polls for and against Kavanaugh but it's all going to come down to turn out for the Democrats\nThe Democrats' chances of getting all for what are the Democrats need to do is to have ever\nSo the Democrats need to turn out and they didn't need to turn out in a really big way\nUm I think the story of two thousand and Eighteen might not be the huge victories that the polls are predicting but I think when we look back I think she thousand in Eighteen is when the Democrats realized\nThat they needed a farm team that when you look at the four Democrats that are on the ballot for Congress not one of them has held elected office before not want the Republicans have all held elected office or are holding elected office so they've got experience they've got a ballot designation that people trust\nAnd right now Orange County I I think\nAlmost every single city council is majority Republican so we haven't seen the Democrats have a big farm team to choose from when they have this opportunity [laughter]\nDemocrats may not have a farm team but President Obama feel so confident about their prospects here that he visited last month for a campaign rally that was before the fight in Washington over the confirmation battle for now justice Brett Kavanaugh\nOutside of shopping center in Huntington Beach Orange County voter Laurie he'd told us She's been trying to oust Republican members of Congress here for years way before cab and I was in the picture\nBy penny and about the negative opinion is that in saying my vote by vote the so already my vote prior to [noise]\nMine's may not be changed but Jody ... says the cabinet confirmation is likely to motivate Democrats to turn out\nWomen who are energized and galvanized them so I think turnout is going to be really hot because of that I don't know on the other side I don't know if the Republicans who feel like the process was unfair to cabinet I don't know if there'll be galvanized out of the ...\nWide margins although in orange county a quarter of all voters have no party preference here's Richard master\nI'm not voting party line vote for whoever was going to represent the people lots of politicians law policy not control [noise]\nLower taxes if you want to earn money we worked for money you want to keep our money\nThere are also people like Greg diamond food doesn't know who represents him in Congress\nOr after read up on about\nReally say too much\nPolitical scientist Jody Ball must says many voters may not know the candidates' names\nYeah I think there's a lot of party affiliation that they're going to go on\nDo you think that part of that though is that things are\nPretty good in California right now and you pay more attention to who you're voting for when things are not good and then when things are fine when you're good we gotta you gotta job you you know and you're okay\nYes no absolutely think that I think that you know part of low voter turnout is satisfaction that people are not a you know roaming the streets with pitchforks ... and and trying to get big changes\nBowman says there is one area where many Orange County residents are not satisfied and that's on the issue of gas prices which are hovering around four dollars a gallon there is a question on the ballot next month across the state of Alaska voters if they want to repeal the state's new gas tax and vehicle fees\nBombers says that could awake in orange county anti tax Republican voters and make the road to a house to take over more difficult for Democrats [noise]", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "11"}
