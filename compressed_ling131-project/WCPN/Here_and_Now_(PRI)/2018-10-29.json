fail you know we're so sorry about this route to community but has this been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nLike first thought was this is a\nBrutal anti Semitic killing tax not only the Jews but Americans and values and the shock of it all was\nJews have been living in a murder comfortable accepted in all communities around the country she changed since the fifties and sixties and in the anti Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities and here we are again one more time\nOr the ugliness not only pop to the surface does periodically but it seems to grip a good number of people in them or\nWell uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred Jews make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI data says they account for about half the countries where they just hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents and twenty Seventeen five hundred more than the previous here have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we see more anti Semitic acts\nSymbols on Jewish cemeteries schools the SAT on Saturday is quite a shock to the

President's Day in his first remark it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing except you're saying that you are also aware of a rising incident\nDo you think that maybe possibly just horrific\nThere there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize ... political leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any major changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe of those\nThat have been spewing out some of his viral language you know politicians closes who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that will send a message in shock the system\nYou know the answer to this or a political leaders they have the microphones and most important political leaders our president is a bully pulpit as the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from other parties but it also has to go down to you know our representatives in Washington are met governors and mayors or you know it's a local issue and if we can mobilize being a little loud voice to make sure that\nThey understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it they'll go to the to the polls if necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that's where it has to begin as\nWell and actually some would say we're hearing the opposite from your president has been\nFor a while we know that the government in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that was heard by marching white nationalist in Charlottesville in August is plenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these white nationalists a supremacist Nazis\nAbsolutely believe and foment the thinking that games are pulling the strings somehow behind policies\nWell that\nSounds on a documented it's put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he originally the shooter was allegedly county in God that had to be telling\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston and other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of\nThe wrong song being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having a big responsibility in this because of his views and his political rhetoric we should all work hard to let him know that we don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make\nIt was just happened to been watching

is that because you're a Democrat and\nTrump's Republican but our political leaders should also be speaking out against\nYou know hatred coming from all sides from all parties we can maybe hold president a little more responsible you know he has to since he has the biggest microphones she's going to have to uh\nYou know live with the fact that he's the one they talk about the most but we shouldn't forget other parties all leaders don't just get a pass\nHere in America ... said that they were fine people on both sides in Charlottesville and you know permission half as much\nAnd I don't

in the morning we thought we'd offer novel about grief that also happens to be a finalist for the national Book Award for fiction but ... says X\nTrying to get on and it's about a dog a harlequin great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and\nThey mourn together to good news spoke with us last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise] my experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing\nAnd uh I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and flurry O'Connor and Kafka and you're quoting other moments in literature as is written another book dogs do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things\nThat is a quote from ... from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the areas apartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden\nWhat do we know about whether dogs grieve\nWe do know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know that we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more and\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to take in the dog but once she has him and she realizes that he is going through a process of Greece\nBut they help each other he'll now\nI remember I had to put a little dog sleep once and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought what seems odd but\nIt seems odd to me yeah cats you can't say for sure that that would happen\nWell when the when the shot started the injection to you know put him to sleep the\nOther dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and peaked over the top as if to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating ... and then he did more afterwards\nOr as I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs heads because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have thought to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean there's ... chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog\nBecause you presume it's like old yell or your present okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog something is going to happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life when you're thinking there\nShe has a life outside the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of the the ... I mean he's he's her whole emotional lives during this period\nSomebody else where the party are near the woman who's in love with the dog you can\nWith a giggle mammoth but also if you are a writer and this narrator is\nA big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a talking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person who in trying to understand what\nPeople like flattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she was trying to tell a story about ... and ... and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I kept thinking I should Google this I should go to this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties and California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYes they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think I'm needs a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen\nAnd to the child is having reading difficulties the dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who words die in their throat because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide [noise]\nBoy could be boats or maybe the friend is the narrator yeah and what about\nYou said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog well my\nMy ... my married are really does Mitt\nCats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble with this idea of dominating any animal ... and you don't dominate cats you dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that tore a cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend\nYeah dogs can be unbearably poignant and she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat will try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head\nAs they do you have her only solace is that\nShe is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen\nWake her up when she had gone Oh yes that's that's very moving\nWell and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and took it I didn't have to ask you it is about writers in writing in the community and the teaching of it um [noise] can you give us one tip for those who uh wanna wrestle a story to the ground\nPiece of advice that I really like is the simple don't flinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among my students spoiled at least in a draft because they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really good experience\nFrom it and that you know makes it not as good a story as it could be\nWell I Would say if anybody wants to see how you can write a book about a dog that for the longest time in the book isn't really about a dog and then suddenly it all about a dog in you know it was such a punch\nPick up the friend um and how much of this is you you've told interviewers this isn't my writing class [laughter] you know I'm not that frustrated with student writers but it's a suicide maybe someone you know because we read the germ of this was people who you knew who were contemplating suicide\nOne of the reasons why I did want to to write this book was because there were several friends that I had let me know that suicide was something that was on their mind it's not like they were planning it next week or even next year but it was something that he started at started thinking about and thinking that that it eventually

education the law was passed in twenty Fifteen and it's being enacted as suicide rates for kids and teens sore in fact\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention suicide became the second leading cause of death the Americans and twenty sixteen behind car accidents\nGlenn leaving is CEO of the mental health association in New York state a group that's pushed for this law for years Glenn tell us why\nWe wanted it to be basically a basic understanding about mental health signs and symptoms and\nAnd to know you have support from the community\nWell so what are some of the the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York\nSo we wanted to make sure that you know each district to determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans and best curriculum stupid\nHow might it be different well I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural areas suburban area in the city\nNot that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island very suburban Long Island may have more of an acceptance of\nThe idea of therapy and mental health being on the table then let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used\nCorrect yeah and there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has to take into into place too and also\nSchool history some schools
