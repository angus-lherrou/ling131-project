[noise] one of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying\nWas not what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in ... county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would hear this\nThe importance of deep coding Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him or to literally by merely covering\nA what he said we would get into lively discussions about this and I said well that's the press his job candidate says something and the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you really making too much of a hall of blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable [noise]\nWhat about religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump\nIt's still predominantly Catholic not majority so there's a rising evangelical population\nTrump's um evangelical vote was off the charts he carried a eighty percent of the evangelical vote so I I talk to 'em a woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God\nShe believed that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered she does he's appointed evangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical they're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business as essentially much ado about nothing\nAnd that he's been married three times they don't care for them the the most important issues are abortion\nAnd his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices\nWhat about just the overall sense of the place uh right now in twenty eight\nThis is going on I mean this is you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area\nThe opioid crisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict I'm the ripple effect is a widespread and ah I'd read the county coroner\nDown there and he is uh just overworked and a thinks that it's an enormous problem and just trying to raise public awareness about it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving is a brain brain is not a lot of opportunity beyond maintenance and uh working in warehouses minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump\nMaybe at the margins are the unemployment rate has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign\nHe hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really uh sabotaging Obamacare and there is no neither Trump for the Republican Party has come up with an alternative plan\nHe said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years\nGoing up the budget he filed in February or shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you'll Republican Party doesn't seem to care about\nWhat about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able to do they don't seem to really\nCare in the final analysis because they just like Trump I think\nAnd now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump did\nUm there's been a lot of criticism that Democrats are ignoring these people that you've been talking to in in places like those are in county well they certainly did and\nWith them twenty sixteen and I think they would do well to listen more to Democrats what other people that I talked to were Democrats but felt that the party had left them rather than they leaving the party\nAny thoughts on what might happen in the midterms well\nIf I had to guess I Would think the um this so called blue wave I don't know how big it will be but I think probably big enough for the Democrats did we take the house but not the Senate\nThen by the junior one of the things I really liked about this book is that you gave us a glimpse into the minds of many people who voted for Trump but\nDid so with respect for their views and I feel like a lot of the um reporting even on people in the middle of the country that's coming from reporters and and and others on the coasts tests to look down on on them you didn't do that here\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

schoolhouse and Elizabeth earlier in high school in Manhattan which began to groups that few\nAnd our students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their do they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nBut the parents of some of the minority students said it smelled of segregation and they worry that a gay their kids the feeling of being left out so the school ended the policy our question is it the right thing to a group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr Beverly Tatum she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former president of Spelman College in historically black college for women\n... the director of the little red schoolhouse said they're revisiting this maybe it should have been more structured but then it was very well intentioned your thoughts [noise]\nUm I think it was well intentioned and certainly there's a lot of\nEvidence to suggest that there is value to give\nBlack kids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful [noise] talk about what is happening\nFor these teenagers because as you write in your book and the chapter called why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria [noise]\nIt seems are different in grade school kids are playing in the sand box with kids that look different from them and then something happens in high school was happening\nOne of the things that's happening is the changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty\nThey start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest that a black boys in school in particular I'm more likely to be disciplined for similar ...\nSpace to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing the stereotypes that we see of black women are imposed on\nThem and so they might develop some oppositional behavior explain that sure well if I Am\nA young African American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is\nI don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know that black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated\nBecause their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school\nAnd if you are in a school like that\nThe honor students are black but if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like\nThen you are likely to think doing well in school being in that honors track is so called acting why it's such a vicious cycle because very often\nThe kids are in those lower ... maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a higher tractors a lower\nExpectation but what ends up happening is this sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond\nFurther with the group that they're in and in fact tracking often does result in re segregation would end racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about the kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings perhaps because they are less well prepared and maybe that's\nThat suggests that black kids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed in those upper attracts you know the the the little red school so they looked at research it was probably yours\nIn your book to read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores that deal not be placed so what do we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like segregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us\nTo the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counsel for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four the notion of bussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city\nOut to the suburbs very good schools but all white schools it was kind of a failure at first talk a little bit about that and then what sure so most of the children who are traveling from Boston and to the suburban schools are black or Latino and often there's this sense of not really belonging\nThey are not part of the local community and so when superintendents of these programs\nLook at the performance of the black kids in particular they often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing there's also may not ... but you write another anecdote about a young black girl who was in a school\nUm majority white and a teacher was saying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to see how we're going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we lived in the city but she doesn't say that and to teach you get so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance\nThat she then ends up saying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which\nAdds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling ...\nBut nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really belong in that school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved and uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had wait a minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his own room [laughter]\nIt sounds like that there isn't it but what the difference between this experience and the little red schoolhouse is that they did it for a year and then they evaluate it how it worked and what they found was that the children who were having that experience improved academically\nAnd also they became more engaged socially why what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids said they felt more supported\nThey had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them\nSo if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus you could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and and be more focused in class by the way the title of your book again why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria\nNobody ever asks why the white kids in the cafeteria their bonding in in many ways\nAbsolutely and it's also important to say as you just did\nWe don't ask why all the white kids sitting together in the cafeteria but in fact at the college level it is actually the white students were more likely to be racially isolated\nIt is possible for white kids still to not engage with the diversity to stick to people who look like themselves just such an odd thing in any high school or\nThey're following or the sports figures it must be very odd for young black to see that well it's true I mean certainly the cultural references that you talked about so you know those black artist to the music becomes mainstream you know those athletes who are admired by\nWhite teens as well as kids of color\nUm those are physical symbols\nThat many people recognize and appreciate but at the same time you can be a young African American sitting and Starbucks and have somebody called the police on you know something\nThat's Beverly Daniel Tatum former president of spelling and college the country's oldest historically black women's college author of the newly

marketplace partners up pulling from Edison research to African Americans a few questions how's the economy doing are you worried about a downturn is the government handling the economy well things like that this year though the poll included a new question asking people how much influence they thought tech companies had on the economy\nAt us and found that Seventy eight percent of Americans believe big tech companies like Amazon apple or Google have a good amount or a great deal of influence on the economy\nWhat's surprising is that fewer Americans more like sixty eight percent of people think the president or Congress have that much influence over the economy here to break it down at me Larry Rosen cofounder and president of Edison research\nI remember a survey from the Nineteen nineties did ask the question who gets more credit for the good economy Bill Clinton or Bill Gates and Bill Gates one strongly [noise] um I think the American public definitely thinks the president has some influence on the economy definitely blames the president of the economy does badly\nBut I think they are savvy enough to understand that it's really these companies these entities you know outside of our government that makes our economy good or bad weather it's\nGo back to the auto companies of the early parts of the twenty century well through the twentieth century or any other sort of emerging kind of technology to change things electrification et cetera and now for the last twenty five years it's been the tech companies\nThis is the first time the Edison and marketplace have asked this question specific\nWe asked about a lot of different things that affect the economy to get a sense for what people think is really responsible for what changes the economy ... people were very likely to say large financial institutions as well have an influence on the economy obviously people saw what happened\nDuring the global financial crisis about ten years ago and so they can see the influence that those kinds of companies have on the economy\nAnd in general they saw that all kinds of businesses have more influence than politicians are Congress or president or many other things that we looked at\nTwo and then obviously politics is very polarizing and divisive right now and yet the strong majority the Seventy eight percent who said tech companies and banks had a lot of influence across political age and gender lines what does that tell you is it are they unifying in a positive way\nWell I think it's important that we clarify that the fact that people say they have a lot of influence on the economy doesn't necessarily mean they think it's a good influence they just see that the influence there and yeah this was absolutely one of the few areas in our poll where there's almost no difference between Republicans and Democrats in the way they see these things\nSo I think it's just a generalized awareness of what really does drive our economy and it seems to be big companies\nThat Larry Rosen cofounder and president of Edison research you can find other takeaways from the Edison poll about trade our economic anxiety index and the poll by the numbers on our

this valley what did you see that\nThat really got you [noise] the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story\nWe'll masterpiece Eighteen minutes long with a live\nIn a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial\nQuarterly friendly formal it was just\nAn amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all and it had the feeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of dance than to say that had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week and then I thought\nSomething's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan man's fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the saint of ballet and I knew that a lot of people thought because it was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and\nDeborah Xiao it's excellent biographies two of them and they both mentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that are encroaching had panned it and that she was hit most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many and many minutes [noise]\nUh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called germ Robbins affects all angry man that was later but you became as you write like a court appointed lawyer you were going up from Robbins worth as a belly choreographer\nAnd so let's take a listen to some of uh again the pieces and we will have it\nAnd she did in Nineteen fifty five Canadian TV taping of it with the original ballerina ... click penny\nRobbins muse and dear friend [noise] and this is a year before she was paralyzed by polio [noise]\nOr or or\nOr\nHow is this a reimagining of the afternoon as a fun [noise]\nWell I I just love the stamps and it's only about ten minutes\nTwelve minutes long you can watch over and over and it just feels wonderful Everytime [noise] it's not just\nA reimagining of the music better reimagining of ... version that he did in the very beginning of the twentieth century the fun is the main character and he has priest is is dancing around and stuff but he's practically a solar\nWhereas Robbins imagined this as a ...\nWonderful to ... I think where it simultaneously about the ballet world we're looking at two dancers in a studio partly and then it's also\nAbout a fun and his dream girl who\nCome and visit him and with those two dancers tend to kill the clip and ... was it was a knockout\nAnd what are they they're like they're watching themselves into practice mirrors that is what it feels like\nAnd we are the mirror there looking toward us out in the audience but they seem to be looking in the mirror as\nDancers sometimes do in a studio said that there's this weird feeling of we're spying on them in a way\nAnd bouncing himself never took the superior attitude toward things that had applied he was Balanchine loved dances at a gathering which Robbins made and down she said it was so great you should make more make more it's like popcorn and he said\nDances at a gathering this is a the dance Robin creature Chopin music in Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nHe had been away from the New York city ballet doing pre I can\nSee for Broadway but this dances at a gathering with an instant had\n\n\n\nAnd what do we see in this day\nDance to the gathering starts with a young man alone on stage and sort of ends up with him [noise]\nTouching the stage after many many minutes I you know it's quite a long ballet of all the dancers coming in and joining a gym and they all get to strut their stuff and they combine in many different ways\nBut the idea is they are dancers hanging out together and so one of the things Jerome Robbins did this happen stand up beside watching each other as others are dancing it's again like afternoon of us on\nA combination of\nA work that's meant for us and that it's meant to have\nA real worldly reality and the work that talks about itself being on the stage\n[noise] uh you talked about his childhood which was difficult ... relationship with his mother um and he became difficult there's a famous and encircle story about him backing up on stage during rehearsal you know he has his back to the audience\nThat companies in front of him he's backing up backing up and no one tells him that he's coming at the edge and he falls in the orchestra pit and no one comes to help them\nNones he you know could be cruel\nYes and ... and a lot of people talk about his cruelty and there are many many stories about how difficult he was and not just the dancers to Leonard Bernstein for instance when they were rehearsing\nFunding for here\nWork with high school students to identify and achieve their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship awards more at college fine dot com\nAnd NPR and MORNING EDITION on this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis is hearing now featuring the sound of applause on Ninety point three I'm Idea Stream stamp collector before joining the Cleveland Plain houses associate artistic director and twenty sixteen\nRobert Barry Fleming worked as a line producer on ... Pulitzer Prize winning play sweat a couple of years later flemings now acting in the sea ph production about the hardworking people of rust belt reading Pennsylvania I spoke with both of them about their production\nRobert you have a history with sweat you've worked on earlier incarnations you in fact we're aligned producer in an earlier point and now you're an actor and fun to put my side talk about your changes over the years have seen the production I think\nThe thing that's most striking for me is what seemed to resonate in two thousand sixteen is even more resonant today in twenty eight team you know the thing that we find with playwrights who write great work it's in some ways prescient\nAnd Lynn ... ability to talk about the intersections of race class understanding what the decline in manufacturing industry what the impact in a very human way has been something that\nUnderstanding it as a line producer and being just overwhelmed by the power of the play is one thing to live inside of it as an actor is entirely other wonderful and illuminating experience so it's been quite a powerful experience for me\nYou play you have an easy for officer for to the show's main characters Christian Jason how does he fit into the story because\nHeard Lynn quoted as saying is that reading in of itself was a place because of its being an industrial giant as a place that many social services were provided to that community and has been a place where\nMen who were coming from an incarcerated situation were able to reintegrate into the community in a really effective way when it was prospering but what we have seen with the jobs dried up is the fact that those services\nAre still in place and those services now are really facilitating a dumping ground of men without really setting them up for success and I think it's true that Evan is seen that kind of stress or for these two young men who are finding their way back into the community\nAnd his role kind of frames a mystery in the play of just why exactly are they in that situation which is both a great drama tour juggle circumstance as well as illuminating way of understanding those circumstances\nLynn what are the most interesting exchanges in sweat comes to an Oscar a Latino who's always wanted a job in the factory but it hasn't been able to get one crosses the picket line that they strike and he's told by Joanna who's white she says these jobs for people who grew up in writing did you encounter that time of attitude from longtime residents without jobs for for people who were from their foreigners need not apply\nYeah when I was reading Pennsylvania I heard a lot of ... racism and there was a level of resent his jobs are disappearing and under their set of false belief they blamed it on the other which where soft target\nOne of the things you do in sweat so well is that you see this latent racism from these people who are concerned about their jobs and they are blaming foreigners but yet you allow them to keep their humanity is just what you're talking about you talked about replacing judgment with curiosity is that what we're seeing here\nWell yeah absolutely it's the other phrase that I really think standing complex it when I enter into a situation and really eat with my guests\nOscar is on stage for almost the entire play we don't hear much from him why not\nWell because I think it's in nature of the job that he does if you when you see the play you see that ... the heart is working character on stage he is working from the very strict lonely you see into almost the end of the play but he is virtually invisible and so I think I'm making it statements about the nature of workers\nWho are Latino or black who are playing vested in American Dream that for whatever reason there's a large swath of the population that refuses to acknowledge it back to work and their contributions\nRobert this production to Cleveland playhouses taking him to a chemical even audience there's pre show discussions you how to union I recently talked about why you're doing the kinds of things you're doing to engage\nThe audience in this way I think part of why we were so eager to do the players not only because of the great American Classic but that is also\nSo resonate in northeast Ohio and what we have seen in the rain county in camps in Youngstown\nAttribute well there's so many communities that this is a real reflection of how they have prospered and how they have been challenged and\nWe were eager to make sure that this was more than an entertainment or position doesn't entertainment but a real opportunity to be in conversation with our community\nTo recognize the invisible who are very rarely recognized onstage and really help invite and assure them into what we do at Cleveland play house as well\nIn addition to labor difficulties in job loss when sweat also deals with drug addiction is taking over the community as well as his inability of some people to leave their circumstances because they can't afford to move\nTo understand why some people might not be sympathetic to their plight it seemed that Thirty years ago when it was people of color who are suffering from drug problems where they couldn't leave people say well that was your fault you needed to prepare yourself for this but now it seems like people want to be more sympathetic in this cause\nFingers across the divide and not recognize the suffering of others and I think you're right and the thing that people were broadside and people find themselves unable to leave\nTheir communities because of their economically trapped and personally I kind of don't understand why some would point fingers at individual\nLike that because any of us find ourselves suddenly in these circumstances personally you know as an artist I've\nFound that there are moments in my life when I had expected that I was going to be rewarded and that reward can come in and I had to figure it out\nYou know I think this is without any money\nAnd not knowing how I was going to survive and next year and I think that that's\nThe reality for a lot of American today is that there was a time when there was a lot of jobs bill that day\nWhen a person and entered into a factory and they knew that they were going to be there for the next twenty five years I don't think there's any certainty anymore and I don't think that anyone in this sort of a new American economy can be a hundred percent safe and secure\nOne of the messages I felt a sweat delivers is that that reminds us and this is going to sound kind of silly that poverty is hard not just not having a job and not having food but even if you do like the Ninety minute bus ride because you don't have a car not being able to move your groceries easily it's a daily struggle I think most of us don't really think about\nIt I think that's a hundred percent true I think that being poor is one of the hardest jobs that an individual can have\nRobbers sweat shows just racial divisions within the community reading but what is it teaches about the commonality of class\nWas things that's another unspoken thing in American culture that we I certainly grew up being taught were a class with society and in my adult experience prove otherwise through my own experience has been described being an artist and\nRecognizing the value of the work that you do and where that's positioned and the culture I of course\nAnd gender and understanding that all of that intersection speaks to this issue of classes rather complex and our culture and it's rather unique to our culture you maintain your connections with so many people do you dealt with and reading how are they doing these days\nYou know if it's a really interesting question and a complicated question I think that I've Returned to reading quite a bit since I did my initial research in this part of the city that's definitely thriving you could feel that there's a new energy sort of searching through the city but by the same token\nThere are individuals who I grew very close to who circumstances having changed but in fact has gotten worse\nAnd as a matter of fact the other day I was walking down the street on my block in Brooklyn and I ran into someone from Redding Pennsylvania just per chance and I said to him how you doing and he said not great among my way to the welfare office and it broke my heart because\nHe was I'm One who when we were there had been one of the right spirit in the community you know have come out of prison he had gotten his college degree heat that in his PHD he was incredibly bright spot in the community it's starting to community gardens had been an organizer and time between when\nWe first got our conversations in reading and now he's predicament had changed a hundred percent\nAnd I can't tell you why because we had a very short conversation but that's all to say I think that there are aspects of reading is doing quite well but the reality is there's still a large swath of the community for which there are circumstances have absolutely not changed", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018",
