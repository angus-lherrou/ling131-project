Boston and Geico offering the guy comb overlap the guy called mobile app stores ID cards enables bill pay and submits policy updates and claim reports directly from a user cellphone alerts\nAll the races in the mid term elections there's one that doesn't fit the mold a Republican in a very blue state who is way ahead in the polls\nIn fact Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker is the most popular governor in America again a Republican in Massachusetts He's facing Democrat Jay Gonzales at last check is almost forty points ahead of him in the polls\nAnthony Brooks is senior political reporter for WBUR you are in Boston he joins us by Anthony hey Jeremy and why is a Republican like they are so popular\nIn Massachusetts well when it comes down to is that he represents a brand of Republicanism that works really well in Massachusetts these relatively conservative on fiscal issues he doesn't like raising taxes but he's liberal on social issues like abortion rights and marriage equality\nAnd he works well with the state legislature which is dominated by Democrats so in this age of hyper partisanship across the country Baker represents something very different that appeals not only to Republicans in the state but according to ... to lots of Democrats and independents as\nWell you'd probably call him a Democrat if you were in any other state here he is in a recent debate with chickens I was talking about issues that matter to him a where he has to go against the president\nI've always been quite clear about where I stand on a whole series of things with respect to the president and managed to work pretty hard over the course of the past four years to stop some of the things that the Congress and the president was proposing that would have been particularly damaging the Massachusetts ... cuts the cuts in the end I H\nM and cancer and other forms of research and a lot of the work if we did associated with a travel ban immigration\nWhat more do we know about his politics as well as we mentioned he's moderate or physically cautious socially liberal by contrast his Democratic opponent Jay Gonzales wants to talk about big democratic programs raise taxes on the rich invest billions and transportation education\nProvide tuition free college and move toward single payer health care system Baker is much more cautious I kind of cautious fiscal manager\nAn effort to fix the T the state's public transportation system but he opposes the kind of big tax hikes and big programs that comes out\nAnd ... is trying to remind people that Baker is in fact Republican listen to this moment from that same debate with Baker refused to say whether he would vote in the election for Republican jak deal who is challenging democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren next month are you going to vote for Jeff deal\nGovernor I'm going to vote for me I'm going to vote for ... you know and I'm going to vote for a series of other candidates as well I don't know what I'm going to do you expect to that one you don't know if you're gonna vote for the guardian ... decision\nCarefully to find out that that's his lieutenant governor ... this is a tough issue for\n... really that was an awkward moment for Baker and it became even more so after the debate when he said that he misspoke and would vote for the Republican ticket which would include a deal\nNow Gonzales is trying to link Baker to deal and by extension to Trump and and this does put her in a kind of awkward position this socially liberal anti Trump Republican who says he'll vote for Jeff deal the state's number one Trump supporter of the guy who co chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts does Baker have a relationship with President Trump no\nThey're not close a Baker didn't vote for Trump as we mentioned he's opposed several of his policies\nBut he argues that when he can work with the Trump Administration when it helps Massachusetts he will but this is a state that voted two to one against Trump um so uh you know Baker has to do a bit of a balancing act you know when it comes to the president\nNow Massachusetts has a history of moderate Republican governors William Weld pulse solution even Mitt Romney who was governor in past Romneycare which was the model for Obamacare\nThat's right and Baker is part of that tradition of moderate Republicans that have had success in Massachusetts and across New England for that matter they included people like late Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire Lincoln Chafee Rhode Island Olympia Snowe of Maine\nPart of that tradition if Baker does when what is the lesson or is there one for Republicans in other states\nYou know the lesson is that Republicans and Democrats can overcome this hyper partisanship and work together and get things done I think that's one lesson that said bakers brand of moderate Republicanism is increasing increasingly rare once upon a time it represented a viable wing of the Republican Party that existed across the country but now that wing\nIs on the verge of extinction extinction so I think the lesson is Republican moderates like Charlie Baker increasingly rare\nSaid that he Brookes senior political reporter for WBUR you are in Boston has any thank you my pleasure well a more traditional Republican is gaining ground on his Democratic opponent in the north Dakota Senate race Kevin Cramer is ahead of senator Heidi Heitkamp in the polls\nI kept one her seat in twenty twelve by fewer than three thousand votes and she had strong support from Native Americans which brings us to the Supreme Court which declined to consider a challenge to in North Dakota law that requires voters to show proof of their residential address at the polls putting the law into effect just weeks before the midterms\nAnd that law could pose problems for many rural voters many of them Native Americans\nDanielle to Sheena finished the director of external affairs for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe she's also a citizen of the tribe she joined us Daniel thanks for joining us\nFor having me Jeremy so you say it's common on reservations for someone not to have a physical street address a explain why that is for people who aren't familiar\nYeah so on the reservation were very spread out community um and due to that\nA lot of people do not live in town ships or areas um communities that have a lot of people in that so actually\nMailboxes are kind of uncommon and because of that most of the community members here hundreds if not thousands of people on an Iraqi used peel box addresses and go to the post office to get their mail and\nThe voter suppression is that many people now have to get new IDs with an actual physical residential address\nSure so I Want to get to do that and how you're dealing with that issue but first of all do a lot of people who live on reservations tend to vote given that they don't have physical address is ... just before this year do they vote in big numbers [noise]\nAh yeah you can um credit US Senator Heidi Heitkamp when in twenty twelve for the U.S Senate seat of North Dakota to the Native American vote where she won with\nLess than three thousand votes and I can tell you here on Standing Rock on the north Dakota side we have twenty seven hundred eligible voters Eighteen and above all that are capable of voting in this election\n'em in twenty fourteen twelve hundred people on Standing Rock voted and so that tells you right there that if just one tribal nation alone on votes predominantly with one party that could swing an election\nSo what are you trying to do to get trouble citizen voters eligible for this upcoming election given the Supreme Court decision\nYeah so so do based on the the new law that North Dakota really imposed upon the tribal nations is we have to make sure that everyone has identification with their new residential physical address so that\nEntails either getting them a new ID cards that's issued by the tribal government here or we have to provide them supplemental material um whether that's a letter from the travel agency you know tell them they need to bring a utility bill let them if they're going to use their old id um\nAnd also making sure people do know their residential address because again like I said people I'm here on the reservation house numbers are not very common a joke that my grandmother was saying is that she actually\nDid a permanent marker and and marked her own house with her own numbers so there you go\n[noise] the Republican controlled\nOne of the easier states to vote and what are you said about\nI think that's comical because you have people now making up their own addresses a because they do not feel like they should go to the sheriff who is also are nine one one coordinator and the only person in Sioux county who can issue an address so they're making up their own um addresses right now which\nIs voter fraud so they just created a problem basically and how long do people\nHave to come up with a a new address in order to vote this election day\nSo they they have two weeks they can do this right up until election day correct yep uh-huh so do you think that they will do you think you're going to get enough people registered to vote so that they all can have their voices heard\nI yeah so we we have seen day registration in the state North Dakota so we can have people um\nYou know just come in and get their ideas up until seven o'clock on November six and right now I can tell you that we had a lot of people who have already gone to get their tribal ID's which we have been providing for free in order to help people vote so I mean hundreds of people were affected\nBy this law in Standing Rock but thousands of people were affected across North Dakota\nSo um we're already mobilizing and getting that couple of hundred to to get their new IDs\nThen you'll just big picture you're Native Americans have always faced unique challenges when it comes to voting there were the last to gain suffrage in Nineteen twenty four couldn't vote in states like Arizona Utah New Mexico until Nineteen forty eight is there still are feeling on reservations like yours the native people\nFunding\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

sure people with pre existing conditions are able to get and keep their health insurance the Affordable CARE Act is still at risk of being dismantled but a majority of voters wants to protect coverage for pre existing conditions joining us now is Julie Rovner who is chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news Hi Julie\nHey Jeremy and let's step back a bit first before the Affordable CARE Act was passed in ... and who did and who did not have protections for pre existing conditions\nWell if you were going from job to job if you're an employer provided insurance then you had protections for pre existing condition or either exclusions are being charge more as long as he didn't have a break of more than sixty three days that with a Nineteen Ninety six law that Congress passed\nWhat the Affordable Care act did was that extended it to people who basically left their jobs for their own insurance who wanted to leave to start a business or who were people who work for themselves or or kids graduating from college and going off their parents' plan\nThe idea was that people should be able to get insurance regardless of whether they had a pre existing condition and they shouldn't have to pay more for those were the two most important pieces of the pre existing condition protections in the Affordable CARE Act but\nBack ... if you did leave your job and you did leave your health insurance for a period of time and you did have a pre existing condition diabetes cancer or whatever it may be what does that mean for you could you get insurance\nUp possibly not or you might have been able to get insurance but it would cost much more or you might have been able to get insurance but it wouldn't cover your pre existing condition so there were there were a lot of sort of pitfalls if you were trying to buy your own insurance and you had been basically treated for a medical condition sometimes as minor as acne\nSo at this point with some of the dismantling that has been done of the Affordable CARE Act that pre existing condition protection is still in place right ... basically\nAre there is a lawsuit that is pending we're expecting to hear from the judge in Texas [noise]\nPretty much any time or the lawsuit suggest that because of the tax bill last year that took away the fine for people who don't have health insurance the entire Affordable Care act is now unconstitutional should be struck down\nThe Trump Administration argued that they didn't quite agree with striking down the whole uh for Bill Carrick but maybe they should strike down the preexisting condition protection so even though Congress didn't change it there is still some threat that it could be changed in the court\nWill that brings us to the bigger picture here which is that how can you say that you want to keep that one popular provision of the Affordable CARE Act which is the production for pre existing conditions but you want to get rid of other key provisions does it work if you take little pieces of it away\nWell it it makes it difficult I mean that's basically what the Trump Administration is arguing that the insurance industry that we can't afford to cover people with health problems unless we have a bigger pool of healthy people that's what that tax with about that's why there was an individual mandate the individual mandate is now gone and there is still some concern\nThat only sick people will sign up for individual health coverage because it's expensive uh the insurance companies appear to be betting that they're going to continue to hang on to at least they all the people that they have because they're not raising premiums a whole lot for next year or we will see if that pays off we will know more about that in twenty Nineteen about how well that actually works\nI mean well let's listen to what President Trump has been saying a here he is on the campaign trail at a rally in West Virginia last month\nAnd I will always fight for\nPatients with pre existing conditions or you have to [noise]\n\nSome people just not a Republican thing to do I don't care and I'll tell you what all of the Republican\nThere's just are safe [noise] Julie is he right that all the Republicans are moving into that position at this point\nWell a lot of them are saying it but there are what they have done suggests otherwise and actually just yesterday the Trump Administration um put out a guidance that allows states to take these are short term plants that don't necessarily cover pre existing conditions\nAnd let people get subsidies for them under the Affordable CARE Act\nWhich is not something that protects preexisting conditions it basically says that OK sick people you're going to be segregated into these other plans in their premiums are likely to go up so it's in what they say and what they do do not match this year we will see whether voters can sort that out\n[noise] what about the Affordable CARE Act overall is it likely that if Republicans keep control of both houses of Congress that they are going to try again to repeal the whole thing\nI think that would be likely I think there are some there was some talk that they might try to do it in the lame duck session after the election that seems unlikely because they're going to have the same Congress they had before when they didn't have the votes but if they were to pick up seats particularly in the Senate then I think you would probably see another effort to to do what Congress tried and failed to do and twenty Seventeen\nOther than the pre existing conditions part of the Affordable CARE Act what are the other really popular parts of the law that it would be difficult for Republicans to get rid of well\nRepublicans tried to go after the Medicaid expansion um and that turned out to be surprisingly unpopular I mean who I I don't think I would've guessed and\nTwenty Fifteen that Medicaid would become a big political issue and yet we have medicate now on the ballot in four states I'm about either expanding or protecting an existing expansion so that the popularity of the Medicaid expansion which gave a health insurance to\nTo you know many millions of people probably around fourteen or Fifteen million people is proven to be popular also so there are other pieces of the Affordable CARE Act that the public\nIt is again whether the whole thing can stand up if you take away that part of it I guess it has so far\nIt has so far that tried in the insurance company behavior suggest that it it will be or they're betting that it will be okay we will have to see what happens in the court\nThe sign up period for a sea health plan starts on November first and for the first time since twenty tend the price of health coverage through the federal marketplaces is down slightly what's going on there\nA well what's that what's going on there is that insurance companies raise their rates so much last year for twenty Eighteen they have no place else to go they're finally starting to make money so they don't really need to raise rates\nIn some cases they're lowering rates at least slightly um partly that's because under the Affordable CARE Act they're not allowed to raise rates unless they can justify the rate increases which they can't this year\nAnd the whole thing and it looks like you know there's a little bit of stability but I should point out it depends where you live\nI'm rates are higher in some places still than in other places sometimes that's because last year's rates didn't go up so much I Would also point out that in some states open enrollment has already started in California it started October fifteenth\nSo you really need to to check your state to find out when open enrollment is when it ends and ah what the premiums are looking like what\nAre you hearing from Democrats or as we live up to the election are you hearing people talk about universal health care as they were a couple of years ago\nWell Democrats are going to have a really big fight I think after the midterm right now they're talking a lot about protecting preexisting conditions um but there is this ... this sort of NASA and growing move for a Medicare for all or some kind of universal coverage\nIt's a phrase that means different things to different people but clearly the Affordable CARE Act well it expanded coverage through a lot of people did not do enough about uh doing something about the price of health insurance and the price of health care in general\nAnd the fact that the U.S pays way more than other industrialized countries and I think that's going to be the debate going forward Democrats are going to have to decide whether they want to support and more government\nGeneral Julie while we have you ah we learned today that the retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has revealed in a letter that she has been diagnosed\nWith the beginning stages of dementia probably old timers disease she says this is a a something that affects so many Americans what does it mean to have a\nSuch a well known person is Sandra Day O'Connor come out and say that this is impacting her as well\nWell I think everyone is aware of this I think everyone's family has been touched by someone with dementia or with Alzheimer's\nObviously we saw President Reagan after he left the presidency um it is a big issue you know the one thing that the U.S really does have in in medicine and that there is bipartisan support for is a government funded research to the national institutes of health\nAnd this is something that is that a top priority for the end I aged it's obviously you know a tragedy for for people are connected to people with dementia and it is also a huge source of spending a for the United states so

for the security threats that we have today\nThat's Kansas hoax from the center for cyber security and privacy protection at the Cleveland Marshall College of law she believes insecure voting machines are the biggest security threat to the mid term elections and they are definitely insecure last summer at the DEF CON hacking conference security experts ... at a variety of voting machines\nAnd came away saying the machines were hopelessly vulnerable to even the most basic hacking like the kind where the default password is still password and lots of machines don't even create paper receipts to ensure that votes are counted correctly oh and by the way the researchers said most of these problems\nHave been known about for a decade\nWe have not required voting systems vendors to operate under the same kinds of rules as say pharmaceuticals as to the\nSafe and effectiveness of their products so safety privacy audit ability transparency whatever word you want to use these are all marketing

these machines\nOne fully certified machines thirty eight states require at least one element of the certification program only twelve require the full federal certification and eight states including Florida and New Hampshire Oklahoma in Montana don't have any requirements at all\nAs for the vendors Qantas hoax says they don't really have the money to build cutting edge machines\nThe vendors are actually making their money from the technical services they provide to local governments for conducting elections\nAnd that's their steady stream of income so many of them are as far as we know

Parker White House reporter for the Washington Post joins us now I actually hey how're you\nDoing well so so that is not true what he just said he's not going to be able to pass another tax cut next week Congress hasn't even session\nThat's correct um and that's one of the things he is\nMeant what he was doing and as we started making calls no one in Congress and you know and in his administration knew no one really seem to know so why is he saying that he is doing that [noise]\nUm I think he I assume he thinks it's a good messaging strategy right people like tax cuts um that would be a popular thing to do is if you could push a tax cut through in the next Thirteen Days before the midterms that would be really buzzing big\nBut here again he won't be able to do that um he also claimed a last night in this rally that unknown middle Easterners were mixed in with a group of seven thousand Central Americans currently a more than a month away by foot from the U.S border also not sure where at least there's no evidence that there are no middle Easterners in that group\nRight the president has been asked the White House has been asked and they have not been able to provide any examples evidence or specifics of what the president is referring to\nActually he also return to a claim that he made during the twenty sixth seem campaign that immigrants are who are here

he's also talked about a Democrats funding this caravan and kind of implying that their funding them because these migrants will cross over the border and then and then vote in Thirteen Days um and that's also false that's not how our system works [laughter]\nMhm [noise] so so are his supporters gonna care if they find out later that some of these things are especially with the middle class tax

I'm with President Trump that was not the case he sort of quickly realized um that he could say what he wanted and\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WB you are Boston and from

now the ride hailing company lift is bringing electric scooters to Washington DC it's the first east coast city to get scooters from left but scooters are already widespread in the nation's capital with companies like bird lime and skip\nAlready offering rent a boat dock list electric scooters for short trips around the city ... is the director of the Washington DC department of transportation he joined us Jeff\nHi Jeremy so how many scooters are there in DC right now approximately well we currently have upwards of\nTwo thousand doc was vehicles both a bike and scooters combined and how long have they been around [noise] we launched a pilot program about a year ago or to allow these companies to demonstrate to technology here in Washington DC\nAbout a year ago and have people been happy with them so far or what are they saying\nWe've gotten a lot of feedback about their use and certainly a there are several people who have a really be be on to use these as a part of their uh daily commuting experience and others who are using them for periodic trips to go a long distance or how how far are they going to commute the scooter\nWhat we've seen a different types of trips in some cases they are\nExample so there are a number of cases that we have observed or over the past year\nAnd one of the things that a lot of cities have said about the scooters one of the problems that they've seen is that people just leave them on the sidewalks and they clog up the sidewalks and then if you're disabled and you're trying to use your wheelchair and get down the sidewalk you could get stuck because there's there are a bunch of scooters in front are you seeing that there\nThis is something that we heard very early on during the demonstration period and it's something that we took very seriously in working with\nThe companies to ensure that they were in forcing our rules and regulations and that their rules and regulations in terms of use a were reflective of those things and that has become something that we're we're working very closely to to enforce and and we see the incidents of those things are decreasing\nAnd do you have a good relationship with the companies are you in contact with them regularly\nOr we have ah been working with them to collect data and information and also to report problems that we hear from from members of the public here in Washington DC uh and so we have a opened a line of communication with them to ensure that we're sharing information at and that they're sharing information with us\nAnd they are sharing information with you that is correct\nSo obviously one of the big concerns is safety and I'm just last month there was an SUV that hit and killed a man who was riding a rented electric scooter in Washington DC apparently that was the first time that somebody has died in an accident in the U.S on on one of these scooters\nWhat are you know about that or what can you tell us about that and and how you're making sure that that doesn't happen again at least to the extent that you can try to stop it from happening again\nWell D.C is a city that is committed to vision zero which is a a a strategy that under the leadership of our mayor we've put in place to eliminate roadway fatalities in serious injuries and we're doing everything that we can taking it very seriously\nWe're also taking a number of steps to ensure that we're building the safest possible infrastructure [noise] ah it's worth noting that all forms of transportation come with inherent risks\nAnd so we're working with in this case with these companies specifically a two to ensure that they are promoting the safest possible a use for their users and that we are a informing the public about uh about this new form of technology this new form of mobility that is on the road with\nOne of the things that people upset about the the safety risk of the scooters is that a lot of the people who ride them not just in Washington but all over the country are wearing helmets and and that they're they're out on the roads with cars but they're not wearing helmets or do they have to wear helmets in D.C\nCurrently the law and DC are for helmets is is limited to individuals who are sixteen or under or some of the companies as you may know do a giveaway helmets and they strongly incentivize riders to use helmets and and that's something that that I think companies are are thinking about as a as this technology moves forward\nAnd what about a a government or what about the district of Columbia are are you thinking or are people in D.C thinking about putting in a law that says that people have to wear helmets if they're writing these rented scooters\n[noise] you know I Can't speak to what lawmakers may or may not do with respect to changing the the current helmet law certainly we are a whole week encouraging both cyclists and people who are using scooters or to to be as safe as possible and that that includes wearing a helmet so you get\nTo see the data as you said what are you finding about how this is changing transportation in DC is it having a big effect\n[noise] it's it's very early to tell what what the impacts will be overall to commuting patterns and into traveling and to to trip to take and that's really why we have decided to do this in an incremental approach to allow uh kept a number of these vehicles\nStanding of of how the public is interacting with them\nAnd right now the cap number is what the\nCat number is four hundred per company okay and so now we're talking about with the addition of lift a currently in a district there there are five companies five companies\nJeff you've been in Washington now for a number of years how big is the addition of electric scooters doc lists rent ... electric scooters compared to any other changes that you've seen in transportation including by the way over and left over the years\nI Am glad that you mentioned uber and Lyft because there was a time when that technology first emerged and came into the market uh that that people were asking\nA lot of the same types of questions that we are now asking about a duck was bikes and scooters this is a significant change it's one that uh provides a new mobility opportunity and\nUnder the leadership of our mayor Muriel ... it's something that we have a embrace but have done so in a very incremental way to ensure that are that the technology is utilized a in a safe way for the residents and visitors of the district of Columbia\nThere are still a lot of cities in this country that do not allow the scooters and I'm In one of them right now what would your advice be to other cities that are considering whether to allow doc less a electric rentals scooters on the roads\nMy advice is really to to listen to the public we very deliberately opened up a comment period where we got lots of feedback and lots of information from the public or from really all across the spectrum and that's something that we take very seriously we analyze it and we use it to inform the policymaking going forward\nThat jeopardy and who is director of the Washington DC department of transportation

for capturing stories while working at the east side news on woodland avenue in the Nineteen eighties she says she didn't realize at the time how important a black newspaper west to the community she went on to become a riding teacher and recently she worked with members of the mount pleasant community and several other east side neighborhoods to share their stories\nThe effort culminated with Cleveland stories volume one which was facilitated by literary Cleveland idea streams carry wise spoke with Cleveland directory Cho code as well as Morgan about the project\nCharlotte your reflections from working at the east side news that is what you wrote that Cleveland ... what did you learn in that job that you can't leave that stays with\nYou I learned about time I learned about those\nLuminaries those political luminaries knowing Lee Fisher and meeting Jane Campbell and just meeting all of these people who who knew Jane Campbell will one day be mayor of Cleveland\nI had no idea and my working at the east side news because there was a community newspaper we had access each week\nWe can get a press release and call up you know a state senator or a state representative I had George ...\nInteresting community they have to call us they had to give us access\nBecause we were the alternative news and at that time we didn't have alternative news for those communities so we had a mandate get alternative news for the residents and voting time like right now every body stop by those little dingy offices\nIt was just an old house and they will come and have coffee and tell us hey\nI Want you guys to write a story about what I'm trying to do on Buckeye or what I'm doing on woodland are what's going on with businesses around shaker square and then we were right about it\nBut we should say that he said new still exist yes it does exist Ulysses Glen is still there\nThey have an online presence and you know I see him I remember in two thousand eight we were at the Democratic debate at Cleveland State University in in walks in my own journalism instructor and we're all lined up at the table and\nThe guys from sixty minutes or there and it was like one of the coolest journalism moments that I've ever at and I'm like\nThis used to be my journalism teacher this was my editor and it's\nLike it was a great moment to meet I think Steve cross was there from sixty minutes thing\nAllegedly will stall was there and it was like the coolest thing that ever happened and my Mike why was there and he knew was from the east side news and so that was a really important moment for me to know that\nThat journalism experience that I had starving in college and even in high school that it's still meant something and that I could still pursue those goals even when I was you know a professional and really at college teacher who just wanted to be at the debate\nLay you hosted these sessions he's writing sessions at the mount pleasant library branch and also ...\nThe writing I Would say the influence of writing because their community hubs\nSow seeds of literacy is a place that people know in the neighborhood it's a place they know they can get services if they're working towards their GED it's also part of a larger building where Mount Pleasant now is located in where community services are located and the same thing with the mount pleasant branch it is a a community have worked for folks and go to get information and services\nAnd so what was so interesting and great about it is that feeds of literacy or in the library too I'm sure the your clients towards us they refer clients towards us but we also brought folks in from other parts of the neighborhood from other communities like Buckeye shaker square and beyond\nAnd also people who had ties to the neighborhood like they had grown up there but they didn't live there currently\nAnd we brought you know those different communities together\nLee one of the stories that stuck with me\nWas written by Clinton Congress who wrote very candidly I should say about his work at the mount pleasant library branch and at times how he could feel jaded about the routine and what he was experiencing there how do you encourage writers to be honest in their writing\nThat's a fantastic question and it's I think it's something that's very difficult to do um I think ... pieces very brave because he really opens up about his workplace\nBut a lot of times it's just by going through the writing process and by going through multiple drafts and as you put a story down on paper and begin to tell it you often yourself realize what it's really about and then you're able to get to the heart of the story to get to the truth is of the story and to tell it in a very honest real\nWay Charlie you guided writers in oral history that was one part of this yes and that's an important way of capturing stories from relatives many who are older is there one or two things that you would offer as it advice specifically related to capturing oral history that one\nStories and I think for some of the people who struggle with writing you know they could tell you the story\nAnd it's so ugly came out and we recorded some of those stories because they really didn't have the skills to write them down and it was just a thing that I share with them\nJust tell the story you know just sharing when you get together with family and friends and you're having a barbeque or cookout ours Thanksgiving or whatever the occasion is\nWhen we go to funerals as African Americans is also a time of celebration and what we do is we tell stories but nobody writes them down and they can be lost so the tradition of oral stories is very important in some cultures\nAnd we just need to keep furthering that practice tell those stories but some of you come out the literary Cleveland workshop and will help you write\nThem lead twenty five people created palms stories essays that are all part of Cleveland stories volume one is the plan to create more volume's\nWe would definitely like to continue the program where it goes from here I don't think we have all that mapped out yet but I'd love to see us they rooted on the south side of Cleveland I think it's a great community with a tremendous amount of stories to tell\nCharlotte was there anything that surprised you that you learned from the people who you are trying to teach\nI learned that they were survivors that was the part that was really difficult\nWe were there and there was a woman who had moved to Mount Pleasant from the rain and uh she told a story about uh being shot in a drive by on her birthday and\nI'm like I wasn't really ... expecting that and it was I heard lots of stories about\nWe just have to find a way to get them from them and get them document is some type of way because they were really great stories of survival deck and inspired ... there were stories that weren't good enough to be made into movies unlike what do we do with all of this\nSo we didn't get all of them but staying rooted in that community gives us an opportunity to once the anthology comes out is going to stir up a lot of interest and we can get some more\nSo the anthology is free at seeds of literacy where else can you find that so that you could enjoy it in other parts of\nCleveland so there's also a free download on our website\nAlong with a oral history interviews being available to listen to\nAnd uh we're going to distribute a certain number of copies for free and then if there's interests we'll do another print running and will will either sell them at cost or give them away anything else that you would add that we didn't get to cover I guess the only other thing that I Would add is that the program what we didn't talk too much about this but\nThe program was also funded by Ohio humanities and was kind of rooted in neighborhood history\nSo one of the things that I think is really interesting about Mt pleasant and I don't know if you would agree Charlotte but not much has been documented about its history some of the surrounding neighborhoods like sugar square Buckeye Glanville half are nationally famous for things that happened there\nMount Pleasant is a neighborhood that so many people pass through\nWhether it was as ethnic immigrants at the at the beginning of the twentieth century whether it was African American migrants from the south in the early to mid twentieth century the stokes brothers Don King you know lots of famous Clevelanders came through there so I think it's a really interesting neighborhood with a really rich history", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "23"}
