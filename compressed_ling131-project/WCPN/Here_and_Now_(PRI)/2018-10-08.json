with suspected of accepting bribes his disappearance as one of many lately in China billionaires Muslims a movie star and increasingly feminists\nAccording to lead to Hong Fincher feminism is having a moment in China and that is deeply frightening to the Chinese government\nVenture is author of the book betraying big brother the feminist awakening in China she says she hasn't seen as social movement this powerful since the Tiananmen Square protests of Nineteen eighty nine ... ...\n... thanks so much for having me here nice\nTo talk to you tell me first to focus of the book is the feminist five these are five young women in China who are at the core of your story um the theme that you present is the political is the personal give us examples of how among these five women\nAre the personal became the foundation of their activism and also who they are what they did\nSo um these five women became known as the feminist five after they were jailed and twenty Fifteen\nFor planning to celebrate International Women's day um and it wasn't just those five women there were a lot of women in different cities across China who were planning to handout stickers about sexual harassment on subways and buses but before they even carried out their plan\nThe police and and all of these Chinese cities just carried out a sweeping around ever rats and focused on the five women the feminist five brought them to Beijing and detained them\nFor thirty seven days before there was a huge global outcry that resulted in their beliefs are being detained for what is it done well well um well this is this is what was so outrageous\nIn the end it was something akin to disturbing the social order\nUm that the the reason why the arrest and jailing of these women just galvanize so many so many people and the feminist community inside China and globally is that it was just so outrageous because of all they wanted to do was to handouts stickers raising awareness about sexual harassment\nOkay so I Want to find out why that was such a threat to the government to uh just doing something like you had to go stickers or making T shirts and handing them out against sexual harassment but first what gave what was the impetus for these particular women the film this fine\nUm well I mean a a among the fan on a five quite a few of them um had suffered abuse in their personal lives well growing up\nUm for example the nights herself spoke about quite severe um physical violence or at the hands of her father I'm from a very early age and her uncle um some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse\nAnd and it wasn't just these five women are a lot of the women who um who are have been involved in the women's rights movement\nHas personally being um victims of sexual assault or a very severe domestic violence\nAnd that has given these women and ten cents a personal commitment to fight back one\nOf the of some of his five oh one month for instance had to have a master's degree to teach high school whereas men and joined only need a bachelor's degree\nYou know there'll be some people who remember mostly don't use a famous adage women hold up half the sky or in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China or equal without ever the case and if so what happened to that [noise]\nYes well I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about\nAnd and and then taking care of children and cooking and the ...\nThe fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either in the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the con find moments of of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really on the highest in the world and in the early communist era and the and and the propaganda rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do um and so even today you see the legacy of that early communist era because\nChina's seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling a dramatically with the onset of a market reforms\nUm but but now in the last couple of decades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as I'm with the dismantling of the planned economy so many women who have been laid off related to men and the gender gap is is rising exponentially in so many ways\nAnd that's a big part of why this feminist movement has grown is because of\nThe dissatisfaction with with this huge gender gap that women\nYou know have to put themselves behind men and so many young women today feel that that's really profoundly on there what what is the threat that the Chinese government feels yeah well I mean this is what is so fascinating because on the face of it I mean what these women are doing is actually in line with\nThe Chinese government's expressed belief and gender equality um that if you look at the bigger situation of China and now the economic growth the economic miracle of the past few decades is basically over so they're slowing economic growth\nSickly so the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing a particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do\nBecause these young feminists are telling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you don't want to but I'm In many ways I Believe that that that sexism and massage any and the subjugation of women pushing women to return to these traditional roles of beautiful wife and mother\nUm all of that is at the core of what I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how is the Chinese government pushing the\nWell I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is a very aggressive propaganda\nUm that that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long then their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media\nThat women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant\nUm they should seize on their so called best childbearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part of it but then there's also policies um says that the um [noise] much publicized so called one child policy recently ended\nSo China officially now has a to child policy it's being encouraging are trying to push 'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of this really dramatic policy change on on a population the birth rate still felt\nUm and so there's this huge confrontation now between\nThe agenda of the government which is pushing a very traditional gender norm\nI'm pushing women into the into the home to become baby breeders on the one hand but then you have this enormous I'll swelling of I'm particularly educated young women who are pushing back\nIn every way um and so what is unfolding right now isn't just an extraordinary moment in China's history\nAnd the Internet played a big role as well more and more women went on line and we're sharing their stories on there is a work with all the censorship going on in China will well this is what is so fascinating because in spite of the intense Internet censorship would just become incredibly sophisticated\nThat these women are ... they're so imaginative that they find ways of circulating their message and getting around the censorship censorship\nI mean just to give one example there was one activist who I'm Wendy hash tag me too as being very heavily censored this one young woman came up with the idea of using him oh jeez for rice and Bonnie which which is me tool in Chinese which sounds like me too\nAnd so that was one way or that they were able to gain a get around the censorship for a while um another on the government called him ... but then they're continually playing this game of cat and mouse and coming up with new ways to get around the censorship could they have done this without the Internet\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

bullying at a private school near Boston the hero is a high school junior name be Shaun he's of Middle Eastern descent and his sudden stardom on the basketball court\nHas some ugly consequences Sarah fairs on as a child of parents who came to us from Iran I asked her what she and that student beat John have in common\nWe went to a similar high schools um he doesn't go to my high school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly\nWhite an affluent um private school has used his eyes I did which was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller so should um\nGive it up we both love comic books\nWe both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs a little help\nHe is of mixed heritage his dad is Jordanian\nUm his mother is a Persian but grew up here so you place to be John directly on the basketball court um Dijon is a star player he's realized to be a star player really quickly and kind of rises in in social status and very quickly\nBut then things change what happens in a school someone doesn't like all the newfound attention he's getting and I'm One of his colleagues ... right right and he I mean you don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photoshopped image of him to look like a\nTerrorists holding an AK forty seven was in the ... face right All right yes ... yeah and uh has sent it anonymously to the student body so the school is trying to figure out who has sent to his mother and other parents are very upset and I'm wanting to figure out how to fix the culture of the school and make sure he's OK\nOther students are that are behind him and allies sort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for something\nThe poster boy for international politics right [laughter] and people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kind of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to and no kids should really have to do you have to deal with that I sort of did this thing where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared\nI didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all this rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and the sort of thing and then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab American which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim grow up pretty secular but technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating\nA Japanese person to a Korean person where so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking not invasive questions but sort of like they never really thought of\nIt before you called us polite racism and this is something to be John faces as well ... what's the difference between polite and impolite where he says I think most people get the impression that you know racism terrible anyway and there's no really fully polite racism\nBut there's a difference between\nPainting something on your house or throwing a rock and a window\nVersus a micro aggression or saying something that sort of a little barbed or and made to some sort of other someone so how does ... in the book real life to understand I think he's he's had to deal with sort of it's in for that he's sort of had to deal with stuff before it's just never\nUm and stands up for other people and his sphere and himself but there are other times when his internal monologue you can tell that he is really hurting\nAnd I think that's important too especially for boys where they might say like you know set for yeah how's school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to\nTo have them have a pretty rich in her life\nSo he puts up with a polite racism and then you know you get into the idea of cyber bullying and then things become exacerbated and get even more painful\nWhen you were writing this how did you decide whether to make some of the characters that Caucasian character specifically in the book deplorable or not deplorable I mean what what in your own experience made you decide well maybe this person is uninformed and this person is racist\nFor me personally it was really difficult to write this book because I Do want to get away from books that are sort of like where the character has to deal with Islamophobia like the character to just have an adventure or you know be the hero and you know get to do stuff that other main characters get to do\nTwenty or just like you don't want it just like the character doesn't right like he he chose her first and you don't want to be the ... well no but\nFor all kids like I just want them to be able to be like I Am the basketball hero and this is you know what I've achieved but I did want to sort of address this thing that really\nHas bothered me for quite some time and it's not that I think that there are certain people who can't combat racism or or get over it maybe after the book finishes\nBut for that time and space I Want to talk about things that I think young people are dealing with and maybe don't get a lot of media time [noise]\nWhat do you what's the pay for you is it just getting\nI Am concerned with people who maybe feel that the book doesn't represent them fully but I it's just one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is a main character that maybe people were not expecting and really love\nI just want this kid to really even though he's fictional I'm very fond of him I didn't like making hurt a lot of times but I Know that if maybe people read about him hurting they'll hurt real people less\nIf you were you know I mean this is a young adult book if you were kind of work up a lesson plan for this and you wanted to conversation to be started among students would be the theme of that conversation\nHuh I Would say and what does it take to find one voice\nAnd prejudice times and how can you stand up for yourself and others when that's really difficult which is a great hope but we'll see how that pans out\nSarah ... thank you thank you so much appreciate it Sarah fires on the book is called here to stay to read an excerpt go to here and now ... or ...\nOh\n[noise]\nToday the ...

reached a consensus that it's possible to limit a rise in global temperatures but that will require monumental changes in policy ... or ... is the director of climate science for the union of Concerned Scientists spread of what is your reaction to this\nVery dire prediction and the report\nYou captured it this is a really important report\nOne point five for two degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels and the difference is as you said striking in dire in many instances\nSo this is a lot of scary predictions um but a lot of scary predictors are made in a lot of climate studies by different sources what makes this one different in how do you gauge um the the importance of these protections\n[noise] a lot of the scientists study talked about much larger changes by Twenty one hundred three degrees Celsius which by the way happens to be\nWhat countries have put forth internationally determine contributions to try to help solve this so they look at much higher temperatures this is the first report to really look at what would it be like at one point five degrees C and how much\nEffort with the world have to take to reach that goal\nSo again one point five degrees Celsius doesn't sound like a lot um what what would be the consequences according to this\n[noise] was it it is a big deal because think about this the world has gone through about point eight degrees Celsius rise since the pre industrial period if we added another point six degrees Celsius to get to one point five degrees\nJust think about how many um in extreme heat wave the world has already experienced at the level of climate change we already have\nThe amount of hurricane extreme precipitation what we know is that coral reefs are one of the very vulnerable species of um eco systems that are at risk at one point five degrees C\nUm and at two degrees C we the report says we could likely lose the vast majority of our coral reefs and\nOn the positive side I mean just takes a look at the negative as well but it says if the world was able to change and if it was able to get a hold of the climate change and global warming going on right now have as many people would suffer from lack of water there will be fewer deaths in illnesses from here\nBe substantially fewer heat waves and downpours in droves one author says this is a monumental task to reverse our current course but it is not impossible what do you say\nThe good news it as not impossible and and that four inches of extra sea level rise between a one point five the world and uh to the world is worth fighting for because

in Syria the fighting has turned into a proxy war involving other countries on opposite sides of the U.S back to the coalition led by Saudi Arabia it's trying to oust rebels known as who these who these are backed by Iran\nDavid Miliband has seen all of this up close he's president and CEO of the international Rescue Committee David Miliband you were just in Yemen two weeks ago what did you see there\nI mean Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis this is a country of twenty eight million people\nEight million people are being fed by the un world food program every day it's a country with three and a half million people are on the brink of famine and what eighty three percent of the population are in extreme poverty and the temptation is to describe this was a tragedy\nIn science is an indictment because this is not saying natural catastrophe it say mom made a trauma that is the results of a war has been waged over the last three and a half years I wouldn't either side winning\nAnd I want to ask you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen it feels\nWhat this is all about yeah I mean Yemen is a conflict goes to the hall of the trauma that he's going across the middle east at the moment the government of Yemen was toppled in two thousand and fourteen by who seek to the who sees are a group from the north of the country socio economically deprived\nOr they rolled over the then government and captain Seventy percent of the country\nI'm what's happened since then is that a Saudi led coalition with us support also UK all the European support so it's not that far from home because the U.S is very strongly implicated in as\nA Saudi led coalition has been trying to pull the Yemen the control of the capital Sana'a enough Seventy percent of the country the truth is the Eighteen thousand bombing raids that have been led by the Saudi led coalition if not shifted\nThe front lines uh Seventy to eighty percent of the humanitarian and commercial traffic\nGoes through the port of data which is currently choked really ah by the fighting only a trickle of eight and commercial traffic is getting through I'm what's happening in Yemen is that that conflict between who sees and the Saudi led coalition has both in the Iranians who supporting the who these\nBut other than the other side from the Saudis the lesson the u._k. exactly so I immediately you have a theological splits Sunni versus Shia you also have a split of in trout regional power struggle but in the chaos of the groups are emerging separatist groups in the south\nI'll tell you drove the Arabian Peninsula in the east ISIS growing as well in my case the case that I saw with my own eyes is that this is a humanitarian catastrophe or the levels of malnutrition are absolutely shocking in that country that have children literally starving to death but at the same time there was a political emergency too\nBecause the only sign that he's gaining from the current stalemate all the extremist of all ... and I says and it's a country now which is on the verge of melt down not just humanitarian\nTwo thousand children are waiting for hospital places in Yemen\nOr there isn't the fuel to support the hospitals there isn't the fuel for the cause you can see half a mile cues at gas stations on the road you've got teachers and doctors and nurses were not being paid because public sector salaries and not being paid as a country which can't sustain itself or the moment is being ravaged by war\nThat is not to the benefit of any of the science we're waging it was in fact being exploited by extremists and I think the onus\nOn the permanent members of the Security Council including the U.S on the u._k. is to recognize that this crisis is of no snow ones benefit the war is not being one and the only way to address both the humanitarian and political emergency is a cease fire\nA winning a whole stop digging and that's the message that needs to go to the Saudi led coalition\nSettled on right there for a second what is it that the Saudis the u._k. to us and the others\nWant what's their goal that goal is festival to roll back who the influence which they see as being allied to the Iranians secondly to reestablish what they call the legitimate government that was in place before the two thousand and fourteen or two\nAnd a third Leon importantly for Saudi Arabia they want to be secure or from missiles being sent from Yemen into Saudi Arabia and there's no question that the who sees have launched missiles into Saudi Arabia so there are legitimate security concerns\nBut what I saw was the price being paid by the Yemeni people far outweigh the costs that were being imposed on the other side\nWe should say that the U.S secretary of state Mike Pompeo says the coalition is taking steps to minimize civilian casualties\nObviously sticks in the ... because I met a Yemeni who ... told me about missiles had landed on hospital next to a health care center that we were delivering and they all know about\nSo you're the U.S interests that Mike Pompeo has indeed a certified as he is required to buy congressional legislation that everything is being done to protect civilians why we I Know that seven and a half thousand civilians being directly killed a Monday indirect effects on far larger numbers\nAnd why would the U.S not willing to protect civilians why would they in the u._k. and even Saudi Arabia I mean why would that not be a priority ...\nCosting any ad hominem judgment what I'm saying is that the fact is that civilians are not being protected them to come up to the war has breached the basically the most basic norms and international humanitarian law both on the Saudi led coalition side and on the losing side independent un inquiries\nHave a ... produced extensive documentation of terrible breaches of international humanitarian law in other words the targeting of civilians by both sides\nAnd this is a crisis but now uh I came away saying that the world needs to wake up to what's going on in Yemen and the tragedy is at the U.N General assembly there was no all night session of the U.N Security Council on Yemen the u._k. holds the pen\nOn the Yemen filed but the pet needs to be picked up because there is not the current debate to replace the failed U.N Security council resolution twenty Fifteen with something but there's actually a roof map to peace rather than the cop lunch for\nIf we take the issue of um a refugees which obviously the higher the focus is on to the U. S. indirectly to Washington um you have said that regarding help from the western world\nThat you've moved to a relatively benign climate to a relatively hostile and we know the Trump Administration has cut by Seventy five percent the number of refugees it admits into this country every year\nHow does that affect your work we'll just for the benefit of your\nAre about twenty eight million refugees and asylum\nThe appeal Uganda countries like Bangladesh historically for the most vulnerable refugees widows victims of torture often children the U.S has stepped up and being a leader in what's called refugee resettlement which means bringing about on average about Ninety thousand refugees the or the U.S actually on the Reagan Administration was over two hundred thousand\nAnd those people go on to become productive members of American society the Trump Administration has festival changed the security vetting arrangements they want you to update them that's legitimate for any government to do but they've also reduce spy Seventy five percent the cap on the number of\nRefugees are allowed into the U.S and that obviously means individual lives are affected their off fifty thousand Iraqis who supported the work of the U.S military and government in Iran translates into things\nThey're not being allowed into the country either so there are individual stories of people who fear for their own lines who can't now starts a new life to work in the U.S which is part of the reason they're in trouble because I ended up being targeted because of this ... for the U.S then not being allowed in\nEither so you've got this clamp down on a refugees fleeing for their lives clamp down on people who would claim refugee status because of the work for the U.S\nGovernment and the great danger is that a bipartisan program of proven success remember refugees contribute more to the American economy than they take out in\nA welfare payments are proven program is being strangled and this year um we are having to deal with the fact that there was a historic low in the number of refugees allowed in only Twenty one thousand in the fiscal year that ended on September\nThe ... the Trump Administration us into the U.S at the Trump Administration is such a feeling of thirty thousand for this fiscal year which started on October\n... the first and so what we see is not just the effect on individual lives of those who would have come here there's also the fact that countries around\nIt's dealing with six hundred and fifty thousand registered refugees from Syria\nIs dependent

about the time that he begins putting the duct tape on he says this is a robbery and so then everything was fine like crystal clear what was going on you know it was just really strange [noise] none
