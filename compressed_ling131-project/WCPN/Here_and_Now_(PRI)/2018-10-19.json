a government officials for a U.S ally so the president has said that he is going to wait for the Saudis and the Turks to get to the bottom of this with an investigation uh but it's looking more and more like he's going to be pressured into taking action\nBy Congress we saw that happened last year with Russia the president did not want to sanction rush what he wanted to have a better relationship with wide and reporting but\nA Congress in a bipartisan overwhelming vote passed new sanctions against the election meddling targeting Russian President was forced to sign it and it's looking more and more like the president sees that fate and is trying to position himself as a potentially being tougher on salary on the Saudis for what happened in Turkey\nWell and that's one of the reasons the president is is so conflicted about this is because the U.S has a very important strategic relationship with Saudi Arabia very important economic relationship they own a lot of US government bonds or or big oil producer or they invest heavily in U.S companies there there's a lot at stake here\nFor the United states if it does get really tough on Saudi Arabia\nThat's right and it's also that uh what President Trump sees as an important strategic partnership in terms of ah responding to Iran and what President Trump feels is a very strong Iran's threat\nSo there are many many reasons why President Trump has been reluctant to dig in on this and to take action against the Saturdays yes we're waiting allegedly for some report it's got to come out\nUh and the next day or so from the Saudis about what they say happened and yesterday um secretary state Mike Pompeo made it sound as though\nYou know whatever they have to say it will be something that the that the White House takes you know very seriously and they buy it entirely exactly they'll have to be questions about whether or not you can trust that report coming from the Saudis of course the idea that that they are going

yesterday the elections will be held a scheduled across the rest of the country a powerful local police chief was killed by gunmen in Kandahar general Scott Miller commander of us and NATO forces in Afghanistan narrowly escaped injury\nIt marked the first time since the two thousand one us led invasion that the top American commander in Afghanistan has been involved in an incident like this\nJoining us now is the b._b._c. chief international correspondent leads to such he's in Kabul, Afghanistan\nLeast there have been a number of recent Taliban attacks in the run up to this election but this one in Kandahar was especially brazen what did you say to you about the security situation there\nThis was the most devastating attack or by the Taliban against\nAh the senior leadership in Afghanistan taking place in Kandahar a critical critical province of the former heartland of the Taliban they still have a network of sympathizers still have the ability to carry out this a kind of spectacular attack\nThe wife now to senior leadership including the powerful police chief general Abdul ... some may some have raised questions about his his tactics in trying to improve security in the province so there's no denying he was lynched pen\nIn bringing a better security and stability to this area and not just to kind of her but to the entire south so it really has sent a shiver right across Afghanistan and happening so sue now before these critical parliamentary polls we're still waiting to hear all the details about\nHow this was done but we understand was committed to buy a member of his security team of young bodyguard underlining again the ability of the Taliban to somehow persuade new bride or encourage\nOf administration and it does come just two days before the parliamentary elections in Afghanistan do you think that it's related to that\nThe total almost strike whenever they can they have vowed to attack these polls they verge of Afghan citizens like teachers and students not to vote to not to put themselves up in harm's way\nThey have said that they will try very hard not to\nOr not to injure to kill civilians but they've made it clear that they will they will attack security forces and they will attack this electoral machinery or they say this is very much in awe of intellectual exercise carried out for the west and they want to Afghanistan to have no part of it so security forces\nAcross Afghanistan are on high alert um it's hard to know when and how they will attack I remember I was here for the last elections in Afghanistan which for presidential elections\nAnd the Taliban had been convinced by by Pakistan or by other forces not to attack the polls but they carried out and devastating attack after the polls close we can't say for certain what will happen this time\nAh I Know the efforts have been made to try to convince the telephone not to not to damage at this crucial protests but of course no matter what the what the Taliban do or don't do there is still the forces of Islamic state and they will listen to no one they have carried out some of the most brutal attacks including here in the heart of causal\nOr American troops going to be involved in election related security this weekend\nThis is very much an Afghan led protests and the Afghans are very proud of that the ring of steel as they call is\nAround ... is very much for Afghan police Afghan military African intelligence we're visiting the control room of the Afghan police this week they showed us all their security cameras right across the city keeping an eye and all the major streets and the thoroughfares\nOf course have have their aircraft when it comes to securing the vote and they are said to be more than fifty thousand forces involved that is very much shop Afghans who will be a right at the front for protecting up Afghan people\nIt's been Seventeen years now since the U.S led war in Afghanistan the toppled the Taliban it doesn't sound like they are are giving up anytime soon that they still would like to retake control of the country well\nThat's the big question I think there have been studies which show that the Taliban\nAre either controlling or has an influence in a very large number of Afghan districts the estimates go anywhere from fifty\nTo Seventy percent of of the districts but it has always been said that they cannot take the capital Kabul which would be the most heavily secured a part of of Afghanistan and of course would involve a lot of bloodshed\nWhich is why there is great hope being invested now in the new signs that possibly peace talks could begin there's the new\nAmerican envoy is I'm a highly decide who has was born in Afghanistan is now leading a American official he's former\nI'm a ... a ... year to Afghanistan he's been visiting the telephone talking to Pakistan\nTalking to the Afghans and hoping very march to start at protests which gets the Taliban and the Afghan government around the table to negotiate an end to this war and of course that would involve discussion of the Taliban's main demand\nThat African American and other western security forces leave Afghanistan\nLeast you said after all of your trips to Afghanistan over the years what strikes you about the country right now in twenty team really\nStrikes me about Afghanistan now is that there are the the new war is very much between the dark forces of the past including the Taliban including the powerful warlords\nAfghans who are truly inspiring often the reports we hear our young Afghans leaving for Europe it was saying they have no future here turning their back on their country but when you come to Afghanistan\nWhat you see is highly educated young Afghans determined to stay here knowing the risks and they are running in record numbers in this these parliamentary elections trying to take on\nThe old forces including the warlords and their sons and mostly sons who are running in these elections so it is very much an election pose between hope and fear\nAnd the greatest hope is that political space safe political face will be open to not\nTo let this new generation have a greater say in forging a new future for this a long embattled country\nThat's the b._b._c. chief international correspondent leads to set in Kabul, Afghanistan as Afghans prepare to vote in

volatility has returned to the u._s. stock market Wall Street jumped this morning but it's been a rough couple of weeks or three percent drop last Wednesday one per ... per cent decline yesterday [noise]\nOf course that's nothing compared to what happened thirty one years ago today when the u._s. stock market dropped twenty two point six percent the largest single day loss in us history\nNew York times financial reporter Diana Henry case wrote about what led up to that day and what can be learned from it in her book a first class catastrophe the road to black Monday the worst day in Wall Street history I spoke with her last September and began by asking her what made her want to dive into this crisis\nWe're talking with younger people in my circle even younger financial reporters I was astonished at how little they knew about the Nineteen eighty seven crash\nI Lived through it myself as a reporter but the methodology that has grown up around black Monday Israeli an amazing monument to Wall Street amnesia and let me tell you\nPeople will tell you oh it was no big deal was over in a day was one and done and nothing could be further from the truth so it was so\nI kind of wanted to solve a mystery here why has black Monday been so forgotten why have we not recognized what it was showing us and taken that to heart\nWhy did you start your book\nI drew raised at Jeremy my the book opens on the silver crisis uh which was a bubble in the silver market\nBut what was significant about that crisis which was in the commodity market far from Wall street was the way it quickly led to the traditional fire breaks\nThe panic spread from market to market from the commodity market to the brokerage industry to banks and the various regulators of all those marketplaces barely knew each other's names\nSo we open on a world where official Washington is still kind of trapped in this delusion that they are all these isolated markets that can be regulated separately\nAnd the silver crisis in Nineteen eighty blew that delusion apart for those who were paying attention and then along the way I illustrate the ... heated occasions when\nA panic refused to stay where it was supposed to so that by the time you arrive at black Monday you understand that they didn't just pop out of the clear blue sky this was the culmination of a series of\nMisjudgments missteps fundamental changes in how Wall Street worked\nWell one of the fundamental changes was the rise of electronic trading how big a role to play\nIt was an enormous role and it was very unfamiliar to most investors at the time particularly the main street investors the extent to which computers were speeding the flow of orders into the marketplace at the speed of light\nAnd many of those markets were still operating at what I call the speed of life not the speed of light they were human markets they were trying to operate\nAs they had operated for a hundred years\nAre there in the background in the shadows beyond even the vision of alert regulators were the use of computers to devise new and destabilizing trading strategies to create new financial derivatives that were used and imaginative and unusual ways\nSo the computer was a tool of the financial engineers who were creating the new products that would show a effect trading on black Monday\nI must say as you're talking about this sounds kind of familiar ... after having just lived through the crash of two thousand a you know people talking about a lot of ah fast trading and new products that nobody understands\nYou're exactly right I mean in in Nineteen eighty seven there were these tighten investors who use these untested derivatives\nIn computer driven strategies and they nearly overwhelmed ... regulatory system exactly the same thing happened in two thousand eight too big to fail investors using untested derivative than\nHigh speed hurt investing strategies with fragmented oversight so\nWe're right back where we started only with exponentially larger scale and risks\nThat you brought up the issue of regulators you talk in this book about Ronald Reagan who took office uh in Nineteen eighty one and\nWas pushing for smaller government was appointing people who wanted to cut back on regulations how much responsibility did Reagan and his administration have in the crash in Nineteen eighty seven well\nIt's sort of a mixed bag Jeremy yes um there was a new deregulatory fever in Washington the lady that played out however was in skimpy rations for the regulators so the to the extent that the regulatory machinery was under staffed\nPoint out that after the crash it was a blue ribbon commission appointed by President Reagan led by a staunch Republican the Brady\nWho recommended that we scrap our current regulatory system and put a unit a fight regulator in charge\nIn Washington so both the prescription for what we should do and some of the problems that gave rise to black Monday can be traced back to these political divisions but I should also say that\nThe Democrats in Congress on the left in the Nineteen eighties we're not really part of the solution either a they wanted more funding for regulatory agencies true but they failed to undertake the serious oversight of these profound changes in the marketplace\nOne I Wonder if we can ever expect our members of Congress to be able to be good regulators of the financial industry because it is so complicated how can we expect them to understand all these new products enough to oversee\nWell that's why we need to look at the regulatory structure we have\nWe don't expect our politicians in Congress to understand nuclear energy but we do expect them to adequately fund the department of energy and make sure that the risks that that agency overseas are adequately taken care of I think that same thing is true of our financial markets yes they are\nExtremely complex and yes they are algorithm driven and there's lots of rocket scientist from academia who were making fortunes on Wall street and that is arcane and bizarre for a lot of people in the political realm\nBut they still have the responsibility of making sure that the regulatory agency is appropriately structured appropriately funded and appropriately staff\nWriting this book of why crashes happened how something that seems small can get out of control very quickly and spread and cause a market crash\nYes\nAlthough it wasn't a big surprise you know we've been laboring for decades under the um\nThe notion of an efficient and market a rational market where investors make rational decisions and and those decisions are incorporated into the prices of securities automatically I never found that particularly persuasive I've got to be a good appreciation for how people panic in a crisis\nBut after researching a black Monday I don't understand how anyone can believe that that's an accurate explanation of how markets work\nWe're human beings we bring a lot of baggage to our investment decisions we get frightened we indulgent wishful thinking we ignore the red flags until it's too late that's the nature of the human mind\nI'm sure a lot of people on Wall street are going to read your book what about people who don't work on Wall street or don't work in the financial industry what do you want them to take away\nI Want them first of all to understand that this is not a mom and pop market we're the mice on the elephants dance floor here\nAnd we need to understand our role\nWhat I Hope they will take away from the book is a clearer picture of how today's market works and how we got here but I also hope they will realize that when the elephants or stamp heating and running around with their ears on fire what they should do what you and I should do\nIs stay calm stand pat and wait out the storm and then when the dust settles call your representative and Washington and demand that we finally get some meaningful action on regulatory reform",
