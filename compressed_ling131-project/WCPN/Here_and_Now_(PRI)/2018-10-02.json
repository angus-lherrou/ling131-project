Smith who a Ford says was there\nA it includes drinking and it is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which are his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which a that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which\nAn incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer which is something that a cat and I went to great pains to deny\nKevin as your book has also become the focus of scrutiny this is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse reading from Kevin ... have you I don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce that our first of flatulence we were sixteen okay [noise]\nAnd so when your friend mark judge said the same put the same thing as your book page back to you at the same meaning it was flatulence\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection and we want to talk about flatulent such a sixteen hundred year book page\nOn 'em game it's all about that's not what this means\nIt's sort of unclear what booth means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a booth truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty widely but\nIt seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious a reference to drinking there was made in your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily\nYou know he he said that the beach week routes club which is pretty obviously right they reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having\nVery clear that drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nWell and just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says that moved refers to anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kavanaugh about another term as your book devil's triangle here is devil's triangle\n\nDrinking game has played three glasses and a triangle\nAnd\nYou're quite quarters you know okay so ... what about\nThat one and again I'm going to refer to Urban Dictionary uh and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that are the devil's triangle is made up game of quarters with three cups or engine to try and go the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could not explain them under oath\n[laughter] right so uh this is again this this is a bit of flying it's not really clear what the intended usage was at the time they are all sorts of a a suggestion is about it but one thing that I Will notice I went back and I looked at Google has the tools allows you to search OR Books that they have ... I went back and look to contemporaneous news reports\nYou know news ... likes to talk about flying high schoolers are using I saw no indication of either booth or devil's triangle the way in which Kavanaugh alleges they were used were actually contemporaneous uses of those terms\nSo we're we're we're diving pretty deep into\n... in an area that sort of hard to evaluate a objectively and categorically but it seems pretty clear that no one besides Brett Kavanaugh says that a devil's triangle is the thing that he said it was which is sort of ironic given that the whole thing is meant to refute an allegation that he says only one person had me\nI Want to play one more clip from the hearing this is senator Amy club which are pressing cabinet and his assertion that he never had memory lapses resulting from drinking or you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much\nCan you answer that question judge and just to you that's not happening is that your answer yeah and I'm curious if you have I have no drinking nor do I okay thank you so Chad\n... who's a former classmate of Kevin ... says cabinet has not told the truth about his drinking at Yale or is it plausible for him to tell senator club which are that he's never had memory loss from drinking ah\nI I mean it is plausible I suppose theoretically it's plausible but we have a lot of contemporaneous evidence from people that knew him at the time who said he drank a lot too when he drank they're often times in which he appeared to be in the past hated [noise]\nAh and there are lots of suggestions or some people who knew him then that it is hard to believe that he never would have been blackout drunk given how much he drunk and I'll heavily drank and of course this is the central central point\nIf it was the case that he with some regularity and high school uh gotten drunk to the point that he can't remember his actions that may influence\nThe story that he says which is that he doesn't he never had a did what Ford alleges it's quite possible he doesn't remember what we're doing what for legit so it's very important for him to establish that he never got blackout drunk because if he can establish that then that bolsters his defense of this event never happens well\nAnd also you know this is a person who wants to be a a justice on the Supreme Court and\nThere are big questions here about whether he was telling the truth under oath to these senators this is a Jeff Flake the senator the Republican senator from Arizona and Chris Coons a Democrat on sixty minutes over the weekend a talking with Scott Kelly of CBS if\nJudge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee nominations over Oh yes I Would think so\nSo they're they're both saying that that line to the committee would be a problem I mean how how ...\nSort of fascinating things here is the extent to which the sort of obvious white lies of him\nOr trying to downplay for example as your book injuries are sort of given a password\nSort of established as odd spectrum of these sorts of false words that are are going to be considered\nA disqualifying for Kavanaugh and that the European countries may not necessarily fit into that category so it's a will sort of have to see but this is all politics right I mean flakes\nAssertion that that would be disqualifying will be absolutely heavily love and by the fact that he needs to consider what the politics are of the decision that the ... and so to the extent that we can say hey Kavanaugh said this thing about the year book which isn't exactly true\nWhat we're going to end up seeing inevitably and the evidence suggested this is what we're going to see is that people will simply say well yes that that's not really what I meant when I said that this would be disqualified Philip up any guesses about what's going to happen this week\nFunding for here and now comes from math works creators of Matt lab and send me a link software

important\nHappy with the new agreement from simply because I was happy with the olden Raymond and I can't imagine why someone who was profoundly troubled by the old agreement\nShould be happy with the new agreement so this is more in the nature of a publicity stunt than an international diplomatic act\nSo when President Trump said this is proof that my strategy worked that I put pressure on Canada and Mexico and I got what I wanted and our dairy farmers are going to be in better shape now you say what\nI say any changes are tiny compared to the overall economy\nThe ill will we have created with respect to the Canadians and the Mexicans will have costs that will exceed any benefits the ability of North America to remain unified\nWhen we face very serious challenges from Asia has been constrained this has been the most short sighted of strategies for the most negligible gay\nDo you feel the same way about what's happening these heavy trade with China right now\nI think there are major issues in the U.S China trading relationship it seems to me the strategies we used\nTo go after them have been quite problematic they emboldened the strongest in most hostile to the United states elements within the Chinese government they encourage the Chinese on a road to ...\nInfluence they fail to mobilize the moral and political force\nOf the entire international community which has surely the most effective way to influence Chinese behavior I think that any conscientious American administration would be addressing issues about\nChinese trade practices and in particular the ones relating to intellectual property but I don't think the strategy or the tactics has been well calculated to maximize long run American interests\nAnd what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these terrorists that were collecting a lot more money on everything that is being brought in from China\nThey're all kinds of ways of raising taxes if you want tariffs our taxes\nThey are taxes this fall principally on the goods that people buy and the inputs the companies need\nIn order to compete that's why their taxes that are particularly regressive and particularly inefficient and so there's something very odd about an administration that prides itself on its tax cutting focusing on\nCutting the taxes for corporations\nAnd raising the taxes\nOn uh the ordinary goods the toys that parents by for their kids have Christmas\nSo are you surprised then that Republicans who have long campaigned on big tax cutters and being against taxes are not speaking up about these tariffs\nStopped being surprised\nIt is clear and you know I'm an economist not a politician or a political scientist\nBuddy it's quite clear that a Republican congressmen and senators are in great fear of a primary challenge sponsored and supported by President Trump\nAnd President Trump may not have a majority within America with him indeed his approval rating suggests that it's well under fifty percent but he does have a big majority within the Republican Party\nAnd he's prepared to ruthlessly use that to impose party discipline and therefore he is able to a rally\nRepublican congressmen and senators who value their survival as political leaders more than their previous convictions\nTo stand by his side you know the book has moved somewhat out of fashion but John Kennedy wrote a great book called profiles in courage about senators who regarded their\nCore beliefs as being more important to them than their reelection I just wish we were seeing more profiles in courage or in the Senate these days on trade issues and frankly on some other issues as well [noise]\nWhat do you think of what the fed is doing right now they just raised interest rates again inflation is up above two percent unemployment below four percent right now I is it possible that the fed is keeping interest rates too low right now or what do you think\nThink the fed is right to recognize that any error and letting inflation rise a little bit too much\nIt is likely to take a very long time to reverse\nI'm One who believes that we have a very different to contact me than we used to therefore I think the approach to being pursued is okay and I would not be one or to criticize it certainly not one to criticize it on the grounds that we should have even more rapid increases in interest rates than we do\nI I have an interesting theory that I just heard from somebody in the banking industry at a major bank and and he was saying\nThat the unemployment rate may actually be getting so low that they're going to be a lot of people hired for jobs that they shouldn't have being paid too much money and that's where inflation is going to come from what do you think about that\nIt's possible uh there is some evidence that at the end of expansions there's a tendency for productivity growth to slow\nAnd that may be for the reason you're a companion suggests that ah when laborers in short supply some of the people hire are a bit less a qualified but it seems to me that what is striking is how slow\nAny pressure for inflation is and perhaps that's because of the price discipline posed by foreign competition posed a buy a technology so I think it would take quite a lot to generate a substantial acceleration in American inflation\nI Want to ask you about one more thing which is that we're talking as the stock market is at record highs a lot of people are worried that you know we've been in an expansion for a long time now that the recession is on the way what are your thoughts at this point about that I'd\nBe surprised if some time in the next three years we didn't have a recession evident\nOne is not coming I think you have risks and the geo political environment you have risks that the fed will\nWith printers printer ink on toner cartridges for home in business and in store print shops for customized presentations booklets and manuals more at

national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis is hearing now featuring the sound of applause on Ninety point three I'm Idea Stream sample letter debuting on Broadway in Nineteen sixty four Jerry ... classical musical hello Dolly\nHas put a number of leading ladies in the spotlight over the decades\nFrom Carol Channing ginger Rogers\nTo Pearl Bailey anathema Herman to more recently but Midler and Bernadette Peters\nAs the Tony winning revival um works on a national tour another living Broadway legend takes on the role of matchmaker Dolly Levi the woman known as the voice of Broadway Betty Buckley the production directed by Jerry's acts Lanza play house where this week I spoke with Buckley about being part of this acclaimed revival\nThere are a lot of different ways to approach shallow Dolly how would you describe the way that ... has chosen to stage to show\nHe's going to really eliminated the storytelling he's of course the director of comedy and farcical comedy and I've never done anything quite like this I did a lot of musical comedy when I was younger [noise]\nBut I haven't done that for quite a while he's quite a genius in that kind of work in that kind of fires to stage but be neat that it's real poetry and a great great heart in the story telling\nBesides the privilege of being able to be the quarterback for the national touring and doing the job I feel that they added bonus I've been in comedy school for the past several months with professor\nSo it's great to be where I'm at in life and my age and you know with all that I've done\nMy career to still be learning and growing and being given that opportunity to do so wonderful\nThere was a lot of these Miller Dolly ... says you're most challenging rules as\nWell yeah I Would say so you know Sunset Boulevard was very challenging I did that for a year in London and a year on Broadway and I think we counted that I ran up and down the stairs and these heavy beaded gallons and high heels something like twelve times a night eight times a week for two years and it did quite a job on my knees that I've been paying for ever since\nAnd then I laughed because everything I've done since\nIn theater has a staircase and Everytime I see a staircase I get vaguely dizzy you\nKnow [laughter] but actually the hello\nDolly staircase I go up some stairs behind\nThe set before the hello Dolly number and then I come down the stairs\nAnd I just have to do it once a night instead of twelve times a night but yeah I didn't realize how much dancing there was when I saw the show that made it look so effortless I didn't even realize she had dense that much\nAnd then my first day of rehearsal are wonderful associate choreographer Sarah Edwards came in and said okay let's learn the hardest numbers first let's start with the hello Dolly dads section I was like what\n[laughter] and she's like hop\nSkip jump sad to say hop skip jump jump jump kicked kicked and I'm like\nWhat [laughter] I didn't notice any of this but I've been in a very\nIntense training regime\nI ... I have a wonderful trainer named pacman Nokia at a gym in New York called ... which is an incredible oasis of a gym I've been trading with him for many many years he's trained me for all my big big projects and Sunset Boulevard included\nAnd I contacted him last spring when I knew I was doing this\nThen when I got to New York in July I started seeing him five times a week and working out by myself on the six day a week to really intense regimen it's all come together just in time which is great and he told me that I Would like in the beginning I Would work out every single morning and then go to rehearsal and stagger home at night and take an absence salt\nBath and fall into bed it's like all I could do\nBut he said that my stamina would grow in the you know I'd get stronger and I have not come to my workouts each morning and say okay here's some of the choreography I have to do and he would then design my work out to make nice strong enough of that even to the extent of having me bring my\nBeautiful dance boots made by ... the wonderful dance shoemaker in New York he said to bring my dad's shoes to the gym and we would run some drills and my dad's boots and all of that's worked\nGreat funny having this opportunity now to play Dolly hello darling this national tour as just another important landmark in your career let's go back to the beginning to you and the role of Martha Jefferson in Seventeen Seventy six story usually received that job when you're in New York City is that true\nIs true yeah I'd been signed by an agent when I was a junior in college I had been a guest performer at the Miss America pageant\nAnd these agents saw me on television and had me fly into New York to audition for them\nI sang for them they signed me immediately and then they said what do you want to do and I said I have to go back to Fort Worth to finish college I was at TCU studying journalism and minoring in theater and they said fine and so I went back and then my senior year and then I went on tour with Miss America to Korea and Japan\nDuring the Vietnam War the summer of Nineteen sixty eight and saw the results of war and all these hospital intensive care units that we visited along with all the military bases in Korea and I just kind of lost my incentive to go\nWho's now big Broadway producer but at that point was my agent and he just kept calling me insisting that I come to New York and then he arranged for me to come to New York with a job in an industrial show because my father was very very strict and\nWouldn't let me leave with just a dream you know he didn't think that was feasible or realistic to do so Roger had arranged for me to do this industrial show and\nSo I went to New York and I called to say I was in town and he said you have an audition and Fifteen minutes at the American theater laboratory take your music and\nGo so I was the last girl to audition on the last day of auditions for Martha Jefferson in Seventeen Seventy six and was promptly cast and in costume fitting in rehearsals and the next day so it's pretty amazing\nYou wanted to leave room ... reports would reverse cats powers that she pitched you initially\nEveryone in the musical theater community in New York New about cats and knew it was coming to New York the Broadway production but it was a hit in London and we all had the cast album and it's a beautiful beautiful album and memory of course was sung by the great Elaine Page so my agent at that point a lovely woman named Joanna Roth\nCalled me and said were submitting for ... and she's the glamour cat that things memory and I'm like okay so she said prepare memory so I did and my first audition they said to Joanna we're not interested in her because ... radiates death and dying and Betty radiates health and wellbeing\nUs hall\nTexas girl and so I told her kind of I don't know presumptuous Lee I told to and I said they'll be back\n'cause I just had this feeling about it I just had a feeling that I was going to do that part and then it was my role and it was on page six in the New York post and daily news almost every day like who they were considering for ... it was really wild\nDidn't my final audition and covered and I have to speak to him briefly afterwards 'cause he's still seemed unconvinced after he directed me and had me sing the song like three times\nAnd I said well surely you've seen every one who could possibly play this part and I know who my colleagues are and there are many girls who could do this part really great and I said but of all the ladies that you would consider\nAnd who could do it well no one can do it better\nAnd I'm your girl it's my turn and he seemed to really be wielded by that then I was embarrassed that I said that and I left the theater and that stage manager gave me a thumbs up in the rehearsal pianist gave me a thumbs up you know and then\nI called my agent and to and that just say what I said it and she said oh Betty when are you going to learn to keep your mouth shut out he's a British director he was the head of the R S the he doesn't want to hear some Texas girl giving him her opinion and I was like oh you're right I really messed up and an hour later she called me and said are you sitting down they just called and offered\nYou cast it was pretty good [noise]\n\nThe memory of course I mean that is one of these pieces come to find your group in some respects\nWhat's it like to have people associate you with the song so closely\nIt's very nice people tell me that it's my signature song and you know honestly I feel really grateful down to even have a signature song you know [laughter] but it's been a tremendous gift [noise]\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "02"}
