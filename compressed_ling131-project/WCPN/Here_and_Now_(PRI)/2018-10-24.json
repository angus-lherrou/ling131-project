races in the country that a little more heated yesterday the Tampa Bay times reporting that attacks shows the Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developer something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout stars of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump's favorite Ron dissent is by as many as twelve points in the polling the two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men to sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida as history probably as most progressive he supports hiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single payer health care system\nWill have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gives to Gillum against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations but first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here in at the very least we would need\nA ... sort of states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs\nAnd others on behalf of its citizens and so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid or which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state right now a Republican so refused to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government that right now is being given away to others\nIn Mr dissenters said that to a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to healthcare you said you could always go to an emergency room that response in my opinion is disqualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee which is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in the state we were traveling in a young African American who is also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here said to us you know I I I think this is a problem he's his\nTallahassee is the eight largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMy city is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate\nThe missile defenses described out community as one where people are sheltering themselves in homes in avoiding the streets and he's clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognize that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what is humidity do about it\nAnd what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we instituted restored of justice practices created reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community get the opportunity to reenter society and have dignity around their work\nThis categorization of a high lawless a you know this is Trump be in politics it is not based in\nReality I Want to ask you about President Trump you know in your debate with Ron descent as you said he was a student for the president you made no bones about how you felt about President Trump and his loosen is without acts of leadership well an absence of leadership as you as you put it\nPresident Trump's polling numbers they have bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent astute first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nI'll tell you I Will take my chances\nHousing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refuse to do with\nAh I'm teaching my kids what it means to the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes\nAround making fun of handicapped individuals\nReferring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe\nIt's completely inappropriate behavior and Mr disasters he is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself and apprentice Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency and common sense to our body politic more people have to join me in decrying this kind of Davis if\nA racist Xena phobic and sexist language out I'm never going to make apologies but trying to create a kind of society and it kind of a community or where my kids will be proud to grow up in\nIran just answered says if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor how do you work with the ministry and listen to many many for the environmental plans that you have for this day\nUnfortunately for most of the center this is not Russia or we don't bow down to the president we work with\nA check for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle disagreement\nTried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail governor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama stimulus money\nAs much as I disagree with the conduct\nAnd the qualifications of this president if he tries to Florida two point eight billion dollars\nI'm going to take that money and I'm all put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor my differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to help him on infrastructure help on transportation Rick Scott Knight who again donuts\nBeen hammering your region your opponent Santa's is now positioning himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to build reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nCertainly different from your Republican sitting Governor Scott my\nOpponent can say anything he wants to in an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times\nAs the mayor of photos capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the ah Florida an aquifer\nAnd where we noticed through our spray field operations that we were contributing to hire nitrate levels and what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new church she every level almost portable level\nTo reduce the number of nitrates going into our groundwater when we get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science put some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluters to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time well\nListen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda\nAnd we recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise\nAnd so we got to start building are more resilient state and yes that in some cases will mean that there are parts of our state we're not going to be able to continue allow growth to take place already insurance an actuarial studies are showing some of these areas that are going to be under water that's\nOf course ... part of our\nTalk with Andrew Gillum this past Monday and as we said yesterday the Tampa Bay times reported that attacks from Guillaume his old friend and lobbyist Adam Corey\nShows that a man they both thought was a developer\nHad Broadway tickets for Gillum and others including Gillum brother now the textbook Corey reads Mike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight Gillum replies awesome news about Hamilton Mike Miller turned out to be an FBI agent part of an undercover investigation into corruption not focusing on Gillum\nGuild says his brother handed in the ticket he assumed his brother pay for it\nHere's what he told us in our conversation\nTell us about the FBI investigation according to New York times ... there was a lobbyist friend of yours that was actually a friend as many of your friends are from your student government days in in college this is Adam Corey who introduce you to men who identified themselves as out of town developers they want to invest in property\nThey turned out to be FBI agents working undercover to investigate community redevelopment agency possible corruption you've said\nThey told you that you are not their target but before you knew they were you make too personal trips with your old friend Adam Corey one to Costa Rica there's questions about whether or not you and your wife paid your share of a home there you say you did\nAnd then another trip to New York where you've said your younger brother but you tickets to see Hamilton you stand by that that your brother gave you have to let it get it and\nGive us your questions will get answers you first funding for here and

[laughter] and we're the here in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan Romney Robin from Europe well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been fending off these charges that he took tickets are Hamilton I mean Hamilton makes it in this race and his share of a vacation that of a couple of friends took\nA you know just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers it turned out to be an FBI agent in a an ... an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke the story of the text\nIn which a Gillum friend a lobbyist told them about this Hamilton ticket or that the developer heads for them Gillum responds awesome\nIt's just going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent is in\nSome polling right yeah I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here in Florida\nThat or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answer these questions I mean almost undoubtedly the dissenters camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies in the story I think\nI think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story\nUm and again it's going to come down to how he answers the question\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know Gillum could I think he's like the third\nI'm democratic I'm a I'm an African American candidate for governor here he would be only the third in the country something like that and he is they couldn't be more different he's a progressive um uh let's hear a dissenters on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship with the president and keep people in the administration Florida has a lot of names from our military footprint our transportation our water resources which been a big problem here and we need to work constructively with the federal government\nAndrew Gillum is running on in teaching Donald Trump I don't know what for but I don't think he's going to be able to do anything productive lay out what the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nIn mind so how is President Trump laying out and say\nWell I mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the Santa Scott the Trump bumps\nIn the sand is was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results the Republican primary was decided\nWell before the Democratic primary that was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for Kennedy\nWell Enrique I said they don't let me bring you in here because the president also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections and that's this and he calls it the caravan of uh some say refugees some say undocumented immigrants making their way through Mexico to the U.S border\nThey are doing something like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that border till December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack\nOn the border how does that resonating where you are in Miami\nThank he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the Caribbean and saying they're all for open borders I think this is one of those uh ... it's certainly a politically charged ... at a very convenient time for the president\nBush said that the issue of immigration front and center which already was to be honest uh in in this election along with health care and and the economy\nUm um I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and um would really see the impact all the coverage and all the attention described and have had in the last couple of days\nAnd that he will have a in the run up to your mid term election uh we'll see that on a ... or ... depending on the turnout both parties I think I read as he was a a turnout election\nWell let's be clear this is a cat and that are reportedly was organized by a church is that it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar in the last one that was of the size of group of people um you know organized\nThey're putting that just three people uh were accepted into the country so there is that but I just just to underscore this Enrique we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block\nUm you will have people who will be of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people are seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point in Florida it's a great example Robin you see a Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nOr someone just stayed in two thousand and sixteen now you're Puerto Rican says many of them who are already in Florida before Monday about all the security Maria\nOver ... have seems a coming to Florida and that are um some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in to resolve\nA for for the governor's race in in in the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and just the Latino community is not a monolithic community different interests and and different agendas\nI Want to turn out to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling uh shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nCenter Nelson and Andrew Gillum\nWill kill the economy fare like high taxes um see Andrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent Sara\nNelson as voting for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher taxes higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd Here's Senator Nelson responding\nWell the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another\nYou keep on going on on every part of my record\nHigh and daily from WFSU here in Tallahassee always colorful but who is not the edge here and I especially with\nThe hurricane that just hit I every time I turn the TV on icy Governor Scott in a little kept visiting you know some terrible you know disaster where a school's roof has been ripped off I mean he is seemingly everywhere so who's who's got the ... year yeah I I mean\nAre you know there was a the latest Quinnipiac poll released I think yesterday had males and we'd uh at about seven points I mean a hurricane recovery obviously inherently political\nUm you know I think Rick Scott being the governor he he had the advantage invisibility and the response to hurricane Michael but Senator Bill Nelson the I think to his credit he visited emergency operations centers in Bay county here in Tallahassee\nVisited rural counties and raise concerns about their their abilities to recover um so yeah I don't I don't think that the hurricane response gave a Scott much of a discernible boost jumping Nelson his whole married right now well\nFunding for here and now comes from math works creators of

at age ... dot com\nAnd fight the herd providing global financial resources and market expertise to clients the world over our W. dot com has more information\nThis week we're talking election security and technology today story starts with old tech paper\nRemember the two thousand presidential election fiasco and the hanging chads you know those little bits of paper that stuck to the paper ballots and confused about counter so much that the Supreme Court eventually had to decide the election well as a result in two thousand to Congress passed the help America vote act\nIt set new voting standards and gave election offices a bunch of money mostly for new electronic voting machines but within a few years election security officials were asking for a good old fashioned paper trail\nAnd so at that time around two thousand six a couple of dozen genders quickly designed a paper trail if they sort of just slapped onto the equipment and it just didn't work\nThat's Dana did before she runs elections in Travis County Texas which includes the city of Austin\nIt was a rather gigantic failure if you can imagine a voting system with a cash register tape under glass this was how most of the voting Arctic trails were developed still very quickly this paper trail fell by the wayside and for many years\nWhat came after was a reminder this failed once vendors we're not going to try it again\nAnd so Dana divorce set out to design her own voting machine she called it star vote it's an acronym for secured transparent audits a bowl and reliable\nSo we're ... what we said was let's try to fix several of the problems that we have\nSystem we wanted it to the very easy for voters to use so it had to be something that they could take the paper out of the machine and look at and examine themselves\nThat system would let both voters and election officials verify that votes were cast correctly after some heavy lifting on and designed to before I went looking for someone to build her dream voting machine and there were no takers\nLast year she went back to the voting machine vendors to see if they could meet just two of her requirements\nOne of them is we must have a paper trail that actually work and we must have the capability to use that paper trail we have to be able to conduct post election audit\nAnd it turns out one company was able to make that work that's\nGood news the marketplace has come a long way even if it has taken his Fifteen Years and the incredible patients of voters to get this far\nUnfortunately the new machines aren't expected to roll out until twenty twenty but paper receipts are finally part of the U.S election assistance commission guidelines for voting machines and ... says that's the key to making sure voters feel confident about voting\nAnd I don't think it's a matter of just trust I think it is actual proof of the veracity of the election once we have a paper trail then I think it's very difficult call any election into

you mentioned former President Clinton former President Obama a CNN\nOf their Time Warner and the George Soros also out a Long Island I Believe you know I'm certainly an act of terror\nAh but I think a sense maybe it tells us two things one there's some really\nCrazy Iraqi people out there dangerous people and to\n... I think that we have our political differences but we all have to be careful about our political rhetoric and I think when you identified member of the opposite party is evil or as the mob or accuse somebody of paying for terrorists to come through Mexico to the United states uh you know words have consequences\nAlison any any to give you an opportunity there because if you're of course referring to President Trump\nAnd didn't they didn't know that you know let's do you think the rhetoric has been ratcheted up to you know especially to talk about the caravan\nA which is you know it's very far away from the U.S border and happens quite frequently these are groups of people organized by you know left leaning church is trying to help people get refugee status very few of them ever make it across the board are your thoughts on that and the language we've been hearing\nRobin we can all agree that the rhetoric began to be heightened well before the caravan and it it's it has got to stop and just started in the ... presidential campaign\nThat the name calling and the the um disparaging comments at a on both sides but but uh it has to stop and I said at all\nThis is using words like mob or you know do you think\nThere's an equivalency ... look the there needs to to be a more civil town in the way we talk people on the left or angry and frustrated and speaking out and people on the right or angry and frustrated and they are speaking out and look at the end of the day\nWhat everyone needs to to take a take stock and and how we disagree how we express our feelings and I have said all along this this needs to be toned down because someone\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

back\nHis administration has also granted fewer felons clemency Scott has approved restoring voting rights to just over three thousand people compared with more than one hundred and fifty thousand under crust\nThat means today more than one point five million people in Florida more than ten percent of the adult population can't vote because of the past felony conviction Eddie Kane is one of them he's been out of prison since two thousand three Cain remembers how it felt to go with his family to the polls on election day unable to cast a ballot\nI sat at a car [laughter] [laughter] I didn't even go into building fell deprived I felt ashamed of failed ignorant there was a real bad feelings that thing that I I haven't even forgive him or suffer feeling like that\nCain says he wants to get his rights back but the process is intimidating and he knows it could take years\nAll of us deserve a chance to show that we can live decently we live alone so other people so I made a commitment um not to go back to prison but I also want to make a commitment to be a productive member of society\nRichard Harris and the Tampa area lawyer says not all felons deserve that chance\nWe should not assume that all one point five million felons a and everybody shooting in Florida State prison system uh have suddenly become good wonderful model citizens\nHarrison the founder of Floridians for a sensible voting rights policy a group that is against a madman for he said there are a fair criticism is that the current process service during voting rights but giving what he calls blanket clemency with uh\nAn act of mercy by the state of Florida and it ought to be decided on an individual case by case basis with due consideration for\nThe seriousness of the crime the nature of any harm that was caused a in a whole lot of other factors that we think reasonable people would think would be important\nBut some law enforcement officials say the current system is making for the less safe Leon county sheriff wall to make Neal agrees with Harris and that it's appropriate to take away some rights from violent criminals\nRelates to other things like ah you know a sexual batters who are keeping them away from kids and the way from schools and and those kind of thing I Believe those are appropriate steps to take but just the fundamental right to vote there is no proof that are taking their right to vote away\nThe tourists them from any other crime whatsoever\nMcNeil points to research from the states on parole condition that showed ex felons who's right to vote was automatically restored under governor crashed were less likely to commit new crimes he says taking away someone's right to vote only serves to diminish their sense of being a citizen\nWhen people feel like they're hopeless and there are shut out of the basic fundamental rights as a citizen then they're more apt in my opinion to uh give up and turned to a lot of crime or 'cause there's no alternatives left to him\nThat's something James Sawyer says he's experienced personally so he went to prison for buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer while on probation he says when he got out not having the right to vote made him feel powerless\nI used to have ideas about who I wanted in office to her next certain things but I never got to vote because I said what I Can't make a difference so really it made me feel less than a citizen account made me feel like well if I'm not a citizen waggling\nRecently got his rights restored and while he's proud to have the right to ...\nAnd ... for me is kind of like a book of yours is part of a ... I'm not a political either and I'm not sure what level do an adjustment for that and like I say I'm not sure\nSeveral recent polls have shown public support for amendment for above the sixty percent threshold it would need to pass but if it fails voting rights advocates have another strategy a group of former felons is suing the state in the case currently before a federal appeals court\nSupporters are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win at the ballot box in November\nFor here now on Chris Bentley in Tallahassee\nWell another legal battle here when all the way to flip Florida Supreme Court in a decision about who has the right to a point three new Supreme Court justices\nTo replace three retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats governor Rick Scott said he should replace the justices before his term ends but the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors responsibility so we the Democrat Andrew Gillum or the Republican Rhonda census will shape the future course\nA hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes were November's election just got higher let's bring in WFSU news director Lynn had her Hyland\nLet me tell you in person um explain this decision you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of timing the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get to hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their terms or up\nIt's already a new governor is in office and that's part of some of the the consideration that did go into that there's also some previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to sort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor wrecks\nA president or former president Brock Obama saying Rick Scott I sympathize with you he of course wanted to do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices who are retiring by ... Lewis\nPicky queens um all part of a ... a liberal bloc of responsible for many this course for three decisions it's a fourth record how important is this\nIt's critical of this is the same for three court that has overturned the legislature on issues like abortion issues like um provisions on voting restrictions on voting that the Republican led legislature has wanted to do in the past that they cut it\nI'm the same court threw out congressional redistricting maps so this court has often thwarted the legislature when they've wanted to put in policies\nAnd the legislature has responded by calling you know the Supreme Court activist judges that's been a term that's been floated around so a lot of there for three decisions have really come down on some of these hot button social issues and that's been a big sticking point in the point of contention between Republican leaders\nAnd this particular Supreme Court though the makeup of this court matters because these are issues that aren't going away the Florida Legislature under its Republican leadership is likely to continue pushing these things as they have in\nThe past well this is also become a big part of your gubernatorial race here we've been talking about it today Ron sent us a spokesperson warned and he's the Republican or that or the Democrat Andrew Gillum would bow to pressure by out of state radical groups to pick 'em these activists judges that you just referred to houses that factoring into that campaign\nWell it's certainly playing a role in the conversation um but I don't think it's sort of raise and to a level where most people are actively thinking about you know who whoever gets the governorship will make\nPoint you know you're right because we've been asking people on the street you know he's got the big decision you know you've got to speak\nA conversation at a question that has gone back really for decades um we had the first attempt to do this and twenty fourteen through a constitutional amendment that would have given the power to basically governors gotten that failed so this is not the first time but I think once you get to these sorts of questions voters are just like I don't really know you know they're not\nJoined us for America abroad tonight at nine o'clock\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

two legal thrillers set in Mississippi the state regression practice law in served in the legislature before becoming a full time author Grisham sold more than two hundred and Seventy five books around the world\nAnd continues to engage readers with new novels before coming to Cleveland this week he spoke with idea streams carry wise\nOr you are well loved are there you were practicing lie what made you want to become a novelist in the first place\nIt wasn't that I never sat down one day and said okay I'm tired of being a lawyer I'm going to be a writer\nOr it doesn't work that way I don't think really for anybody you have to have you have to have a career a job hopefully something that is fulfilling you know ah financially and emotionally something you enjoy doing\nAnd you have to treat your writing is a very serious hobby but something on the side some you get to whenever you can something you can squeeze in a few hours a week writing and that's what I did\nI was busy as a lawyer busy as a state lawmaker busy as a father young father my wife was having babies life life was really good we had a good life\nAnd I had this urge to try and capture\nOn paper or a powerful courtroom drama that I had a sort of created as seen through the eyes of a young idealistic log in a small town in Mississippi and that's\nThat's where the story came from and it took three years to write a time to kill again you know Fifteen minutes here thirty minutes there an hour there whenever I could get to it\nAnd I was lucky enough to get it published almost Thirty years ago and it however it was a total flop 'em in the book did not sell in um there were there was never a reprint are paperback initially\nAnd I told my my my wife I said look I'm gonna I'm gonna try one more book and if it doesn't work then I'm going to stop this law\nEverything changed well the term is\nIn our county to county system are very likely the most requested book of yours ever can you talk a little bit about your inspiration for the firm which many people also know the movie version\nYeah yeah you know the movie was a huge movie that came out in Nineteen Ninety three with Tom Cruise and Gene Hackman and directed by city park it was a it was a it it's still the biggest movie of all the movies adapted from my books and there'd been eight or nine of them the firm is still the highest grossing\nFilm and you always have a soft spot in my heart for the book and for the movie and for Tom Cruise it was really a big deal that the the the inspiration was that goes back to law school when\nI was not um let's say I was not a top student in law school I was a serious student but I wasn't the top of my class but my my best friend was and he uh had a number of interviews and\nA job offers and he came back to school when we came from a long visit somewhere I think Atlanta or someplace like that him and he said that law firm has kind of weird it's not very big\nAnd I got the impression that once you joined that law firm you never leave\nAnd that kind of stuck with me over the years and he did not take a job they went somewhere else so I never got the full story but uh just you know I had this idea for a story I wasn't planning on writing it I just remembered it and so when it was time for\nThe second novel to riot or a pitched the idea to my wife and she really liked the idea pitches to to my agent in New York and he really liked the idea so I I ... a little bit faster in and finish the ferman in two years\nAny thoughts about their reckoning becoming a movie is that something you're interested in\nI'm always interested because of the movies are very important to ah to the books and to the audience and to the bran and it ... you know we all just watch a good movie\nAnd you know we'll we'll get some interest us some phone calls a it's so hard to get a movie made these days because um Hollywood wants to make different you know they're they're they're all making a\nSpiderman five or whatever that they they don't make they're not too many good adult dramas made today and that's you know I I have not had a movie made in Fifteen Years and and again I I Would love to have 'em all filmed\nNow people know still seem very captivated with stories about lying crime whether it is in books or ... or films what do you think it is about crime and the law\nAnd you know it's a it's a it's our DNA and we just you know as Americans we just love\nStories about lawyers and we have so many lawyers we have so many switch litigation we have so many law firm is ... ... you know we we have so many rights or as as a people\nWe we have all these rights that we think we have a weird guarantee and if somebody a messes with our rights or whatever we were you know we won't do we want to do justice and we won't we go hire a lawyer and we\nFoul also just vets who we are we also have unfortunately too much crime and so to me murders and so that lends to a lot of um a lot of fiction law but a lot of good stories a lot of human suffering anytime you have tragedy the suffering you have you have great stories and you know with our history\nOr just like in the reckoning it takes place in you know the Jim Crow south in Nineteen forty six where there's a there's a lot of conflict and tragedy and suffering and that's why I think so many stories come out of the south\nAre you already working on another novel and if you lie or would you be willing to say anything about it\nSure a a few years ago I started a kid series it's called Theodore boom\nKid lawyer it's about a Thirteen year old kid who thinks is a lawyer and I've written six of those probably six\nYear and will publish should probably early summer of next year and time for the you know the kids to get out of school so I'm ... I'm always reading something on January the first to reach us start\nAh the next legal thriller and I'm a give myself about six months to write that than you know that's I have plenty of time to write so I'm I'm I'm doing two books a year now\nWell the collections manager at our Cuyahoga County library said that she thinks you're a fan favorite of readers because you don't take the audience for granted and you keep things interesting so how do you keep things interesting\nWe'd all starts with a plot or you know I ... I don't start with characters normally\nI think of a good plot and uh obviously with the legal setting and that's why I spend a lotta time following trials in litigation and farms and lawyers and stuff like that but you know I think I have a knack for spotting a real good story or creating one\nYou must hear from people who are aspiring to write as well what advice do you offer to keep people interested in trying to write\nA yeah I Try to stay away from advice because people hear what they want to hear and advice as easy to to given even easier to ignore it you know if you're serious about riding you've got to have a good story\nAnd you've got to reach a point where you're writing at least one page every day\nAnd until you're doing a pager day nothing is going to happen you got to have a story\nAnd the discipline to ride a little bit every day in the course of the year to you got a full length manuscript and um you can't use Thomas excuse nobody has enough time for anything uh you got if you're serious about you've got to find Fifteen minutes for thirty minutes or an hour a day somewhere to ride at least one\nWhat brings you hear\nA tell you what I Love Cleveland um about four years ago I had a um medical problem\nAnd I felt the best doctors in the world and uh all roads ran to Cleveland to the clinic there and I found a great doctor he fix the problem and I'm perfectly healthy now so [laughter] very fond place in my heart for a for Cleveland\nWell I think Cleveland has defined place and it's hard for you and you certainly a we'll have a crowd on Thursday\nLooking forward to it thanks so much for taking time today thank you\nJohn Grisham speaking with idea streams carry wise tomorrow evening he stops in Cleveland for a sold out event with the writer's center stage series put on by case and the Cuyahoga County library to hear our entire conversation with\nGrisham head on line to applause dot Idea Stream dot org this is hearing now between Santa Claus on I'd point to stick around\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "24"}
