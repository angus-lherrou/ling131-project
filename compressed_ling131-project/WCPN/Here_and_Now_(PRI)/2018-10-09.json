I Would say you have I Know rents thousands of government documents about this what did you learn from them\nAbout how the citizenship question came up out in the first place\n[noise] all these documents were part released in part as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question and I really key document is an internal memo written by\nCommerce secretary Wilbur Ross who as our secretary oversees the Census Bureau and the twenty twenty senses\nAnd it it he says that he initially thought about adding a citizenship question to twenty twenty cents is as soon as shortly after he became ... the Senate confirmed him as commerce secretary so this would be late February of twenty Seventeen\nAnd then a over those months he\nWorked with his staff at the commerce secretary to find a way to get this question a citizenship question on to the census and this is a question that asks\nIs this person a citizen of the United states it's a topic that the Census Bureau has not asked all us households since the Nineteen fifty cents is although there have been a there's been a citizenship question on a smaller Census Bureau survey that's now known as the American Community Survey\nWhat reasons then does the administration gave her why it doesn't want secretary Ross to testify about it at least what the thing about his reasons\n[noise] well the Justice Department's a which is ...\nWould decide these lawsuits based on the documents these internal documents that they're released as part of the law suits\nAnd not on depositions questioning of Wilbur Ross ah and trying to get into his intent is mindset but that's exactly what the plaintiffs in these lawsuits and you know dozens of states cities and other groups that want this question removed\nThey say they really want to a better understand exactly why commerce secretary Wilbur Ross went to add this question because the Trump Administration said\nThey wanted to add up because of the voting rights act and he wanted responses from a citizenship question to better enforced section to the voting rights act which has protections\nAgainst discrimination of racial and language minorities\nAre essentially to make sure those groups have the right to vote 'em that the law the federal government has relied on other another kind of citizenship data from the American Community Survey of 'em and uh the ... says that data is not enough or is not accurate enough\nUm and it needs it on the descending on the twenty twenty cents as plaintiffs are very skeptical of that and they are concerned that there are other other motives here involved or one of the internal memos or one of the emails released as part of the lawsuits include a communication between\nA Kris Kobach the current Republican gubernatorial candidate as well as the former vice chair of President Trump's now defunct\nCommission on voter fraud he wrote to Wilbur Ross are trying to lobby Wilbur Ross do at a citizenship question and his concern\nWas that undocumented unauthorized immigrants are counted in census numbers used to divide up\nThe congressional seats are among the states after the census\nOr all of this comes at a really pivotal time for the Census Bureau itself on the Senate has not yet confirmed President Trump's new appointee to lead the agency or the Twenty one twenty census is going to be the first to be conducted in ...\nWell they are the Census Bureau has really anxious to find out exactly will the citizenship question that Wilbur Ross edible at stay or will it go and we probably won't find out until a few months\nAnd that's really pushing up against a deadline that the Census Bureau spacing of what to exactly prints on the forms are this will be the first online census but paper will play an important part for live households that may not be comfortable or don't have access to Internet and so they will need paper\nAnd so this is a really big question right now that hopefully the lawsuits will resolve a from the census bureau's perspective and other big questionable they the sense of being able to hire enough workers to collect a information from households around the country\nOkay thank

trying to say bye shredding painting\nIn my opinion and I think he's trying to say that his wife is not for sale it's not the fast time his what has gone up for sale and and it's something that has been done without his consent this time I had to see I I\nI think if the painting was away at him saying my wife is not for one passed in it for everybody and because the painting it shut it off to the Hummer wetlands\nIt was a way of him saying they swapped doesn't belong to anybody he never paints they never does his graffiti odds in a place that\nCan belong to one pass and he does it in public spaces he does than in places where it would be very difficult for me than anybody to claim that that all walk\nAnd I think not what he did he wants his message and he wants his what to be for everybody rather than ... take ownership is at other theories I've had a he wants his wife to have a great ...\nOf the times I've had that he wants his wife to be priceless that could be it could be a number of things and and my personal opinion is that he just doesn't want anyone to in his message\nNow one of the questions people are asking is how do you hide or Schroeder inside a picture frame without anybody noticed the auction house was enormous\n... and because he has pace defeat the eighties Instagram Shea how he went about building the frame himself and installing a shredder inside um

do you take the would become sort of temple moments on the musical how do you take that in translated into a book\nIt is an interesting process of how do you get inside of characters head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as a novel because the book\nAllows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way to the song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and same token we also felt like we wanted this to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't slaves ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow bill any a sweaty palms this is very special to people all these characters and especially Evan Hansen really means something to young people then he's in your hands I'm Glad I didn't speak to you\nAnd line I'm In Evan first monologue in the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say and then also had sweaty hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being sweaty they're becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before here but I felt like I knew how to do this or emotion I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity\nAnd the intensity with with which people had attached themselves to have and and the other characters\nWell talk more about this notion that you're writing about suicide you Erica I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize that's\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know um was the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nThat we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of there is in a in a mission they gave me to tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's the him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experienced joy I'm or was it all\nYou know I'm darkness they don't want to get anything away but I have to say we actually find out ... and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him and some people may not want to know that\nYeah this is Steven yeah I think that's\nThe show wanting to know more about Connor but do you really want to know more about counter or do you want to imagine more about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it\nIs that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does\nAnd it was important to us that it not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for our times of what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media Evan and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country\nIt's a cautionary tale you know what can happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're you know doing it and you're on a national stage there's that\nBut a bench pass it and I just didn't Paul I understand that while you did they did what to do how much to do more in a book than you did in the musical you fans we're already doing it than section they were they were writing about Evan and Conor what might happen\nYeah this is just than you know that that was something that was inspiring to us in terms of doing a novel adaptation was\nSeeing that there were a fans around the country around the world who had never seen the show maybe they had listened to the cast album or read watched a clip on line or something and\nThey were beginning to create their own stories with these characters and interactions that might have been between evident Connor and\nAnd I'm a particular curiosity about Connor which is you know partially what inspired us people wanting to engage with these characters and that's what gave us the confidence to do this and the first place it is a conversation starter for\nFamilies you know moms can see elements of their kids that their kids won't talk about you know out loud and and and kids will\nHide ugly truth about ourselves that part is the interesting thing is because because I think it's a given that people come and talk about oh this is like my family but the I think the more interesting and somewhat heartbreaking stories or the adult so grown people who are in their forties fifties sixties coming and saying I'm Evan or that was me or that that's how I still feel are I'm Still trying to\nCore and gifts by printing digital photos directly on glass

refugees and migrants to Europe continues within eighty four thousand men women and children mostly from Syria Iraq and Africa\nHave arrived in Spain Italy and Greece this year every day more than one hundred people arrive on the Greek island of Lesbos\nThe first faces they see are those of humanitarian aid workers to help them reach the shore get clothing and food and healthcare and temporary shelter\nAid workers the trauma up close nearly every day for months and that takes a toll they have high levels of depression exhaustion and even pi TST that can last for years\nNow the George Washington university global mental health program is drawn up a version of the Hippocratic Oath to address the problem\nThe ancient originated increase it calls for new physicians to swear to abide by ethical standards Philip can deal is is one of the doctors behind this new version\nIt's still the general principles of caring for patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits Cuban confidence that continue to this day\n... is professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned it to monitor and ideals was\nTheir team and take care of themselves recognizing that there is a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first they have to take care of their teams they have to make sure that they stay within their areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of when she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a Syrian section on a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult uh in in desperate\nSaid you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath ear able to give her permission to say I can't\nRight that's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work do you think\nThis is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point uh our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that were going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\nOne of the things that you and your colleagues have noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shores if Greece a pretty ... quite community\nHow has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that we've\nBeen impressed that the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity that even those who are\nSo we learned that many of them had grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange of populations in the Nineteen twenties\nIn the ah follows me or not they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone seemed to have an immigrant story they married someone from outside Greece these workers you talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants in one sense and therefore this kind of work takes on a a shared the humanitarian motivation\nJust have one more question um I have no need for quite some time and I know you're as you said Greek American you go to Greece quite often because of the refugee crisis\nBut I Wonder what it was like for you to be in one of the cradle of modern medicine implementing a very different kind of hypocritical for a very different reason from what the original one was drawn up for me personally what is this like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise that I've learned here in the states and take it back to the origins of you know my family's migration in the Nineteen fifties so my family left Greece after er during the civil unrest there after World War two\nAnd to be able to go back\nAnd offer what I can we were just there in September talking to folks in so long ago and asked them about the work that we do and a recruiting help from the Greek psychiatric community so being able to collaborate in this way has been both professionally I'm personally fulfilling\nPhilippine Dallas thank you
