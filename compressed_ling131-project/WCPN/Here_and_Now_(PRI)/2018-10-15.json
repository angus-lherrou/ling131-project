Boston and Geico celebrating over Seventy five years of providing auto insurance for drivers across America more information on auto insurance available at Geico dot com\nWay and pundits and politicians are working hard to make predictions about how they'll turn out we often look for protection tell us what will happen in politics and the economy and technology\nAnd in other things but as the saying goes making predictions is hard especially about the future so how do you do it well joining us now is Dan gardener who's the author of future babble and super forecasting the art and science of protection Dan welcome\nHi Jeremy so why is it that we humans always want to know what's going to happen in the future when it's really hard to do that in a lot of ways yeah uh it\nReally stems from a really fundamental need we have a need a psychologically rooted need for control a sense of control of our environment\nAnd what do you need for control of your environment you need to know you need to know what's happening now or if you're looking into the future you need to know what's going to happen and if you look into the future\nAnd you've got important questions on your mind and all you see as a swirling vortex of uncertainty that's deeply disturbing you have to our race bat uncertain and one way that we erased uncertainty is by turning to experts in saying please tell me what's going to happen next\nWhen the experts that I think of when it comes to productions that get it pretty right at least in the not too distant future weather forecasters yeah I have an app that tells me in ten minutes it's going to start raining exactly where you are right now um but you know where are we good at it and where we bad at it\nWell it's interesting that you highlight weather forecasters because of course people tend to make jokes about weather forecasters they always get things wrong yeah exactly the opposite in fact weather forecasting is the gold standard of forecasting\nNow the big difference between the weather forecasters in one of the reasons why they're so good and so many other domains [noise] is it the weather forecasters know how good they are and they know when they ...\nOr that's pretty certain or there's a good chance that\nA and nobody keeps track they'd do keep score and so if you look at\nThe big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else [noise]\nUm they don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records we don't know how accurate the are\nIn the same way that we know how good a baseball player is by looking at his batting average in is the goal of a forecast to change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's gonna happen or once you think you know what's gonna happen\nThat will change the outcome\nThis is an absolutely essential point very often when you talked about forecasting people talk about well how do you make an accurate forecast but very very often when forecasts are made\nIt's not actually accuracy that people are interested in there all sorts of other reasons why people make forecasts so you know a pundit on television might be making a forecast because it's ideologically congenial for the audience that very often happens\nOr they might be making a forecast because it's shocking and it's interesting and entertaining [noise]\nUm there's all sorts of these other competing interests\nIn one of those is to cause change so for example if I warned that some terrible thing is about to happen it's not necessarily that I Believe that is in fact the case it may be that I'm trying to spur others to action in order to prevent this suppose a catastrophe [noise]\nUm so we have to be careful when we're looking at a forecast we have to ask ourselves is this person just trying to give me the straight good to be as accurate as possible or do they have other interests at stake\nWhat are some big flops some production failures that stand out in your memory\nWell I always liked to say that the Nineteen seventies or the golden era of failed productions\nMass global starvation within a couple of decades [noise] wrong or and then the Nineteen seventies were absolutely stuffed with the most amazing forecasts and and happily for humanity most of those forecasts which were wrong we're all dismal they all said we're going to run out of oil um\nWill it reminds me of Y. two K. right that we all thought that general is going to end with two thousand came along and nothing happened\nThat's that's exactly right Y. two K. was another one there is a very long litany of these things but you know a one of the unfortunate aspects about forecasting is this\nIf I go back to old forecasts and say hey do you remember what that guy said ten years ago well let's take a look at what happened and it turns out it's wrong\nI can tell you from experience that people kind a yawn [laughter] because it's an old forecast who cares about old forecasts old forecasts are old news but if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right\nThen they will be introduced as the person who got it right and we all have to listen to this person because they tell us what's gonna happen next and as a result the rule with expert predictions so often is heads I win tails you forget we had a bad\nRight well you think about that every time somebody who figured out that President Trump was going to win when much of the media thought that he would not when a when he did win you know there are a few journalists out there like I said at look at my tweet from you know two months ago I said it was going to happen you up\nAnd you know look it's a there's an old saying about me a mutual funds you know you start five hundred mutual funds and you just bet on all sorts of different stocks and ... by sheer happenstance one or two of them will hit big\nAnd then you hold up your one or two that had big and you say look at this what a brilliant invest right and well forecast very often function like that you can't judge the quality of a forecaster by a single forecast\nThat stand gardener who is author of the book future battle\nCast political and otherwise at here now dot org\nNow to the environmental fallout from one of the most destructive fires in California history in late July the Carr Fire swept through parts of the city of reading and the surrounding area\nToday residents are faced with burning hillsides burned hillsides and more than a thousand homes sites contaminated with toxic ash Liam

capital of the world\nIn the twenty\nThis area\nWent from a textile industry into\nManufacturing jewelry part and finding and those textile mills became the factory the building that we're in right now was attacked\nIn Rhode Island how it is still the industry [laughter] and read a lot of it has changed a lot and a lot of\nPeople would say manufacturing and the U.S [noise] you know has diminished\nAnd my response to that is there was a time when we struggled but anyone you talk to that knows anything will say it's coming back\nThat people aren't that satisfied with going overseas and they prefer to have something that in the usa\nAre you happy with the direction of the state is going\nI think we could do better um but I think that gets into politics and I'm not going there\nFor the politicians are\nWhen I ran for governor we had one of the highest unemployment rate to the country\nAt a recent debate Gina Raimondo took credit for bringing in Rhode Island out of the recession\nIn fact for most of the year that Iran we had beaten the highest unemployment rate in the country and in some industries like the building trades unemployment was over twenty percent people were hurting so I did get to work and I got to hurt changing the way we do economic development [noise]\nWhat she means is tax\nBreaks Raimondo lured big companies like Johnson and Johnson and a division of GDP with generous financial incentives her opponent Alan ... who was mayor of the city of Cranston is not impressed\nWith culture but the governor subscribe to a corporate welfare [noise] those millions that have been given for many uh developments that\nProduced only a few construction job no long term jobs that's going to be dramatically reformed and many of those millions are going to be caught\nAnd fun has his own challenges in this blue state he has to tout his conservative credentials without hewing too closely to President Trump and then there's this wild card\nYou deny our knowledge and draw boats from Mr fall I Want to draw votes from both of her jokes\nWas the chair of President Trump's twenty sixteen campaign in Rhode Island\nOf ...\nGreat in their in their lives into Burma [laughter] I'm tired of the party politics\nSo how will vote was three candidates do in the race is more\nThey get some answers to that question I went to this very busy street corner in downtown Providence of course the capital of this tiny little state and I asked Maureen locally for some guy that she's a political scientist and she's been following politics in the state for very long time\nI Lived in Rhode Island to thirty three years so you know the lay of the land\nIs pretty much yeah why did you bring me right here in this spot in downtown Providence\nI thought if we were talking about this race this would be a good place to illustrate some of the changes that have gone on in the past decade that we were in worse shape after and during the recession we were at the bottom\nAnd we were the last to come out of the recession you know I've\nHeard this a couple of times talking to Rhode Island or if you were the first to go in and you were one of the last to come out right\nAnd I think that's because we had a a workforce that was relatively uh on train for new technology but up until fairly recently\nThey were able to make a living in manufacturing a good middle class where they\nFought in his little cottages down at the shore and things like that\nBut all that changed you know in the eighties and nineties and so in the recession hit we really weren't prepared for what was coming and it struck it it really hit us very hard how much did that pain affect the political psyche of the people here\nI think they were pretty cynical about politics if we had been so long at a disadvantage economically and people people are promised things and not a lot of big changes occurred\nA Republican administration that attempted to a fun with state funds are gaming sort of video game for Curt Schilling\nSet when Boston Boston Red Sox pitcher for the Boston Red Sox Fisher it cost us like you know over like Ninety million dollars initially we got some of the money back\nBut that really gave people a jaded for sex ed on economic redevelopment and what people were doing the added to the you know the the long downturn sort of deep recession we had\nThis was an attempt to pull us out and\nIt failed and it left\nPeople pretty cynical and yet here we are today twenty Eighteen we're about to come up on the mid term elections in a big gubernatorial election here in Rhode Island and we see construction crews here was harder work on a project\nRight well the thing is we are in a good spot now in other words we have come out of this recession our unemployment numbers are above the national average I think that's why you see all the trains in the sky and so forth\nLet's talk about Alan from he is a Republican and the polls do show Raimondo ahead but not by that much\nIs that a surprise to you in a blue state like this is going to be an interesting race it's not going to be a cakewalk for gain a reminder she's going to have to work really hard and she's gonna have to get out of her voters so in that sense I Am not surprised there are people in this day who are concerned about\nOld Rhode Island what it was like an hour songs message resonates with them\nGot a good story he's got a good story he's the son of Chinese immigrants he worked in a um Chinese restaurant\nHe went to a local college where she is yeah Harvard roads are so it's a very very different picture the\nMost recent University of New Hampshire poll which came out after a conversation with Maureen locally has ... pulling ahead but even in\nWill do well we

leadership what's wrong with the way the state's going\nThe pension funds are not funded that's the problem now you brought up\nA very controversial point Gina Raimondo and what you did with the pension does that's something that's still bothers you that's\nThe ... and people started walk with\nPensions that have been caught this wrong\nWhen Gina Raimondo with state treasurer and Rhode Island

Chapman is a professor of management at UC Berkeley ... school of business\nHer research focused on the tech industry and found that narcissistic CEOs tend to pay themselves more and pay their executives less they get involved in more lawsuits because they take more risks than they need to and they tend to hire people more for their loyalty then their skills are judgment\nI asked her if the myth of the genius founder means a lot more nurse assistant tech\nWe hear a lot about CEOs who our founders in the technology industry adopting behaviors that appear high on the narcissism scale\nBut in the end there are as many founders who are not narcissistic as they're our founders who are nurses cystic\nSo it's not really a causal factor you don't have to be a nurse is is to be a founder\nIt sounds like it's hard though to disentangle those two things those two perceptions right\nIt's very hard to disentangle them particularly if you think about being a board of directors who selecting a new CEO and the c._e._o. is savvy enough to put his or her best foot forward it's much easier to see the energy and division\nMuch um he or she will claim credit for success and so forth and so you know one recommendation is to really build into evaluation tools\nThe ability to get a much more nuanced understanding of these kind of downsides of the narcissistic personality what will it take for companies to get better boards of directors to get better venture capitalists\nTo get better at weeding out these personalities well I think what's so tempting in the entrepreneurial world is that in fact entrepreneurs are almost\n... selected based on having\nDelusions of grander right thinking up things that haven't existed before and having confidence in those visions\nWhat boards of directors need to do though is go further and try to evaluate not just the idea and the confidence of the person proclaiming the idea\nBut what is there a long term source of knowledge going to be are they going to only rely on their own instinct and their own ideas\nJennifer Chapman is a professor of management at UC Berkeley toss school of business I should point out here that narcissism isn't unique

temperatures and not taken out of my bag a well they're called adopt part of the echo family and in my household we have a a big echo in the living room and a little dots here and there throughout the house\nLet's be honest I mean uh I don't like your wife to hear this like you do refer to this as your new\nGirl than it is yes go is definitely my new girlfriend the fact of the matter is that she wakes me up in the morning she sings me to sleep at night sounds like a girlfriend\nAnd I would just like like there's so many more devices\nAlso thinking that there's just got to be voices going all the time you're talking to Alexa and asking her to turn a light on or off at ten you know the radio on or off or you know testing your blood or it just it feels like there's a Greek chorus fire you know there's\nA lot of chatter that goes on in the house no doubt I'm very lucky that I Know braille so I'm a portion of my access to information comes back to Lisa nobody gets to what's going on\nBut one of the absolute phenomenon in my household is I get out of bed first had to the bathroom I turn on the shower the sink flush the toilet and step on to my talking scale 'cause I don't want the rest of the household here with the bad news or the morning is from that talking scale\nSo we learned the mascot we control volume and with the new eco family only the one closest to you responds so you don't have this problem saying something down the hallway only habit change something in the living room yeah that kind of thing that\nI mentioned braille a moment ago no braille\nHaven't been around that long a just a couple of hundred years and it still under development ah we recently adopted an international standard for English Braille because they're the Brits wrote braille differently than the Americans than the Australians\nBut the big change in braille\nIs what's called refresh will break I'm going to turn on this orbit reader mhm it looks like a hand held labeled printer [noise]\nWhat's it doing little dots electro mechanical dots are raising up in the pattern of braille characters now a couple of years ago I was showing you a refresher will braille display\nAnd you

have\nUsable vision so out of those who are legally blind about eight out of him have some usable vision so we use closed circuit TV devices I'm going to turn this one on ...\nLooks like a very small TV\nYou know come on yet it gives me controls\nTo show things in magnification to increase the magnification decrease it changed the polarity of things so my view things better white on black than black on white defined I can switch that can also take a picture with it\nA at a distance bring it closer to my face and be able to control that magnification as well and if you do have a large TV in your living room you can attach this to that\nAnd use it screen but the device that's on your camera on your device and really enlarging image so grandparents ... with low vision can see pictures of their grandkids are so this makes it very portable for them to do that when it's like\nWe know you have catch the bus that's an application that it can help you find bus stops learn a rival departure times blind square that a GPS application just like foursquare but I Want to see the a device that helps you know the color of your clothing\n[laughter] so the color identifier that are brought to show your last time cost three hundred and fifty dollars this one costs twenty six wow and this is maybe a temp the side so that one yeah it's like a car key fob exactly [laughter] I'm going to hold it against my type ...\nJak orange that trait dark dark red states [noise] be [noise]\nI'm wearing a looking black pants oh grain and [noise]\nThat tells me guess what the batteries dying [laughter]

that get help with so I'm going to take off my regular\nDesigners shades here mhm and put on a pair of glasses but they have a camera mounted just above the no no way\nSo I'm now going to take a phone it's specifically a over rice and phone that has only one purpose and that's to do what I'm about to do with it for a variety I ready for service and now if I double tap on the home button on this phone it's calling in Iran agent\nAt connecting to the aging Tony [noise]\nHey Cody Brian here I'm I'm doing a demonstration of Ira for public radio Hi Cody and across the way here is my interview

I'm sure\nFunding for here and now\nMotors with home improvement professionals for a variety of home projects for minor repairs to major re models homeowners can read reviews of local pros and book appointments online at home advisor dot com\nAnd Geico offering motorcycle an RV insurance more information available on motorcycle an RV insurance at ... dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto this is Ninety\nPoint trees hearing now featuring the Santa Claus Idea Stream stamp collector\nA modest coming tree wrote a book store managers being honored this weekend for her impact in the northeast Ohio literary scene\nWe now continue our conversation with Cleveland arts prize winner Suzanne Vega town of ... books she spoke with ideastream David see burned out about the shots long history which included occasional visits from fame writer Harvey peak are\nHarvey was um he lived in the neighborhood and he was a regular when the book came out we would do book signings he didn't frequent the store that much he'd like to get deals and so his favorite thing to do was to go to either library sales or he was really good friends with ... and so he was on you know had to kill us at ... workshop\nAnd aquarium kinda rare books and yeah\nYeah and I think they had a intellectual connection to Harvey was you know almost a scholar and his reading and thinking and um so he liked to engaging in Syria discussions\nNow you've expanded from the poetry readings and and and you do have book clubs you have community meetings and I swear if I'm at a literary event anywhere in the region it's not unusual to hear\nAnd after the speakers done Susan dig a town I was in the back selling books you know so you're that's a lot to do you're pretty busy person or have been at least\nUm our staff does a lot of the ... day my staff gets the credit for a lot of what we do at the store and offsite too because\nWith libraries and with reading series it's really fun for us to go on to the community with the books um and I think one of the reasons that this this growth happened in our business was when um [noise]\nUh porters closed and just locally closed I think that they had been engaged by a lot of these people before that and then um so the reading series kind of looked around and you know started inviting our local bookseller to do them so\nWe would use started there was no threat of online retailing back then but but big box stores were sort of a competition one borders was running full was was that an issue for you grows\nWell there were a lot of bookstores at one time there was um the Barnes and noble border several locations Joe so fast and then our local independents I'm loving very apple tree and a visible voice uh those\nWere ... were do those were in neighborhoods those are kind of like you I wouldn't see them as competition on our would be well\nWell we're it's so it was an ecology what people tend to do was to just go to the big box stores they they never looked around for the neighborhood stores so we were there we were always there and the people didn't seem to ... I mean we always have had ... ... a little customers\nBut you know the masses were just looking for the chain store so when the chain stores closed people looked around and said oh there's ... there's this beautiful store on large where\nThere's apple tree and Cedar Fair amount that you know been there forever so\nSo then people took note of our stores and um we started to stabilize and thrive I think before that we were all getting along and doing what you do when you love your work you know you don't get paid that much\nBut um you're you're passionate about it and you're energized by it you know it's intellectually satisfying because there's always new books there's always customers talking about books\nAnd so when our stores got busier you know we probably all got steadier paychecks but nothing\nAnd of bookstores are surviving if not thriving and a lot of main street stores are opening again a lot of neighborhood stores are opening again\nAnd um I think there's um we've kinda figured out ways to um be a neighborhoods being communities and some best practices to make that work and and each store is totally reflection of their neighborhood and they're surrounding community\nAnd a to point out you survived ongoing drew for a long time but you're not alone ...\nAntiques Thirty Years' passport to Peru forty years record revolution fifty years yeah and you're what thirty six or so\nWell our stores forty years old and we've been country for thirty six years\nSo so what what's behind that does is it just ... time warp on the street or well I think it's\nA good story to do business I mean it's a it's a wonderful walking area it's it's it's not too long so people can start at one end and go down to the other um we've we've always had great restaurants on the street that attract people we have um you know a transitional population of students who are constantly refreshing coming in and out\nAnd then we have the neighbors that I'm living in the surrounding areas who like to shop in our local business districts and then\nYou always had people from you know as far away as eerie or you know a places in ... county I'm coming in um to experience something they might not having their own cities and their own places\nSo uh I think it's been attractive for a number of different reasons has always been kind of a bohemian neighborhood um it's very diverse which is what we've always loved about it and so I think people feel at home there I feel comfortable there and uh I think because it's sort of the chain of\nYou know shops and restaurants it's very comfortable to go from one to the other and and also uh I've always said I think if there's a very lively street culture people can hang out on the street and tie\nGoing back and forth it's very easy to go back and forth between your store and Tommy's restaurant where there's been a little pass through there forever and ever\nYeah but when we moved into our current location was Nineteen Ninety three and um the building had just been renovated after a fire and our spot was a part of our time is it used to have done and uh\nThat that door was cut in there as a as a walkway during the renovations and we just kind of left it there after we moved and\nSo yeah I think it's nice that our customers can um go and have something to eat at Tommy's and come back and browse and Tommy's customers like to be able to browse while they're waiting for the new one yeah so it's been a really nice um ... relationship\nThe death of the book has long been predicted we're we're we're now will tangible books survive\nYeah I think people love to browse stores they just they just want to go into these individual environments because every stores are tailored to their community and they're all different from each other so people like to go into these different stores and and browse and see what's out there um\nYou've ... you've come to terms with the Kendal for yet\nBecause our customers seem to like to do both states will find ... times when they prefer to read you know on their on their a reader or their phone or you know they they also want to read read books and they want a browser books and another thing too is um\nLenny and generation on our big readers least of course we are seeing the readers but um they're very jazzed about books and people um all ages of people who use social media\nWill um share information all the time about books and reading a lot of information about books gets exchanged that way people see a post on Instagram about a book and they'll get excited about ... looking for it so I think all that just feeds into I'm kind of a new book culture that's really more exciting than ever\nWe're looking back on this anniversary or their anecdotes along\nCome through over the years um and so I have a lot of memories of of those I think one of the brave his performance as I ever saw was a poll by the name of\nNervousness who did a reading at a store near the end of his life he had a brain tumor he brought an extra lamp and a magnifying glass so that he could read his poetry wow and so that was very memorable to me I think the public Diane ... who's a contemporary of care whack and Ginsburg\nOne year I was her hostess and she uh she came to the bookstore and read and uh so that is always a treasured memory for me because I've always not only told her poetry but her her memoir that she wrote\nAnd um another event that I remember that just happened recently a there is a um artist named Dave shared and he died a number of years ago he was from Cleveland he went out to California in the late sixties he was part of the whole underground comics revolution he was an illustrator for the fabulous ... brothers and\nA guy by the name of ... and got very interested in him and just edited this beautiful coffee table book about Dave shared and work and uh\nSo mark was in town and um they shared an had gone to saint Joe high school and all of his classmates came to the event it was just beautiful to see us old friends they or someone who has contributed to the book and to remember Dave shared and who is is kind of a legendary figure but I think not many of us around here no him I\nGet excited about the you know the events that were doing and and the authors that were presenting\nAnd and that has made for very rich experience over the years I can I can probably like a dozen stories to tell you about that\nSusan ... of the connector congratulations on the anniversary and congratulations on the Cleveland arts", "year": "2018",
