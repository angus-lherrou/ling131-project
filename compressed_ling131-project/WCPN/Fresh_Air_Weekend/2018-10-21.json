S. midterms approach to look at the identity politics have left and right and their impact on democracy\nOn a panel this week in the studio with me here Adrian ... professor of politics the University of Kent nine or drive a novelist and journalist yeah ... ... lecture on government at Harvard University\nAnd in Cambridge be involved that go Paul I lecture at an English at Cambridge University will come to you all I'd like to begin by asking each of you will seize identity politics will do you mean by it Priya\nIdentity politics is I think to ... that has been given and is used to describe\nPlanes for civil rights claims to full citizenship and claims to social justice and identity politics\nIs I think a somewhat pejorative term which has been given to demonstrate equality and full citizenship and to social justice and I I'm not happy with the um because I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and that has less to do an identity often than with questions of justice\nWe can talk about that a little bit more Adrian past\nWhat does it mean to you does politics is really about individualized warrants the individuals are small groups very often so cool minorities that's how rocky arguing for quality of inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now at a very good of a commonality that we're stressing Everytime makes us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds to\nCars and also the same communities in and countries so there's a problem I think in mass its response to individualize and but I think it's an individualized was bumps drop them a more communal collective response yes among\nYeah to me into politics his crops two very different phenomena that are going on to the same time it's a lot of confusion stems from mixing goes up so I'm the one hand what we're seeing at the moment is\nA lot of a minority groups claiming equality came in riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and on the other hand I think we are seeing\nAs sort of movements but as Adrian just said I sort of trying to re center the basis of liberal democracy from being about individuals to being ... about groups ... elements of the state line of try to [noise]\nI think the term ... around the idea that we are defined by our power relationships and that who we are is primarily dictated by groups into which we were born in that way I I regarded as anti individual for ma'am part\nJust about any group that I was born into female American what have you I Would like out of that is I find it confining and my idea of what identity means\nIs much more individual and I regard to these groups that we didn't choose none of us did I think there are a problem to get out of and I feel that this movement is trending in the wrong direction often for admirable reasons but I don't think the results have been positive\nDel Rio victims those real oppression exploitation\nBy the way to go over that is to name it as an injustice die affect everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always repeating what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... that\nThat doesn't ah to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people would have some you know recognized but that's exactly in fact what the beauty movement did they said look\nThis is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize that what we ultimately want in ...\nI think all of us in this conversation but there is real discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it but I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit toward a more justified would look like last summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big sick\nAnd very nice movie which is autobiographical about a Pakistani origin American stand up comedian who falls enough with a white um how can we go into sort of dramatic life story they have no partners\nUm I was amazed by the way in which that movie er which tells in a mainstream romantic comedy a story of interracial marriage\nStarted to be attacked from the left\nSaying well isn't that problematic that this round protecting this has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the ride was saying\nWho cares if you find somebody who he was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and was parts of the left but some of food that was problematic ... size leave for me is the crux of a disagreement about what society one ... I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between\nCultures rather than one where everybody is to stay in the lane and avoid cultural ... on you to picture and in a movie of interracial relationship is probably about ... identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the Ron Paul has come up I find some of the discussions off white hungry all get along why can't we all just share the same value is\nThe way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... call it a bit like the kind of cheesy a wrong call on I've never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I left on the left all my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality\nThe fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same him sheets about all falling in love and living happily ever after I mean we talked on politics until it kind of button all Hollywood wrong call not allowed\nTo bring you in 'cause he wants to come in at air I think on the issue of algae beauty rights and the way that change but feel free to comments on what pre as well\nI think the we what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not\nVenture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also creates\nA social atmosphere of fearful illness on a an an artery social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and ah you know if you're at a party\nAnd there is somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani but you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're gonna think twice about approaching them and not a big ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong\nBecause you might use the wrong word me might express something that's a little you know not all perfect there's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful Asia\nIt's the intolerance that line will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on ... pops and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying we'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow to differences defined was more than ... not too close to a real difference\nDemocratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus that shouldn't be warm but the memories simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's I think we have done to purchase has become\nSo the ... I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of very generic I hadn't ringing about authoritarianism and\nLack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example the only example that was given was black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nLet me give you a couple of examples but first what I wanted to make the but I think a black lives matter in many ways is an important movement in Monmouth has actually contributed significantly to our understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think there's one argument that back I met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and the business or a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers it was also true but the majority of the people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the registry small portion of the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to the vacation is if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and this is a particularly deepen justice but you know what if you're a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go to parties you should also be worried because actually\nTwo white people who got shot by the police as well I Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this off ... people have never lived in Mount a cultural multi religious monolingual states this is new new situation that we find ourselves in ...\nSome practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society some feet along the function political parties trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing but on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and institutions in the communities are not working and I think that's why people feel\nThis was a sense of powerlessness is a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized and I think the problem with the sensor them Tuesdays by definition exclusive\nBriefly ... I think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier or\nWhether it's legit disagree with the premise I Do think about the tree or democracies in the world was founded on a ... ethnic multi cultural self conception of themselves and find God who started to challenge that and we now live in society so much for most people embrace the idea of it the more to the mic societies that\nIf something has talked quite new Priya\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth\nAnd one of the ways in which they're addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that way by a says minorities and black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called\nIdentity politics and this means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for any quality and suffering\nOkay pledged to think about that thank you for

tell them to somehow that I didn't see much less than half of all there's not a smoker and I said I'm not saying I'm not saying you did what I'm saying\nThe idea that somehow we can just say we're able to be most depressed people in the journey warms up my son in yet everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not\nAn institution that since feelings do methane in his age or longing and if you're going to a place to people to communities and countries might as we can all today that feeling out of politics or\nThe obvious question that follows from that has been loaning so who onto wet and ease parts of the reasons for identity politics that actually it is people expressing a sense of on the longing that actually ... the identity that was that before whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there that these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement ... on the one hand and the ... on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties\nAnd I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly you're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinctions it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation\nAnd northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their try then they want representatives who are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interests not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say ... voice is a very clear that on Nick durable in some ways it was if you'll know rendered Modi in India and you a\nPre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India\nIdentifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as\nAs a species break up into what are often very competitive clumps sorry Ken I'm confused I\nThought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem\nBut I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups it's a natural tendency of people to especially when the larger amalgam is just a bit too big to get your head around\nTo break into small groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's all politics happens because those tribes are bad but although tribes are okay\nI mean I'm very bad language singled out yeah I mean I think the\nQuestion is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who have close to them as possible so that starts off as a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious or ethnic group and the question is how do we deal with this in ... to the society in a productive manner\nBut one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging and to become a form of cosmopolitan\nWhen I look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years and I don't think that's realistic because actually especially in the age of globalization nationalism retains an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me it's the best response\nIs to try and domestic hated hop wild feast of nationalism to try and claims for sales to make it inclusive\nFight for inclusion of all the different groups\nUnder the common identity and how do you make that journey from being a cause and pulled us in a member of the metropolitan elite to being if you like a flag waving patriots\nUm his patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know adopt a size of its history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country wherever they from you can also respect patriots who left that country it's a question of mutual respect\nFor the other hand around so badly anxiety saying that you love found that it how do you enjoy it isn't that are going to tour what's wrong and loving your country and its people accused all the people of identity politics but I'm not your national to dream of your post nationalism I imagine you are and your your your as\nYour your national ... thing they can my country but the question in my car accident a majority\nIn a

the writer response would be the P ... index for it is the author nationalism over Congress party but sad but we're all Indians and respect of\nMe that he is not true I mean it's not as though the older a form of nationalism the Congress talk he didn't have ... elements to it the one\nHand we do our days of areas of angry as well as looked at what age it if if I can bring you back then in a sense there there is a we we do seem to be making a distinction between figure identity groups saying that\nA national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily such gets\nWell 'cause I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups and sometimes you need something more of rocks and that can build a bridge you know we can be workers we can be people of of a place like a village\nI'm bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further the kind of cosmopolitan isn't that you also spoke about\nThat can doesn't have to what can be a bit abstract I think at the European level isn't that option I think a lot of people feel European British or German or French but I also feel they have a little ... as a possible so that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we managed to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom\nWith its great diversity of people here\nAnd beyond says that if everybody identifies primarily with the national try and\nSay I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu and Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this
