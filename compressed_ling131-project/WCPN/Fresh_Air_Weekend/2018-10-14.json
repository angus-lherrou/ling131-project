governmental panel on climate change came out with its latest report I won't be hearing from one of the office at a moment's\nEssentially the report said we can't go on like that [noise] and if we do what getting to danger the stabilize the climate cities cars and buses and everything else around me is going to need to be powered\nBy renewable but he's not possible what's that going to do to the economy and can we have the kind of throws we've got used to what we have to get used to something else maybe something less dynamic more does that mean that politics can lead is his way to to make big sacrifices\nWell there is a pretty tough questions that but as I get back to the theater now needs adult\nSon a tunnel is Laura Diaz ... professor of climate change policy at Cambridge University ... he's the policy director at the Grantham Institute of climate change at the London School of economics\nJulius ... he's an associate professor of an ecological economics at Leeds University I'm Molly Scott K. to amend the of the European Parliament\nFor the u._k. green policy thank you all for joining us before we begin I Want to introduce one more pests than a ... year we rebel he's one of the authors of this week's I PCC reports and he's with me here in the studio\nYou read the report cool for the well to aim to keep the rise in global temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to comment to price\nIs the world's on track to teach anything like that target festival\nOn to clarify up the report doesn't call for anything the report on it was a question that the government has asked do you see\nIn two thousand Fifteen independence agreement here was clear ducked two degrees of global warming was no safe level and governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible\nAnd five and two degree and also shows demeans into raising rich global warming can be limited to that level\nAnd say just to be clear is the well on track to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to ... it's not on track currently the pledges of the countries that they submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions overtime and two twenty thirty whereas in mission should be decreasing very very steeply or by twenty thirty\nSaid paint a picture of ... the consequences if temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five and two degrees for a few critical systems of Europe it is really important for\nExample for coral reefs are two degrees of warming we don't see any scientific evidence that they will ever survive\nAt one point five degrees of warming it it's still possible that some of them survive also for four to ... ecosystems there is a really clear shift in the impact\nOn forests and other systems and finding also for humans the difference between one point five and to a degree of warming is about more than four hundred million people that are more affected by heat waves\nSay already said stock consequences coming out that a roadmap power enough do you try and make the changes that are needed to bring temperatures down what sort of things does the report suggest might be necessary\nShow that to people especially at the so far we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable life how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible Simon I'm American by nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important that people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have\nWe're kind of a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly because you don't have all the hanging around at the airport which are often outside the city center so I'm a and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term slides\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better quality large they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design of ... lowering our missions and one in which people living standards Ohio\nLaw where it is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes that simply and\nThink here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing from from switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and\nFive to seven and ten but some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term costs nothing equate long term Cleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increase of seeing an extra see the price is that you cannot another country and in other countries have\nHeard the most a low income people said larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no Lewis says what we can say that\nThese losers from this transition\nCould be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor the short term losses but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of garments to think of the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the fossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time\nThe case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit\nSeen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get these short term ... if I can just bring you back from a ... year he was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between a one point five degree rise and the two degree Celsius rise\nDo you think there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um well I\nLike to sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the terms mission was a massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we vote in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement although I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work on the sustainable\nFinance area we can now say the ... financial products or pension products have to be aligned with a one point five powers target for example I can see that now in the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and I imagine a world of these climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes not\nKnow it just went to work to do that when asking the question who is going to appear to for this one we should not see this as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one does this reading an investment in a safer and sustainable rope and when ...\nI'm an impact if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already returned observing today they're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree are forming\nAnd ... to a degree of warm induces ... into fall future does this um one point five current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so does this really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for ducked\nDown the road and find them eat the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefree managed and they have to carefully managing managed showed up the issue the poor of the impact of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare Laurie\nWants to come back and yeah and I think I wanted to bring together the comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have a Nineteen nine countries with renewable feeding tires Seventy three countries with\nAuctions fifty eight countries that are the how the other places to stop the renewable and\nThanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of ... coming down significantly cities is making it easier there isn't a global carbon price for instance has agreed no but ... is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most\nEfficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have to\nRealize there's been um scholars and political science working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally been more expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications unconscious indication they're beginning to be competitive so it's these investment changing it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing it\nA report about making sure that the most vulnerable or not it's not just necessary for ethical reasons but it's also necessary for political reasons I was only in that situation do you get the support you need the help\nYeah so when we talk about coffee it's important that we remember the global economy is not stopping and there were three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty cents even down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two\nThousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double Ninety Chilean will be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we might the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the\nGlobal economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next for two years they all trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our\nCurrent growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive\nOr we designed our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nWith that so I Want to wrap up this how fast and now ... case had\nA ... year we were a gal will take a short break up just to remind you let us know what you think of the program or any ideas to topics you'd like us to look into the ... the real story at BBC ... ... e K will treat me at ... and if you enjoy the program we have pulled cost you can subscribe to just set for the real story\nHard news and cultural commentary his is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin\nStick with the facts weekends on him that he points to read WCBS in\nNineteen eighty to a friend of Suzanne Vega taco asked her to manage a new book store he was opening oncoming tree road she took him up on me off\nI Am to death for a couple of years if it was such an intriguing idea to me over\nThirty years later they're still running the store the next weekend she's being honored for her impact on the greater Cleveland literary scene but she's not so sure she deserves any kind of surprised she'll tell us why Monday afternoon at twelve thirty three during Ninety point trees hearing now featuring the sound of\nApplause support for ... for three W CPS is provided by\nUniversity hospitals relies on financial gifts to help further it's vision to advance the science of health and the art of compassion continuing the legacy of giving from generation to generation more at UH giving dot org slash gift apply and has the weight brown school\nSo well to me well and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute it's funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make kept Monday's PCC reports\nI've investigated the claims and I find them want things from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more than ... facts on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nation just level\nBut I I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed decided that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration but it needs to take this little seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration\nA viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda Myron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis they they got nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and the abuses science to argue for the fact that use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that little warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nFull board wants to come in and bring you in\nThe United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not discern to it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide your date and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it simply cheap to generate power from other folks\nSaid from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and which he's at odds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is Easter appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with\n... left behind communities including coal mining industries um we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but the uh the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is big up because of sea level rise and there's a good chance that the warmer than our fridge waters and the goals were partly poma because of climate change I think people will say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress in the u._s. hasn't gone way this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to zero at sea route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the U.S government has been spending\nYou know carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the first world the very developed well let's turn if we may ... to ...\nBut do you have on to them and she joined us today from Cairo joy I won't talk about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing fast but also a country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly seriously just described with some of the changes that are on the way\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it's\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda as much more to talk about renewables but at the same time let me just give you a small example\nIn the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not linked fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that happens studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional look in relation to energy they could actually have a huge savings in health\nAnd so uh that it's a good reason for taking action on a bus up you and doesn't this come back to the\nPolitics because then the cost Indian governments have argued that a country that's growing is simply not positive it wasn't part of the industrialization prices that if you like caused the problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beaded Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five\nYou force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it it's no longer a Bible argument to say they're going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways to buy bonds\nThe mistakes of the north and you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the old tried to convince a bench and funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question then is water the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels or the investments to the south and I think that for the very good idea of shifting the problem is that right and so I don't even developing country should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels\nThey should try to bypass that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic disruption do you think for a country like India that democratic that this is\nMore difficult or easier to push through as an idea [noise]\nThe problem with democracy is a force is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to decisions relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other hand\nI think that there is a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science\nAnd I really think that if you can get social movements going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to suffer our water comes from a snow fed mountains and that's really going to lead to major challenges the mountains stock to melt the snow starts to them as in the mountains\nAnd so as a consequence if you just try to look at\nThe agricultural sector in India as opposed to sect in India they were really suffer and there's a reason to take dead views into account and try to read visit our energy storyline\nAnd Judy assigned book a suit the big reasons for India to make changes similarly big reasons to China\nChina's been going for a sort of both and strategy of growing all energy types at once but I think any kind of well run country any kind of country that has a government that cares about his population will in fact be pushed by that population if that population as well informed enough about the risks that are coming down the line and are very near future\nAnd in a few years we won't be in the same place we are now will be much much worse off in terms of the impacts we've committed into the system if that if that awareness is spread and", "show_name": "Fresh Air Weekend", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "14"}
