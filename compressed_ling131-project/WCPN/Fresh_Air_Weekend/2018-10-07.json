to begin by asking each you how strong would you say a new ways green credentials\nCarry it has with ... what I Do\nThat although we have the oil industry and that we are exporting a lot of oil and gas our green credentials are quite a significant and should be taken into account especially I Want to mention\nWas a a various political parties have done that Rick uh several years transforming that the um transportation secretary that we have here in in our way\nAnd we have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all\nFifty percent of all new cars where electrical and that's a ... a a major leaked towards a more green society especially when we know that the transport sector is a big country it ... into the field to credits yes so for\nMe I think it's very important that we have an active policy towards thing getting new technology that drives the green shift and still has the oil and gas sector because it gives us the money to do all the research and have\nAll this ah green technology development\nGay Sunday is that I think that because of oil and gas we can't afford to be have a huge impact do make the climate better globally and we do the job abroad or we do a big job inside Norway and that is because we have the money from oil and gas to do the job\nWe do a lot of things in the rain forest in ... we do look with the electrical cars in Norway and there's a good thing\nAnd say fool not safe from all the panels these green credentials their Christ office in ... are you going to agree\nI agree with it ... they have with a domestic strategies and spending a lot of money abroad for the rain forest but I think\nThe parent though it's worth getting back to here because we don't really have a plan edition or a strategy for how the transition will take place we know that both for climate change and for energy next is going to change so we need a plan for how we're going to get off ... feels\nAnd where the good guys and all of this I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in LA\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big energy transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being dependent on importing false ... in in many countries to want to be\nEnergy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of renewable energy and that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in the ... and it's happening in Germany and that's going to change\nA new exploration licenses for it and places like the parents see in the ... I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will still be producing and twenty seven\nTwenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate guessing missions can convince the well\nI think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the power pounced based on coal into work\nBut it I thought oh yeah we're talking about but my point is\nThat if you have replaced coal plants root for example gas\nOr even oil there will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener re first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agreement society I'm totally agreeing with that but we have to do it in a way that actually if yeah ...\n... Christopher in this in this moment of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron see because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than so many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited how long are camped here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy and we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw ... find out what's next fenced in and out came back\nOh do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said no China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in Oxford last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students I when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get a false that feels good to\nUh would look at the time frame because ... says well it could be dragging on two twenty Seventy yeah we'll ... it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency they say it's still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noisy globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based\nIf we go to do a big big job you're going to increase renewables about six thousand percent unless it's a huge huge drove ... on on how do you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that you know it's not and we've been debating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time\nAnd it's going to take a lot of drastic measures but it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built toughest new investments are being made into ... and the G and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil in competition with but that whole as a poet\nTilt to sell these ideas how long does anybody else in a bind well it's difficult in a way that it's become easy I've I've been working environmentalists just for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and\nIt's become you see act but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and important to understand that why why do you think well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify yourself in this I mean a lot of people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince kind of\nTo look on what are our options what are the renewables\nFor example where are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable\nBut where do you get to ... do so well uh you get to perhaps if you're a lucky from or organic waste and it's part of the circle but uh if not you have to produce it by making\nSome of our Lance part of\nThe ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that the now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry\nAnd we see that a ... that's called at the new now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because they understand they are also part of the green shift\nSo my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green gay or at the same time we have to address\nIn the transition into but not none of which have successfully been\nNo ... again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time on this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to\nThis is one of the great things that we could use our universities for the ... from the burn sees like ... wages to construct them up on these shows are under thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere's a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we're\nCarry you wants to can look at and she's yes it's definitely important and and we are in the situation in Norway led effort political party actually ... let me just explain what we mean by that cash a story and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take the call them for the environment and and put it away the underground or under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think the technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government to nowhere shifting governments have spent quite a ... a lot of money to try to make that happen barriers\nTo getting down to the details again and the staff has been focused on in order for Twenty years I think we also need to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think women know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you please let us know what you think the program or if you have any ideas the topics ... the real story at BBC don't casual UK and you can subscribe to the ... such the b._b._c. the real story pulled cost up\n[noise] distribution of the BBC\nEight PM American public media with support from see three I O T addressing the world's most challenging problems that the convergence of artificial intelligence I owed to the

eight Ninety eight\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way it can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign certain area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is in ... in creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation and I was being so\nVery because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to walk into anything other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy is secure it is of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development and in order to Norway because with all this exploration stuff we talked about\nThan it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway you have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental them so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you were an engineer in in terms so I think he would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFor other than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students asked for it can come and says\nWell no no this is a policy to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the merit to him a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift or even though we we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expansion Andy a matter of time sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down the coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to think you've made it out here I Know but it's ... it it sounds like it doesn't ... sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now in the energy sector is really happening in these happening in other countries that the moment I mean look at China that ...\nDocks there as well would it close higher polls and absolutely but my argument if you will see now that you knew about energy we indeed be more cost effective than fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum\nWill that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new region gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls the way a little bit from Russia\nGave does it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian gas an older guys\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the barn and seek comes from home or if that comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than on not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that new region energies plane as some people might not reasons to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to these powers that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia China and ...\nAnd the parents said they have drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the bar and see and I don't think it's necessarily get that nor by goes to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\n... that is according to the cost\nNope no if the carbon prices high and Europe\nGus will exclude coal we've recorded lay on what you mean by that call them price the price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy but [noise]\nUm there's a market inside Europe um the ... or ... or ... years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe too low cost when those prices are starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough push health renewables\nThat he's still a ... to ... to understand that renewable and gas are competing in Germany they are afraid they'll be able to call them pricing no but also the way the energy system works\nAnd seems to nibble energy is so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are\nThey are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway count we come take Russia's place when it comes to two guests and an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're going to keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments but\nBut this is about what kind of view do we have for your past twenty fifty and Europe's committed to have Sierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector of the twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way relatively poor country in the Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people ... the the way which treats citizens of the fact that it gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on\nSo for months on the underpins this country that's going to keep it wealthy but with no way somehow lose some of the stasis is no way afraid pot from some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you you you painting as far too short picture because no it was a will for states before they all came\nNowhere made a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping so we made the welfare state long before we discovered oil and gas\nRemember your along the coast in Europe or the has the only place in Europe which hasn't been any comment during history because we're always has easy accessible proteins so we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food going on on thank God\nWe didn't have an ability we we have again it's areas aside in looking\nAt a lot at the history and one important objective that sets in the Nineteen seventies supposed to keep the moderate pace of extraction\nAnd when they hit that limit that sat in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight bit triple production within Fifteen Years and then the tens yes afterwards the almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol independent states\nThat we also have this workforce that we can use for other purposes so I think tying ourselves to tightly to oil we should ...\n... but I guess I think what I'm asking is is somehow psychologically has it allowed no way to punch above its weight can\nI think we could just up the oil and gas tomorrow and it wouldn't have anything to do with our views on ourselves because\nThat means yours anyhow I mean we have we have a vote\nFor a state that's actually very clever because we have this big fund we use money from that sound to pay for\nFor the political system for decided to solve it wouldn't have anything to do all of them of course we will lose future income\nBut it would be very very stupid because in the European Union in the world that through increased coal emission because they would lose no reaching gaffe so that was my main point earlier um [noise] so I'm back to the U.S", "show_name": "Fresh Air
