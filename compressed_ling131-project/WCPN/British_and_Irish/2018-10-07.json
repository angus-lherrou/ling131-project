you know it's like well what's all the fuss about you know uh but they do try to be part of the republic of Ireland I Know it's considered there so there are moves afoot to try to make it a seamless as possible there are\nProposals in terms of you know ... uh\nThe the withdrawal agreement that I'm a you know quite a lot of people um agree upon but that's still significant agreement and it's you know it's it's as much the specter of at the\nAt the at the image rather than the substance that's you know seemingly important to preserve among certainly\nUm you know the the hard Brexit tears and the ... the union is I think Britain is going to end up like this\nI Believe but it's a little bit different a bright where we have a truce was my problem is her party is is your rubbish but Garber
