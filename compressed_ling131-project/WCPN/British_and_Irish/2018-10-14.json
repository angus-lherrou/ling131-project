for your opening statement\nOn this Fisher thank you Mr ritual thank you for continuing this proud tradition of Ohio debates and all kinds of political um officers in\nAnd Caitlin Tom I'm honored that their hair and always some thank my wife for her support and\nBeing who she is in my life so I I look forward to this debate I look forward to debate in Congress or an ac thank you again for hosting\nThe senator brown congressmen ... you have thirty seconds for your opening statement\nFor I think the debate commission for sponsoring of savannah one in fact my wife Tina and my family for being here I don't want to thank for senator for being here as well but tonight you're going to hear about two visions for Ohio from two very different people\nMy vision of pro Hi oh first my vision is to make sure we're growing our economy and continue to grow our economy the centers vision is of Washington first grade in one job for himself\nAnd actually loving Washington Chuck Schumer so much but he's forgotten about the people of Ohio\nAnd with that let's begin center brown first question for you this evening of course tonight we're in Cleveland city on the rise as you know with wonderful things happening and some of the best people you meet in the world but it is also a city with the crime problem as we speak the night there have been a hundred murders in the city this year the fifth year in a row we've crossed that mark\nSenator brown what can you do better to help the city and others across the state becomes safer places to live and work\nA county and I live in the city we live in southeast part in Cleveland we love this city uh we see the city we see the city of Cleveland making a comeback we also do no we have a state government that is to pull money out of our city\nIs not invested in our streets and highways of not invested in our police one of the reasons that and police and fire one of the reasons the fraternal order of police um have have endorsed me is because of my support for law enforcement all also my support\nFor going after the root causes of crime we know that in this city are not far from our neighborhood in fact the ZIP Code we live in for\nIn large part because of Wall Street greed in what happened in housing and what happened ten years ago to our economy or we need to invest in good jobs we need to invest in our cities or we need to invest in infrastructure um I worked on a plan with four other senators to to to\nFulfill the president's promise which is not really introduced yet for one trillion dollars in infrastructure spending over ten years paid for by closing tax breaks and that would help our police and fire in public schools\nAnd help our help in this housing crisis half a foot one force of people in this country will rent\nOne fourth of people who rent in this country spend half their money half their income on housing that means one thing goes bad in their lives in their lives turned upside down the federal government is paid little attention to housing state governments paid little attention to housing\nThat's where we need to invest in housing and what else we thank you very much congressman or when they see\nYou and again my heart goes out to the people here in Cleveland and some of the issues that we have\nAnd I said that all along I've made my ... home Ohio many many years ago thirty five plus years ago and it's because I Love this state and I love what's going on here but I Do think we need to look closer at our cities is one of the things I've done as the United States Congress man we set up an organization called opportunity Cleveland\nThat's the difference between someone who talks and someone who gets things done where you put a ... a group together who actually started looking at the inner city I'm looking at opportunities for mental ships for jobs\nThe best way to be able to change this city\nIs to be able to make sure that our children and grandchildren are young adults have those opportunities they have their opportunity to see mentors just like I did when I was growing up I came from a very poor family situation as well but I also had mentors throughout my life and opportunities see jobs whether it was not working\nAnd we need here in Cleveland and that's why I was so proud to start the opportunity to Cleveland group to be able to put people together and match up young adults with opportunities for mentors match up young adults with opportunities\nFor obscene jobs and seeing opportunities that the opportunity but the differences I'm here I'm Out here I come back and I get involved with their computer community the difference between me and my opponent Sherrod Brown as he loves Washington so much and Chuck Schumer is forgotten about Ohio he's been there for twenty five years\nAnd thank you how to run a thirty second we're above I've done the last four or five days\nA week ago we sponsor my office hosted a five hundred women in Cincinnati and our fourth annual women's conference in gay women engaging your community to help this community just this past weekend\nOf six hundred students from thirty five schools university students from thirty four I'm Sorry from Seventy five schools around Ohio came together and are propel Ohio conference\nTo help those students engage in plan for the future and help this community just recently my brother's keeper we just did our statewide convention with my brother's keeper center thirty seconds thank you very much\nCongressman or ... Senate Democrats last week for a vote to support\nThe roll back the U.S department of labor rule that allows for the sale of so called junk healthcare plans that among other things could deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions and would not cover prescription drugs and emergency room visits where do you stand on preexisting conditions emergency room coverage and prescription coverage\nWell health care is a big issue for me and let's face it when I travel the state whether it's Mary who I met in my travels with said congressman I Can't afford my health care and even though I struggle for the payments I Can't afford the doctor balls orange John and his family as I traveled over and they understand area who's a congressman I Can't afford this healthcare do am I\nFord about health care and that affordable health care has to include coverage for pre existing conditions it also includes allowing our children to stay on that policy to own age twenty six and it has to include making sure the caps are eliminated\nOn on illnesses that's the type of health care that I have supportive but at the same time we have to have health care that is affordable we'll have the health care that not only takes care of those in the lowest the low safety net\nAnd I'm a big believer in that Medicaid we need to make sure they are covered but we can do that better because we can't bankrupt our company ... our country trying to do it and the rich are going to be OK I'm more worried about those in the middle the middle of that are struggling every day to try and make\nNot only ends meet but able to pay for that health insurance or health insurance since they Affordable Care act\nA hundred and thirty two percent in this state\nIt's unacceptable and John who I met the other day in a in a it was driving me said to me congressman I make less than fifty thousand dollars a year I Can't afford my health care and and your penalize me for it I said not me a hundred and eighty five thousand people in this state a hundred and eighty five thousand people unless they\nHad to pay a penalty because of their health and not being able to for their health insurance senator from\nStart with this governor case like a Republican I'm a Democrat work together on the Affordable CARE Act and then two inch doesn't expand Medicaid and ensure hundreds of thousands of Ohioans in fact two hundred thousand Ohioans right now are getting opioid treatment because they have insurance through\nThe senator supported about he felt he voted to bail out the banks and a two thousand and ten he didn't vote when we wanted the ballots will be stopped he's the individual who is supporting those banks by the way twenty seven million dollars in in uh in funding\nThat he's received a lot of it is from the bank so he stranger careful when he talks about things not economic he's\nA senator brown the inter governmental panel on climate change last week issued a report that warns if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate the atmosphere will warm up by as much as two point seven degrees above pre industrial levels like twenty forty\nBringing worst food shortages wildfires and massive coastal flooding the report said that they use of coal for electricity would have to drop\nCrisis uh my action my reaction to the report as it solid it makes sense Congress and the White House had been derelict in their duty to address climate change perhaps certainly one of them perhaps the greatest moral issue of our times because of the future of the health of our planet\nWe never should have pulled out of the Paris accords are on climate change we know that that um we we have seen weather patterns change dramatically um and I you know I I've been around the state of Ohio you to to create wealth in state you you either grow it you\nYou grow it you mine it or you make it in Ohio does all three were good farm state where an energy state and we're a manufacturing state I've seen it all and Ohio I've seen the solar I've seen the wind turbines in western Ohio in polling county I've been to Toledo and many times than to for solar I Know we mine coal in southeast Ohio\nI Want to do all of the above but unfortunately\nThis Congress decides its way more important to subsidize fossil fuel than it is to invest in when in to invest in geothermal into invested in solar were one of the\nToledo is one of the major solar manufacturers in the whole country yet our state government our federal government\nContinue to be in the pockets of the fossil fuel industry are repealing renewable ... for a renewable portfolio standard all of those things that we as a state in we as a nation ought to be focused on\nThe report is is mostly actress we need a Congress that's going to invest thank you senator by a congressman or anything\nWell thank you and look I support clean environment I support clean water I support clean air but I also support in all of the above and when it comes up all the above energy we need to be thinking of those assets that are here in our state compared to other states the problem was centered around as he is more concerned about other states and Washington DC that is about this thing\nMany times where it was a a canary on his lapel and he talks about the coal miners my grandfather was a coal miner my grandfather was a proud coal miner\nIf my grandfather was alive today you know what he would say send around you don't support me you don't support me as a coal miner you wanted to bankrupt one of the industries here in this state which is important to this day so yes we do have to look\nAt all of the above and we have to make sure we're looking at our own resources as well and those that are beneficial at the same time\nAll of the above wind solar all those are necessary and I'm a believer that you can't just walk away from the coal clean coal you can't walk away from the natural gas clean natural gas\nThat's here in an asset in Ohio so I'm a big believer that we need to continue to search for all the above even nuclear all of these should be looked at because we need to be competitive and at the same time you eliminate coal and natural gas like the center of would like to do an energy costs from hardworking Americans were going to go off electric bills are going to go up\nLet's be prudent let's do what's right let's quit worrying about voting with Washington as my senator senator or a colleague here does he landed match or with voting with Ohio and\nSend it around thirty seconds I Do or this canary in the bird cage to symbolize\nMy support for mine workers might support for all workers my support for the dignity of work the fact is I led the charge a couple of years ago to restore the health care for retired mine worker center mansion in West Virginia I led the charge to do that\nI didn't right now I'm the co chair with Senator Hatch a very conservative Republican from Utah to restore the pensions for sixty thousand workers in Ohio I support mine workers they support me but the important thing is I support them and will continue\nTo kind of don't ask you this question is for you we live in a time of great division in this country civility does not exist anymore in some circles\nWe see this coming from Washington and beyond and many people in this country are concerned and scared as a United States senator what would you do to help bring this nation to get\n... and that's one of the reasons when I went to Washington I was so frustrated I got there and my first here and\nI hear Republicans and Democrats arguing with each other and calling each other names of civility the issues were a problem so what I did is I reach out and my first hearing I spoke out and said look\nWe can't continue to do this I didn't come down here to fight with Democrats I came down here to get something done and I was proud that a colleague from the other side walked over me I'm John Carney who's now governor\nOf Delaware and said to me I agree with your comments or nature we need to work together we started a bipartisan breakfast and the following week that now has been going on for eight years that bipartisan breakfast includes Thirteen Republicans and Thirteen Democrats we need to be able to work together we need to be able to come together and make some decisions and that's why\nIf you look at my record my record I'm One of the Eighteenth I think it's forty percent most bipartisan members\nOf Congress versus my opponent who is streamed on the other side he's one of the thirty eight percent most\nPartisan members this is the problem if you're going to just continue to vote Ninety seven percent of the time with your party Ninety six percent of the time to start with Chuck Schumer\nCenter brown loves Washington so much and Chuck Schumer that he votes Ninety seven percent of time with them we need to be able to work together I've ever proven record of doing that in the Senate I Will start that exact same breakfasts up work across the aisle\nGet things accomplished over Fifteen bills made it to the house Senate and were passed out of that bipartisan group I'm proud of that and I think you can you do that in the Senate Senator from\nJournalism school uh doing a study of of work in the Senate found that I had more bills fast than all but three other members of the United States Senate\nYeah they're bringing people in the community to gather students doing all that but let me talk for a moment about the work in Washington about bringing people together I'm One of the major architects of the farm bill I'm the only Ohio\nSo first Ohio senator and fifty years to be on the Agriculture Committee I grew up milking ... cows on our farm\nI I ... I I for agriculture such an important part of our state but my point is the farm bill it's a it's a ... a nutrition bill it's a rural development bill it's a conservation bill it's a family farmer bill we put together a coalition we got eighty six senators\nMore than ever on a farm bill to to vote for it and we're working it through the house now it's more of a challenge because the house of representatives you can see tonight\nSo partisan but let me let me ask congressman they see a question about this perhaps the most divisive thing in our society now is what our government did to rip those children from their families in the border\n... was was just with President Trump campaigning for him in southwest Ohio and I would hope Congress or an AC wouldn't I'd ask him tonight to use his connections his friendship he said the president got 'em in the race he loves President Trump\nYou says friendship to convince the president to pay attention to these children who are snatched from their family because you know in our time is up and it's you know the rules or you can ask questions each other but senator congressman you do have thirty\nSeconds yeah I Would hope I'm senator brown would start paying attention to the questions and answer on that was on the farm bill and farming and again a center brown supports water of the water is the United states in a terrible bill that hurts farmers senator or a brown has also supported not eliminate some of the death tax what's hurts farmers\nI may consider it a friend of the farmer he might be talking about voting are supporting a farm bill but he supports what ever Chuck Schumer and Washington tells into sport Ninety seven percent of the time\nHe doesn't represent Ohio farmers I Do thank you sir we now have\nTime in there and having a recent survey shows that mean for for a nap likely voters are and if I didn't want to tell us we just kind of an opportunity for al highland\nTerrier thank you and I I Will I Will go back a little bit on that question\nUm many years ago I was secretary state of Ohio\nAnd one of the focus of our folks spoke ... of our of our work was to make sure that the ballot was open to everyone in the polling places were open to everyone I led the charge to make Ohio polling places\nButter accessible and we've seen all over the country Republican efforts to suppress the vote and make it harder to vote we feel that one of the things I did back then was I went to McDonald's corporate issue shows shows the kind of way I reach out to business to labor\nI traveled with Sandy she sat next to me in an airplane one day and she said to me congressman when she found out it was a congressman shows I'm working to become a legal immigrants\nAnd please do not let people who have not gone through the process that I've gone through just be able to get legal become legal immigrants that is not fair that is not fair for me that's not fair for the country\nSandy was coming back to Ohio\nSand is the one that I think we should be thinking about more somebody who's worked through the system that's why I support changing our system and making it better I support modifying the old system\nNot the system that has been in there and play some by the way it's Congress's issue this is something Congress should be doing it's frustrating when I hear centered around talking about the president\nWhen it's Congress and he's been there for twenty five years these loves Washington the Chuck Schumer so much for God Knows filed\nVoting to fix the immigration system and that's the issue this is so disheartening for me\nCentered around thirty six ... she works for the D.C travel and tourism bureau nonetheless some consternation keeps talking about my time and washing he's hardly a newbie in this number one number two he spent in the majority party since the moment he came to Washington the Republicans control the White House\nTrick or on wages or on trade or on health care or on climate change I I Know when\nI when I think about senator your view tended to\nCongress the greed on one thing recently massive bipartisan legislation to address the growing opioid crisis which you know it takes roughly one hundred and fifty\nLives a day in the United states public health experts and first responders however say the measure lacks\nThe steady long term funding needed to stop the spread of addiction they say grant style awards for pilot programs or the disincentive to organizations to make long term investments how do you respond to their concerns\nWell my heart goes out to this opioid crisis and again this open crisis just an apple last week last month it's happening because of policies of Sherrod Brown and Washington over the last twenty five years let's talk about some of those policies when I talked to John By the way I started a opioid task force I came back home\nI took people who have actually been addicted and then of recovered the other group was families who've lost their children the third part of that group was health care facilities are caring for bills and here's what I learned\nWhen it was John who was an addict he told me the biggest issue we have are the policies that say you have to go to college when he found out he didn't want to go to college guidance counselors were telling them you know why the funding the funding for ... for funding for high school education\nWas pushing people to only go to college\nAnd what he did he turned to drugs or Michael Michael who was a successful businessman what happened with Michael was he opened up the medicine cabinet and found drugs extra opioid pills that his mother had that was a terrible situation because what he did and some tough times as you started down that path\nWhen you talk to these individuals who find who's the policies that are concerning we can't have policies number one that tell our children the only way you can be successful is to go to high school we can't have policies in watts\nWell Ms Sherrod brown loves Washington so much and Chuck Schumer that he continues a vote with those policies instead of trying to change those that would be my goal let's take a look at all of these and by the way when it comes to health care facilities they need more than six months which was the senator from especially as you know eleven\nPeople in Ohio if it's ... than the average eleven people died yesterday from opioid overdose eleven people died today eleven people will die tomorrow eleven people will die Tuesday and um it's so important I appreciate ... supportive\nOf dealing with this awful awful opioid public health crisis I've worked\nOn a number of bills with senator Portman including a bill that we attend to together the White House a signing ceremony for to keep setting on carfentanil I'm Out of a call ... coming across our border we've worked for the postal service to try to do it\nUm we work with local police officers one reason I I think that I have I think the one of the reasons that the apple pie endorsed me um we also need to do the job training as we do opioid treatment I work with the senator from West Virginia Republican on that\nUm we have taken bridge it's passed this innovative one of two facilities and the entire country the pay special attention to babies born of addicted mother's um we got that in in the law so that that can be replicated around the country I Know Columbus\nI councilmember brown is working on that issue also now I'm In I'm proud of that but but here's the thing is when you think about dealing with opioid addiction\nFirst do no harm as I said earlier I was at the top of her house in Cincinnati you know one of the times I was with Chuck Schumer I was with the ... house in Cincinnati um with with a man who told me were next to put his hand on his daughter's arm and he said\nMy daughter would be dead if it weren't for Medicaid costs when they see you voted twenty times to take away the congressman or an AC thirty second\nNot as their spending too much time in Washington with Chuck Schumer and I was spending\nTalk to the people that this the facilities need more than six months to recover and there was another thing that I found from I grew the parents who lost their child you know the first person they ran into that child ran into after they left that facility was the drug dealer we need to be looking at all of these issues not just Washington talk about money and this\nWhole as the Ohio got plenty of money as you as a as center said\nWe have Medicaid expansion thinking all the time um [noise]\nSenator brown many people on both sides of the aisle do for different reasons said that the recent confirmation hearings for justice Brett Kavanaugh were low point for the Senate and for political discourse\nIn retrospect how should they have been handled differently\nWhy on I opposed I'm I've I've met with a a judge Kavanaugh I researched his record I made a decision to oppose him early before\nDr forge testimony I Believe Dr Ford I think there's no question she was telling the truth but I opposed I pose that nomination\nBecause he and his record and the sitting Supreme Court has put their thumb on the justice scales to support large corporations and outsourced jobs over workers to support Wall Street over consumers to support health insurance companies in their fight to get rid of the consumer protections for pre existing conditions\nSo I I Wish I Wish these were to be different I don't know how the Senate does it differently um I think the fact that they rushed it through they didn't they didn't offer that they didn't allow um thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of pages of documents\nI'm from judge Kavanaugh's time working for President Bush they didn't allow the investigators to speak to a number of people to Dr Ford ask them to the FBI investigator so I think this this Senate system of confirmation needs to highlight more the the the the the um\nIn fact see the judge Kavanaugh was again going to make this corporate U.S Supreme court even more supportive of corporations over workers and\nConsumers ... senators and congressmen or anything\nWell thank you and again it was a low point for the Senate\nIt was a ... best was the Democratic party that decided to tear down a poor man\nWho actually gave a very compelling speeches well look Dr Ford gave a compelling speech and so did the uh so did the judge in the end they set a standard of conduct the Democratic party set a standard of conduct and they said if you meet that standard of conduct an unsubstantiated clean you can not serve\nIn Washington shame on them\nThey better start looking at their own people I said this all along if you're going to set a standard of conduct for unsubstantiated claims you better start setting the standard of conduct for substantiated claims\nMy opponent Sherrod Brown has volumes of records of substantiate it claims of abuse spousal abuse and the people of Ohio need to see that looked at it and understand it he will say he'll say\nHe will say that he will say that his ex wife was was ... you know forgive forgave him God Bless her\nThat is that is a forgiveness that I God Bless her for doing that the problem is I'm Talking about all victims I'm worried about all victims now domestic abuse not just one\nEvery member divest reviews that situation as a standard of conduct that Sharon Brown now has violated and he should not be setting of Eunice US Senate seat any longer\n[noise] centered around us thirty seconds congressman ac my former wife ask you to stop attacking our family she called these charges and your tax despicable she is supporting me you should be ashamed of yourself\n[noise] audience we don't have [noise]\nWe we we don't have a lot of time left and again please hold your applause or displeasure if you which we can get as much as we can hear in the last few minutes\nGonna do a bit of a lightning rod round here because we are running out of time a senator when they see I'm going to begin with you a forty five seconds to answer this question which comes from a someone ... a viewer who to pose this question", "show_name": "British and Irish", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "14"}
