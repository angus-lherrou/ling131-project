A. M. U. dot board Barbara emailed I still talk weekly by phone to your many friends in Sana'a and sort of see are living in hell and be asked\nWhy does America hate us so much why does America wants to kill us\nWhat do I say\nSome of before we continue in before we bring in our next voices on the conversation I Wonder if you could just for those people who haven't been following the Yemeni civil war very clearly can you just boil down at the core of it what does this conflict about who are the fighters and what are they fighting for\nSo Yemen's conflict is actually quite complex conflict\nA it's a it's a conflict that has many layers to it but ultimately what you hear in the news if that's a it's a Saudi Iranian proxy war you also hear that has he got at the who the government in Sana'a that announced itself is actually in fact\nA coup government that has drawn by militia and that the Saudi Government is trying to restore the legitimate Yemeni government ah to power in Yemen now the problem with all of that as this conflict is\nFailing to do all of the things that they're saying it's a it's about for example when Saudi Arabia got involved in the conflict with the Arab coalition the aim is to bring back the Yemeni government the Yemeni government has been residing in jail since the war started and\nIs struggling to go back to places where there is no so see um Bush on the ground and on top of that the who the English or in a sense has gained so much more since the war started in the sense that at first they had to share power with ah the former president of Yemen where you know into that\nHe's an was president for some time but I'm the shared power with him now fast forward three years into the war they had killed them and and now they have their own control of the majority of the north of Yemen\nAnd of course the the scariest thing about this is the Houthi militia had managed to capture the Yemeni military arsenal that belong to the former government is now all in their hand\nAnd so in a sense what the war dead is complicate an already complicated political situation\nAnd it devastated the lives of millions of enemies\nAre for example Seventy five percent of the Yemeni population is is suffering and in need of immediate aid and depend on foreign aid to kind of survive and this is a Seventy percent increase since before the war began um\nBut I Do want to talk more about the the population on the ground that needs help I just want to before before we were next wars and also didn't want to be clear there's a sectarian part of this these\nThese who the rebels who kind of came after the government you're Saudi Arabia involving itself but there is a Muslim sectarian aspect to this also is Sunni versus Shia conflict as a proxy war right\nSo this is what's interesting and this is what a lot of the people don't realize first of all the shot and Yemen are don't practice the same sect of ... that Iran practices or the Shiites in Lebanon are at all to practice\nThey practice a sect called the DSM and the ideas and is known as five or ... and it's really different from ... which is a the ... the form that's practice in Iran\nWhat's interesting is that it's the closest form of ... that resembles so many of them are and in Yemen we the Sunnis there are ... and the divide isn't you know the the ... are not a minority like in other places they're forty five percent of the population\nAnd so what's interesting about this you know ...\nThere are situations where they don't agree but they managed to co exist for many years now the CDs or the who the sect of of you know what's happening in Yemen they're no longer practicing as they did and as it as it seems like they're trying to politicize said he has them and to kind of a\nAssociate themselves more with the Iranian sect of Shia Islam and the ...\nHas struggled to maintain its sect as it is with the influence of well how does them and set up as them coming into the country and so in a sense what you're saying is that the most radical elements of those two\nAre fighting each other and so in a sense you have the presence of a new ... conflict but one thing that I really have to point out to the listeners here is that that's not the only thing going on\nI'm a huge portion of the country in the liberated territory from the control\nIs actually a demanding secession and that is something that you don't hear about in the news as much you know in the south and ever since Nineteen Ninety four the people there felt that they were under occupation and the cost secession are rising day after day as this conflict continues\nOr do you want to make sure we get to a voice on the ground and humid but I hear what you're saying summer in terms of all of these very complex fault lines moved kind of come together to fuel the civil war today before we came on the air today\nWe were able to get through to Sana'a in Yemen all communication into and out of Yemen is really tough but we did make contact with least grounding she's the UN's resident and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen least laid out what the conditions are like right now for those who are living\nAnd working beer here as part of our conversation that we take just a few minutes ago we used to be welcome to want to thank you very much can you give me a sense just in a in a larger topics how many people the un fears are at risk of famine right now\nThe spread of hunger that we could see as many as fourteen million ... who are facing Sam and by the end of the year this is why the United nations is rain the alarm bells\nAnd telling everyone that we are facing possibly the biggest famine in living memory if we don't do something to stop it right now\nWhat are some of the other health risks that you're looking at their other than just starvation I'm sure was deprivation of reasonable secure supply of food all kinds of other health problems also come into play right\nThat's exactly right last year the largest cholera outbreak in modern history hit name and there were more than a million people who are suffering either from Colorado or from watery diarrhea there had never been an outbreak of such magnitude in living memory\nNow this year because of the work work that's being done by frontline partners in UN agencies and officials here in the game and we've been able to contain the spread of how the Democrats have similar levels there is a lot of color in the country but it's not spreading at the rate of cars last year\nThat being said when people exist for months and months on supplemental rations when they are eating limited amounts of food what happens over a period of time is that they slowly start\nAnd this is absolutely foot we are seeing for millions of people in this country their immune systems are weakening and that makes some highly vulnerable to infections and water borne diseases including color\nAnd just by way of contacts leaves mentioned that there are fourteen million people that the un fears are at risk of famine the population of Illinois where we are right now doing this program from Chicago he's Thirteen million people just by way of contacts least give me a sense of what a mother a father\nDo all might be dealing with just to try to feed themselves and feed their family would they have to do\nSo sixty percent of all of the people who live in this country are what we call food insecure now out of that out of those Eighteen million people every single morning there were eight and a half million to wake up and they have absolutely no idea where they are going to get food from that day [noise]\nSo what will happen is a family will use absolutely every means at their disposal to secure what they can they'll go to their relatives and bake they'll go to religious institutions and bake\nThey'll come knocking on doors a non governmental organizations in the UN\nAnd ask for our help they'll do to rubbish bends and pick out what they can they will walk through the streets from the beginning of dawn until midnight looking for any scrap of food it is absolutely desperate\nFrom this station and from Subaru featuring the all new three row

file through our app won a vox pop will answer as many of your questions as we can tomorrow on\nOne day back now to our conversation with Jane Ferguson and some of our Hamdani still time to get some of your questions and thoughts about the conflict in Yemen and about the U.S Saudi relationship\nContacts through Facebook our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org before we continue some al Hamdani let me come back to you for a second I checked in with our audience here at W. B. easy in Chicago to kind of ask them if they were tracking with us\nAnd one of the things that I think confuses a lot of people it confuses me too\nIs the nature of this secretary and aspect like several of us and we have a an array of of age ranges here students and seniors and everybody in between have heard of Sunni and Shia Muslims\nBut then that like the the sex within the sects I think that's where a lot of us kind of get lost can you\nCan you bottom line that for us what difference does it make what set these people are with like why why does the sects why does the sex involved matter to this can you just kind of simplified force\nSalute laced so when it comes to you and I'm like I mentioned the majority of the northern part of Yemen is historically say day and the majority of the southern portions of Yemen as historically shaft eye and said these can be called ... and that\n... they're called ... now the ... conflict a kind of began years ago and then was revived recently on what we see as a political\nIn a conflict it's not really a religious matter today it's really a political matter of allegiance to what part of the middle east are you going to support and what we're seeing play out is that Iran is announcing itself as the I'm\nKind of the guardian if she has some and Saudi Arabia on the other hand is presenting itself to the world is the guardian of ... and so as soon as she our is pretty much kind of people fighting for the interests of who's going to take control in the region\nAnd that's what this is what's happening in the M. and you know for instance when this war started\nWe know that the u._s. then under the administration of President Obama had struck a deal of um a nuclear deal with Iran\nAnd the sense they sacrificed Yemen by saying here you can fight Iran in Yemen but the U. S. is gonna kind of find this deal with Iran now that was a short sighted move because I think a lot of people then they didn't anticipate that today President Trump would come to power and then today you have and a nuclear deal with Iran I\nAnd at the same time also have this devastating crisis in Yemen and so in a sense\nSo let me let me ... I think so let me let me back up and try and repeat back to you what you just said I said I've been drawn a diagram everybody here ... years and watching you scribble in my piece of paper so we've got these these two sets of\nIslam Sunni Islam and she Islam is this old centuries old fight that has been made political you use the phrase political Islam to describe\nHow we're well on this kind of for political and regional power reasons trying to kind of claim itself as the the defender of the Shia Muslim face\nAnd Saudi Arabia has kind of noise that itself the defender of the Sunni Muslim faith and that politicized Islam has spread into other costs\nKind of a battle in this larger war for the soul of political Islam is that kind of it\nSure yeah exactly and so what I'm saying is that historically and traditionally the sect of Islam that ... have practiced for years are not necessarily aligned with the Saudi an Iranian sects but for political reasons they are now aligning with each other\nGotcha gotcha folks here it'd be easy does that make more sense good sums up all around and if you go and I I appreciate you explain that I think\nYou know part of the complication Jane Ferguson is that this is\nComplicated I mean some wars you can't just boil down to one cause but that also makes it hard\nFor us sworn in Yemen to zero in on them and and really think our teeth in but your reporting has involved some of the people on the ground\nWho are dealing with the results of this larger fight for the soul of political Islam you described the story of an eleven year old girl that you encountered back in June the kind of stuck with you can you give us the basics of what happened to\nHer [noise] sure telling her story is one of the reasons is the most important reason why journalists need access to this because we have to put a face and a name and a picture to the statistics otherwise they're just the tip steaks and I think than we we deal with with a lot\nOf uh of of of difficulty trying to get the public to understand the level of this crisis so I and\nI was in ... um which is a product and sort of in northwest of of Santa and controlled by the who the rebels\nAnd uh and it's mountainous and in the town of hijacking the capital of the province there was a hospital where like every single hospital that I've seen ... that the children's ward is now a de facto mom nutrition ward and we were just filming there with some women and their babies' whenever a young man tall\nWas my ... and for a horrible few moments we really thought may mono might dying\nIn front of us on the hospital bed she was eleven years old and way too I think twenty four pounds was what that it was about what we had to what we had asked at the doctors at that and it was absolutely a\nHorrifying to watch her she you know when when a child gets so weak and so among nourished\nThey also become so vulnerable to any kinds of infection and so they tend to get a diarrhea anyway and so even even if you do manage to get through to them and uh they get diarrhea they get devastating they hydrated as a result the whole thing just spirals\nUntil the child's body just gives in um we spent some time they're filming with my own end speaking with her family\nAnd her mother eventually came the next day we were able to talk to her and we were piecing together the family story and it is a story that reflects millions of people's stories in Yemen\nAnd it is that her father was a schoolteacher and a government school but whenever the uh the government salaries stopped over two years ago he his salary stop to once people lost that level of income the government was that the the biggest employer by far in the country before the war\nAnd that's not just soldiers and police that's people who work in offices that's teachers any kind of clerical work or any kind of bureaucratic work in Yemen\nWants those salaries stopped people would then go on to trying to live off of what the aid agencies would coal coping mechanisms to you and I that's simply do have any savings do I have a line of credit at the local store do have any livestock in the backyard do I have relatives who can help us out after two years\nThose coping strategies run out and they ran an ad for this family and they simply had no money and wanted child starts to go downhill it can ...\nOn and ... and lots of families are not that lucky and so one of the things that is really important to remember by this crisis is we don't even know how many children are dying for ... or we don't know how many don't make it to the hospitals\nAnd ... and you know this one child came from a middle class family that educated father and that's really terrifying benchmark of how deep and dangerous this problem is\nRight you know want to get to some questions from our listeners were before we do I I I think there were people who watch what's happening in places like Yemen all the right now there's no place like human in terms of what it's dealing with but these kind of humanitarian disasters\nEqual access to education is the law but racial issues can get in the way let's see how one school near

U. dot org before we bring in our next two guests Steve I didn't want to ask you one thing about the way the documentary was made I Wonder how you set about\nTelling the students' stories I mean there is a moment in one episode where either you or a cameraman tries to talk about one student about her cutting class I mean all the kids that you follow through various struggles with\nIts class what's grades with life what kinds of boundaries do you have to set when you're telling a story about high schoolers\nWell that's a great question um I've always tried in the films I've done over the years is to a\n... had the subject feel like they have real agency in the making of what we're doing\nA you know the idea we aim for is is that we're really making the film with them not on them\nAnd yes ultimately we have editorial control but we take very seriously that kind of relationship and on this series it was vitally important that they are also be other filmmakers involved we had a diverse team of filmmakers Kevin ... Rebecca parish being Lou\n... Charles a story was followed by Kevin ... I mean I felt a little bit with Charles but that's really a cabin who\nI mean being I'm Sorry being that that followed a Charles a story and they had to establish these kinds of relationships\nUm that important now the moment you're talking about is with tiara that's actually a story I happen to be falling and you know if you have to navigate those those times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions\nBut you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with Tara because she was struggling with a lot of things\nAt that time I thought was relevant to include that in the film\nAnd continue to ignore the inequalities of today people of color are treated differently in America period end up sentence\nAgility for fun to watch every episode of America to me I absolutely love it I'm shocked at how clueless the white teachers are especially that physics teacher\nThe school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by the news of full disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Stephen ... for his thoughts on the series we did not get a response but the invitation remains open we also reached out to the principle of Oak Park in the river forest high school Nathan rouse\nWe were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit for courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary either is that right see that's right\nWas that the more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide\nAmend the Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race and public policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called\nDespite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to what I think that any also with us here at W. B. easy as David Stovall a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago\nHis focus is on the influence of race in urban education community development and housing and he is a Chicago native professor Stovall welcome they so much for having professors have you watched the series any part of it some of it all of that yes\nFestival what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest the thing that struck me the hardest isn't\nEpisode to win one of the parents of a student actually goes on the fourth floor and I think this is the end the conversation that we do not have a ...\nIt was a color are in the same place with white students when this mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties in on that fourth floor and he still happening today that to me is the story of us ... professor Lewis what are you [noise]\nYou know one of the things that really struck me there are a lot of powerful moments in the series but I think one of the things that also struck me as the silences some of the some of that kill missions and I know a lot of this had to do I'm sure with who was willing to participate and who wasn't\nThe one of the things you notice in that district is that the people aren't in the documentary so all the white powerful wealthy families a key leaders and the district a lot of the people who had the most power and the most influence over what that school ends up looking like\nA opt out and I think that's a kind of powerful and symbolic I'm a example of what's actually going on in the district\nPay by the way for those of you listening and I forgot to mention we may be discussing some things in the documentary that if you were eager to watch America to me might turn out to be spoilers so do that in mind in the conversation if you would like to listen to this lady because I don't want to get them please do not\nTweeting me [laughter] 'cause I ruin this film for you I don't want to hear it but if you want to listen to this later on your own after you've had time to watch the documentary you'll find our conversation in its entirety at the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org\nWe're talking about racial\nEquity professor so what does that mean what does racial equity look like is it and making sure that black kids in white kids get the same test scores is it about disciplinary procedures is it about truancy is it about people\nFeel being nice to one another like ... how would we know racial equity\nIf we had it right I mean I think the Susan thank you for that question I think the thing around equity and I think the ... to him and his point what people are unwilling to talk about\nHad the least and now what are those things that they talk about that they meet the other thing around equity is getting people what they need when they need it and ... is the issue of concern\nGive me an example of getting people what they need one they need\nA young person says we have a particular problem with this teacher who is constantly giving us disciplinary referrals\nConstantly grading us in ways that we feel to be dubious now there needs to be so that racial equity team at the schoolhouse whoever that is\nThat person needs to be in the conversation or that racial equity team it can't be the conversation around young people which often happens in school houses that young people are blamed for this not equitable condition professor Lewis ... what\nDo you find or the big barriers to advancing toward racial equity is it is it funding is that the people involved is it different for every school in every district what tends to get in the ...\nWell I'm going to talk about the parks at the world and there are a lot of them and I think one of the things that um my colleague John Diamond and I found when we were doing the research for our book\nWas that when you really try to understand why changes so hard it really is especially in these kinds of communities\nAbout the folks who have a lot of resources that have been served well by those districts for a long time not wanting change to happen and we talk about this is a kind of form of opportunity hoarding\nBut it's a way ... how race works today differently than it worked in the past in the past who might have said you can't be in my class or we're going to have separate schools all this kind of things today we had this veneer of racial integration and we what we do instead is create these racially segregated academic hierarchies within schools and the schools themselves\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with a legacy of putting clients financial well being first learn more at Raymond James dot com [noise]\nFrom constant contact who's segmentation feature allows small businesses to deliver personalized email campaigns to connect with their customers learn\nBefore we get back to our conversation here in Chicago are worried about what we'll be talking about in Atlanta tomorrow\nPoison it appears to be Russians preferred weapon of choice and we'll find out who Moscow is targeting and why\nWe like to know what questions you want answered so leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one egg America's relationship with Russia and what was the Soviet Union has had its fair share of ups and downs but\nWhat message do you think Washington should be sending to Moscow now\nEight five five to three six one a one a let's say five five to three six one two one two will dig deeper into the files of Sergei screen Paul and get to some of your questions tomorrow from Atlanta on one day\nBack now to our conversation with professors amend the Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our one a tax cullop how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall\nOne person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were bussed in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother tax club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up took me years to wrap myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was white unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like advanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and scholarships\nCan give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make it\nTo me I I mean it's not a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue not pushing far enough\nRight when we talk about equity we have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity and then how are those opportunities denied in real time currently and because one why student did not get one scholarship does not mean that\nBlack and Latino students across the country do not are not typically denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve that's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction that I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you been able to par south reactions that finally\nWell I've I've not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise] but you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdotal experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience and more eye opening experience if for no other reason there are other reasons is is that we've tried to take you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not\nLiving in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all of the things that we see an awful lot of in documentary filmmaking including some of my past work\nAnd I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the ...\nDifference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for anyone high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin is does that reflect your experience and all my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general it was like there's kind of lie her essay is there's this blanket we put over why kids that's like your you know they always going to be warm\nRegardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color they're like okay well we got like\nA whole bunch of sleeping bags but we ain't got one blanket for everybody and only some people get that sleeping bag you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who's also featured documentaries were like\nI wouldn't say like the ... well I I didn't want to like compared to any of the students but the school has like\nI guess prominent interest in us because of what we do with our extracurricular is and so it was just already saying that they're like okay well we need to make sure those kids are good you know but for someone who isn't in any extra curricular is who doesn't have any type of\nUm nine students teacher relationship with any adult in the building they like it's hard to get you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even consider it to get one and that's like I think that's the whole thing right there is Lincoln's vice a sleeping bag whereas like\nAll other white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and have stakes in school the parents are big funders their siblings went there whatever whatever and then you got the kids who I mean like me luckily I found spoken word but you got kids like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went to other people\nIt goes the showing 'em which episodes that Mr Dorner was like most of the kids and who's on the news um tutoring sessions are usually white and ... yeah oh I Know that's part like you know personal accountability with us also to school like\nYou got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to ... on his tutoring but just the one right but you know so\nWell to that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor loose carry tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty years [noise]\nYou know it's hard to look at the high school level and understand you can take a snapshot of high school level but when we study districts like a park like Evanston like Brookline mass like Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens of these kinds of districts\nThat tracking that kids experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts that we take hits that might be you know an inch apart in terms of their skills coming in\nAnd we track them early and what we know over and over again for research is that that tracking means that kids don't hire attracts get more they get better they get better teaching and so we take kids that might even be a niche apart in terms of skills and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time\nAnd so when we look at schools like a park as Dave said earlier\nThe structure that we have in place around around things like creating these academic tracks um are inevitably going to uh take\nRacial disparities that exist in all our society and and reproduce them in our schools and the ... the troubling thing is that race becomes not only part of how these trucks get created and if you look at the history of the really deep racist history of tracking and general\nRace also becomes the explanation for why it's okay the fact that you can walk into a school today and twenty Eighteen and see that the most advantage\nExact school I put on a black shit how this all up in arms that the fact that we think that that's okay it's all about our racial mythology\nI I think we also have to ask questions about what defines being educated and what a good education is and you know I've heard a PE teachers including ... Williams the black or a teacher in the series\nLament the fact that it's a piece students often just want to be given the information they need to score well on the test that's what they want they're not really that interested in learning they just ... it's a game it's in supporting\nGame I mean in terms of a larger kind of a an as an editor for vacation like having a more well read\nLearning yes so some of the some of the most interesting and I think for far reaching in deep teaching what's going on at lower levels which is not to excuse the system that man is talking about but we just because we define being educated in such a narrow ways it's about ACT scores\nAnd GPA's and that you know and that's what we defined as being an educated person as well but I hear you on that Steve but at the same time you know I think about I'm not trying to excuse because sooner no I I I hear that I I I hear that the I ... I Wonder if they'll professor still all about you know kids who grow up\nIn in refer parts of town that have been told your ticket", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "24"}
