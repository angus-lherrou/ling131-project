thinking about for the midterms much more than what's happening with Senator Elizabeth Warren and President Trump their ongoing feud over Warren claiming to have tribal ancestry\nThe senator has addressed her heritage in the past including at this year's National Congress of American Indians\nI kept why some people think they're hated being made here\nYou won't find my family members on any roles in I'm not enrolled in a tried\nAnd I want to make something clear I respect that distinction I understand that tribal membership is determined by tried and only by tribes my mother's family was part Native American and my daddy's parents were\nBitterly opposed to their relationship\nNow in the scheme of things does it matter if Senator Warren really is a verifiable tribal heritage clearly it does to her especially after the president referred to her as Pocahontas and said he would give a million dollars to the charity of her choice if she could prove or ancestry\nThat apparently led to senator to take a DNA test who's results she says prove that she is Cherokee\nThat drew criticism from tribal leaders like the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck Hoskins junior who spoke on MORNING edition\nUm and then we are now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nMeans by which you are a turkey citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for a senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA guy really undermines tribal interest frankly\nOn top of that the test did nothing to stop\nAs Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed she took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be one one thousand twenty fourth far less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her quote DNA test is useless even they don't want

A. M. U. dot org we heard from quite a few of you who shared your stories\nAbout exploring your tribal ancestry about what that means to you in the context of your life here's one voice mail that was left in our inbox\nHi Sheila this is Carol elaborately ah I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot of documentation from my mother to uh that we were part of the ... tribe in Oklahoma we\nApplied to be a member of the ... tribe we were accepted and it's been a real joy to be a member 'cause we um we can vote now we get all kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us more ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but broadly speaking what what does it take\nYou usually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back um ah through time\nI mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community has one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long arc and being part of that is I think really important what was the things I Love to think about is shown is was hunted mastodon\nI Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back\nMillennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture are there other kinds of benefits that you find whether their intrinsic or extra benefits of being an acknowledged member of a tribe that are worth\nProtecting that are worth keeping in their proper places I mean Carol talked about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what other kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledged citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it isn't coming upon us to protect our our our children are native languages are traditions are land\nThe water and the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA tests is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're native\nYou know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it\nThey take our language and they can modify it they take our spirituality and modify it and they make money\nThey make money off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of their family lore or they speak with some smog and title meant\nLike they've lived the life of a native like somebody's ever called them an engine or a our word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies at the door even if it's Elizabeth Warren\nI should know by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today that we did a discussion about these DNA testing kids the ones that say fine not your ancestry and learn what your family's from we did a program today's October seventeenth we did it on October Eighteenth of last year called ... where do we come from we spoke to geneticist\nAre named Adam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest\nGoing to do one of these home DNA test you'll find that conversation with Adam Rutherford on our website the one a dot org such the word ... the number one daughter a dot org\nBrittany tweeted I Am a county and kick Hanukkah or mohawk and I'm frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help me to issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nYou a progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focused on this\nYou ate progressive she must have known why we both Kerry living 'cause we were going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what you were in progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nNorth Dakota has a voter identification law that has been stayed by the courts until now last\nWeek the Supreme Court decided to essentially let it go into effect for the November election so what that means is new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election\nAs you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who's one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us wrapped Kevin Cramer\nHer Republican challenger polls have Kramer ahead\nIn twenty twelve setting the high camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had a very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American and so this voter id law\nCould potentially saw heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed at because they said that that north Native Americans\nTo get the idea in the first place\nSo what kinds of ID are we talking about like what does the law requires\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box as they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient\nSo if you have ID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that idea used in the primary is no longer good for the general election\nA lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by their supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has that been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about it as a measure to prevent voter fraud and also\nBecause the the state has argued that a mailing address\nDoesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even added vertically vote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a vote or die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast valid and the wrong precinct would would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if your mailing address it somewhere different than where you actually reside\nWould love to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population near reservation maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential address\nWhat are you seeing and how is this affecting you whether you are in North Dakota or elsewhere love to hear from your your North Dakota but email is one a at W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one a comment on our Facebook page Jerry what did you hear from people in North Dakota about how this law is affecting them is this\nSo yeah this is a big issue ...\nOh I think it's really on people's radar absolutely an issue and I also think there's some context around it when I was reporting from North Dakota from the Standing Rock reservation which is in North and South Dakota but the north Dakota part is affected by this\nI'm a you know it's really one of the things that I was interested in one of the reasons I went there even before the Supreme Court ruling is because voter turnout there is the lowest in the state\n... it was the lowest in the state before this and that's because there are challenges that people their face and getting to the polls so I I think you have this law now\nBecoming a new complication for this election that has the potential to drive turnout even lower and you have people reacting to that their their excuse me their tribal governments and nonprofits that are taking steps\nTo try and help people get residential address as if they need them assigned trying to make sure that they can obtain id and looking to mobilize voters and find ways to get them to the polls whether those efforts will be successful given the short timeframe I I don't think that's clear yet but I think you absolutely have a reaction to this sense that it's meant to suppress\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Subaru featuring the all new three row ascent with eating for up to eight and a choice of second row captain's chairs loves it so it makes us Subaru Subaru learn more at Subaru dot com\nFrom Fidel any investments taking a personalized approach to helping clients grow preserve and manage their wealth learned more it fidelity dot com slash wealth fidelity brokerage services El Al ... and from Americans for the arts\nTomorrow we'll continue our conversation about the mid term elections with the national look at major races and issues we've looked at great panel but we can use your help to focus the discussion what are your main questions and your main concerns about the midterms candidates polls voter turnout controversies or anything else\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one day which we talk about tomorrow when we talk about the midterms on a national\nLevel at eight five five to three six one two one two you can also send us a radio quality audio files\nWe'll share some of your questions in talks tomorrow [noise]\nBack now with mark ... of Indian country today and carry levine of the center for Public Integrity\nLet's turn now to the number of Native American candidates on ballots across the U.S for the midterms we'll hear from one of those candidates in a moment but first mark I'd like to come to you you've been following Native American candidates for years what are you seeing this year that is the same as the past or is it may be different\nOh it's a record breaking nearby I ah almost every measure at this point pass the primaries more than a hundred and four candidates\nUm we have for the first time ever more women than men running for office or just to look at lieutenant governor with a five candidates for lieutenant governor across the country three candidates for governor across the country\nOr nine for your U.S House of representatives it's just pretty extraordinary also have some breaking news uh get just yesterday the lieutenant governor of Alaska Byron lot who as Clinton resigned and was replaced by a\nDirector of health and Human Services and Alaska Valerie Davidson who's your pick and she is now the first native woman to ever be lieutenant governor of a state\nWow that's just as like the last twenty four hours yes\nCan you give me a sense mark and this may be kind of a hassle question but what does it mean to to folks of tribal dissent to see other people have tribal dissent in these kinds of positions senators members of Congress Senate governors governors can you give me a sense of intrinsically what that means\nWell I mean there's the old joke that if uh you're not at the table you're on the menu and that's certainly part of it but um I tell you I traveled last election cycle with the news Juno who's running for the house in Montana and everywhere we went a little\nGirls would come up to her and want their picture taken with her and you just saw\nWe'd love to hear from some of you about which candidates of tribal descent you are keeping an eye on if there are Native American candidates that you are pushing for or that you have concerns about that are on the ballot in the midterms\nWho are you keeping an eye on and why email us one a at W.

black children our to our liberation\nI wanted to center or something like someone who wants to dead and dishonest\nUh one white Americans who have proven themselves even more unwilling to confront their lives to consider how their lives limit our access to good love healthy choices in second chances\nOr want it to book to begin and end with the assumption that if white Americans reckon with

out to the nation and I'm particularly writing to my region and the deep south um Mississippi\nWhy begin with what you're not going to write editing phrase it as such a kind of a sucker punch\n[noise] ah I wanted to be a bit bombastic in the book but I also wanted the first few lines and the first few pages of the book to feel as if they were directly written to my mom and\nI think it's important for me to tell my mother and tell the world that you know I wanted to write a book that my mother would enjoy as opposed to run in a book that I think my mother and I could actually work with\nThose imposed as a pressure I think for most writers to write what they think I'm the market might necessarily embrace in a in an easy way\nAnd yet I initially I wanted to write that and I started writing that book and I actually wrote that book and then I started over and I was like you know I think that's a shiny book I think it's maybe interesting book to people but it's dishonest so you are\nKidding you actually wrote this kind of shiny respectable memoir that you thought would be more marketable and then got halfway through got to the end there were like I Can't put my name on that\nYeah the book I saw was a weight loss book I was going to lose a hundred and fifty pounds to talk to my mother talk to my grandmother talked ... about their relationships with weight food sexual violence racial tear and talking to them I realize that some of the what they were saying was very most everything they were saying was interesting but what they were saying was understandably dishonest because there was going in a book\nAnd instead of condemning them for not being honest\nI mean trying to craft a visa nonfiction to specifically my mother I'm searching for honesty right which I think it's different than the truth so I just went got through the end of that process and realize that the book wasn't at all I'm doing the work that I think I needed to do or to my family

A. M. U. dot org\nLet's read one more eggs or from the book this is about something that happened to you and your mother or when you were younger not real far from here in Maryland and it is on page Amy one would you mind reading from it's about halfway down patriots won the part that begins when we were half a mile from home\nSo almost the end of page eighty three which ends with the word flying would you read that first please\nSure anyone and ... when we when we were half a mile from home or Maryland police cars stopped us just like when they stopped us in Mississippi you set up in your seat ... kept both hands on women look straight ahead\nHe told me to sit up keep my hands on the dashboard don't say a word\nOfficer knelt down and lifting your window when I saw your face or close to his gun I Want it to snatch it and watch it melt into black grits evidence police started approaching me more often and Mississippi I wanted to super power to melt every gun in the world and the black grits officer asked why we had in Mississippi license plates\nBecause we are residents of Jackson, Mississippi you say I have a post doctoral appointment at the University of Maryland College park have I done anything wrong officer when officer told you to speak up and claim your change lanes without signaling you kept your grip\nOn the steering wheel and said I did not change lanes without signaling you spit up behind me so I signaled and changed lanes officer tried to laugh and you're faced as he asked for your license and registration\nIs that you're a man he asked you he needs to show some identification to\nYour hands came up to staring well and you pointed out the officers face move away from my car you said that as much as he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification I mean I have your badge number please\nI hate it how it sounded when you didn't use contractions golf to ask both of us to step out of the car we will not get out of his car you said a lot of this time we have done nothing wrong\nMy fist were bald up and I was edging towards the driver's side window you slapped me across my chest with tobacco your hand and told me to be quiet and unconscious office right as another officer pulled up the first officer who is now laughing walk back to the second officers car\nYou eventually show the second officer your license and your University of Maryland I D\nD officer looked at the id flipped it over and told us to have a good night never give them a chance to take a shot you finally said after we walked in the apartment and lock the door they will take it they will take it\nAnd when it doesn't matter where the where you are they will shoot Joe Black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they hide their guns and say you kill yourself\nI hear you I told you and try to make you laugh why don't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't and they instead of their though\nIf I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot us you said\nOh you wouldn't I told you that for that matter because you were speaking correct English you looked at me like you were thinking you might actually be right key but in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you will correct English they view though\nI Do not need saving you said I'm not the one who was an endangered species I'm not either I told you I'm an endangered species would a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back that cop gave me the bubble goods you laughed and laughed and laughed until you didn't\nWhile I was in my room change and you told me to write about what I learned from the experience with the police I wasn't sure what the right because I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seemed like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cutting a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky and the biggest problem was police weren't the only people doing the shooting\nThey were just the only people allowed to walk around and threatening us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style of flying I loved our style or fly\nOut other eggs are heavy bike here say leave and there is a lot going on to the eggs are but I think one of the sentences from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it\nA situation where we went to had to go to a new school in eighth grade was the first time I've gone to school with white kids\nAnd um my best friends from a previous school were there and one of my best best friends um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way you did every morning when we were at our other school in Jackson and long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told and put a knife away treated the knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers and grandmothers\nAnd in that situation I learned that sometimes in off in a mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so ah my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what you're not giving them a chance to look like eat in a grapefruit\nGot us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out an elaborate without checking it out\nAnd that got in trouble so I just wasn't sure\nAbout this this a theory my mom ahead you know you can duck them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to the home life when you spend your entire life outside at home anticipating white supremacy and wind power doing un that's the question I'm trying to ask you miss section and also in the entire book\nWhat did happen with your home life particularly with with you and your mom unless you were trying to grapple with these things that she was telling you or the way of the world and you are trying to understand them how did that affect your relationship with her yeah one one way I think\nA lot of just traditionally American things happen I started to be resentful that my mother was telling me things some things that were raised some things that were wrong um she started to be a a a lot more active in trying to police me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more\nViolence so we couldn't talk about with like domestic abuse she was in an abusive relationship I saw that relationship I reacted to that relationship I tried to fight and protect different relationship\nBut I Would never talk to her about that fight in protection [laughter] she saw me in relationships that were like difficult for me where I was being bad to myself where I was mistreated people emotionally we didn't know how to talk about any of it so while we're doing really good sort of at talking about how we survive outside in the house\nThe particular kinds of violence is happening in my house were completely silent we never knew how to talk about it and so you know it took me until I was like forty to forty one years old to have the guts to actually write into some of what was happening in our house and try to connect that to what was happening outside of our house\nI Want to talk more about your literary style but I didn't want to point out one other aspect of the antics don't you just read\nWhere the officer looked at you and said who is that is that your man there's also this through line about people presuming\nThat black boys are older than they are it was a factor in the shooting of to me or rice the young man who was shot dead in Cleveland, Ohio back in November of twenty fourteen to mirror was playing with a toy gun he was twelve years old",
