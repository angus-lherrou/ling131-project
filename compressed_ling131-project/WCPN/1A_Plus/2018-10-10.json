Michael\nBut um [noise] we can't say that the American\nDirectly related to global warming but we can say is that the ... these ... increasing as a result of global warming because we're all my atmosphere had no energy can hold mobile attacks are\nThe chances that they still have the extreme it that whether it's ... or extreme rainfall all heat waves are increasing with every little bits of wanting\nMe to a few more of your comments Sarah emailed I feel overwhelmed by the talk about climate change and don't feel like\nIt's an ever present feelings of helplessness anxiety and guilt about the choices we make every day Sarah we will be talking about some concrete options and just a moment but let me get to a few more\nThoughts that have come in the U.S for ... emailed you should stop framing this as what will politicians do politicians reflect the people that voted for them half the voters in the U.S read Donald Trump's tweet the global warming was a Chinese hopes and voted for him anyway\nThat just goes to show how important the issue is to the people in this country\nCalled before I Wonder if you could respond to Joel's email I mean the president has committed to taking us out of the Paris Agreement he kind of questions the provenance of the agreement by saying well who wrote it up let me see who wrote a mental believe it does Joel have a point\nOh well in in terms of um ... policies being the policies that address climate change on the U.S really isn't a\nA distinctive place right now I think I'm Around the rest of the world we do see an expression of will by leaders\nTo um enact policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions I think that there's a lot of questions on how strong list policies actually are um you know the analysis shows that they're they're not strong enough to limit warming even to that that initial two degrees but they you in the U. S.\nUm what we see is President Trump not only you know essentially questioning that the basic established of of\nClimate change but but also moving to undo existing climate policies I'm President Trump has already moved forward with policies to undo regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants on undo or weekend um regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from cars\nUm and he had said that it is his objective to promote\nOh the use of calling us and abroad um one of the findings of this report is that in order to um limit greenhouse limit climate change to\nUm you know to to to that sort of at least destructive\nUm level of warming\nUm the use of coal will have to ah basically go down to zero\nI'm by by twenty fifty she'll ... basically no more on just about no more coal and and and and it is you know that that is that is an extremely disruptive policy recommendation um there's no question that there are industries and people who will be harmed\nWho who will have their livelihoods disrupted by policies um that go in that direction\nAnd and that's let me just once I started to shore call but I Wonder in terms of the politics behind this and I hear you on I I totally hear you on how disruptive is is it's all like coal is so interwoven in the network of America's energy grits kind of hard to just yank it all out\nI Wonder though in terms of the voices on the world stage who we we know that there was this who are saying well coal it'd be really hard to pull out\nTo get the sense of there's anyone in the world stage saying tough our planet has only home you light pole tough we got to get rid of it deal with on you or California so Jerry Brown the governor of California for sure\nYeah and many of the ... the president of France has sought to kind of a step in and um\nHe he's trying to carve out a place for himself as as a as a leader on climate change it's it's not difficult for France to take that position because France um doesn't really use coal\nUm so but but but we I mean we absolutely see world leaders saying you know this is what what needs to happen I'm In ...\n... is there a call at the same time we're opposite that the Chinese government has moved forward with I'm actually in acting um prices on carbon ah they're they're they're an acting a cap and trade system that would force\nUm carbon polluters called polluters to essentially pay attacks or the um in in order to ... which is designed to drive the market away from from greenhouse gas has an idea that was invented in the United states is\nI'm considered sort of politically toxic here in China they can implement it by ... they don't have to deal with that Congress voting against at Iraq and in the United states\nI Do want us to talk more about that idea of carbon taxes we continue in just a moment but let me get to a few more comments Brian emailed we have no leaders anymore with the skills or courage to do what's right regardless of the political cost we\nWill keep polluting as long as the price of fossil fuels is low would be interested to hear from some of you listening who you trust who you think some of the leaders are politically in this country around the world\nWho you believe are sincere in their push to do something significant about climate change is there anybody that you think is for real and saying that we're going to make this happen or maybe if you're active with\nA politician or a government leader or a government agency that's doing something tangible\nThat you feel people should know more about we love to hear from you what gives you hope that climate change is something that is actively being worked on where you are email is one a at W.

I mean the corporate level and I'm Still more companies get on board and care about the environment\nWe will reap the consequences thanks Geoff an Amy for sharing your thoughts with us ah speaking of the corporate path there are some corporations who are taking a position in the fight against climate change including with regards to the carbon tax Melissa tweeted\nChina uses more than twice as much coal as the U.S hard to believe some carbon tax is going to make much of a difference considering their population let's talk more about carbon taxes with one more of our guests joining us from London\nTed holstead is the chairman and CEO of the climate leadership council Ted welcome to want\nTo a [noise] good to be with you ... what is the climate leadership council\nIt is a group a that is co founded by a by actually the brought us climate coalition in us history to back a national solution as pushing for a carbon tax or all the money is related to the American people in the form of ... of ... of a dividend\nWho were some of the backers of the council where does the funding come from\nSo um the council is ah does not accept corporate contributions but our founding members include four of the\nAh oil major is the largest car manufacturer in the United states the largest utility but also the largest a solar company in the United states a very broad coalition it also includes two leading environmental groups and opinion leaders from across the political spectrum ranging from\nBen Bernanke key to Janet Yellen to Larry Summers and of course our plan is named after former secretaries of state James Baker and George Schultz the Baker's shoulder carbon defense planned but Joshua let me clarify we have there is a separate spin off organization that has a lobbying organization\nAnd that now has corporate funding including from Exxon okay and they just connect to the organization or\nUse it as they spin off but it's there's still a connection in any way or completely separate\nUh it is a separate organization that is the advice\nAmericans for carbon dividends which was co chaired by former Republican Senate majority leader trend lot and uh uh sooner broke that group lobbies for this plan and it now has money from oil natural gas solar wind and nuclear power interests\nColder before let's take a step back before we get into the planet the climate leadership council was advocating more specifically defined this term carbon tax for what exactly is a carbon tax shores so um\n[noise] the idea of a carbon tax is um ... each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere um you can put a price on how much economic harm it causes\nUm and uh in in in ... and important note on that as the the economist who came up with with that idea his name is William North house\nHe's a professor at Yale I'm was just awarded the Nobel Prize for this idea on Monday or the same day that the IPC came out with this report which heavily sites I'm professor north houses work\nUm so he came up with the idea of every ton of carbon um traps heat in the atmosphere and you can put a price on how much\nEach kind of carbon hurts a the global economy um and and there's a range for how much that costs that it it can range from um fifty dollars a ton to a hundred dollars a time when I'm you know there there's there's debate about about how much\nUm actual harm it can cost at once you sort of place that price on carbon um then you are can essentially um create attacks um above a price on carbon or attacks on carbon that you would impose upon polluters of carbon dioxide no go up\nDo I pay the pollution from automobiles does the carmaker pay a carbon tax for producing the vehicle that belching out carbon dioxide or does the oil company pay the carbon tax for finding the gas and loaded term I actually\nMost likely you pay at a as a car driver I'm okay\nAnd and and and you you would so um we don't have carbon taxes in the U. S.\nUm so in some ways this this is sort of um you know in intellectual debate although other countries are are are working are sort of further along on this but the idea is\nUm if this would affect how you drive it would probably um be taxed based on how much carbon monoxide would be a produced by burning 'em by burning gasoline show it would most likely be added to the cost of the gasoline that you put in your car so if you're going to put in\nAnd it mounted gasoline in your car that would produce a certain\nAmount of carbon dioxide when you burn it that would raise that tax would raise the price of gasoline and the idea is then you would be motivated to buy a car that use less gasoline essentially that that's how it would drive the market so consumers would want to buy electric cars would want to buy efficient cars\nNot because not out of some sort of\nA moral sensibility but because actually a a a price on carbon would make it cheaper to use an electric car it's a it's a powerful market signal\nTo hosted the yesterday Exxon Mobil committed money to lobbying Congress for a price on carbon give us a sense of what the plant involves and why it's getting support now\n[noise] so um the bigger shields carbon difference plan is based on four pillars of the first is a robust carbon tax Jordan at forty dollars per ton which would actually be the highest carbon tax of any a leading emitting country all of the money would go directly\nThe most vulnerable would win economically from this plan and a third pillar is that we would\nTrade a high price on carbon innate growing price on carbon for some of the carbon regulation simply because a carbon tax is a more cost effective way to solve climate change\nThe law just wanna make sure I understand so the plan if the plan went into effect there would be a tax on the carbon that I Am it with my car or my motorcycle or whatever and then that the revenues from that tax would come back to me as a taxpayer in the form of a of a dividend is that what you called\n[noise] yes so a family of four would\nGet approximately two thousand dollars per year in dividends and here's how the system would work the more you pollute the more you pay the less you pollute the more you win so Seventy percent of American families would come out economically ahead and that's what's so transformative about the dividend concept which is that we can have\nThe most effective climate lever which is a carbon tax in a manner that is popular populist and equitable for the American people\nHow much of that money would be spent on environmental programs are planting forests or doing research on cleaner energy with all of it just come back to us as taxpayers\nA hundred percent would go back to the American people and that is what makes the plan\nA popular and politically viable because and kept on Capitol Hill you'll never get the two sides to agree on how to spend the revenue Republicans will say well let's spend on deficit reduction are lowering the corporate income tax Democrats will say well let's spend it on\nA renewable energy innovation or a low income support\nIt opens up Pandora's box by contrast when you returned all the money directly to the American people it closes that box and what polling shows\nTrump supporters for this plan for the one support among millennials which of course or soon to be the largest voting cohort\nI hear you in terms of the political viability I think it's interesting that your organization is put together something that can actually pass or at least in your view could actually pass and seems to show support on on both sides I Wonder if you believe that it would actually for lack of a better word works\nIt is a classic love story one that Hollywood has told for decades with her audience is saying now that this star has been born for the fourth time\nFrom W.

you think of the movie\nHey well of course I loved it that I loved it for entertainment and I and my big pieces that moment when he brought her onstage and knowing that was not her comfort down knowing what she can hold that she wasn't going to be good enough\nThat no one would care that no one would find her interesting or attractive\nAnd she just went out and she killed it and they loved it and for that has second a seat that she realized they were wrong and everything they said to her that was a pretty important if you're someone who's been afraid to put yourself out there for the same reasons is kind of a big moment\nYeah I I I hear you on that just does that resonate for you in a way like was there something personal that that made you\nOr in front of people and you often hear you know you need to make dinner or project lower or beat this or that are younger and that was kind of all of this it was kind of all of us will have that moment yeah we can personalize it whether it's in an interview or what have you and I think that was an important or with\nHeather what'd you think about that whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her no\nYes [noise] yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she was like this is my name is ... needs to take me as I Am and she worked at it\nYou know got tend to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and I thought it it kind of an ill\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that Ali billboard and he says we should have just made the old billboard you're knows\nI mean I think the thing about the comments about her nose is also a guy guys\nHonoring Barbra Streisand [laughter] one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a exist in and thrive in Hollywood as far as coming on the music industry it absolutely is of a powerful comment on the music industry\nAs the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing has placed in time where this movie is place in time it's interesting to think about that because almost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's\nReally no acknowledgement of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming and playlists and um the major record labels having less power than they used to\nWould would work for this film you couldn't really tackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also try to end but by the way for those who have not seen star is born will not be seeing stars ... just kind of want to be in on the conversation she\nTells Bradley Cooper character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose you know just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go into homes I Wonder how you view that commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie\nI felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art I also thought about pink\nWho is very much and invention of pop music but you also have this kind of rye cynical style style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this film in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways\nIs very linear it's a very linear idea of there is the one I'm rose to fame there is one pass you just simply offend or D sand as opposed to there is no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like that he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming\nWith out kind of going through that traditional path so I agree with Anna about that but I think that um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them pass each other on this fame ladder and I think you kind of have to construct it that way\nCharacter talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist like Lady Gaga who has been so able to make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean\nThe funny thing about this movie as she is way more important to culture than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from you know Bradley Cooper just had a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd and that way\nYeah except for the voice in rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diversion but you're right I mean she is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of\nThe story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley send a lot of time sitting up\nThat first time meeting here's a piece of that moment from a star is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga is character Ali used just improvising love saw him on this phone thing Paul\nUh to to to do that\nTo me [noise]\nBradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in a store is born Cooper spoke to NPR's MORNING EDITION with the host Rachel Martin about his work and said this\nOh that was the beginning of the journey and the first time we sang together I mean everything's alive we say we sing everything live in the movie wow you know there's nothing we're not lips thinking\nAnd I turned to Lady Gaga who's saying next to me and she was looking at me like I was Jackson, Maine when any when you're in a scene in an actor is fully believing that you're the character you can't not believe it yourself so she really gave me that confidence\nBradley Cooper speaking to Rachel Martin on NPR's MORNING EDITION John horn what did you make of the collaboration between Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga particularly how it came out in the way the love story played out\nThis is my big problem with the film and I think for a lot of people it's not an issue it was for me when her character an alley first meets jak he is a stumbling blackout drunk\nAnd I think it looks as if he's just spend a weekend at a bar do Kevin Cavanaugh KCUR and I don't find that interesting or attractive if she had met him sober and he fell into alcoholism and stayed with him it would be more interesting he's he's increasingly mean he has petty\nAnd I think as his alcoholism ... becomes worse he continues to treat her worse and yes he's Bradley Cooper and yes he is incredibly talented musician but I never really bought fully wet alley saw in him\nNPR comes from the

Horning let's get to a few more of your calls\nPeter gene can you hear me yes I have a five stars which why five stars\n[noise] um actually I just loved everything about this I've actually seen the other versions and this one seem particularly well updated to today um I thought it was the the irony of her being discovered\nBecause he was a drunk and looking for a drink and their life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was the continuing same and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent\nI guess he was her age of the guy who made her over\nThe manager down agent played yeah what what is your main character\nI didn't like him\nAnd I I guess I wasn't supposed to but uh the men had he had that conversation with jacks and um and and basically getting ready to accuse are accusing him of being a problem in that whole relationship\nI just I just knew that that was going to be the start as of something really bad happening\nYeah I'd I hear Eugene a hundred percent of ... and I I figure I heard your charming and as well\nThat was a male nominee go yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of the story one of the tricks with the manager is I think they do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is\nI'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them\nFrom the beginning um but then they are ultimately headed toward this\nWith the manager unfortunately seems like a forced element that\nIt doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes in to just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed it because when he's been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate and a lot of different ways for sure but you know did the movie really do a good job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough\nTo drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film was\nBy agree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell\nAnd there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happen or or we're done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example she goes on stage to her with her and he can't keep up or he keeps we're getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened to someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right so that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way from ...\n... exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's part of the the narrative issue with the ending\nWas oh go ahead and go ahead\nOf course the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame machine or the fame monster as Lady Gaga once called it and one of her album a destroys people is a major theme throughout all of the versions of stars ... ...\nThat character in this film I absolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions he almost was a sympathetic enabler\nUm of of the male lead and who then was like hey you know\nWe're trying to keep them afloat but he's going to mess you up Esther Esther was the first name of alley\nOr in the star is born versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people um requires that a a stand in for the machine\nBe part of being part of the cast you know has to be there um I also just want to say before we end gotta get this out there that um\nThis is also the story of how a woman's arise leads to a man's fall [laughter] and that's an internal problem with the stars bar and you know\nUm it's a melodrama it's it's a melodrama traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic\nA ... toward the lead female character but there is this underlying sense have to say it that even as Jackson, Maine is saved temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from\nHis young protege ultimately he is destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushing the periphery feminist reading problematic\nFound well but you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a feeling male ego is the wrong story induce me to era\nWe get to a few more of your views of the film Harvey in Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen for stars\nI'd like to have the same Eliot brother character better developed possibly a moment perhaps a moment could have been written in the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance his scenes seemed a little too detached from Maine overall I Love the big venue concert treatments\nThat kind of gets to a comment from Argo in ... North Carolina who tweeted three stars a star is born was a story the performances especially the musical ones were fantastic\nAnd the cinematography was incredible I expect a lot of nominations to come for deep ie the director of photography the cinematographer Matthew ... production designer Karen Murphy costumer Aaron been out score original song\nAnd editing John horn spoke with the cinematographer Matthew ... about shooting live performances which are not really straightforward spaces to navigate here as a part of that conversation from Cape PC sees the frame\nThis film was very difficult to sort of navigate the stage performances because we had three different modes basically we had the Coachella mode which is I'm borrowing stages or that were already set up with a lady that was already existing\nAnd putting in our own crowds and then there was the I'm running guns sort of we have ten minutes to shoot in between two sets with a real audience\nApologizing in thanking the audience for I'm sort of I'm shooting a movie in between two bands and then we had the third which is the Greek theater which in which shallow was performed where we um we actually in more of a movie fashion was able to create the Greek theater as a set\nAnd put a certain amount of crowded and so that was my most controlled um scenario but the lighting of it had to have a consistency might my goal was that um you know in creating a a character from St Louis cinematography standpoint\nJackson, Maine might as well be um [noise] oh I don't know Jack White and I had to\nRoad show and it's also in the film in the sort of visual movement of it\nA representation of rock and ruled that was massively but seek the cinematographer on a star is born speaking to John horn on Cape he sees the frame\nJohn can you talk a little bit more about the making of this film particularly back to Kathleen question who wrote on Facebook how you can tell if they filled is well directed this kind of a film the way that Matthew described it presents all kinds of additional challenges to make it a well directed film shooting in so many different kinds of locations\nYeah I think the ultimate question about what is it is not a well directed film it's do you believe it do you believe you're watching Bradley Cooper or do you believe you're watching Jackson, Maine if you think you're watching the actor you're not in a well directed movie if you are with the character\nYou were in a well directed moving there are certain different ways to achieve that and I think Bradley Cooper does that leave it and I think one of the things that he achieved really well is an immaculate but he talked about this the seeing this performance of shallow so you have to direct that seen as concert footage it has to be compelling as an audience to watch these two people play music", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "10"}
