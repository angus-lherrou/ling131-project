let me get to some of your stories in comments one member of the one a text club who calls herself simply scared wrote\nI'm twenty eight and afraid of the dark it's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it\nThe thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us who are silently coping by the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you were more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids out of time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words are the number one letter a dot org\nLet's get another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board Mara welcome to the program thanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times and account of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote\nI never felt compelled to share my story before because of this so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse on\nYou know for years and my friends and I have been\nAnd colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars or and and trips abroad of of our sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist who I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring Dr Ford's testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain that they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to to stay silent\nOn my own experience can you share with us to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think um we both had um an interesting one another and\nWhen you drink a lot I was you know Twenty years old at the time um and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex\nAnd that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was a rougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to 'em and it was very painful and I I'm often to stop and\nToo drunk to got to know what was going on is what what I thought at the time and you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nLast week professor Conan the Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor Ford what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh of having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor Ford said\nIndelible in the head that can't this is the laughter ... the uproar is laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective what is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the hippocampus foods and what it does\n[noise] um they hit the campus is a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise]\nDoctor for it in her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has specific parts that are involved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm\nI'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away you when people who can encode that ... that fear that lion and immediately react\nOf an assault on the brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the Muzak or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that I'm even just hearing her talk about it really makes my heart clutch you know it's really emotional\nUm but forget other details like uh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street um those aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is a brain operate\nThe kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way you described it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie you know you walk into drawing in house you'll forget all the decor but that's being leaked out at you that kind of forced your adrenalin to rise that wouldn't codes that I Would have great example yes\nNo more you said that a moment or cilia Laurie I Believe or Lawrence Taylor these moments that in code so intensely are there are ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or do you just kind of have to deal with those things kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through those for ten years\nThere are many many ways to work through those I'm\nTalking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or a community support group or an ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful um what we do in our empowerment self defense classes\nAre is\nHelp people find their voice and find their physical power a talk therapy can accomplish a certain amount but um as professor can and will tell you the trauma also lives in the cells of your body and um you need to have some kind of so mad\nRural place of practicing standing up for yourself or asking for what you want and we also do hitting and um that can be that can really move the trauma through an out your body or not only reclaiming your power but you're also releasing whatever you've been through\nLet me get through a few more of your stories Jennifer emailed my story involves a sexual predator who happened to be my boss ultimately I was raped on a business trip to get away I had\nTo move to another state and begin my career again the cascade of consequences for each woman like me goes on for decades\nKiki emailed I'm Seventy two I told my best friend about her employees who sexually harassed me he asked me to show him my breasts while he stroked himself asked disgusting questions you did\nNot tell in my day my friend she left my friend she's not my friend and the

York Times journalist Marvin Gaye and Harvard University these terrorists and Conan we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came into us\nMy name is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year that I was able to acknowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why it doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped\nWe feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves\nLet alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rape that left obvious marks it's easy to pretend it never happened and\nEmotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared and so hurt and so is shaped\nLive thanks very much for sharing your story with a smaller again love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment that comes\nAfter an incident like that after an attack like that wow hey it's it's powerful and\nYou know [laughter] so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault or it was one of the things that many that that I doubt left but I have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances\nRaped I you know it goes on and on and on and and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown and social research or you know that he shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame need secrecy to survive\nI'm an oath huge part of the reason that I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore or that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame and so in telling my story you know I I was I feel huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that\nI'm into the public arena where I Believe it belongs 'em and no longer hold onto that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but hearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it knowing how many of the people I Love and care about\nAnd know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around and that ah I guess for me that's where\nWho I Am as a journalist meets who I Am in my experiences as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching you know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of\nThe the embodiment of that injustice and that's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from\nLaura I just wanted to um that speak to what this what lives shared\nNot to tell I Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone\nWho feels unable to tell or who make that choice not to tell 'em that it can be internal reasons like Libya shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job\nUm but they are all very real at at the same time\nI'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\nSarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college where sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and he gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend\nOn top of me still inside me I never thought of him that way never consented and barely have the strength to get him off of me when I tried to tell some people what happened I was called a whore lucky because my rapist was apparently attractive to others and I was called a complainer\nAnd people wonder why survivors don't come forward\nEmails when I was Thirteen Years old a podiatrist began molesting me he was thirty one he told my mom he had some work I could do for him if you check patients in nursing homes he took me to pornographic movie theaters he taught me what a glory hole was\nHe had a friend of his implant an IUD in me this went on for almost two years [noise]\nLauren let me stick with you for just a moment I Would love to get your reaction to a clip from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway who spoke this weekend about her own experiences with being assaulted listen I feel\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I ... I don't expect and judge Kavanaugh or Jake Tapper or Jeff Flake or anybody to me how responsible for that responsible ... own conduct\nThat was Kellyanne Conway speaking to Jake Tapper on CNN lord what do you make it become\nWell first of all I'm Glad she came out as a survivor um you could feel the emotion in her voice ... it's a side of Kellyanne Conway we none of us have ever seen before um\n\nBut she seems to put the blame entirely on herself being responsible for your own conduct when we know that\nThe\nAggressor is the only person responsible for the harassment abuse or assault you can for where anything you want you can get his drunk as you want if there is not a rapist there you will not be raped I'm I'm Sorry that that she's\nCarrying that and it's a really common thing that a lot of people carry\nCarlos wrote on our Facebook page I Am a fifty year old male survivor of sexual assault\nBy a man who was my mother's boyfriend at the time to this day it is difficult for me to trust any man aside from my brothers because of this I rarely hug any one and I'm ... extremely protective of my daughters professor Conan would you react to that I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of how\nThis might be playing out differently for male survivors of trauma versus women who have been traumatized\nThank you for bringing this up because um [noise]\nOne of the things we haven't talked much about is that men are also victims of sexual abuse and assaults um and that the effects on them I'm of developing anxiety phobia he TST are similar to that that women experience after being assaulted and I think for men who are victims of sexual assault an image\nBe heard um so I so in terms of how this is playing out I Wonder how men are feeling in term of do they feel can they identify with Dr Ford or they feel like their experiences are being\nNeglected um I think if more men um\nWho were able to him felt comfortable speaking out that actually it'd be really helpful to move the conversation you mentioned earlier about a men's involvement and I think people have mentioned hearing from ...

A. M. U. dot org let me start\nWith the book this alliance between astrophysics and the military and give us a sense of what that is in a nutshell and why it is as the title of your book suggests so unspoken\nYeah so so we already are familiar with the role that other sciences or played in warfare\nA symmetric weapon that would have been a symmetric in the military sense where your opponent has something that you don't have and you're in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call that an asymmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you look at the notebook have of Leonardo da Vinci where yeah he did art but he also was a mastermind that sort of military machines that could lay waste to your army\nSo and we know him as one of the greatest combinations of scientists engineer and an artist\nBut moving forward you think are the physicist as the person who built the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know the ... you know wouldn't make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas\nAt the biologist might weaponize anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association because we just humbly sit at mountaintops and wait for photons to arrive from across the galaxy\nAnd then we carefully takes a detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw\nSo that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics in the military it just never shows up\nBut in fact astrophysicist and then the earlier days or ... years have been fundamental to the growth of empires and the Gemini of nations\nIn particular the the need to navigate with precision around the world ... my my professional ancestors no new the night sky\nAnd to to know the night sky and on any level is to give you better advantage for navigating earth's surface because this guy looks different depending on where you are on earth and things rise at different times and sat in different places and so if you ...\nAre and all of this can be established and there's no end of examples where this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who had control over it\nI should know we didn't have a conversation on this program for those who are more interested in this connection between science and the military\nAbout the origins of chemical weapons during World War one a good bit of that heritage traces right back here to American University which is the institution that owns WAMC which produces one egg you can find that conversation on line at the one eight doc board\nNew President Trump announced the creation of a space for the summer a six to branch of the military to focus on the militarization of space that I guess it will be a fifth plant since the coast guard is technically part of the chess which is also the topic of your book\nGive us a sense of what effect it within their who is a topic of the book give us a sense of what this space force would need to do have accomplish avoid to be in the best interest of the American people and humanity\nFirst of all just to to the space of course there's not a new concept and ah it surely been around even before I remembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission I served on\nA authorized by the White House to study the future of the u._s. aerospace industry which at the time\nWas had fallen they've fallen on hard times I lost a half a million jobs that his consolidation in the industry there's competition from Europe\nWith Airbus and other places that were rising up like in Brazil has embraced Air Canada was making a regional jets so there was a concern that well what happens if we lose this industry\nTo what impact would that have on our security on our transportation on our commerce\nYou order something from Amazon is on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it they're right or at least to the nearest airport\nDrones I guess but so so you you ... when you look at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well\nMight we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns of space because these are the same companies aerospace companies that that became a word right\nAnd if you separated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general\nAnd the air force then and now controls space activities of the military it's called the U.S air force base command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space worse separate from what's already happening so I was I get a second guess the general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had\nFast forward to today on the Trump announcement as well as the pants follow on announcement\nIt if you just listen to it it sounded very very sort of macho look how big my biceps is as I speak\nThat was very we don't want to just be there we want to we don't want to just leave we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that spooked many people typically sort of peace next out there who say oh my gosh what will just mean\nDo you think of that ad thing though I mean if the U.S has supremacy had Gemini over space our aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than seeing the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nYeah sure I'm just saying one could have said exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear the future of what could happen if you quote militarized space as I was really represent rhetoric not reality reality is\nA space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space\nAnd if you're going to do that uh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it\nThat could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroids strikes and then the limit it could render is all extinct\nAs one did sixty five million years ago with the dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all species of life on earth at the time and that asteroid was only six miles across an earth is huge relative to that it's a matter of the energetic and what it does to the climate and the atmosphere\nAnd the long term survive ability right of of of the by odor that requires the sunlight to feed it so so space force\nWould might include I by the way I Would also throw in your clean up the debris it's up there while you're asked the space debris problem but so so here's the distinction I Want to make which ... which I don't I haven't seen the press or the public recognize\nSpace is very hard and not particularly strategic to make space and act the repository of weaponry\nHolding aside the fact that that would violate a treaty to which we are signature and today more than a hundred countries are signed from Nineteen sixty seven that it's a peaceful use of outer space treaty has a much longer name that I always forget right but those are those are the that those are the essence words from the title\nAnd it's very beautiful treat it you feel like holding hands and singing kumbaya should read it particularly at a time when there's the Cold War but space activities weren't right on the rise\n\nSupport

conversation with Neil DeGrasse Tyson lots of good questions to get through it let's see how many of these we can get through in the time that we have left Eli wrote on our Facebook page that she's a big fan of yours Eli writes\nI have a job interview at Goddard today the God of space flight center do you have any suggestions on how I can slam dunk this thing it's my dream to be able to work at NASA [laughter] [noise]\nThink in this kind of in the world of of\nExploring the frontier or not only a strong resume matters but uh inter personally enthusiasm ... I think really matters they want to know that you you really care and you're ... you're in it and your\nYour your spirit energy that is spilling out of you that all your whole body mind and soul is ready to be given onto this grand adventure\nThat we're all partake in in the exploration of space so I think if you convey that uh I don't know if it's a slam dunk but at least it's a um [noise]\nIt's a shot from inside the paint [laughter] want to stay in\nTeam chassis I eat a robot body are transplanting a human consciousness into a computer [noise]\nAh so first of the human mind is really messed up we have a lot of evolutionary baggage that prevents us from making rational decisions as also we do some very beautiful things are art and music and the sort of thing\nTo put a human brain into a robotic chassis um when you could program that robotic chassis to have almost anything you really care about I don't see that as as as a thing that people will do and the other option was what to put put to to put our consciousness that'll happen either\nYeah well we don't really know what consciousness is\nAn evidence of that is how many books are still written on it there's evidence that usually you don't know what it is\nFor example if you look on the shelf of books on gravity there's like three books we got gravity for not still writing books on its alone\nJust for the la yeah deer obey gravity so um but it is sort of uploading all of your electro chemical impulses into some machine to mimic that\nTo mirror that maybe that comes along with consciousness we don't know but I see that happening long before we would take a brain and stick it in a in a machine by the way speaking of transplanting brain what I really want is if we can't if we can't cure Alzheimer's and we can't cure a oh last\nAt least find a way to transplant the brain of an Alzheimer's patient into the body of I'm\nI'm not sorry the brain of an a or less patient into the body\nOf an Alzheimer's patient and they get a full person out of that because one you you lose the body other you lose your your mind that this sounds very altered carbon even wants to a lot of mental exam is very Frankenstein to ... I just said if you had goals if you can't otherwise I I bet we'll find tears for both of those before we learn how to transplant a brain\nBut I think about that all the time certainly helps them certainly hope so\nBut we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and your scoop out some water and they analyze what it really carefully insect there no whales in the ocean [laughter]\nNo you haven't looked so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy and our search for life\nAre intelligent life uh for example um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or or Mars and perhaps other places but a ... anyone who study the problem is\nIn no way doubts the strong likelihood that there's life elsewhere in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\nAmy asked on our Facebook page will the human race cease to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends not considering a possible impact from an asteroid or other cosmic influence\nWe're pretty sure that nothing extinction level is headed our way that would take us out in the next thousand years and we know that because the more dangerous an asteroid is the bigger it is typically and that the bigger it is the easier it is to detect\nSo so uh I I think we're good about that it's possible that a comet could come from out of nowhere because comments very long period comments\nThey sort of show up you know you don't have history for them and one could come in and take us out\nOr it would be really bad luck to you if that were the case but I regardless you want a healthy space program that can deflect these things and so I'm all for\nBuilding you know protecting have any insurance plan that you put a little bit of money in for a to protect you against a devastating thing that it would be very rare\nSo but uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds\nThere is on that I tend to be fairly hopeful younger people seem to have a very different grasp of the value of the earth that this is the one home we have than many of their parents and and forebears and I kind of guilt today's generation gives me hope for dealing with some of the problems are climate faces but what about you\nYeah I'm hopeful realistically hopeful so but I'm I'm I'm ... I'm\nI'm cynically hopeful so here's how this works cynically hope yes so here so people don't act even when they're warned until it gets really bad and then they act\nSo all these this topic movies that show like look at Blade Runner right will it ever get to that point this so this ... you know because we reach it or or or soil in green no because you reach a point where people say no this is to this is this I cannot tolerate any further on an e people\nI don't want to eat people are so rich that really is too hot [laughter]\nRight right so you so you so we have restoring forces in the world\nThat prevent swing too low in in this regard and these ... story telling 'em it involves a trend that never stops and goes to rock bottom and I ... I've seen people bounce back societies bounce back ... people in power bounce back\nSo how long you're going to deny science until it really interferes with your health and your wealth then he said oh my gosh I think I like science again and then you put the funds back in ... so that's why I think we'll be okay\nJared submitted questions through our app won a vox pop\nDo you think that human beings are physically incapable of understanding the\nFundamental nature of the universe if not what the timeline to solving say something like\nMatter the question Jared Neal\nI lose sleep over whether the human mind is smart enough\nTo act actually understand the universe as it is\nAnd I worry that we may not be smart enough to even who what question to ask\nAnd this disturbs me because we know who defines humans as intelligent we do we do yeah who's to say that that is sufficient intelligence to figure out how the universe works\nSo so uh now dark matter dark energy the advantage to being modern human is that we can we can stand on the shoulders are those who came before us you don't have to invent calculus to solve the next problem somebody else did\nSo in a way we're assembling wrong by wrong a ladder of knowledge that looks over every next wall that we have confronted\nAnd so we were so maybe the sum of all the intelligence of all humans\nWhich has provided by peer reviewed journals that are publicly available as we all start where someone left off and take it further that as we stand may be we can be smarter as a species that we can as an individual", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "02"}
