little bit harder I think it might be worth sharing a comment from Alexander who emailed I have a message for those who hold this kind of hate in their hearts I don't care who you are I don't care what race you are a part of what creed you follow who you voted foreign twenty sixteen I Will find\nYou and I will love you there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop me\nCharlie ... let's get back to Thomas comments on Facebook Tommy rights\nWhen speeches free and in the open people get pushed back when it is driven underground it is given legitimacy\nAnd leads to action one of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert\nBowers had there so a gab dot com\nIs a sort of a basically a Twitter cologne um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racism begets [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter for for violating Twitter's community standards\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know eat the absolute power of of free speech but what ended up happening with gas\nThe idea is that uh that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I became it it has become a a place where white nationalism a\nAnd an extreme or bigotry homophobia whatever ah has has been embraced and and uh and this was a place where the the Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say at his name\nWas maybe not radicalized necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his\nA truly hateful views it was the last place where he\nPosted before at the shooting 'em and it seems that it was it was sort of a\nA A N unproductive vent for a lot of that hatred I'm an after\nAfter um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming and realizing this for the first time a note noticed that are that at this place is a dark\nPlace to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying a words are not bullets in social media posts a have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this free speech is different from from action\nAnd I started when they did they actually say words are not bullets anyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence\nWith it you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens\nA lot of free speech communities on line that they don't really believe necessarily for speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalue speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences and then there's sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protect it's so hard if it means nothing I'm ... and I think that that is something that that a lot of people don't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nJacobs I Wonder how you view kind of the fun\nSince our program one a as maimed up to be First Amendment which First Amendment lesson hate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments incitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given a new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh all the more worrisome looks like you\nShort well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true I've seen how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to spew such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews\nIs that that is being that that hatred is being supported and embolden from the very top when the president of the United states that the white nationalists see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the left who is in charge we have somebody on the right who is the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist the racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign out before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power in the United states of course trap the taps into very old anti Semitic tropes ... and so we\nYeah but it was a ... I'm Sorry where am I going to do you wanna get a little deeper into that a lot of talks a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts with that on that I mean the president\nDid address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday he began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil\nOf anti Semitism and every other forms of evil and unfortunately the vote comes in many forms and we come together as one American people\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning she wrote quote there is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate\nStop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must and unquote gotten a number of comments from some of you about the president's potential role in all of this Susan as in Silver Spring Maryland right outside D.C Susan writes\nI look forward to the day when we once again have a president who understands and always considers but his or her statements have far reaching consequences Indira I'd well\nThis was of course incredibly disturbing to have the president once again demonizing the press\nAnd calling us enemies of the people\nI'm Down here to be under the tree and the people I mean this is\nThis absolutely journalists are essentially in a way the life blood of a democracy if we are not able to inform and educate\nIdeas dream [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes

Maryland writes I Know this sounds weird but I actually feel some hope\nAfter the massacre it was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears we were told it was just trumping Trump telling it like it is you could be as prejudiced and root as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise] a GW tweets hates\nOr socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with our own words are votes and our money\nRace in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated NPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions\nThere needs to be consistent strong resistance to the hateful divisive speech that is anti American journalists needs to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism the president's ignorant rants if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to scream very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we won't hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks so much for having the show I um\nI guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who's both religious situation also very much scientific I think there's a strong feeling\nAmong a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left of people who have a starting with religious views and a close connection to the state of Israel I mean I teach at a a small just ... here in the city and or in the in the suburbs and a lot of us didn't do feel uncomfortable with House bill that um\nYou know express a\nStrong here instead of Israel or especially religious views that aren't um you know but I mean about hot button social issues but is there to see is that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that that needs to be talked about to um\nDavid how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you are how the school deals with it\nStore you know are not strictly\nStrongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leaves the school you know they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a friendly if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't\nThink it's reasonable say that you're seeing a lot of violence from the left and that that's true I think you are seeing and I think our students feel a certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um\nAnd it's you know I don't know we we felt we do tell kids who probably should need need to shut up you know an artificial ... that you know you can't argue with that we're\nJust kind of who you're going to have to learn to live with that kind of pick your battles I think that's a hard\nThing yeah to pick their battles I should I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised students to do that and not\nThe not federal everything will David ... book can be can be very hard David let me put that to you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rubber what do you make of David comment\nThank you David I wanted to respond both to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to save Seventy first of all I'm really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course a high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I Want to be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and laughed and very often it expresses itself\nAs a as a tax on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which it's not even criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses the line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of his trials governmental policies we\nThen we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies but rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out who carry a violent acts and say that they are motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually choose who are shopping in a grocery store in a jewelry store in a synagogue\nAnd at the same time in the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred a race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is that it's being supported by the government\nIt would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore\nWho's ... who is criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U. S. but instead we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right and riling up his people\nTo a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation as many of your calls as we can't as well Stacy wrote on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escape and no sanctuary but as our nation rabbis teachers the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nLynn wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope various religious leaders offered support strengths and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happen\nBut I feel like part of what worked [laughter] I hate to say in Pittsburgh fever but one of the things that I think helped in this whole process as you described school he'll\nIf it's a kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had so in crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to locked arms with one another\nThat's right I mean a squirrel hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community\nUm it's right next to CMU Carnegie Mellon University in pit\nAnd a lot of the people who live and scroll hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers accountants dentists it's an educated community a tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall\nIs also um you know politically a liberal community and it voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton in this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community of Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help and Pittsburgh's favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the end of the enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning I'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta\nJust four months ago and attack or killed five reporters and Annapolis newsroom the capital Gazette so you know I Do think we have to worry about drawing the line\nUm I mean meaning there is a line between hateful rhetoric and I'm hateful actions because of group polarization that happens\nIn just a tiger wood and beyond description CNN is reporting that are suspicious package that was addressed to CNN was intercepted a post office in Atlanta view investigation I don't think has at least you'll do it any public\nLet's get to a few more of your calls and comments including one from Pittsburgh where Lee is on the line highly what's on your mind\nOr Joshua how you doing today\nSure what what's on your mind how ... how are your neighbors do an after all this\nUm times very upset and it's you know it's it's devastating I have a family um friends and customers in there and that live in squirrel hill it's um\nMe too movement has revolutionized how America talks about sexual harassment how much is it changing the laws to protect victims and punish harasser\nFrom W.

A. M. U. dot for Emily Martin before we get into the state laws let's talk about the federal sexual harassment laws who do they cover and who don't they cover so when you look\nAt workplace sexual harassment lives um title seven as the federal law that\nHe covers you if your employer has at least Fifteen employees so if you work for a very small employer federal law doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title sudden also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment laws\nSusan ... the number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to more workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about which states are expanding protections and who they're covering\nYeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduced legislation in twenty Eighteen on workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states are have introduced legislation as it relates to limiting or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements or an enforced arbitration agreement so\nWe've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York Tennessee California as you mentioned Vermont and Washington\nAnd other states are also looking at extending training requirements um so how many hours must uh employees are employers um require training and so we've seen legislation on that\nIn California is just one example of that\nElizabeth tip it I Love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws we heard from the inner ear is already who told NPR she was sexually harassed on two separate occasions when she was a contract worker once while singing in a band and once while working as a tutor\nShe says she could not report the incidents to a chart and as a contract worker she had no employer to sue\nThought about it and I was like I don't want to post that on my social media it can change\nA lot of employers do but it's not because I'm federal law makes them do it now we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sorts of training are really affected what sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior\nSo one of the things that I Hope comes from this long overdue attention she workplace harassment is some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in the workplace\nYeah I I Do want to put that to you professor too but also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean as a certain kinds of training or the other new kinds of state laws that you think would be the most effective in reducing harassment\nWell when you think about me to as a sign of a broken system you want to attack all of the aspects of the system\nSo part of it might be that our laws in general do not really hold employers accountable when there is harassment in the workplace that it's relatively easy especially under federal law firm lawyers to get out of them\nAnd a lot of states have really low caps on damages so if you through your employer the maximum amount of money that you can get from them you know in some states might be fifty thousand dollars that's not much of a deterrent for employers who are trying to decide how much to invest in their systems to address harassment\nObviously our series is about what state lawmakers are doing to address a number of hot button issues across the country and let's hear from one state lawmaker right now in California joining us now on the line is California state senator ... Jackson she's a Democrat representing a district that includes Santa Barbara and part of Ventura counties\nIdeas stream [noise]\nThey can prepare for life's ups and downs coverage options and more information can be found at farmers dot com\nAnd from American University's ... school of business committed to business being a force for meaningful change through graduate and to undergraduate degrees mission driven curriculum and hands on approach Morris co God done American dot edu\nDown to our conversation about so called me to legislation trends in New state laws the name to strengthen protections against sexual harassment\nLaw school assistant professor associate professor Elizabeth typically we woke up some more of your questions and thoughts as well especially if the laws in your state that deal with sexual harassment sexual abuse worked for you or field you we'd love to hear your story or even just your questions about the way these laws work\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one eighty or email won a a W. A. M. U. dot org Emily Martin I Love to get your reaction to what we heard from California state senator ... and so I was like ... California is trying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think\nI agree that California's been a real leader\nIn the space those with the laws that um we just heard about that were passed last last session\nAs well as if you love the unfortunately we're vetoed by the governor that would have expanded the statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim you know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about\nI'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that is not enough time often for people to figure out what they need to do how they want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action\nSo you know we joined the national Law Center joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week\nCalling for twenty states by twenty twenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassment protections and California I think it's really a beacon for other states and thinking about how can\nThey strengthen their laws in meaningful ways many states Emily that you're targeting in particular well I think\nOne of the things that we've seen this past year is that it's not just progressive states for example Tennessee\nNo coming to work that would ah keep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and so we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide solution Suzanne ... your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Jackson\nYeah I think it's a great example of a legislators and really trying to grapple with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and and\nAnd introduced a lot of different types of legislation to get out that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that\nI did want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states and that provides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment of workplace in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note that quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitation laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find that conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org vets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously owners and if we could dig into the line of where nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not\nInherently illegal they can have a purpose in contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information Dennis wrote on our Facebook page there is a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however it is it ...\nThe guard list of the existence of this agreement Sudan\nYes well that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states in their legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements\nAnd sometimes they just called them contracts um or other types of agreements\nMost of the legislation that we've seen us specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace though it wouldn't necessarily band nondisclosure in great agreements and hold but just as they relate to this specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nPressure typical before we move on to too much for there can you just define that term force what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do\nWell there's actually two types there's the type that you mentioned that people find that to start over there and play meant that says keep our information confidential and that was another type of people signed usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they've hired a lawyer\nAnd those are just settled the person's legal claims and those are the ones I think that had become most problematic because in those cases it's clear that some sort of bad conduct has occurred or is disputed and in those cases both parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts underline the case\nFor someone who stick with you from it I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or help for hurtful in terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you have said that they may not be enforceable because they may be some there maybe some contradictions\nWith federal law but I Would gather that sometimes they can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line\nWell\nThe contracts that you sign at the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes clear that those can't cover sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in the contract\nSo the contracts in a way educate the employees about their rights it's a lot more complicated though if you're talking about settling a lawsuit because in that case many times the person is represented by a lawyer and I've heard plaintiff lawyers say that they like these provisions because it's moved the path toward the settlement\nAnd nothing is kind of hard about this is the people who maybe had the most interests and learning this information aren't at a table future effect and potential victims of harassment they don't have a say in whether the victim and the employer decided to keep the information secret\nLet's get through some of your comments and questions Alex tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier\nLuckily we have to go through sharp training every year we all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on emailed my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in Chicago for a work conference a resident of Illinois sexually assaulted her despite my encouragement she is terrified of coming forward for fear of retribution\nDo laws or cross state lines especially in Illinois and New York\nComplicate the legalities that would otherwise helped bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say the stuff on\nThat's a great question if you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond setter ally yes there can be complicated questions that arise if the person is usually employed in one state but the harassing or assaulting behavior was in another\nBut it's important to remember that we're talking about state law stay in the ways in which states are going above and beyond federal protection and there are core federal protections they should be strengthened in various ways that their core federal protections against workplace sexual harassment against sexual harassment in schools and so that is ...\nThe code they live in a suicide I'd love to get your take on one of the states that did not pass at least one of its proposed bills on sexual harassment and that was in Louisiana it had to do with settlements of sexual harassment cases Louisiana State House bill five seven eight would have stopped employers\nFrom forcing workers to settle sexual harassment disputes through arbitration state representative Raymond cruise voted against the bill among other things the rep said it would open up litigation for everything\nRight now we're considered one of the most with did just states and the nation one source I just looked up said we're number six six out of fifty own worst states for litigation\nMatter of fact if you divide of the country into five four regions the south has one hundred eighty six cases like that her ten thousand people the next closest section has Fifteen one tenth less than one tenth the ratio of\nThese kind of cases go into court I encourage you to do what we can to help stop sexual harassment early anti ... both the state has a good and business friendly state to be in", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year":
