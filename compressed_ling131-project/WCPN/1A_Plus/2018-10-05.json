A. M. U. dot org\nWorth noting that the president is awake and tweeting today his latest tweet about the cabinet process and the protest against it reads quote\nThe very rude elevator screamer are paid professionals only looking to make senators look bad do fall for it also look at all of the professionally made identical sides paid for by Soros and others these are not signs made in the basement from love\nHash tag troublemakers\nThe president's been pretty vocal about this whole process in the last few days has been for some time but it's been turning increasingly negative is a week's going on on Tuesday the president held a rally in Minnesota and took the opportunity to mock Kavanaugh's accuser professor Christine Blasey Ford and question her account of events\nThirty six years ago this shop and I had one\nBeer [noise] right I had one beer [noise]\nWell you think it was I was wondering how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know [noise]\nI don't [noise] I don't know\n[noise] what\nNeighborhood was it and I don't know where's the house [noise] upstairs downstairs where was I don't know but I had one beer that's the only thing are in [noise]\n\nBeautiful incredible young is\nThey destroyed people they want to destroy all these really evil people\nPart of what President Trump said to supporters at a rally in Minnesota on Tuesday Steve Clemons we should note first of all what the president said is untrue professor Ford did not say that the only thing she remembered was having one beer ironically she said the thing she most remembered was being laughed at\nBy Brett Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge she was allegedly in the room when this happened so there's a little bit of irony with the crowd laughing her over the president's account so we should clear that up but I Wonder more to the point\nWhether or not the White House has addressed those remarks\nLook I'm I was on stage just on the other day with Kellyanne Conway are asking her about these uh the president's temperament and\nUh about her own revelations about sexual assault that had happened in her life and why she chose a to share that and and she ah acknowledged that she didn't choose to share that it just came out\nThe president's behavior is something that makes many people around the president United States today extremely uncomfortable [noise]\nThey have at the beginning of this process we're trying to be respectful to say that a doctor Ford needed to be heard and listen to or that there were important issues there and the president broke out of those constraints and we're sitting as I'm sure Susan Glasser and a Eugene or\nWill will comment as well in a very extraordinary moment where many Americans and their experiences at that have gone through many other sexual assault victims in the past have kept quiet and said this week even Susan Collins who's now probably uh in in a position to vote 'em in in favor of a judge Kavanaugh\nHas has said you know people do not\nBad that was written for one person that was written for not Donald Trump was written for Senator Flake Senator Flake at the Atlantic idea at the Atlantic festival this this week\nSaid that we could not have the kind of temperament that Kavanaugh showed on the Supreme Court he says we cannot have that on the court we just cannot and he was referring specifically to cabinet going after senator after senator after senator after his very emotional opening statement\nAnd that was a message to give flake cover to also vote for cabinet so we're sitting here where people are walking away from the allegations and\nUh the tunnel that many women and their partners and other supporting them feel about this being a shoved under the rug right while others are getting a hum essentially\nFig leafs and passes to be able to vote for cabinet\nYeah he did have a lot of very sharp exchanges with senator Amy Klobuchar shower and Patrick Leahy and and Dick Durbin and many of the Democrats who questioned him last Thursday fewer quick questions and then we'll we'll keep going let me get to some of your comments as well Virginia and in Washington DC writes democratic obstructionism\nMerrick Garland\nAnd Susan in Gainesville, Florida asks what on earth is the rationale for only one copy of the report a forty five pages being provided for review by one hundred senators\nSusan clearly a lot of things for voters to carry in they're not at all distant memories when they go to the polls in November go to the polls next month do we have any\nReal hard reliable sense is there any evidence of how much this may affect the mid term elections I mean a lot of what voters vote on in the midterms doesn't have to do with what happens in Washington so live it does a lot of it has to do with what happens at home we have a sense of what the balance is looking like right now\nWell first of all it does depend in fact on how the ... and there is an interesting I\nVoters while a becoming an enormous rallying cry for Democrats and conversely were he to go down\nA especially in such a spectacular fashion so close to the election there's already a sense and President Trump clearly feels is which is why he's been ... up his his voters over the last week on this he you know that we're Kavanaugh to go down that this would outrage a and an enraged\nRepublican base voters in a way that could prove beneficial especially in some of these key Senate races are in ... which is already taking place largely on a favorable to Republicans playing field this fault what's unusual about this\nDevice if we've had many divisive fights before a it strikes me that this is coming so close to a mid term election therefore injecting a volatile note of uncertainty with just weeks to go to the election number one number two a it is a cultural war being ignited arguably\nAmong Democrats and Republicans while\nBoth sides I I wrote last week about the two Americas that would listen to the very jarring lead different accounts offered by Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh and uh would process this hearing and it's completely different way I think we've all watched that playing out over the last week a each a\nPolitical tried in our increasingly tribally divided culture has a whole different facts at a whole different narrative a whole different argument to make its inflaming\nPassions on both sides are Republicans have made a lot over polls in recent days showing that\nA Republican voter enthusiast and which had been very low very turned off in this midterm election year has sparked upwards a over the last week you could argue well that's just the the election getting closer and we're not sure how much it has to do with cabinet but but my guess is that you know for different parts of the country um\nShould be happening imminently ... and all that goes but one more comments on this from Gary who wrote on our Facebook page\nSexual assault aside Kavanaugh was not someone I saw as being even killed and being neutral making political statements during his opening yes he has qualifications on paper to be a justice however his temperament should be assessed\nLet's move on to some of the other big stories of big news this week including with immigration policy roughly three hundred thousand immigrants from El Salvador Haiti Nicaragua and Sudan has gotten a temporary reprieve\nAfter the Trump Administration threatened to revoke their temporary protected status TPS\nThis week a federal judge in California put the administration's plans on hold for now\nIf the plan does eventually go through hundreds of thousands of people with TPS will be forced to leave the U. S. over the next year Eugene temporary protected status is is one of these things that protects folks from other countries who come to the U.S under eggs which in circumstances like after the Haiti earthquake\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Boehner with a bonus certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractor is committed to expertise and the customer service contract to locate her and more information are Boehner dot com\nAnd from the Brown University school of professional studies with executive master's degrees for mid career professionals in the fields of business cyber security healthcare and science and technology leadership brown dot edu slash NPR\nNow to the friday news roundup with Susan Glasser Eugene Scott and Steve Clemons let's talk a little bit more about that New York times investigation regarding President Trump's finances are ... Eugene I think\nOne of the things that is worth noting for sure was what Susan Glasser said regarding the\nAh the provenance of the information related to the investigation or there are other big questions that are still out there when it comes to the president's tax history we still don't have his tax returns\nProvided by him for example I was gonna say that's the biggest question I mean the reality is this what's done over a I Believe Eighteen months what has happened since\nThat's because many of the answers could be provided if we actually had a the tax forms which Sarah Huckabee Sanders pretty much gave us a reason to believe earlier this week we've we perhaps should not expect or the reality is that this is not an area that Trump\nA desire to be transparent about and many of his supporters don't demand that he has I think there are people who are have noticed how much wealthier he has gotten since getting in\nUm the White House and and regarding specific uh businesses if heads or some of the um hotels have rented out by international organizations perhaps wanting to um curry good favor with the administration\nUm and I think there's some people who are concerned about how that could influence a policy foreign policy\nSpecifically well it's been four years since the fatal shooting of black teenager look climbed McDonald by officer Jason Van Dyke in Chicago this week marks the end\nOf that closely watched trial has the jury deliberate we're keeping an eye on the verdict come will keep you updated on any developments on that before we continue with surround up a quick word\nAbout next week the black lives matter movement which they will climbed McDonald cases definitely caught up in\nFocus is on police shootings of African Americans and one of the most prominent voices in that movement will join us next week de ray ... cats in\nHis new memoir called on the other side of freedom appeals for police reform and remind supporters of black lives matter to keep fighting for awareness of this issue\nWe'd like to know what questions you have about the black lives matter movement today or questions for ... he tried to turn his activism into elected office when he ran for mayor of Baltimore in twenty six team that beat was unsuccessful but what does it say about where it's a movement is and where should it go\nShare your questions for activists to writing the cats and you can leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one\nYou can also use our new app won a vox pop where you can leave us a radio quality message or check in on future topics you'll find one vox pop V. O. X. P. O. P. in the app store and we will share our conversation with the ... coming up next week\nOn one day while the vote on the Senate floor has just happened were just double checking our numbers are out of what the vote total was again this is one of two votes that's involved in either getting Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court or not\nToday's vote is a procedural vote to end the debate it's technically called cloture\nThe next vote would be the vote on whether or not senators would actually choose to put ... on the U.S Supreme Court\nWe heard just a few minutes ago that Senator Susan Collins Republican of Maine\nWho might be a potential swing vote on this announced\nThat she will side with her fellow Republicans on a critical past voted this cloture vote to end the debate we're just double checking our numbers right now want to make sure we have the exact right so total and as soon as we have that\nWe will bring that to you for the moment we should get to one of Susan ... I ... she is literally leaping out of ...\nWell it looks like we have the votes now from all four of the undecided senators going into at least on this cloture motion and interesting they Lisa Murkowski is the only one who was voted no show Joe mansion that Democrat from West Virginia has voted yes\nJeff Flake has voted yes Susan Collins has voted yes now Susan Collins however previously announced she was voting yes on the cloture vote but not\nTo necessarily take that as an indication of her final stance on Kavanaugh because she this afternoon at three PM she will announce her final decision so we don't know necessarily what this procedural votes me but I think it's quite significant\nUh to see the Joe mansion yes vote in particular and the Lisa Murkowski no vote is\nGoing on maybe from senators who were struggling in and out of the room Steve Clemons once this cloture vote is done with eventually it will be done with what happens then what do we expect between this vote in the next one\nWill you'll have debate on the floor or that goes on and they'll bring that debate to a close and they will set a time most likely tomorrow I'm In which they will vote to confirm or not judge Kavanaugh\nAnd that time it it could be any time during the day or is there like a particular window hardly any time of day I mean one of the things about the Senate is it\nRuns anytime I think one of the interesting things is you have a a senator from Montana a a Steve Gaines whose daughter is being married tomorrow getting married tomorrow and he wants to walk her down the aisles so ushered his vote be absolutely necessary they have to wait for him to get back from Montana so it's one of those life\nUh intrusions into the way of the system runs but my sense is that Mitch McConnell is obsessed with getting this done moving on and getting people out campaigning and\nHe'd noting this as a success that they've achieved that's why this is so unusual that feels raced pushed whether it's the FBI investigation which many people have been saying has not been a exhaustive did not go into many corners is because the clock is ticking for Mitch McConnell and I think he wants to shelve this and get this done as soon as possible\nAnd not one of these votes achieved you'd want to vote you have to do in person there was no app for that so certainly his [laughter] his uh his other life commitments can have a big impact the final vote total fifty one yes forty nine no and indeed as Susan said senators Collins flake and mentioned voted yes to suspend the debate and move on\nLisa Murkowski voted no but it seems like for the most part this was pretty much a party line vote Eugene Scott I don't think that we really expected it to go\nIts moment suggested that even before the allegations against Kavanaugh became a public and I think uh there's a a ... a larger idea I've added David Brooks tapped them\nOr to today and in his New York times piece about just how part is in the judicial branch has become um we talk often about activist judges um and concern that people on the bench are not making decisions and partially but\nWe haven't seen that be the case for a while now and they simply appears to be a continuation of that I mean if I if I may Joshua\nOne other element on this is that it was interesting to note that Heidi Heitkamp brother\nTweeted that she has to look at herself every day in the mirror and us chose to vote no even though he thinks it significantly increases the chances that she will lose her seat\nJoe Manchin the last time there was a reasonable poll in West Virginia is looking at Seventy percent of West Virginia is likely to vote support the cabin on nomination so the broader side in terms of the tectonics in the parties as they look at trying to take the Senate where the Democrats taking the Senate is\nIs also hedging on this that if mentioned were to be a no vote on Kavanaugh I think it it it very seriously could raise the stakes of him losing that state so there are different they're different issues here one is what what does the future prospects of\nA of the composite of the Senate look like with regards to this and despite the many many personal emotional and deep issues related to the cabinet on nomination itself and this lifetime appointment but\nMany people are looking at high campus now a in a much more endangered position um and this probably uh if if Manchin follow through with his position on on the vote tomorrow increases the chances that he will survive a in November Susan\nI just I mean I think that that's our view right now a plan if Kavanaugh gets through as I think teams\nOh yes on the nomination than we might have known going into this cloture vote\nBut if if ... gets through in the end\nI I think Josh made this point earlier and Iraq as it may or may not actually prove decisive in any of these individual Senate races uh it's uh\nIn in Alaska for example if Lisa Murkowski she's Republican she votes no but the Republican governor and lieutenant governor of her state have come out against Kavanaugh there particularly incensed not necessarily even about the sexual assault charges but a about a ruling that that bears on a Native Americans that he made as a judge earlier in his career and\nAre among the world's highest honors for service to humanity and now we know the

vote on the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh cabin up has secured the supportive enough senators to advance to a confirmation vote NPR's Scott Detrow is here with this lab reports gun so so there's one final\nVote over the weekend and uh eating won't necessarily be the exact same boats here Maine Republican Susan Collins voted yes to advance Kavanaugh's nomination\nShe says she will announce her final decision it could be a gas it could be a no later today of the four key undecided vote that we were looking at three of them voted to advance Kevin along with Collins\nArizona Republican Jeff Flake voted for\nNomination Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was a key no vote which surprised when people she had been on the fence all along she voted no so it's a party line vote except for Murkowski voting no as a Democrat and mentioned voting yes with the Republicans\nScott does this mean that Mr Kaplan I Will be on the Supreme Court looks\nMore likely than not right now but again we'll have a better picture later today I think Joe mansion in particular is going to come under tremendous pressure over the next few days he's up for reelection in a state where President Trump is very popular but Democrats are are going to be hounding him with calls in protest over the next few days\nThe final vote comes this weekend we don't necessarily know what day because here's one wild

the political pressures on them so what do you do about it that's why the president signed a new set of executive orders and I'm In August we haven't seen them they are all\nTo do cyber attacks back without having presidential sign off\nTill now that's been something that the only only the president could authorized the use of nuclear weapons and cyber weapons now it's not entirely clear that only he can authorize the use of cyber weapons in retaliation but you want to make sure you're attribution is pretty good before you strike back\nYou know who to attack yeah great married before we move on from there first of all that is no small thing that that the U.S military might have the latitude unilaterally to shut down a power grid or turn off or you know hydroelectric dam through the Internet\nBut beyond that do we have a sense that certain countries certain organizations are getting a better handle on dealing with cyberattacks to world clearly hasn't figured this out is anyone making progress I think about the EU because I hear so much about Internet regulations from there on a consumer level but\nOn a military level is anyone making progress\nOr not that I'm aware of the U.S I think it's still the world leader and in in terms of you know advanced Internet abilities and and the threats are pretty clear a Russia China and North Korea or Iran\nBut a ... figuring out or response and how you want to calibrate that response so it doesn't become this open ended escalation and you don't know the capabilities of your rivals if you respond a you you're entering really uncharted territory\nVivian do we get a sense of countries beginning to kind of work together to figure this out to to figure out some kind of international response to cyber attacks or as Russia really got the whole world kind of running with here on\nThey say what we've seen in the last couple of days of coordination of hum indictments than you know raising concerns about um sighing and otherwise obviously there's a lot of discussions that are taking place where countries our western allies trying to coordinate some kind of effort to counter\nMany I'm uncertain case as to how to approach the cyber world in general on cyber threats and as David said the U.S trying to really formulate some sort of attack plan or something to counter and to protect our infrastructure so that we don't have um we're not as vulnerable as we've seen ourselves\nIn the past but obviously you know the U.S is still trying to figure out a way forward I'm having looked at what happened to us in the two thousand sixteen election still we're talking about the fact that we are vulnerable in two thousand Eighteen we could be vulnerable in twenty twenty so we haven't actually tried quite figured out how to protect ourselves get alone\nThe world's kind of coordinating on a global scale to do the same it's it's it's not an easy task\nIt's funny kind of a decentralization of the way that we vote that we are so many different kinds of voting systems might you know way kind of how it helps a lot it helps insulated from according to the fact that we've got all these different utility company yeah but you know ... but but the key element here as we've done a better job at discussing internally how we would\nDo counterattacks than we have organizing the world than the sort of digital Geneva Convention what standards of what's on limits and often it\nLet's shift gears and talk about the Nobel Prize is particularly the Nobel Peace prize the winners were announced this morning Dr Denis ... and ... one for their work combating sexual violence as a weapon of war\nThe announcement from the Nobel Committee said in part quote Dennis ... will quake is to help or who has devoted his life defending these victims\nIs the witness who tells of the abuses perpetrated against herself and others were rod is an Iraqi woman she was captured and held by the Islamic state escaped captivity after three months and told to her story in a book called the last girl\nDr ... founded a hospital in eastern Congo that treated thousands of women many of whom are ...\nHow sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war and has for quite some time yeah really has to two individuals who seem really deserving of the peace prize has been a lot of had a lot of controversy in recent years very politicized\nA couple of people who really been thrust into dangerous situations handled it with with incredible courage and Dr ... up built this hospital in eastern Congo which is in the middle of nowhere and just a very remote region Twenty years ago for maternal care they're just as much health care of that was his intent\nBut as the Congolese civil war metastasize um rape became a huge issue a huge problem the various factions un peacekeepers who are involved in in rape there\nAnd so he became the voice of rape being used as a weapon of war and so he's been at this for Twenty years very prominent a voice but still operating in a very ah\nA dicey region of very deserving winter very\nI I can really speak for the case of ... who I I spend a lot of time in Iraq and two dozen Fifteen sixteen I'm interviewing ZD women who were released from captivity from ISIS and\nThe impact yeah obviously psychologically physically or the the the use of sexual assault\nAnd rape as a tool and war is obviously a huge thing but you have to also remember that these women go back to their\nTried to go back home a lot of their family shunned them because of cultural sensitivities to such things and so their lives are essentially up ended by their families a lot of times don't take them back home a lot of these women were impregnated I'm as a result of this and had to really know where to go because\nThey were single mothers which in Iraq is is just\nCompletely a taboo and so I you know it's something that you should raising awareness for that's something really really important and you had a lot of people on the ground in Iraq trying tests\nTroy perceptions it's it's it's an uphill battle and so that's one of the other way I'm trying to do that and it's a it's it's worth the the know notoriety that you're standing\nLet's shift gears and talk about China vice president Mike Pence spoke yesterday accusing China of trying to sway American public opinion and undermine the Trump Administration\nTo put it bluntly President Trump's leadership is working in China wants a different American president there can be no doubt China is meddling in America's democracy David what is\nVice president Pence mean by meddling what do we know about what China actually is doing well it's it's pretty fascinating because he is appropriating\nThe language of the Russian attacks from on the twenty sixteen election and transferring it over to a different set of activities\nThat the Chinese are are involved in that there's no question that the Chinese have views cyber before in for political purposes but they largely haven't used it here they've used it in Taiwan they've used it in their\nArguments with Tibet they've used it internally a lot they've used it to some degree in Australia and New Zealand\nBut what he is arguing is that in putting together retaliatory tariffs terrorists that are retaliating for terrorists the United states put on China\nThey are aiming at states and districts that are key to President Trump\nAnd therefore causing pain\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed a financial

with Vivian ... and David Sanger let's talk about Iran\nAfter the Trump Administration abandoned the nuclear deal that was negotiated during President Obama's tenure and to reimpose sanctions Iran took us to court the international court of justice to Akron argue that the u._s. actions violated the terms of the Nineteen fifty five treaty of ...\nWell the Trump Administration hit back this week\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday that the U.S is ending that treaty\nIs a decision frankly says thirty nine years overdue in July around brought in Marilyn's case and the international court of justice alleging violations of the treaty of amity\nOr on six to challenge the United states' decision to seize participation in the Iran nuclear deal and to reimpose the sanctions were lifted as part of that deal\nThat was secretary of state Mike Pompeo speaking on Wednesday Vivian salami some have said that ending this treaty is largely symbolic or is that so\nYeah it is an unknown and a lot of ways I I think um in general it's more just reinforcing the administration says standing\nEfforts to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and um crackdown on Iran and kind of show that they're not messing around and so I'm basically this was just one more step in that process but as far as any real uh changes on the ground it really doesn't do much it's really just our sponsor\nTo on the international court of justice says ruling that uh that essentially said that sanctions that they re imposing sanctions um we're not fair to\nIran bring my we step back for just a second what is this treaty of amity [noise] uh I'm sure that was a question if the state department I just have this vision of some low level staff are going through the basement looking treaty avenues should really damage\nCould result thing for me heard about that is the the big acronym of Jaycee PO away the Iran nuclear deal but\nIs this treaty of amateur well in Nineteen fifty three the U.S helped orchestrate a coup in Iran bringing the shah of Iran back to power or if they were us and Iran were buddy buddy at that time and so two years later\nIt's the yeah you're brought me back to power shirt treaty of amnesty great and they were indeed good friends from fifty three until\nThe Seventy nine revolution misses the shah who was deposed in ... in the Islamic Revolution of ... Seventy nine so for thirty nine years uh there has been no enmity between us in a rod\nUm this again seems very symbolic I'm just a last little relic that somehow didn't get shredded after the the the revolution Seventy not it was the last hurrah of ...\nThis coup and then they got everybody we put in power to go sign the treaty port Kermit he's getting no respect in the state department these days it was permanent Roosevelt\nI'm taking it I I liked that name for for a man who had such a place in history comment Roosevelt and I know where the American David ... is there any real effect in terms of\nThe sanctions the consequences to the U. S. for refusing to lift them if this treaty of am a tea is more sim Bali where might there be more tangible impact so the tangible impact\nIs November when President Trump has said that he will impose the full sanctions on Iran He's given allies warning that this was coming and those sanctions if he does it as he his pronounced would say to any ... company around the world but particularly European companies\nIf you do business with Iran you're not doing business with the United states and it's an effort to choke off the Iranians\nBy making the big aircraft makers Boeing's ready pulled out the big um oil a production equipment makers all get out of Iran and they were doing that what's happening now though is that the ... the Europeans are saying we're going to find a mess it\nTo buy oil from Iran without clearing it in dollars so that the u._s. can affect it with the sanctions and a number of us went up and met a with the Iranian foreign minister when he was at the un ah last week and he made an argument to us was Saturday evening\nThat he believed that this method was going to come together so we're heading toward a conflict between the U.S and its European allies over on\nDo we have a sense Vivian I I think I feel like the the big issue really is Iran's nuclear program and the argument from the other nations who are still ...\nAnd that it has done something to impede Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon do we have a sense of where we stand in that regard sitting the economic stuff aside for a moment justice put us any closer on that path or we still kind of in a holding pattern me what is was outlook well\nThe Europeans as you say they they consistently say that they they don't want to North Korea is I mean this is of course before we became buddy buddy and\nPresident Trump declared that he and Kim Jong un or love\nUh we we didn't want to North Korea is in the sense that we didn't want this to very active or potentially rogue nuclear states and so\nI'm a checked Iran was always going to be better than an unchecked Iran and so that was the Europeans argument as to why the nuclear deal had to continue despite its imperfections and so um", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "05"}
