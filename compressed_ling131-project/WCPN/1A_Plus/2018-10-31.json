A. M. U. dot org and they get to a few more of your comments Laura is in Goshen, Indiana\nLaura emailed Trump as a vanguard of our worst angels is effectively sounding the horn to release previously restrained prejudices latent in some Americans\nHate is now fair game and high volume what they call the end the political correctness is the end of civility and democracy missing McCain and Obama now you don't know what you've got till it's gone and it's gone\nHeidi by Rick I Wonder if you could respond to that comment I Wonder if what Laura is saying\nIn a way takes a little of the pressure off of President Trump\nIn so far as he didn't create these views he happened to have tapped into them but you can't tap into something that wasn't already there\nI think that's a completely fair position I mean you know in the United states has had a long problem with white supremacy and racism and legally oppressed you know parts of its own population for centuries\nSo that that it's legitimate to say that this kind of hate has been there\nI Will say that the work we do at the Southern Poverty Law Center found a great escalation and the number of hate groups for example on\nLine hate rhetoric particular ... during the years that Obama was in office as an African American he very much a set off white supremacist who were unhappy with him being elected to the highest office\nAnd the Internet it self has allowed this kind of material to proliferate radicalized people you know it's allowed to be shared in a way that wasn't\nSee it there's no question that there is a hyper polarization in American politics and I think it's important to also recognize that something is going on internationally when you look at Europe a there is a larger\nKind of breakdown of post World war two consensus um you know in general throughout the the developed world and certainly in Western Europe and North America\nA Trump did not create that he isn't happening it and he's exploiting it to his political uh aims\nWe need a a tremendous reset I think in American political discourse and this is not a I'm not even talking about the rhetoric of hate per se um of polarization of opposition at this point according to Gallup about twenty six percent of people\nIn America identify as Republican about twenty seven or twenty eight percent identified as Democrats these are historic lows\nAs was noted before there is a historically low level of trust and confidence in the government and other major institutions\nWe need to come up with a a political rhetoric of public rhetoric actually that is\nI'm not a you know that is not based on demonization polarization and again either Trump Trump bears a certain core responsibility as president of the United states because he is not\nSimply a politician he is also on some level uh he should be leading the discussion in a way that has more productive than he is but he's also not the only one are you doing this um\nAnd um the other thing to think about though is\nWhat is the distinction between rhetoric and action um and you know when we we live in a ... a society that is filled with a lot of a fantasy violence whether we're talking about games whether we're talking about rhetoric et cetera but in general crimes are going down and violence is going down so again\nRecognizing that rhetoric is one thing in reality is another I think as you know as the starting point of any conversation about this but I Do think we need to reset and that it needs\nIf the words that are set especially in the political sphere I mean anyone who thinks that and I know you're not saying that words have zero power but ... who who minimize the power of words needs to go back and read the declaration of independence those words yeah weapons for sure and they let you a war\nAh you know yeah I I you know I I agree completely with that and and I realized that I you know or maybe it's a slippery position where I'm saying you know simultaneously that words matter in rhetoric matters but also that we need you know what what are we going to do about this I guess as it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous it is hate filled it is garbage I mean it is and it you know it's been now uh we we can go on and on that doesn't get us any closer to figuring out how do how do we have a better conversation about politics about places where we need to\nReach a consensus and and then it knocked policies that actually work for the benefit of of\nPeople I Do want to talk a little bit more going forward a little later in the conversation about what next steps might look like next we'll circle back to that Jennifer mochi a number of people\nHave commented on the role of the press of various media outlets that I Will try hard not to use the term is a media\nBecause there are so many different kinds of media out there will try to be a specific as we can and thanks to those of you who have commented who has been specific who've mentioned specific networks or specific people that is extremely helpful so keep that up\nLet me get to a few of your comments about various media outlets in various press outlets\nCheryl tweeted the largest responsibility belongs Judy twenty four seven media and those who absorb commentary an opinion as if it were factual news that President much like Andrew Jackson stands up to the press should he just let the Ninety percent negative coverage go we all need to be personally responsible\nMod asks why does he get so much airtime\nRush Limbaugh Glenn Beck Alex Jones et cetera but you've permeated our society at a finally elected zero leader which only embolden stone Jennifer before you react to that sweet of comments I should note that going back in recent years\nHas tried to walk back some of his rhetoric has as publicly apologized in his words for for taking some of the rhetoric too far but I Do wonder for what's your sense of how much of a ... various media outlets plans\nAnd it's a great question and I think that um there's a little bit of a historical big picture that um maybe would inform my answer here I'm In part of that is the reciprocal ruled that used to exist between the president and the press\nUm it used to be the case that uh there was a mutually beneficial relationship between the presidency and the press a largely because they needed each other the press needed the president for information and the president needed depressed because the president needed to disseminate that information and get their message out\nAnd that relationship has fractured a and that's largely due to um cable news and social media and the fact that we all now have this platform to disseminate and circulate information including the president\nUm and so information circulates in a very different way than it did twenty thirty fifty years ago which is really fractured this relationship between the press and the president and Trump has been able to take advantage of that\nAre in a way that that previous presidents had tried to do but Trump has really done much better for worse job depending on your perspective um and so a Trump is completely mastered the news cycle and the way that\n... especially cable news has been complicit I think in in amplifying his message at you know on Twitter he has followers a ...\nRight and because those messages are amplified and that is Trump using the bully pulpit to good pope that of the presidency and also taking advantage of all of these other social media opportunities and and and so in this case a lot of times the press is then guilty as impulse sinus messages and then they shouldn't have\n... I Wonder how much you put the blame on various media outlets versus the president I feel like at this point we're kind of used to the drum beat of opinionated commentators on television and radio it's almost a trope in our culture I mean\nThe new Spiderman game on the police station has J Jonah dream is and the guy used to be the publisher of the daily bugle where Peter Parker worked\nAs an AM talk show host whose whole job is to criticize Spiderman and it comes up in the storyline like we're so used to this it almost feels like background noise whereas the president always feels like foreground but that's kind of ... concern is that the president always feels like foreground how to use it as\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from love me in makers of go to meeting a collaboration meeting platform that comes equipped with features to help people stay focused to get work done learned more it go\nTo meeting dot com from capital one\nCommitted to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be opened from anywhere\nCapital one what's in your wallet capital one NA and from the John D and Catherine team MacArthur Foundation at ... dot org\nWe get back to our conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program about voter access head of the midterms we've heard a lot of concerns about people who should be able to vote not being able to voter fraud has been a hot topic for the last few years so say voter suppression is worse now than it's been in some time\nHow easy or hard is it to vote where you live\nWhat have you encountered in terms of registering to vote or casting your ballot leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a if you've ever run into problems voting what was the issue and how did you deal with it tell us your story eight five five\nOn a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Jennifer ... by Rick and Nick Gillespie a few more of your comments Fernando tweeted we are all adults at adults take responsibility for their own actions the media is trying to find a scapegoat and it is truly unfair but then again he is blamed for everything\nDone writes the shooter is responsible dumb question\nDrew tweeted Trump may not be responsible for the violence but the people who are feeling Bolden and encouraged by what he says as long as he remains inconsistent and denouncing violence and hatred they'll continue seeing him\nAs an ally stripped from what she could you response that last week from drew it is true that the president\nHas denounced the violence I mean the first statement he made after the carnage in Charlottesville was to denounce white supremacy bigotry hatred melts forms then in that press conference that impromptu press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday I think\nHe said there were good people on both sides ... I Wonder\nHow you view this in terms of the the way that the president denounces violence at least in a statement and then makes comments that are vitriolic thereafter how do you see this\nYeah it's a great question and and I'd also like to address the question of responsibility and if we have a moment you know that after answer\nAnd so Trump will say the thing that somebody has written for him to say he will read from the teleprompter when he is forced to do that\nAnd that that isn't his natural inclination and so I have tracked in fact the way that Trump uses denial and in these situations when people do try to hold him accountable and suggest that he has some responsibility for something\nSo for example during the campaign and a group of white nationalist at the daily\n... um and so they sent her um hate messages and death threats and you know did all kinds of terrible things to her\nAnd when they asked Trump about it he said he didn't know anything about it so his first strategy was to deny any knowledge and then they said well and you know just on CNN they said well but you know do you have a message about this now you you clearly know about it I'm telling you about it\nAnd then he denies association with the people right or he says I don't know I don't know those people and he says what fans of mine you know are these are these fans who've done this\nUm and then he does a third thing which is to wonder what um the journalist Julie off he had done to deserve this hatred you know did she write this terrible article that is full of you know lives about me um and then to accuse other people have doing the same kinds of things right to an appeal to hypocrisy\nAnd if you look at when Trump is responding to these situations where people are trying to hold him accountable for his violent rhetoric\nUm he follows that same pattern he denies knowledge of it he denies association of it and maybe praises the people who've done it he wonders what the person did to deserve it and then he finally uses to call ... which is an appeal to ... to say oh everybody else does this it's not just me\nUm and that is classic for Trump he cannot be held accountable [noise]\nThis is why I call him a demagogue a demagogue is an an accountable leader and that's a historic definition deriving from ancient Athens\nUm and and we're talking about whether Trump is responsible and we can say that he's responsible but I'm telling you Trump does not accept responsibility he won't take that responsibility um and admit that he in fact has been wrong\nI Wonder how effective do Jennifer's in a situation like this to refer a lot of blaming you for this or just kind of wondering what your take is ordered to refer to prison\nWon the electoral college and when you call him a demagogue you call all the people who looked at him supporters enablers of a demagogue him at a time when something like this happens but it's got to make it harder to have to cut it to be we need to have about ... about reforming the civil discourse\nSure it's an accurate term so um if you look it up in the Oxford English dictionary and the lady you'll see that the first step finishing of a demagogue is positive for neutral it says that it's a leader of the people which is a the etymology of the word\nWho defends the rights of the people against the other parts of the state the second definition of demagogue is a leader who uses polarizing propaganda for their own personal gain\nDonald Trump is a demagogue in both senses of the word\nFor his fans for his followers and his voters the ones who won't leave him who will defend him at all costs they defend him because they see him as a heroic demagogue they see him as defending their rights against the other parts of the state that they believe are corrupt\nEveryone else who sees him as a demagogue in the bad sense of the word sees him as using polarizing propaganda for his own game\nSlip through the use of the word to use the word accurate though it may be use it helpful\nThink so [laughter] it's an analytic point we can't understand what Donald Trump is doing if we can't understand what he's doing an unaccountable leader is a danger in any political community but it's actually in a democracy\nPolitical scientists and historians who are concerned about the health of American democracy people who are charging democratic erosion and how democracies die they point to the kind of language that he uses they point to the authoritarian tendencies\nOf I'm wanting to uh\nAnd which are a grounded in his language frankly I'm as as evidence of democratic erosion\nHeidi I Wonder if you could respond to one of the concerns that I think are a number of people on the political right have raised which is this idea that the rhetoric is too hot all the way around that the political discourse\nAs just heat it up in both directions many on the right has pointed to the left\nSaying that they use similar rhetoric to the rhetoric that President Trump has been using but they don't get cold out for it quite as much here is a sample of some of what they're referring to\nIs time for us as Democrats to be as tough as they are dedicated as they are to be committed is Michele always says you don't when they go low we go low we can [noise]\nThat you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to recognize and respect is strength\nThat of course was former secretary of state and democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton preceded by democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters and first was former attorney general Eric Holder Heidi what about the course and this across the political spectrum how does that factor into into our current climate well there's no question that there was a horse\nDonald Trump did after Charlottesville look there's some sort of equivalent here the real nastiness is coming from the right and it's coming on the basis of attacks on immigrants\nMuslims global is which many people would argue are anti Semitic theories and there's something else more the violent is coming from the right we don't have domestic terrorism

U. dot org\n... let me come back to you let's talk about the nineties a little bit there are two particular nineties references\nThat I Love you to react to one of them is one that has been getting a lot of attention lately because it's celebrated its twenty fifth anniversary this year here's Bette Midler caffeine a Jimmy and Sarah Jessica Parker in Nineteen Ninety three in hocus pocus\nBe must find folks who the ... is our children up Salem if off and I I Know we have\nTo say how come they head and the only thing is if they win either way easier with the adventure and he says slow lane highway\nHocus pocus from Nineteen Ninety three I was Thirteen\nCraft from Nineteen Ninety six years Robin Tony and Rachel True in the craft\nOf my sisters and I asked for the ability to not have those who gave me\nEspecially racist piece of simply bonds score Leslie\n... different times of the pictures from the nineties but but we are there any common bonds to\nI think there are certain similarities um I think both of those movies are sort of grappling with the kind of wizard of Oz Margaret Hamilton idea but which that we talked about earlier right the idea of the which is this ... threatening woman who is ... the status quo\nAnd he'll get it the way it sort of deals with that is it makes the which is fun and bumbling and they're not totally threatening because there's still a bad at what they're doing um but in the end of course the the modern caves\nAre victorious and which is our sense away and\nAre defeated and you don't have to worry about them ever again the craft kind of wants to embrace the idea of the wicked witch a little bit more it sort of the joy of that movie is watching beads grills gain access to this power and sort of spiraled out of control and go feral in this kind of really satisfying way\nBut at the end of the movie they still have to be returned to resort to the status quo right because it would be too threatening at that point in time if they got to just have all of this on channel the power so the source of their power which is officially gender this but the movie consistently refers to as a male and sometimes they call him daddy\nThe source of their power put restrictions on them and the only the witch who\nSort of response to those restrictions appropriately if that gets to keep her power the ones who rebel against those restrictions and tried to just do whatever they want get punished and have to be sort of set off to an insane asylum and straight jackets in order for it\nThen at the end of the ... century and wanting to get access to that however but not ...\nAble to do so let's whole heartedly glad to hear from some of your about your favorite references to which is in music and movies TV and books mark tweeted Sylvia federally cheese book Taliban and the which that C. A. L. I. B. A. and the Taliban and the which\nIs essential reading on how early capitalism and massaging the witch hunts were tied together and the current season of American horror story is all about which is trying to save the world\nMolly tweeted how about the episode of broad city called which is when Abby and a lot of learned to embrace wishing is as a powerful part of womanhood and perhaps actual magic\nChristian so let's talk a little bit about American horror story particularly the third season of the anthology series American horror story covered in which takes place in New Orleans here is Jessica Lange as Fiona good from the third season\nShare I took down your entire company with about as much as a matter of law\nAnd Marie\nArtim thank God which reminds me drink\nJessica Lange us feel good in American horror story coven now Crist infielder good is not very good in the series she sucks people's life forces to remain eternal young but she's always gotta quip she's one step ahead of our enemies she dresses\nFabulously and it seems like even when which is our evil in pop culture they still kind of are portrayed as enviable\n[noise] yeah I think it goes back to the ... type that is often a one of the nations of the ... that we see and um yeah we we're\nSomeone like fee on and we want to see her be wicked and then we want to see her be punished for it unfortunately that's what most people want to say and so that's kind of what plays out within that area so that ... there was many years ago so he probably seen it [laughter] I Wonder how you see\nThat the crust and I mean you know when when we look at the the wave at different struggles for equality or for social ascendancy are depicted\nYou know sometimes it's the it's a very ... it it feels like a similar cycle you know you have these these characters that are very noble and then eventually we get to these characters that are renegades you know we have\nThis Sidney ... is the first wave and then you've got blacks whites Haitian movie she got shaft it's the second wave you have these characters who are are very admirable and noble and then you have cattle characters who are like you know screw it I'm kicking butts and taking names\nYeah I mean I it just speaks to that the complicated nature of actual human being so in that way they're sort of a human is Asian that's happening when we see these multifaceted witches\nSondra excuse me a busy black woman tweeted so thankful for your guests alternative perspective on be which that's the one which I never liked because of her husband's demands that she not use her powers\nUh oh yeah ... I Wonder if you could could help me with this ah the use of the word which I don't know if you've encountered this but I've encountered a lot of men who have used the W. word\nBecause they knew they weren't allowed to use the B word this word is very charged for a lot of men I mean even that song by Frank Sinatra witchcraft where he says there's just no nicer which than you I think that's kind of a sideways reference to that B word is that something we have to grapple with\nAnd we feed into politics all the time\nPhotoshopped as a which I'm so this really is still a negative epithet that a lot of people use to put women in their place to shame them um to shut them up especially women who are in the public eye who half opinions and who dare to speak their mind\nYeah I I Wonder kind of cost us where we do\nWith that mixed connotation a Noel wrote on our Facebook page\nI don't see the concept of which is a positive feminist forcing mainstream American society if a woman says she identifies as a witch in any sense of the word she's only embrace without identification and pig and culture the word which still has negative connotations like witch hunt\nSo I don't see it as a way for feminist to assert themselves and be hurt a strong powerful voices in society\nAnd Kathleen wrote on our Facebook page here's what I learned as a young girl from the wizard of Oz well behaved sweet witches are always beautiful graceful and kind which is to strive for power are ugly\nMean and bitter not exactly a feminist message constants yeah\nMean I think that the listeners aren't round as the either those messages there I mean one of the lines in the wizard of Oz rate is a door and he said which is our old and ugly and Linda said no on the bad witches are old and ugly good which is a beautiful\nTheir general there's definitely a kind of classic Madonna who are good woman that woman dichotomy here where women who are adhere to the status quo like the heroine of the cops Sarah does get to the powerful to a certain extent as long as they used their power in a way that is\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from farmers insurance committed to helping people

of it's done by the south [noise] especially the music [noise]\nCarpenter is a master of horror movies end of the soundtracks to bring them to life\nThe original back in Nineteen Seventy eight and he is the composer on the twenty Eighteen sequel which is in theaters now John Carpenter welcome to want to thank you for having me you've been away from the Halloween movie franchise for some time now what made you decide to come back\nWhen his producer Hollywood producer Jason Blum a convince me to come back I knew that one was a a a sequel was going to be made as I Know a Malik the cod he's the the son of the man who put up the money for the original Halloween so I knew there was a sequel coming\nBut Jason bomb or talk to me and they said you know where it's going to be made with or without us so why don't we meaning he he and I\nUh get aboard and try to help it would be good so nobody had put it to me that way before so I thought that's a great great thing\nJason Blum spend doing some pretty interesting things with horror movies lately what what do you make of where the genre stance today\nAs in good shape but it's always in good shape our has been with cinnamon since the very beginning and I have a feeling\nA it will be with us until doomsday just because everybody's scared if something were all born afraid we all understand fear and so it's really fun to go to a horror movie with your girlfriend or your significant other and cuddle and scream and so forth\nWhat was it like for you not being in the directors chair for the twenty eighth team verse of Halloween you were involved in the film but what about watching someone else direct this movie\nIt was a relief because I don't have to suffer the stress and anxiety that director suffer and that's a worst profession in the world other than being a coal miner\nThe worst other than a cold I'll come on now well it could it could be worse I guess you could be a slaughterhouse tightened there's that you're right\nReally garbage what do you think movie fans least understand about what it takes to direct a movie especially a horror movie\nWell ever or did they at least understand let me think of a\nDirectors are responsible for all the central elements of a movie if it's supposed to be funny they're responsible for the humor of it if it's an adventure and so forth and so on so director of a horror movie think of it this way horror and comedy or a law like\n'cause it's turning it's all about timing and\nIt's all about when things happen and how they unfold and it's more complex than than people assume but uh people just think that horror as a lot of war and obvious violence and it's not\nYeah see I I I hear you on that it's an interesting analogy between horror and comedy I'm not big on ... or I Do not personally do well on blood and Gore at all but a good suspenseful movie like I can I can hang with that 'cause that's that's a satisfying experience what what do you think\nIt takes to make that kind of timing in a horror movie work\nWhat is it what does it take to make a horror movie work these are secrets that only the Brotherhood knows I Can't oh come on you can tell me something well look to make it really simple\n[noise] ah there are no rules for any horror film\nThe horror horror movies come out of the story and horror\nIs every action think of it that way not a genre necessarily what's your reaction to things\nAnd that if the story is is unfolding than you used the story telling\nTo a a a\nSet up your scares and set up things they're\nFrightening for the audience he said the word earlier suspense that's what's you if you get the audience in suspense and you could scare them\nSo maybe the key is having a story\nThere can be the scare is that it that is correct you got it what about the music you contributed music to this film and and the music to the original in Nineteen Seventy eight what does it take to make that kind of music work for a scary movie\nWhat does it take it takes a certain amount of talent and ability to play musical instruments and feeling for him\nThat's what it takes now were you always musically inclined when you put the original movie Halloween together Nineteen Nineteen Seventy eight or was it something that kind of came together unexpectedly\nNo I I grew up in a musical household my father was a music professor he was a [noise] a virtuoso violin player and he had taught to college\nLevel music courses at the university where I grew up I grew up with music in the house all the time classical music listening to it\nHe decided when I was about eight years old that I should learn to play the violin there was only one problem with that and I had no talent other than that it was a great idea\nBut I moved on from the violent to the piano and guitar and other things I picked a lotta stuff up\nWere there any particular influences that you draw on when you made the music for the original Halloween or that you drawn on over the years\nYes I'm all classical a\nMovie composers and classical musicians and rock and roll I'd get influenced everywhere\nWhat about the timing I did the theme to the original Halloween is not in a plain old for for your time it's in five four time it's an odd kind of time's signature was what drew you to that\nMy father taught me five four time uh when I was Thirteen he'd try on that I had a pair of bongos I got for Christmas I taught me five four on that and I thought it was unusual just straightforwardly unusual timing side\nAdapted that time's signature\nBut at least some of your favorites Halloween to thing Christine prince of darkness escape from New York\nAlso a musician and composer who wrote the soundtracks for many of his films including the sequel to Halloween which was released this month by the way since it is Halloween we were curious what are you wearing shorts your costume send us a tweet with a picture at\nOne a or tags vote one a show on

decide to direct and scores of music for your movies\nOr score directing and scoring was a a an act of desperation because I didn't in the beginning I didn't have enough money to afford to a higher composer or and or ... or somebody to play the music\nSo I knew I could do minimal job but at least get the job done and I was quick and I was fast so I hired myself", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year":
