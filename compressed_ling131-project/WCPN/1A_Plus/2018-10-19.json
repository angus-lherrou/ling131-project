I Wonder if this debate gives us any more insight into whether\nThey rather progressive Democrat like a war has a chance in a state like Texas shoes you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans business give us a sense of whether he moved in the little\nI mean broadly it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in the midterms typically you know not that many voters watch them sometimes undecided voters do but unless there's a major gas\nThey typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows the ... up by about seven points which\nOn election day of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think\nAnd under covered aspect of this racist the fact that Texas does straight ticket voting you can go and mark a box for Republicans\nAnd the strength of the Republican Party over all the strength of Governor Greg Greg Abbott for instance who's running you know against Ed Ed Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties um seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even if that are over ark\nHas been able to keep them to single digits\nI just wanna make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra\nFor all the Republicans on the ticket yet you can basically do forever Republican all at once and this is the last election that they'll be doing straight ticket voting after that it won't be as easy\nWill fundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're due this week to the federal election commission they were due on Monday and the results\nLook pretty good for Democrats and house races at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of Democrats are dominating fund raising in house seat races the challengers the Democratic challengers out raised Ninety two Republican incumbents more than six the Democratic candidates raised more than a million dollars that corner\nIn the Senate Democrats are also outrage and Republicans ... raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races also glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas\nKaren tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday to rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continue to be felt and seen\nThe weather channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatalities spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to find people who've been missing\nYeah there are still people missing there still people who are trying to pick up their lives um you know I think the town in Mexico beach has not reported given any numbers um of how many people are are missing a but there is talk of that it could likely be in the hundreds I mean this was a massive\nYou know had made landfall that would make it bigger than Katrina this has been a huge effort many people still do not thousands still don't have a phone service um and people are expecting asked film is sewn services restored and more roads are clear it and you're able to get more to people that they're expecting the death toll to continue to rise\nWhen Alexander the other big issues when people can actually start\nTo rebuild I mean it's it's fascinating and terrifying horrifying at the same time to look at some of the early drain camera pictures from where hurricane Michael came ashore from where it made landfall\nYou can almost tell which homes were built up to the latest building codes and which homes were not because of homes that were up to codes were there and the homes that weren't were gone and I wonder what points the the ... the rebuilding effort is right now is there any is there any expectation on when people could start to rebuild\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from progressive insurance offering a way to buy home insurance with their home quote explorer tool custom quotes and rates are available online learned more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive\nNow that's progressive and from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit\nComposed of financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement\nMore at alliance for lifetime income dot org\nBack now to the friday news roundup with Josh Rogers Alexandra Jaffe and frankly or don't is still a little bit more time to get in your questions and thoughts about this week's top stories from across the country one at a at W. A. M. U. dot org Josh Rogers let's talk New Hampshire for a little while there are two congressional races underway there are two districts in New Hampshire the race in district one\nWill be historic kind of no matter who wins because either the Democrat Chris Pappas would become the state's first openly gay member of Congress his Republican opponent Eddie Edwards would be the first black house member from New Hampshire tell us a bit more about the first congressional ...\nOr he departed from two thousand eight uh the GOP winning and midterm years Democrats winning in presidential years is now held by Carol Shea Porter fairly liberal Democrat who's retiring I'm In ... ad where do you have people who are running really within the mainstream of their parties are pappas has been serving in various\nElective offices for a long time he's in his late thirties he says family owns a very popular restaurant in Manchester often start for presidential candidates\nHe um he comes from Manchester which is a town that where the even the Democrats have historically been a little bit more conservative than in other parts of the state particularly on fiscal matters um\nEddie Edwards is somebody who has a background in law enforcement he was in the navy he at one time a lead the states uh enforcement division of its liquor commission in New Hampshire we have those big highway liquor stores a liquor is controlled by the state uh I was a fairly big job he a ram enforcement division and he's been a police chief [noise]\nUm you know they were pretty much keeping to well within the norms of their party Eddie Edwards has you know embrace Donald Trump have Rudy Giuliani up here campaigning with them [noise]\nUm and he's in some ways trying to cast Chris Pappas those you know part of some sort of resistance movement and saying we've obviously the nationally Chris Pappas as you know hardly a radical guy or you know family I'm Ron restaurant a you know worked I worked for Joe Lieberman when he ran for president um\nAnd uh this race though is one where the seat can do either way and ah both parties believe they have a shot\nAlso a gubernatorial race underway feared the Republican governor governor ... new new faces Democrat Molly Kelly she is one of the Fifteen women running for governor across the country which is an unprecedented number the latest fundraising numbers that came out this week showed that Kelly the Democrat has outraged\nOn yesterday to help a campaign for Kelly they met with employees of the Granite State candy shop and they discussed paid family leave if I'm interested in aware of this issue sits in terms of all the issues New Hampshire voters are considering but here as part of what happened with your ... brands listen\nIt's going to help families happier and healthier it can help people will be more productive at work and so\nIt's a win win everywhere I go in that state I hear about the need for paid family medical leave and how\nImportant it is for people to be able to have the choices in their life to be able to work hard where they're working but then to be able to spend time with the people they loved that most when they're needed them out\nThat was Molly Kelly you heard at the end senator Jill brand was at the beginning tell us a bit more about Mali Kelly is is this paid family leave issue a big one for her based on her political background her personal background will\nBeen a huge issue for her whether it is for voters is an interesting test me she's been running pretty much exclusively on this issue um it's a challenge of somebody covering their first how many stories one can write about paid family leave my understanding as Democrats\nHave polling suggests that Governor Sununu is vulnerable on this issue he was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it\nAt the last minute or for fear that a payroll deduction amounted to an income tax which you know it was a real kind of fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax\nUm the Democrats believe this is an issue that works for Raleigh Kelly by dint of her background at one point she was a single mother with three kids who work their way through college and that you know pursue new sort of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh\nYou know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get it\nSurpluses and tax collections are up but you know the wage growth for people to lower end of the scale\nIs not in great and this is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it's kind of hits a lot of boxes and may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race will\nUm ... you know Sunni should win or do we have to your terms here no governor's been talks after one term\nUh since two thousand four and prior to that it had been a century so it's pretty rare that a governor doesn't get a second term apps and being a disaster or a really tanking economy we don't have either of those\nUh here polling indicates new news about by about ten and you know you mentioned the fundraising numbers and Molly ... has outrageous person in three to one in the most recent reporting period he does enter the final stretch of this race with a cash advantage although for an incumbent\nWith a nationally known name he's a pretty bad fundraiser he will freely admit he doesn't like to do it so\nYou know he's only he's got four hundred thousand she's got two hundred thousand no interest groups will will add to that in terms of advertising but this is a race said Democrats feel they\nHave a chance to win if if a blue wave a venture weights and they think that Molly Kelly a bite in her background but it'd be a woman is somebody who perhaps his best engineered to kind of ride away speaking\nOf nationally known names Frank or don't use I Wonder what your senses of senator ... brand making this trip to help Mali Kelly is there is speculation about her future maybe in twenty twenty\nThere's a lot of speculation about her future and twenty twenty um I think how much is it kinda resonate as as the big question I mean obviously a there's so many names being kicked around uh right now or that you know it I think time will tell but there there's no question that killed rented one of the people that that people are talking about and certainly are watched\nWise to a and looking for it how it could mean and how it could uh what impact that could have on twenty twenty\nLots to discuss with business and the economy this week including the U.S deficit we don't hear much about it these days but it's back in the news because of the Treasury Department revealed this week but the deficit has grown\nLast year it was about six hundred sixty six billion dollars not a significant number there at all six hundred sixty six billion ... this week the Treasury Department revealed that the deficit has grown to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars it's a six year high end projection say it is on track by the end of this decade\nTo ... a trillion dollars the deficit a trillion dollars\nNo Alexander some experts are pointing to the Trump Administration for being responsible for this particularly\nThe tax bill part of the sales pitch for the tax bill for the tax cuts is it by cutting taxes business what kind of unleash more productivity the economy would boom like never before and the resulting largest would more than make up for whatever we lost in tax revenue how's that working out so far\n... well we haven't seen that yet certainly and in fairness Republicans are arguing that that's going to take 'em you know about a decade to even out though\nAt this rate although the economy is booming there's ... there's no way that it can make up for where our deficit is at at this point um it was sort of an open secret in Washington that the real plan that Republicans were kicking around was welfare reform\nUm to to cut down on the deficit and that conversation has started again on Capitol Hill\nI'm that obviously won't move forward until after the midterms but there is conversation about to get you know starting to work on a welfare reform bill that would cut some public benefits um like Medicare that kind of thing\nUm and so going forward you know it's interesting they care to see Republicans silence on this issue when they were previously the party of deficits but it's also an opportunity for them politically\nMitch McConnell blamed the rising deficit on public assistance programs in an interview with Bloomberg News on Tuesday what's going on with\nThat but it's very disturbing and it's it's driven by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend every

U. dot org\nLet's keep going with this investigation into the disappearance possible murder of ...\nCatherine wrote on our Facebook page ... denies Russia had anything to do with the poisoning of the former military officer and his daughter\nSaudi prince denies any involvement in murder of journalists who criticized him Trump goes along with both anyone else worried about the u._s. abandoning our moral authority\nSonia wrote on our Facebook page here's what I don't understand a Saudi national was grabbing the Saudi embassy in Istanbul it's been determined that show was murdered based on recordings hurt by no one but some Turkish government officials who want to remain anonymous\nTurkey has not released the recordings but there have been leaks of what's in them Turkey's government is not above repression and this kind of nefarious behavior themselves what exactly are we supposed to do as an uninvolved third party\nBefore I let you respond to that ... tweeted and uninterested third party hardly ... was a legal permanent us resident with children who are us citizens the usa isn't it\nMan was a resident he was not only that he was a columnist for a prominent American newspaper the Washington Post\nAnd let's be honest that a lot of the reason this has gotten so much attention in this country is because the post has rightly put a huge and hot spotlight on it and not let anyone forget about it and you know other newspapers in the United states in world media have picked up on it too and really kept the attention on it I was struck\nBy President Trump saying yesterday when he finally acknowledge that yes it appeared this man was murdered that he said this story has captured the world's imagination unfortunately and I thought unfortunately what's unfortunate about it it is the job of the media to demand accountability to seek truth\nAnd our values as America and as we've always been a global leader we try to put ourselves forward as the leader of the free world\nPart of that is about moral values and when we have a very close ally who by the way our military hardware is used in that Saudi campaign in Yemen that has killed so many thousands of civilians and children and is now leading to a huge famine in Yemen\nHow can we say that word uninvolved party um you know this is someone who was a resident of our soil and working for one of our companies\nAnd it's absolutely not true when you have an ally who is alleged to have done something like this we have certain forms of leverage that include arms sales and include potential sanctions right and many other things\nI Will say though I I'd dreams I Do kind of feel we're so you're coming from in a way because we've talked about this on this program before\nThe U.S in Saudi Arabia have had a long relationship but we've never tried to exert strong moral ethical pressure on Saudi Arabia I mean it's a very transactional relationship and so just because one is uninvolved doesn't mean that one is on entangled but I can\nIs a tremendous military and economic entanglements so I'm not really sure what the us has the power to do or if it has the moral authority to do it well\nThis is the limit ... Lee amplify that point Josh represents absolutely critical you know someone who's been actually a very good on this as Senator Marco Rubio who made the point of paraphrasing here\nThat all the money in the world and all the ... military contracts in the world would not be enough to buy back our credibility on human rights if we don't stand up against something as fundamental as murdering journalist for their opinions that's an international norm there's a lot of other norms that were broken here but that's like a critical one\nI mean the show is called ... for the first amendment with that is a in our DNA to stand up for a free press around the world and if we don't stand up strongly against that it'll be a very very damaging precedent and as a Senator Rubio said will never be able to buy our credibility back on these issues\nSenator Lindsey Graham made a very similar point he was so angry and he said I've been a huge ally as NBS in Saudi Arabia but I'm never going there again as long as he is in power he's outraged by it so this is a bipartisan issue\nThan have it is worth noting that the Washington Post this week it published\nWhat is believed to be ... final column it's called what the Arab world needs most is free expression it was published in English and in Arabic and he writes about the systemic the systematic dismantling of the free press in much of the Arab world here's one brief quote from that column quote\nThese actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence as a result Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate unquote Hayes what do you think is he right\nI think he is definitely right so\nUh this has been you know one of the longstanding ...\nIt's Fifteen individuals who flew in twelve of which are part of the ... the crown princes security detail or intelligence services I think we're going to get to the bottom of this now I also think there's going to be a fall guy that somewhere just below the crown prince there already are stories that they'd be there to offer up there and tell his intelligence chief\nGeneral Ahmed Asiri as the scapegoat so I I think we will know who did this and I you know I think probably the crown prince will try to ... you know offer up a a senior scapegoat\nBut I'm I'm pretty convince we're going to figure out what happened here\nWhat we will keep an eye on this story we're glad to get some more of your comments on this for now let's move on to some of the other big stories that make news this weekend may have flown under your radar because of all the attention about ... G rightly given the course\nBut there's also an update from Afghanistan where the war continues to rage Seventeen years after it began with no clear end in sight yesterday the Taliban killed at leading police chief in Kandahar\nThe commander of us and NATO troops in Afghanistan General Austin Scott Miller escaped unharmed today the Afghan government announced it's delaying elections in that province they were supposed to take place tomorrow those elections will carry on as planned in the rest of Afghanistan despite widespread violence the Taliban have already killed at least\nTen candidates and scores of voters in the ... give us some sense of how the Taliban's efforts might affect the outcome of this election voter turnout the reliability of of the results what's the the kind of upshot of\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from ... am committed to changing lives through math by building math achievement problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students every day and nine hundred franchise locations matinees him dot com slash NPR\nFrom love me in makers of go to meeting the collaboration meeting platform that comes equipped with features to help people stay focused to get work done and learn more it goes to meeting dot com\nAnd from the listeners who support this end\nCongress in the ... of the Boston Globe and the Pulitzer center and have brown of buzzfeed do still a little more time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about this week's top stories from around the world one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThis week some Americans were probably green with envy and our neighbors to the north\nRight out guy now\nAnd I got out\nThey were celebrating in Montreal this week because on Wednesday Canada legalized recreational marijuana\nIt's only the second country in the world to do so why was the first in twenty Thirteen Andrew tweeted Canada legalizing we'd was like California legalizing we'd both for like a long relationship where you've been dating forever but just now made it official\nHays how big a deal is this and do you think this is the start of a Global Trends something that has just kind of been understood for a long time and just hasn't been made official yet\n[noise] you know that's a great question because I'm not really sure I mean I think that\nWhen you look at the way that the criminalizing drugs has gone in places like Portugal\nThat at least if you compare that to things like the un officer drugs and crime still is very hard on marijuana and claims that it you know marijuana is this evil so it's really tough to tell where the global feeling is on we legalization\nIf um you weren't you bring it up say at a meeting in the European Union's\nOf European Parliament than I'm guessing you still would not have been nearly a majority of people in favor it even in a place like the USO Canada I don't know it really depends on how it goes in terms of the government controlling the access to marijuana which it it is doing now compared to you know being a private business\nUh that private but illegal business among many\nAnd you know I'm sure that Ken is going to be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether caused the surge and traffic accidents where their claws asserted tops realization or medical affects so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada\nYeah the CBC out of Ottawa has a story about how police there are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers aren't driving stone it is of course worth noting\nThat in this country marijuana is considered the most illegal level of illegal drugs they schedule one narcotic it's right up there\nWith heroin LSD ecstasy ... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have new currently accepted medical use\nAnd the high potential for abuse\nThere was a conference call this week with Todd ... who was an official with US Customs and border patrol here's how he answered one question from a reporter\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our ground be found in the midst of all and to the United states so yes that's possible\nThat's taught or one of US Customs and border patrol Indira give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing this NAFTA to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was this updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of and then sort of pulled the TPP things packed them on to NAFTA and set it snapped a to point no but it hasn't been easy there have been so many strains between the United states and Canada\nAnd you know this people are saying that essentially this\nHave legalized marijuana across the United states it's only on a state by state basis I Wonder also James what other kind of unintended consequences there might be for this I mean\nJustin Trudeau now has to kind of owned is whether it's seen as a good move\nOr a negative moved there remains the question as to what legalization at a national level mind me for Canada on top of that there are early reports that suggested supplies are running low because candidates takes time to cultivate the point of being syllable and there are long lines around the block and things are running out supplies running out\nI Wonder what kinds of additional unintended consequences we might keep an eye out for\nWell you know the Canadian Medical Association journal called this a an uncontrolled experiment so we're going to we're going to find out a lot of things about this but I must admit that I'm not\nThat surprised when you can walk into the major states the United states like Colorado or California and there's dispensaries for recreational marijuana everywhere I I think this is a trend that's happening\nAll over the United states and it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna keep going because people are going to realize that there's a lot of money to be made when you tax marijuana\nA and they use has happened in any way and putting these people in jail is probably not the best use of public funds so I I see is part of the continuum I think it was kind of inevitable that are progressive neighbors to the north for probably going to get a jump on this on this\nBut um you know I I just been struck by going around the country and see in states where this is already happening and everyone kind of shrugs it's not a big deal\nYeah this doesn't seem James to have the kind of energy I mean it's not like the fight of love against prohibition you know where it was considered this major like\nIts issue about liberty and of course it helped spur of the rise of organized crime if you've never seen the Ken burns documentary what are you waiting for go see it this feels very much like something that was just kind of a matter of time like if they legalize it was going to happen sooner or later\nThat's my sense to you out of this is the trend is pretty clear in this country and and Canada Cain has had medical marijuana\nMhm yeah and not one of the loudest most aggressive social movements with regards to the legalization of cannabis a much more impactful movement that has reverberated around the world is the me too movement and we should talk about that before our time is up this week MJ Akbar who's the minister of state for external affairs in India\nLeft that post after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual assault\nAnd harassment also in India this week there were protests and violence meant by that but any woman trying to enter the ... temple in ... state in India groups of conservative Hindu men threw stones and attacked women and journalist who tried to get too close let's start\nWith this story involving ... Akbar Hays how have we seen the me too movement play out\nIn India or is this just kind of the beginning of its effect on men in power\nI think so it's it's interesting because the me too movement really kicked off here in the United states a year ago and for a while or I Know that our reporters at least we're watching Indian waiting and wondering when is it going to affect this culture where\nUh we were so sure that it would finally have an impact and now a in recent weeks at has finally like grab the country and shaking it\nUh we Steve is all started with one actress a one Bollywood actress coming forward and just it's been a tidal wave of accusations sense than women taking to Twitter and being unafraid to name their alleged abuse abusers and us altered by name\nAnd just being really willing to step out and do what the Indian courts haven't done before which is\nTry to bring these men into account and um it's it's\nReally interesting that ... one of the first to go considering um he had such a long run in the Indian journalism scene and\nCredence to these allegations and we'll see whether in the future they are the the women who are I guess lower down on into full status will finally start to be believed as well with regards to the protests of the ... temple in Carol estate the BBC's dreams Clinton was they're\nAsking people why they were protesting here's what one man said\nNo no no no no I wouldn't want to know the media and it turns out to making this they don't really want to do the story goes up under the religion that's the only thing these\nSome of what the BBC streams Clinton was told in carelessly outside the ... temple there in there I Wonder what your sense is of this protest particularly what the gentleman said it made it sound as if there's this external pressure from the media and politician he wants to destroy our culture they want to destroy our religion he says\nObviously that's not true let's I mean it's the most obvious part of that is that ... Modi who is the prime minister of India is from a fairly far right Hindu nationalist party so he's clearly not trying to destroy the culture and the religion", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "19"}
