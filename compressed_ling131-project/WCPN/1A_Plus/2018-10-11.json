of my caissons identity he also hosts the podcast pod saved the people he ran unsuccessfully to be the mayor of Baltimore and his new book is called on the other side of freedom the case for hope during the cast and welcome to winning\nIt's so good to be here tell us about the book's title on the other side of freedom what's the title about what are you trying to stay there\nYeah you know I used to travel much more around the country talking to young people talking to to older people and what I realized that we have a deep understanding of decided freedom so we know and they found a freedom a third of other people killed by strangers killed by police officer we know that we're as more people for marijuana in all ...\nBut did it look like what does it feel like how do we get there with the strategy and the plane because I Know that when I think about what freedom is that its course not only the absence of oppression but the presence of justice enjoyed it we can get rid of all the bad things and that doesn't mean that the good things automatically come into the air we have to fight for those\nSo that was where the other side of freedom came from it in the case for hope is that I think the hope is this your for all of this hope is that belief that are tomorrow's can be better than that today's and when people say\nThe system is broken and in in response and people say oh no it was designed to be like this my takeaway is that it was designed in because people made it up we can make something better and that is the work of hope\nThere are a lot of questions that our listeners wanted to put to you about the work that you're doing about the black lives matter movement and so on I definitely want to ask you about today's political scene but before we dive into\nAll of that I'm just kind of curious to know how you are [laughter] you've been a very busy due to the last four years how are you how is life treating you\nYou know I'm OK it's a ... I I Do a lot of interviews and nobody ever asked me that so I appreciate that [laughter] I'm good I think that like I'm a I'm a happy about being around the people I knew before the protests and people that I Know really well I got to see my sister the other day and she's grade and her two kids so\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from bona with the bonus certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractors committed to expertise in customer service contract to locate her and more information or at Boehner dot com\nAnd from ... committed to changing lives through math by building math achievement problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students every day in nine hundred franchise locations matinees him dot com slash NPR\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson we are speaking to dream of catching the host of the podcast pod saved the people and the author of the new book on the other side of freedom the case for hope\nOne by graphical thing I did want to ask you briefly you right in the book that teaching was the most important thing you ever did how did teaching helped lay the groundwork for activists\nTwenty one now which is so wild uh\nYou know teaching was incredible not only because it was urging everyday like everything when they had to show up as I taught sixth grade math every single there to show up in our math to my students I had to be as prepared and I taught sixty nine hundred and twenty minute classes which has a whole lot of math or anybody who's ever or an eleven year old\nUh what I learned there were a couple of things one was like how to take really complex information and break it down into\nPieces that are can be consumed and could be repeated back so much skill was like what I deliver was not only how to like get kids to understand like when the crazy ones but like I did teach discreet skills like you know what you didn't touch it sometimes means multiplication right but like\nJust how to take apart these big things to make them bite size and then have students to be able to play with them in a way that they could put them back and rearrange on their on their own or the second was like really understanding what it means to\nLike do work that will have an immediate impact but we'll have a long term impacts so I remember I'll never forget teaching negative numbers they struggled like they can get it like anything lower than zero that like I don't get it by the end they can fight anybody around like how to solve the most complicated equation and they like deeply understood it\nAnd that was like understanding the arc of how to build capacity and like I learned that the third thing is I think the best teachers with the ... just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got there\nAnd that like I work is to help\nStudents understand that they can access the gift long after I'm gone after the teacher's gone with the worse teachers do is walk in the classrooms and make people believe that the gift only exists in their presidents and like that is I think in such a corollary to organizing that when I travel anywhere where I'm In my own community\nThat like what I'm trying to do is help people find the gifts that they have because they already have them they might not know them and I believe they might not know how to use them and that's what I can do is help them find them and then use them long after we're gone let's let's\nLeader so how does he you direct\nTV with his role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people know the names of the three black women who actually started ... I think Morgan's referring to Patrice floors ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nSo we didn't get the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that\nAh you know for those of us who were industry in Ferguson we're mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protest there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organized everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nUh it was organic they were set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we were the she for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend which is unfortunate that there's this narrative that if that has come up that as a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized everybody the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true so when I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nThat I'm mindful that I was one of many people in the book a highly\nSo many people who were industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom without you wouldn't there would be no protest\nOr so that is important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that uh one of the important things about having the platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth\nSo you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people have just sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names and in the book I Try and write about those people to you that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together but this narrative to death\nList for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certainly leaders have become more prominent\nWith the concern about but who profits off to cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast as a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nYes it's interesting I think I'm always shy you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the the way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the ... a portion of all the pre order sales went to the end of the pie legal Defense Fund that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book raised to like that's I think about the book specifically\nBut in general the space like I'm mindful of ... when we started camping zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Fifteen\nA we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of race for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nSo over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is not a lot of money and the grand scheme of non profit and we did it so that\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we that was important right so we created the first public database of police union contracts at first it public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really discreet projects\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not pay you know I'm a salary from this stuff so we try to do it as like with just the bare necessities is so that it's not just a question of like\nI'm inclined to be a part of it they get paid as a part of the broadcast because I think that that makes sense um and it's not like some huge money maker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to\nRely on a nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well ah and you know it's like I ... the way that I exist in the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I don't have you know it's like a now they are not and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like he was a really rough um it was rough\n... only it's only a couple of months ago the first time that I met she lived alone since the protests I've ever since you've been saying in the basement of a like my second parents after the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not us you know who wants to get married in the in the basement of their second parents that's an interesting it was a\n... but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the book right now right that like there are these narratives of like oh I made it gives you ... dollars and ... and it's like well no you like the me on the news you hear him in a pod cast you like see me out of an event that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case of that I've had high incomes before you know that that there was any income and wealth is pretty significant though I'm so people have been like really confused by that\nLet's talk a little more about policing one of the members of the one eight text club writes police hold a significant position of power in the legal system they should be held to a higher standard than those without power but instead they are held to a lower standard and given special treatment and a free pass in our courts and society\nContrast that with another Tex ... who wrote as time goes on society\nWhat do you think he I think you know I think for ...\nFor two thousand years we slit people's arresting call their health care we literally drained people's ... down and we were like where it's going to drain out all the impurities and people were like oh ... their blood pressure they change it's like no they didn't have any blood right that actually isn't a solution but we did it for two thousand years it was one of the most popular medical procedures\nBut it didn't work so if the goal was it the people's lives and it's like actually wasn't a good thing or if the goal was to like pretend that you were doing good and like this was excellent and I think about policing it's like if the goal is to stop crime or like to do any of that work like it just isn't whether how no matter how you feel about the police that just isn't happening so\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from progressive insurance offering

some of the more personal aspects of your life that you describe in the book there's a short section in the book it's like a page and a half\nWere you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she left\nA leader in the chapter you write code I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we remembered joy and trials\nWhen we remember pain we are trying to protect ourselves and cope we're trying to order the memories in ways that will allow us to make it to tomorrow and the day after tomorrow unquote talk about how those kinds of traumatic or difficulties\nYou know it's interesting ah this is the first time saying this because it just happened is that my mother read the book um and she texted me recently and it was I hate to re read the book we should talk\nAnd I just have it I like having them with the right back at so hopefully I write back to\nIs one of the reasons why I wrote this chapter in the chapters I can remember and now with us that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name him one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave than it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within and grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize has had like\nWe're all walking into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nA core part of it uh the the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr or any other aspect of their dignity they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew would pass one would not ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside or you know a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraints somebody that can strengths becomes so great and the way that we've learned how to survive\nThat we can start to imagine things beyond it and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd like you didn't see in the right in the left is at the right has always re packaging old narratives for new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe it you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling those stories\nDo you live and how you entered the world\nYou also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times at a rather young age\nAnd you connect that with what you call the quiet quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never hidden any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love\nThe parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons are the important for me to be out very very um [noise] I mean amount for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very\nSort of overt way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gate to think that the only way to do this where it publicly with to to be in the closet and ah you know that tried to start or from the street that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it wasn't real right like I was in the quiet and the closet\nAnd uh you know I I Walk into every room as a black man I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collected within social justice or the work that we need to do\nWithout talking about a mile an identity that I wrote about the uh the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know\nUm but it was like sort of\nIt with freeing in some ways to finally just stay and like not have to tiptoe around it and not be ashamed to say that this happened in and it was real and it was awful and you know when I told when I when I finally told a couple of years later and they ...\nYou know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives and like that was important [noise]\nUm but I've had to like you know I write about in the book because I like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were periods and we both had the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right as I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlets actually goes I mean I I'm ... I've been out from most of my own air career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian or gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people are OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things\nAnd that changes the conception do you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know\nLet's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my that even they have to be\nYeah you know like\n... I think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave them like it is not one way right that there is not to waste to be gate and like\nThat's why the pride parade of really really all that like yeah so like sometimes it is the way rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is me just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid ways to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there are definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not getting enough in like that I don't talk about gay issues publicly as possible and like he was one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life do I leave it to them like other people can feel like it's real re so like I Know\nCare about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of their results but that ah that they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns\nAnd they're nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cause and a friend like that they actually are nervous about like what privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I have I don't feel like I Need to talk about the every two seconds for people to be like they were actually cares about being gay right so the other thing I'll say that there's some people who I can really homophobic but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your ...\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bed for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quote\nThere were calls from within the protest community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling me a sellout unquote I Wonder how you are finding your way forward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so any way you are part of a media so to speak\nAnd reconciling that was kind of the social justice activism work that you're still ... involved in is that challenging to kind of have a foot in both worlds as it were\nNo it's like a both and drape that like you know what's interesting is that all those people who who come in for for quote participating in the system those are the same people running for office today right those are the same people who like\nI tell them everybody to vote who tell people not devoting twenty sixteen who said that you're wasting your vote who said that politics to matter and like why would you support I remember I support Hillary in Washington Post that people literally would like you're wasting your employment I Can't believe you did that\nLike president doesn't have any bearing this is just for show and it's like\nNobody is saying that now like that is that ... that was a while\nThe chaos that this president continues to to put in the face and you think about even there are a lot of really really public people and movements aides who literally just would not say anything about Hillary that wasn't she was a monster and like you don't have to agree with all the Hillary stuff to know that like she was a better choice in this guy so is it that was sort of interesting\nIt takes a lot to make a TV show succeed sometimes you need crazy new ideas and sometimes going old school makes the difference between some of the people who make it work [noise]\nFrom W.

disclosure at the very top of this that ordinarily in an interview like this the hostess is supposed to have distance and and not much of an opinion maybe about what they're covering I I just want to disclose that I'm a fan I mean it's not fail hearing\nYou have got a hit on your hands Raphael season five on Netflix\nBut I've always wondered sort of what constitutes a hit now in the world of subscription TV I I I don't\nI mean the I I I've seen her show described as a smash hit a sleeper hit a cult hit\nA flop and nobody's watching it everybody's watching it I have no idea I'm all I Know some people seem to like it uh and that works for me and and we keep being allowed to make more so that's that's good for me too\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Boehner with the bone

talking with rap feel by Blacksburg he's the show runner of Netflix bow jak horsemen it just released its entire season for streaming and I've watched just about all of that fifth season a rough it let's talk about season five\nRight let's get into it getting dirty a big amount of season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner himself it there's a light on actually something along the lines of television as a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit and yeah I have\nTo say a when that line came up at the table read it got much bigger laugh when I was expecting from the crowd of people over there\nI mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner unimpressed to her about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be unimpressed or talking about a ... a little bit\nIt's it's strange and you know one of the things we wanted to talk about we're putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the\nTourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so um\nAnd it it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius who you know touches a show and turned it into gold and it all just you know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain um ... it's a very collaborative process and we have people\nMaking it better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast brings so much the designs by at least they had all the uh directors brings so much to the episodes of the story board animators the editors um it it it really it takes a village um so it's odd\nGets made at all and I think anyone who presents that as how a TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word play the slapstick puns and the ... falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that runs throughout the season and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes\nFor him it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers who we can't help but make it funny\nUm but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions we take it very seriously um you know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and those guys are talking octopus\nOr you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here uh but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals [laughter] um so the story is quite serious ah but the stories themselves can be quite silly you know one way I think of it\nIs is we're telling stories about real grounded characters in the crazy cartoon universe\nLots of animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adult as Beau jak or who to whom do you think you owe your origins in television ... who do you use your former [laughter]\nUm oh you mean by influencing yeah or do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show and [laughter]\nNo I mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them the shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American ... well\nI think you know obviously the the the giants as The Simpsons and I will be disingenuous for me to\nI got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of the Simpson um but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist outside of the the bubble um\nOr the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I I said ah we're going to ... when we start season one you're gonna watch it and the first is going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park but then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening is going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men\nUm and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really take things seriously a in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak any today are credible artist Carolyn that's sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat\nAh and I met a lot of others to even have that Keith Olbermann in there at some yeah I'm ... is one of the first people we cast [laughter]\nAnd he was cast her whale\nAs a newscaster well uh we we had in the script to um you know a a a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Linda ... is that I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role really and we called them like yeah sounds like fun um and he's fantastic we keep bringing back season after season\nAnd you know what am I a first memories of making a show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had them do all his lines um and then at the end we said we also get you making some whale noises and you know this is Keith Olbermann who I thought it was a very serious man\nWell one of your other main characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison Aubrey who is phenomenal now you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Allison Aubrey is Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American this in the show now this season that's changed Diane does take a trip to the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her\nUm how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it\nWell um we cast Alison ah in in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast or we'd been working a with a different actress um who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because\nAnother show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issues so she couldn't be lead on our show any more um and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing uh and she's going to a a great job ever since\nUm but more and more uh as I was looking around at at the cast and and thinking about\nYou know how how the show was put together and and the makeup of the cast it started to dawn on me that\nEveryone in our castles whites and our main cast and a lot of the recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this wasn't an intentional thing uh that I was doing as\nA racist man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were casting these characters one at a time\nUh and I realized that oh this is my I Need to start paying better attention to 'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices or tried to have more people of color on the show but when it comes to Dianne specifically um you know I think there is uh\nFirst started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do differently as casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character\nAnd you know as I said in these other interviews um I think it's hurt the show because I think my own self consciousness has prevented us from telling Asian Stories I think because I guess I didn't want people to talk about this it's not like this is a mistake we made\nAnd if I can just you know avoid it or you know glide passed it then you know maybe this won't become an issue where this won't become the thing that I end up talking about in every interview and I I think that was a disservice to the character um because I I think it ended up\nYou know we we ended up treating her as just like a white character or as a race didn't matter\nAnd it's it's difficult in our show because in some ways race doesn't matter because there was also talking ... you know anti ... and giraffes walking around so it's hard to say how is an Asian American humans experience that different from a white American humans experience but\nI I think there are differences and I I'm more interested in exploring them now and I feel like the uh avoidance of the issue\nWas holding us back narrative way well instead of avoiding it then you took responsibility for it on your own initiative and and as I said in season five\nDiane confronts those issues directly for herself makes a trip to Vietnam and narrates an entire episode about the experience for her um I also mentioned ... voice of princes Carolyn she's my she's my favorite character I just love the way\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from farmers insurance committed to helping people understand the ins

do without\nJoining us from NPR in New York is the owner of NYC cue cards while the fairest and he's worked three decades behind the scenes on shows including Saturday Night live while the fairest and welcome to one a\nAh thanks for having me Joshua thanks for it's great to be here how did you get into the cue cards business a while you know I went to uh Syracuse and I wanted to be a writer I majored in writing and moved to New York in a you know my brother was working at CERN it a lot of time as a receptionist\nAnd they knew that you kind of guy so he recommended me even though my printing was terrible and ah ah I got the job and I did I did it just get my foot in the door and to make riding connections\nAnd uh you know I did I did make somebody connections and I wrote for some cable shows but it was never enough to support myself so I kept under the cue cards and I got really good at doing cue cards very quickly\nAnd uh you know cut to twenty eight twenty nine years later I own my own company I've been doing it for that long and running a lotta shows\nSo clearly this was not the kind of writing that you had in mind but what was it about doing the cue cards that you liked\nYou know I don't know I think one specially on Saturday Night live\nThe live aspect of it and being out there\nYou know as close to the cameras as you can be without being on camera a and helping the actors and helping the guest stars or through the shows and through this hard show that that you know they'd probably a lot of them have never done live de before there was something very rewarding about that and\nUm I didn't crack under pressure and with the changes and all the stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show noticed and uh you know everyone was a pretty quickly in the ranks\nTell us a bit about your company\nOur Saturday Night live um the Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon late night with Seth Meyers and then we do Conan on the west coast as well those are four main shows um and then we will do some reality shows we do a master we do all the Project Runway as they shoot\nAnd then we do to show any show that comes to that town that he's ... guards you know work on that as well\nWhat kinds of people do well at this line of for\nThe first thing we look for is neat printing\nNow my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was on a med school ... years ago people were like yep we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of printing the cue cards I've seen her all written in\nAll caps yes correct It's you know it's it's a this is it's a it's block lettering it's all caps um it's it's really about the spacing between ... between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the spacing between the sentences\nIt's not something like I Can't just bring somebody off the street and say okay start doing your guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train it for like two or three weeks\nI'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn\nUm two or three weeks of training yeah it it 'cause you 'cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you can't just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just him if he's been okay these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these\nNew things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalized only in certain words it's not capitalized than during whereas where how to end the card of courage to stand on a period or ... or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to end it so that it flows the next car just so many different rules where you can only learn it by by doing it and practicing it\nSpeaking to Wally ... and the founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York okay so let's say you're working for me for you know\nI'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship tell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out\nHow to be a good cue card vendor for me All right first thing I ask you how's your eyesight like near sighted or glasses okay so you were a glass as well your glasses on the show where you are contacts or you know we're either I don't really like contacts hourglasses okay so your your glasses so you can see find I won't have to if you didn't wear glasses and you wanna wear contacts\nI could put your letters bigger so that you can see but that would also make less words in the card\nAnd it would make it harder for you to ... to flow to the ... like if you're taught especially if you're telling jokes\nSo I Would recommend glasses and contacts for you if you know if you want to say you got to wear your glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we would we would have versus where I Would practice with you if you've never read cue cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you\nOr look directly at the cue cards don't look away\nBecause it'll it'll look like you're reading the cue cards how do you mean a little bit directly as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your band leader\nAnd I had cue cards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that you would want to play to those two cards now if you are looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the card in the bed later the audience would be like oh he's obviously reading something\nBut if you just played those cue cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the camera so yeah so I'll I we open depending on where you are in position to the camera\nI'll make the cards the right the lettering the right side so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nYour cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction the the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper that's it\nSketches and I'll be out there with one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put the cars and I work with the director of the stage managers wild well kind of confirmed I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they need an extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical work week at SNL looked like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously unfilled eleven thirty five PM\nI Wish it were that a simple [laughter] now we we start on Thursday we start rehearsals on Thursday and Thursdays a light day\nSo the music the musical group ... for the first half the day and then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only put one one set of each sketch because I have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more and it\nIt'll change from Thursday sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely rewritten from Thursday and friday\nAnd then friday is the same process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process reprint put that on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it ... the cards so it makes sense and then we I mean the redo that we don't have the without the luxury of waiting until Saturday to dupe the friday sketches because senators show day\nSo everything's print that I have about eight people there on friday just yeah basically writing all day I have the fine job I'm Out on the set blocking working with the actress having fun they're sitting underneath the bleachers from eleven o'clock to sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nWhat kind of person would want to take that kind of a job it doesn't sound like a very glamorous way to be near the TV business are you a lawyer you mostly employing people who are looking for a foot in the door or ...\nI encourage that I I Try to tell them cue cards is not a career I I did make it a career for myself\nBut there's not much room if you want to do at great for your lives that's awesome but you should be looking to do something else I'm encouraging them I'm helping them I'm introduced and the people that want the\nThan in a career that they want to do most of the most of it's entertainment related but yeah you sit those long days or friday but that leaves the Saturday where ever heard that they may come out from behind the scenes and there are her say with me 'cause I Can't\nI Can't hold for sketches at one time you know four sets of cars at one time so I Need other people out there and then that's kind of the fun part of it\nHow close up to Showtime safe for Saturday Night live how close are you writing after Showtime\nWe don't stop making changes usually until ... sometimes twelve thirty at night or for your night while the show's going on\nSo you could still be writing while you're alive\nOr we are we definitely are\nUm we get most of the changes done and and then the the problem that happens is that the show starts running late and there's maybe two sketches that lord would like to get in", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "11"}
