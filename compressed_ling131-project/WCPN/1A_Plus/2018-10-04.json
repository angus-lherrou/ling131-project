whether it confirmed him\nIs expected to happen Saturday joining me to discuss the report and its potential fallout is NPR Justice Department reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan welcome thank you so we have this report or will the Senate has the report now or do we the people had any idea what is actually contained within the four corners\nWell we don't have any sort of specific snow and this is certainly something that is confidential and not a something that is generally released to the public and there are no plans at this point according to the Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley for any of this to be made public\nA despite clearly a fair amount of interest among Democrats to make this public and certainly I think among the Trump a chunk of the American public to to learn what's in there of what we do know is that publicly at least\nA six people have confirmed that they spoke to the FBI many of them are people who are friends of a judge Kavanaugh's during high school that would be mark judge PJ Smith Tim ... and Chris Garrett\nOr as well as one friend of a forwards that Leland Kaiser who all confirmed that they spoke to the FBI and then there's a second woman who made allegations of sexual misconduct against cabin on that's Deborah Ramirez and we know that she also spoke to the FBI now a NPR has learned um that\nUh nine people according to a to a an official nine people spoke with the the FBI in total um but again a lot of this is one that you know we don't know what all the FBI was told in this uh\nThere is nothing in there that the committee and the public at this point didn't already know so where\nIs the report right now physically I mean how our senators looking at it because it's extremely sensitive every reporter in Washington wants to get a look at it in and every political operative does too\nWell or the process for this is governed by a memorandum of understanding that uh dates back round a decade or but what generally happens is when the White House gets this background information on a judicial nominees nominee that will send it over to a Senate Judiciary committee us generally held in the Judiciary Committee safe\nToday it's being held in a secure location in the capital and which senators can come down and look at it there are dismayed is basically working and shift right now we're Democrats were getting our um to take a look at it and then Republicans and there are small handful of a staffers who have clearance to see this as as well but basically\nPeople are members are coming in getting a a look at the report they can get briefed on it but this is all happening within basically the bowels of the of the capital right now\nNow I'm Christine Blasey Ford's lawyer say she has not been interviewed by the FBI and this

the list of goals and ambitions these countries lay down in their second annual summit joining me now to talk about the\nOlympics the world cup one of the most exciting emerging markets in the world to Brazil was once heralded as Latin America's crown jewel\nBut then it was hit with a one two punch of a massive corruption scandal and a stunning economic collapse now unemployment in Brazil is at Thirteen percent the country has sixty thousand homicides per year on average and its current president boasts of an approval rating\nOf just three percent all of that is backdrop to Brazil upcoming presidential elections far right populist ... he's facing off against the leftist his rival Fernando had died on Sunday and the lead up to the election has already been packed with drama including both in our owes near fatal stabbing last month\nAnd we're here to talk about what the election means for Brazil and how what happens in Brazil will reverberate across both America's\nMonica to bowl is he or she is senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nShe's also director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins university\nAnd she she's here with me in the studio Monica thanks for being here thank you for having me uh Brian winter is editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the counsel of the Americas he joined us over Skype from Sao paulo in Brazil Brian thanks for being here\nOh Todd happy to be with you good to talk to you and ...\nYou for being here pleasure to be a well Brian you're the one in Sao paolo so let me give you honors here to start a let's start with the nitty gritty who is ... and our most Americans might not be familiar with him\nA ... a retired army captain who has been in Congress for nearly three decades now\nUm but despite having sat in Congress ... first so much time and he he shows ... open loading for\nAh for the legislative body I mean he has said over the years numerous times that the Congress is dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture of his political or of leftists and\nAnd other political opponents 'em and you know that message for a long time was was regarded as marginalized here I mean he was not a popular figure\nBut in the last couple of years because of this historic economic crisis that you mentioned Todd\nThose messages um are resonating a lot more with people when they did in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday and he has a ten point lead and all over his nearest rival it looks like there will be a runoff vote which would be on October twenty eighth\nAnd that one is that one's a close call right now between him and and the guy he's likely to face with this Fernando had died\nBut it's it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty ten to twenty Fifteen and this seemed like\nJust such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of last military rule from Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen eighty five but being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our all even if it does mean a return to you know the more authority\nA little bit of will will get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to a Monica what about Fernando ... or in in contrast he's not as\nFiery ... has been described by some as Trump being or maybe more akin to ... in the Philippines likes to have guns around the the drug dealers should be shot or threatens to summer summarily execute them what about his opponent for for of Fernando ... what do we know about him\nSo what we know about him um is that he's not a ... organic member of the Workers Party the P. T. um he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the ... the far left so\nHe's not he's a moderate um but the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently is very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty three I'm twenty ten when the party really did take this sort of center left stamped so the party itself now is very much hard left um the candidate though is that\nUm that being said the the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist both so narrow\nUm is this anti PT vote so these elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to see as president but about who voters do not see a friend that\nWe're going to talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we're going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to the idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking pills\nElection Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do come out to the polls what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to just sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think there are more weary than a decisive in terms of going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally uh eighty percent of the vote or show up\nOr we may have less of a proportion this time\nOr one important feature here is how many voters will spoil their their vote\nWill leave it blank will cancel do vote because that is important whoever gets a fifty percent of the valid votes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday\nOr we both are not when they more like the according to the late ... that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood people are angry people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil a regardless if they are the less from the left from the writer from the center people feel absolutely fed up with politics with politicians\nAnd that there is no alternative because there is not going to be admitted very cool in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics\nNow Brian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm both an hour oh has a history of violent rhetoric he's been photographed waving machine guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or or drug dealers or thieves\nBeing shot but there's been some actual violence in this campaign last month ... was\nStanding among voters in Brazil in a way I mean\nIf it was adding all of us were paying to see a political violence at that level and I was personally awful for for both so narrow he he almost died by his own account and and those are the doctors that\nTreated him politically I think it's fair to say that it was helpful um because the plan\nBy the more centrist candidates in this race was to spend these last couple of weeks attacking both so narrow as much as possible and on TV ads and elsewhere and and because of this attack against him and because of the resulting\nPublic sympathy\nThey really had to tone down or in some cases eliminate totally their attacks it's also allowed ... to stay fairly quiet and not articulate his plans what he would do if he gets elected as much as he otherwise would have had to I mean he he there is a huge\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized

we're talking about the political climate in Brazil heading up to this weekend's presidential election what's happening in Brazil might seem familiar to Americans in the wake of the twenty sixteen us presidential elections\nMy guests are Monica to both senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics Brian winter is the editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at\nThe American society and the council either ... of the Americas and Paolo ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center and you had been sending us your messages won a listeners drew emails I was in northwest Brazil last month\nSo they will go for anything that isn't part of the Workers Party\nNow Monica before the break you were telling us about car wash the actual car wash and abroad offensive corruption scandal or is it over ... have have all of the [noise] I don't want to mix metaphors but I'm older will have all the cars been overturned it opened up and cleaned out in a car wash\nWell it is winding down um so the bulk of it has already has already occurred well let me go back in time just a little bit because it is important to put into context you think's\nThe most important um findings of love as you had to or of car wash worrying twenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen\nAnd at that time I'm president Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party was Brazil's leader she had been reelected in twenty fourteen into was president at the time\nUm she was impeached in twenty sixteen\nAnd part of the reason for her impeachment there are many moving parts here but one of the moving parts was the fact that a she had lost control of hook of her coalition\nAnd her her coalition had um a number of other political parties that war implicated in the car wash findings in the car wash probing the plea bargains 'em and everything else that started to come out publicly in terms of this particular investigation\nShe was she ... she never did anything to actually stop the investigation which was really a positive thing um but that was one of the things that actually lead to her downfall because\nThe the impeachment that she suffered was really very much politically motivated by the need that some of these political parties in her coalition had to try to at least slow love my job to if not stop it altogether and\nWho still defend the workers' party instill defended the tea they go back to the impeachment of or is that as one major argument for why you know things that the Workers Party has been let's say unfairly treated and the way that the that that things have gone down\n[noise] Matt writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called his home country\nThe greatest country that never was meaning that Brazil has had such riches in terms of natural resources but it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor with the United states uh Paolo Matt makes a good point Brazil was celebrated\nAs the rising star not only of Latin America of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned it at the top\nAre now horrible recession horrible corruption what happened in Brazil where was the Brazil that that hosted the Olympics in was and was on the way up\nWell I think Brazil believe too much in its magic that it's a country protests and can be great and forgot to do the necessary things you do in order to build that country ah one of the major betrayal is precisely the workers bar to bar too that was led\nBy a man born in poverty or that or a bill this very successful party on initially ethics in politics\nThere is this sense after Brazil a\n... a a basic ... riding a wonderful wave in international economics big producer of commodities had the wonderful moment Barbara too was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable well a\nThan reality hit a ruler made a ...\nMagic would disappear or what we have today is a consequence and this is what I think what they should be positive and all of this we cannot blame others for our problems this crisis was produced in Brazil by Brazilians ah and another thing that just ... they should be positive\nIs the fact that the state and Brazil was basically broke\nAnd we have run off the money ah all that dream now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be confronted from\nA ... reality ... basis where the government has run all the money we have to adjust the economy the measures necessary to do that are very\nOff an unpopular and none of the candidates have explain exactly what how they plan to go from the\nGyms now Bryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Bryan that you recently wrote where you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in\nTwo sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion was too many BS privileges for the elite not enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that terse conclusion well if\nYou look around right now at the field of candidates there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be on inspiring um the vast majority of people here as we've said during the program I feel like they're voting against\nSomebody rather than voting for somebody and the consequence\nOf that is is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when things were going really well which you've mentioned touch the degree of cynicism the degree of disbelief that people have in their system of government is just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we\nDemocratic recession as some people have called it really is especially strong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its\nPoliticians because of this corruption scandal\nThan virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the\nPew Research center and twenty Seventeen that found that just eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government that was the lowest of thirty eight countries that that that you surveyed\n... and that just shows you the climate here right now and the reason why many people fear that both denaro if elected would basically have carte blanche to take a you know hard right turn that could involve the curtail month of civil civil liberties and and\nAnd other things I I and my time I'm this week\nUm I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that who are talking openly about the possibility of exile I guess just blew me away I mean it's a Brazil that I've read about in history books you know going back to previous\nPeriods of military rule Nineteen sixty four\nWas the last two I I thought that that was a real Brazil that had been firmly relegated to the history books and\nYou know maybe maybe maybe they are maybe it is getting a little\nBit melodramatic in some quarters but but they're real fears and and and people are scared right now\nWell Brian you mentioned a statistic that was disturbing only eight percent of Brazilian say representative democracy\nIs the best form of government now I'm an right to the point ... emails us why are we so concerned about the right versus the left in Brazil ... is another ... he's an air to want a ... a Kim ... all these dictator dictator wannabes who were being resurrected in ...\nOf democracy and Paolo in the United states it's been said more than once that a ... is a Brazilian version a Brazilian analog of president Donald Trump they're both right wing or both populists are these are these ... comparisons apps do you think\nI don't think so I think a President Trump

Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended cabin on he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody thought I'm a single white male people want me to shut up and I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve\nHears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner in twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nYou're forty six years you've been the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party here the speaker of the house the Republican controlled house you're smart\nYou know the budget that we're in for you have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are\nDead men walking as far as [noise]\nNow back in twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quit to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough\nTo survive as a Republican Party or the future meaning Republicans had to broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics flash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week\nAnd Lindsey Graham hulk if occasion in the Trump beer at say to you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean I it it tells me that the divide is deepening any idea tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to you that you saw in the two thousand election and I say that we've lived with a sense\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there in twenty twelve after twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally look to the Mitt Romney's last ... Obama and concluded what you know what Lindsey Graham did it demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just the one the general election and that's a huge part of it but the fact that he was able\nTo sweep through the Republican Party is like the primary is like he didn't twenty sixteen told Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixty one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world\nHow Trump resonated with their voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe that we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand ... granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator for one more term or ...\nJump out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his enduring popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons to Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk\nIf you are seen as separating yourself from this president your neck primary especially if you're a Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being\nA being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there's also the theory that hey part of this is Lindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you're if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises or if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're a golf with him maybe\nIf you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons to is it is again Lindsey Graham looking at Trump in twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think tells Lindsey Graham and just brought more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically\nIs the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacturing and fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's changed his mind about that or not\nJames sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me\nThat I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation\nOn the merits and in Steve you're not him because that does not sound surprising to you yeah well what he's describing his ticket splitting yet in political science they those voters who go\nIs that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and that that is just the rise of polarization\nOf tribalism let's get back in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve corner you so much of what your book is about uh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are on led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have a when he was a young rabble rousing congressman\nWho was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to then time speaker from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill\nMy partner's maker as you as you pointed out to us again yesterday are in charge of this house if you are saying to me the urine postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and the system you run\nThen I think you may want to appoint a commission to look into the post office\nNow maybe a veiled insult there that might take a little bit of parsing but give it a back story and why Newt Gingrich was slinging an insult at a well respected and legendary Tip O'Neill yeah there there in in hindsight now you look back Thirty years and you play you may say well\nWhat was the big deal the idea was Democrats had run the Congress at that point for Thirty years\nThey were seen as the permanent majority I mean Republicans weren't just the minority party they were buried deep they weren't even close you didn't go into an election saying maybe the Republicans will get it maybe they won't it was like maybe they'll get to a hundred Seventy feet but there's you know that that was how deep in the minority they were in here was Gingrich um who was in his third term from Georgia\nBeating the speaker of the house she was at that point a Seventy two year old old school Boston politician Tip O'Neill\nSupport for NPR comes from station and from Rhodes Scholar I'm not

ultimate software people\nOdds were like with you today we'd been keeping an eye on defense on Capitol Hill to they have a quick update for you\nThe top Republican on the Senate Judiciary committee says the FBI has turned up nothing to corroborate allegations that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was involved in sexual assault in high school and another instance of sexual misconduct in college there is nothing in it that we didn't already know said Senator Chuck Grassley adding\nThere's also no contemporaneous evidence this investigation found no hint of misconduct\nAnd the same is true of the six prior FBI background investigations conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service that was Chuck Grassley chairman of the Judiciary Committee I was quoting their ranking member on the Senate Judiciary committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California disagrees she says it looks to be the product of an incomplete investigation\nThat was limited perhaps by the White House Dianne Feinstein ranking member expect much more on this throughout the day on your NPR station\nI Want to turn back to Steve ... in just a moment but before we do a quick appeal for some help with the program in the works for next week here on one day we spend a lot of time yesterday talking with women about how society views angry women and there's a broad range of opinion but most of the women were hearing from our progressive and liberals\nIf you're a conservative woman tell us how your seeing this moment what have you got to say how\nDo you want to be heard in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh and in the fight over me to the discussions over me to in this country do you think your views are being represented or respected leave us a voicemail eight five five to three six one a one a if you're a female Republican or at least someone who would describe themselves as\nBroadly conservative what do you want the country to hear about you tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a that's eight five five to three six one two one two will make sure to get your stories on the air part of the national conversation in the days ahead\nSo how do they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington that's polarized we've been asking listeners for memorable moments from politics in the nineties and and here's one\nAnd the president is right\nIn many ways we are a shining city on it\nBut the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and gory\nThere is this fair Mr President\nAnd the faces that you don't see the places that you don't visit\nThen you're a shining city\nI Believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from ... the early nineties I take you back to our send you a whole\n[noise]\n\nSoon to be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety to ... or send you a hall show remember him were were full of our city hall [laughter] before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on night time talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because the president appeared on Arsenio Hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and in a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nIt was also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running not in first or second but in third place in the present\nFive percent was Bill Clinton in so they were his team he remembered that Bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be unelectable he'd gone through the scandal about Gennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment it's sort of hard in this image of\nSlick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer really try to scheme is way out of\nOut of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so he was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hot at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd and it was Ninety two it wasn't just starts anew Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot who was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began\nIn February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King Laurie can and and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was on in February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent\nIn just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show 'em in in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said\nAnd just tore into Bush that went went after it was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign that Bush wasn't do in our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message\nUm politicians now managed media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama\nHad a winning personality an affable nice guy and used it to great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon to Stephen cold there there isn't a show that Iraq Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than than maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public\nHas changed just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or send your home and I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier\nIn the rise of Gingrich net moment with Oh Neal what that moment came from was Gingrich looking for a way around at the time where the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he CSPAN\nGive CSPAN was five years old in the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late night speeches and CSPAN to seek out find and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that and how Gingrich or legal to build his career his rise in the house around that fast forward to Donald Trump Donald Trump do\nIt television obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter Donald Trump identified through Twitter\nDirectly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties with C SPAN in Trump was doing with Twitter and and I think there's a real common thread there\nWell let's go back then in the way way back machine one more time\nTo Nineteen Ninety nine Donald Trump who was people forget was involved with politics even at the time he flirted mentally and even in reality with presidential runs long before he was ever successful he went on meet the press\nBack in Nineteen Ninety nine and had some thoughts about somebody that we've already talked about Pat Buchanan the insurgent right wing politician in the Republican Party\nFor his ahead little oven I guess he's an anti Semite\nHe doesn't like the black sea doesn't like the gays I I I it's just incredible that anybody can embrace this guy and maybe I'll get four or five percent of the vote and it'll be a really staunch ride wacko ... I'm not even sure if it's right it's just a lack of of and I just can't imagine that anybody can take them seriously\nDonald Trump sounded than about ... you can and how John McCain sounded about Donald Trump\nJust a couple of years ago calling his voters wacko birds you know that you can and was a candidate who supported a moratorium on new regulations supported building a border wall even said", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "04"}
