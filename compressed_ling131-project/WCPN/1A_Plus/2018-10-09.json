I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that some of my\nAnd therefore I began and operation dubbed operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers who\nI used the term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately that\nLed these officers wanted them being a bus to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular among the rank and file within to Chicago police department\nBecause before I came forward with operation brass tacks the code of silence\nWas unheard of you didn't talk about it it didn't exist\nOr they tried to label me as crazy for believing that this was actually going on within the ... the department so it made me very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nOr wondering why voters from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer how law enforcement or my family but I've never taken an oath so I Can't I'm speaking as an outsider\nBut I Would think you know if I knew that there were reporters who worked for my station who were lying in stories and they got caught I Would be grateful to see them go because of drugs all of us now why do you think it's not a similar mentality and law enforcement\nYou know honestly a lot of police officers dead approach man they still talk to me and you are correct on as police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt officers however the code of silence\nIs so strong within the Chicago police department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide\nAnd and what was interesting to discover during this journey of\nBreaking the code of silence is that there is this common misconception that it's a blue officers blue shirt common St officers going against other officers when actually I learned that the retaliation came from the top down\nBosses were actually\nInstructing the officers who were working with me not to back me up\nOr they would be the next Shannon Spalding so out of\nFear of becoming me out of fear of retaliation themselves or putting their lives in danger losing their job what could happen to them they complied because they it it's easier and easier than going through everything that I had to go through and even though officers didn't\nWant to they thought they had

P. in the app store and we'll share some of your questions and stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with new Franklin Shannon Spalding Patrick Smith and judge will doors Cordell let's get some more of your comments before we start kind of looking for to where the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nHey sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is a very easy standard to apply it's not that hard\nWe do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology too many cops have no business carrying a badge and the gun however Galvin had these questions Galvin writes the question is what is reasonable\nDoes disobeying a police officer shouting orders constitute the right to use deadly force\nThere is a drug dealer running away from the police deserved to be shot\nWhile they may be criminals or the actions from the police equivalent to the criminals actions to Cornell maybe you should respond to ... how do we suss out in a finer sense what reasonable ... years\nSaid well this is in the eye of the beholder it really has no one definition and what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes of the officer\nAt what was the officers ... thing and oftentimes incidents happen and you know just a matter of a few seconds so it's there really is not one definition of it that but I Do want us to get to something you said Joshua about\nLooking ahead I Believe it's time to we imagine policing in America policing in America today is is quasi militaristic\nAnd police departments off there just seen as an occupying force especially in communities of color\nThe who knew everyone and they were people who were not seen as an occupying force there were people there to basically provide a service and help the individuals in the community\nAnd it has dramatically changed we have police departments armed to the teeth with tanks and all kinds of of the equipment that uh are commonly used in the military\nAnd I think it's time to to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box why do we need police officers to basically\nA patrol and and take care of traffic issues why can't that come from within the humidity why can't individuals' community members somehow ... ties to deal with with those kinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nMuslim church brutal and I'm not disagree with your just by way of doing some places where the lower level of sworn law enforcement officer does deal with things like parking enforcement and traffic enforcement things that are less likely to required to be for\nSure but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic\nForce and and they they do have a command structure and ... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole image we have of police being occupiers\nAnd look at a different model entirely I'm not opposed to criminal to criminal justice reform but look what happened\nWe we'd get body cameras and what what happens well we have officers some\nOh don't turn their cameras on or we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year\nAnd a court order ticket footage out on that for example in liquid shooting so that that the whole lack of trust\nGet to know who these offices are their track record their history they're disciplined history very very difficult to get that information and state\nI think that dovetails with the comment that one of our listeners left for us Reggie who lives in Maryland left list in our inbox\nI talk to police both black and white and uh they seem to have this militaristic approach to the community I have\nHad experiences where you know we just simply\nYou know would rather have conflict with ah with me rather than actually serve it I really think that they should you know take away the guns for the first couple of months but leads to buy cheap\nIt's added a community without guns make them stand up comedians are forced to have a dialogue with community I think it'd be a lot better uh was serving their communities\nWhere did you thanks for calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin I Love you to respond to that but if I could first\nIf we could contrast what Reggie said with another set of comments that we've gotten from some of our listeners like what ... wrote scholar writes\nPolice put their lives on the line everyday protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality involve people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law I'll convict him but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time\nNeal what would you say to folks who said that police work is inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we as a public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just being able to get home at night\nSo I Believe it was Reggie that left a message yes um you know that was such a brilliant comment because forcing the dialogue seat when you develop and released\nAnd as dangerous as it is today it you know going back to what the judge Cordell said um\nHow it used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors when something happens they support you when you had those relationships but when you have this occupying force\nWere you know none of the people who are very few of the people the ones that you do know there's conflict on the under ... on the other end of that relationship\nThat's a problem this goes to community control policing that I mentioned before\nWhere the community sets the philosophy where the community sets the budget for those in uniform where the community\nDecides who the the leader is going to be whether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever with the community decides what's important were the community decides you know what we can handle these issues at ground level\nWe just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that\nBut policing is very political it's political through the unions it's political through the mayors and governors and we'll never get to that place into the community decides they come together and say we want control over our police departments and this is how we want to do it\nHaving that oversight at the beginning means that you don't need police review boards at the end when something goes horribly wrong\nIs speaking of which we got some ideas from some of you about what could be done with regards to policing and review boards were part of it including on a larger scale\nJamie asked shouldn't there be a national group or board who could provide oversight over individual police departments they could be an objective trusted advisory boards who's judgments both sides would trust and accept and to whom aggrieved local citizens group\nWas with this dance to police force is not your friend even if your a regular law abiding citizen so maybe

of a transition\nWe should get to an email from Hillary who says I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed the work environment have you noticed a difference\nA absolute absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point work is not immune from the larger culture and I think we have seen just like we've seen\nIncreased polarization in our families in our neighborhoods among our friends is at work too and it feels dice here at work um I think that\nPeople have to be careful um especially when they're power differential Z and it it's\nPolitics or culture or any of your other dividing line\nYeah 'cause everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural debate where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nTo see I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to time to open up if that ... toward keeping the professional and personal separate that at work I just need to be the one person I Need to keep my head down and get to not make waves on you to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there\nAnd the minute that we started talking about emphasizing and being vulnerable and being an urban and compassionate and ... that opens the door for me to say something about how I voted or you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love\nThat is going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like\nIt's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of less\nI think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I'd never seen anything meaningful are significant come from mouth shut had down\nIn my career\nThat's just not how we make contributions\nAnd so what we have to do is learn how to listen talk here each other and\nRumble and we use the term rumble because it really feels like a rumble rumble with the vulnerability of seeing other people as people and being seen as a person and it's a muscle it's a foundational skills that\nI don't think spending what ... what do we spend about ... about a half of our adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives in armor\nIs something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high\nAll of your experiences all of who you are\nTo address the problems for reading\nYour book and based on the research that fueled the book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a star you know stars tough because the wind is tender right and so if there wasn't something tigers there'd be nothing to protect\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really it was actually voided my hypothesis going in so where did you drop\nOff yeah yeah it just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at Jesse what I'm going to find but not in this case\nSo we asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders there it's a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred fifty sea level global leaders three years building a daring leader assessments that people can see where they are and these were MBA and NBA students at\nWharton catalog Rice University and then tons of data evaluation data so I thought when when when\nIt was clear that the future of leadership is about courage we need braver leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier was going to be fear but then we went and talked to several dairy leaders and said so you're not afraid very often\nAnd they were like what I'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long\nAnd I was like so that blew my hypothesis of fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership the greatest barrier to daring leadership\nIs armor it's not the fear it's how we self protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism the pleasing the defensiveness the anger that having to be the ... and get everything right instead of being the learner um so really\nYou know and it's interesting what you said about scars and tender places not only does armor keep other people\nPlus it faster and grow and metastasize\nSo we need to create were cultures where armor is not rewarded or needed\nWe asked some of you to call in and tell us about your workplaces here's what two of our listeners left in our inbox first let's hear from Adam\nMy name is Adam and I'm calling from Nashville, Tennessee\nI'm a paramedic and fire fighter and as such I definitely feel like I Need to do my job perfectly at all times because there are definitely times one lives in livelihoods are on the line I dumped on the other hand I worked for a department that's very good about just war and its employees\nAnd my co workers and I definitely do a good job of trying to share and better get stressed the job\nAdam thanks very much for calling and sharing your story with us no contrast Adam's story which is a bells story she works in a similarly strict workplace with a rather different take\nOn that Dr at a big hospital and it's just really hard to suggest that anyone to feel safe there you have to watch everything you stay in jail and there's so many corporate compliance policy I Would say like it's not a safe place to be human at all\nIs it but we appreciate you sharing your story as well Bernie it sounds like they're one might think that being in one of these high pressure leadership environments would lead to more common experiences but both of these folks are in places we're allies are on the line with wildly different experiences with the variable that makes a difference there\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from his Cox insurance providing customized insurance for small and medium businesses so they can do more and be more learn more at H.

P. in the store\nAnd we'll share some of your stories on Monday when our series the state we're in continues on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Bernie brown author of the new book dear to lead with regards to arm or Monday sold emailed can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah I mean boundaries are actually a big part of this box is batteries are incredibly important [noise] um we defined it very simply as what's OK and what's not OK and so armor is not about\nProfessional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense and it is I Am going to put the protection of my ego\nBefore doing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I'm and protect feeling good about myself\nOver movie and I work for it\nThe difference between so there's a difference between say ...\nOr it's on a deeper level now it's on a deeper into one of the greatest examples of armor armored leadership versus daring leadership has one form of armor we see a lot and folks\nIs that need to be right that it's that I've got to be the ... and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being the learner and getting that right\nWe got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into workplaces and hope emailed\nCan you speak about the ways in which racial power structures and broader society that manifest themselves in the workplace disproportionately impact the contributions of people of color in their work and the extent to which they progress in their careers before you answer here's one example professor ... tweeted\nAs a woman of color an immigrant in an academic I've learned that showing vulnerabilities and even my own resilience can and will be used against me by those in power would love to hear professor brown talk about overcoming that distrust well here's what are the\nBiggest findings I think is that one of the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the lost his owner ability and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic and said that I mean racism homophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege\nDoes or does your everyday traumas and it is real that that that you know the armor that you need to survive those things Israel which is why if leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThan we can't I mean gender is another you know I I think the kind of\nAnita Hill criticisms that happen after the forward testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of wondering away now\nThat is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about core\nValues and I don't think any of us has worked at a company\nThat doesn't have some kind of mission statement or vision ... clarification or posters everywhere or supposed to be and then it's really worth nothing more than the paper on which was printed I work at some companies\nOr I'm going to some companies where their value statement was like Fifteen bullet points la I'm like well why don't we start you suggest\nThat we should limit our core values to to just to and there's a long list in the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot on the list and I really struggled to Merrill down to my to why only two\nWell here's a big operation allies values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat tester\nI mean it really [laughter] it's just really a poster [noise] so like I'm a recording of my head that little will tell you [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] God [laughter] no and so\nWhat was so you know operation allies values into behaviors fewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with had actually done that had taken the time to say you know what a some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in\nAnd so the two is\nReally kind of backing into the data that men and women\nWho had the capacity to be the most courageous could identify their values\nThey had two to three values and you know I have you know\nSelf discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list that are super important to me but when it comes down to it my ... my two core values for me are facing courage and I know that are the core values because it's the place where every other things on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we had an we have a companion work buckets free downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operation allies and into behaviors\nUm it has changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them\nAnd then we have our company values and that's actually how we assess you every quarter\nLives on the values that you were to do it\nLike for example one of our values as take good care taking care of each other ourselves into community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talked to people\nI mean you either do it or you dumped\nAnd so I think it goes back to something we haven't talked about yeah that is a real core finding which is courage is one hundred percent teachable\nIt's for skill sets each of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught\nIt learning how to rumble with on her ability living into your values which we're talking about right now it's braving trust understanding how to talk about trust and breaking it down so we can talk about the anatomy of trust and learning how to rise how to get back up on your feet after a fall or a setback\nYou need to clear as you saw use I mean I I Would be fast foods and know what you live near an outfit my core values are because I Know what they are I went to the list\nLike I guess one sure catcher I sure OK face\nNo\nThere is that what am I to core what's but its encompassed in one of my two homes but no ... I don't know maybe I should maybe I shouldn't and we're talking about ... Josh I Know but I'm the host I don't have to do anything I'm just I'm In charge here here we got to people they were known are OK okay fine I'll tell you what they got\nFreedom and growth those are my two values\nAnd give me an example out of behavior that supports freedom\nUm\nWell for me being out more one thing ... freedom I'm being a better\nListener on this program because if I value the freedom to tell my own story I have to vent extend that to you and I can't monopolize discussion on my best days I Will do for less talking and far more or less thing", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Cleveland", "day": "09"}
